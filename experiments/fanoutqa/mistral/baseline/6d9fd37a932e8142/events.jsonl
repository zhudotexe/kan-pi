Many participating countries invested all available economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities into this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. It was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in 70–85 million fatalities. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1939–1945 global conflict\n\n\"The Second World War\", \"World War Two\", and \"WWII\" redirect here.

The United Nations was established to foster international cooperation and prevent conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US—becoming the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the US emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonization of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.\n\n\n\n\n## Start and end dates\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of timelines of World War II\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** Weinberg 2005, p. 6.\n2. **^** Wells, Anne Sharp (2014) *Historical Dictionary of World War II: The War against Germany and Italy*.

With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany, and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941.[129] By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy late March 1941, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact; however, the Yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by pro-British nationalists. Germany and Italy responded with simultaneous invasions of both Yugoslavia and Greece, commencing on 6 April 1941; both nations were forced to surrender within the month.[124] The airborne invasion of the Greek island of Crete at the end of May completed the German conquest of the Balkans.[125] Partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, which continued until the end of the war.[126]\n\n\nIn the Middle East in May, Commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled Syria.[127] Between June and July, British-led forces invaded and occupied the French possessions of Syria and Lebanon, assisted by the Free French.[128]\n\n\n\n#### Axis attack on the Soviet Union (1941)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Eastern Front (World War II)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe causes of the war are debated; contributing factors included the rise of fascism in Europe, the Spanish Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, and tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their \"spheres of influence\" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a military alliance, called the Axis, with Italy, Japan, and other countries. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n156. **^** Beevor 1998, pp. 41–42; Evans 2008, pp. 213–214, notes that \"Zhukov had pushed the Germans back where they had launched Operation Typhoon two months before. ...

By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign.[252] In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran.[253] The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory[254] and the military planning for the Burma campaign,[255] while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.[256]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n187. **^** Dunn 1998, p. 157.

Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin\nOn 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt to split the Allies on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes and along the French-German border, hoping to encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and prompt a political settlement after capturing their primary supply port at Antwerp.[289] By 16 January 1945, this offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.[289] In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Red Army attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia.[290] On 4 February Soviet, British, and U.S. leaders met for the Yalta Conference. They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan.[291]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied the entire territories of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,[80] as well as the Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region. In August 1940, Hitler imposed the Second Vienna Award on Romania which led to the transfer of Northern Transylvania to Hungary.[86] In September 1940, Bulgaria demanded Southern Dobruja from Romania with German and Italian support, leading to the Treaty of Craiova.[87] The loss of one-third of Romania's 1939 territory caused a coup against King Carol II, turning Romania into a fascist dictatorship under Marshal Ion Antonescu, with a course set towards the Axis in the hopes of a German guarantee.[88] Meanwhile, German-Soviet political relations and economic co-operation[89][90] gradually stalled,[91][92] and both states began preparations for war.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Western Europe (1940–1941)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Western Front (World War II)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** Timothy Neeno. \"Nomonhan: The Second Russo-Japanese War\".

The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. The Soviets demanded a second front. The British argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolstering resistance forces; Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour, without using large-scale armies.[193] Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.[194]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWorld War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939[1][2] with the German invasion of Poland and the United Kingdom and France's declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939.

J. P. Taylor, who stated that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in 1941.[7] Other theorized starting dates for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935.[8] The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939.[9] Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or prelude to World War II.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research, the development of artificial harbours, and oil pipelines under the English Channel.[452] Penicillin was first developed, mass-produced, and used during the war.[453]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n\n* Opposition to World War II\n* World War III\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Levine, Alan J.

By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr, encircling the German Army Group B.[292] In early March, in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and to retake Budapest, Germany launched its last major offensive against Soviet troops near Lake Balaton. In two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the Soviets advanced to Vienna, and captured the city. In early April, Soviet troops captured Königsberg, while the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April, leaving several unoccupied pockets in southern Germany and around Berlin.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy mid-November, the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street fighting. The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad,[217] and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously.[218] By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated,[219] and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk.[220]\n\n\n\n##### Western Europe/Atlantic and Mediterranean (1942–1943)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ross, Steven T.

To circumvent the strong Maginot Line fortifications on the Franco-German border, Germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.[97] The Germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the Ardennes region,[98] which was mistakenly perceived by the Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.[99][100] By successfully implementing new *Blitzkrieg* tactics, the *Wehrmacht* rapidly advanced to the Channel and cut off the Allied forces in Belgium, trapping the bulk of the Allied armies in a cauldron on the Franco-Belgian border near Lille. The United Kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of Allied troops from the continent by early June, although they had to abandon almost all their equipment.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n194. **^** \"The Elimination of the Alternatives.

In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States and the United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the US in solidarity. Japan soon conquered much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan, Italy, and Germany as the Axis powers. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country--with the exception of the Soviet Union--that attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.[115] The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania joined.[116] Romania and Hungary later made major contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union, in Romania's case partially to recapture territory ceded to the Soviet Union.[117]\n\n\n\n#### Mediterranean (1940–1941)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Evans, David C.; Peattie, Mark R.

By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops.[211] In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first was a disastrous offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942 that forced a retreat back to India by May 1943.[212] The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese frontlines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.[213]\n\n\n\n##### Eastern Front (1942–1943)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Koch, H.W.

In mid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo, and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Axis collapse and Allied victory (1944–1945)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThough the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies and the war evolved into one of attrition.[422] While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed[*by whom?*] to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force,[423] Allied strategic bombing,[424] and Germany's late shift to a war economy[425] contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so.[426] To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers;[427] Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe,[402] while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.[409][410]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFile:View from St Paul's Cathedral after the Blitz.jpgLondon seen from St. Paul's Cathedral after the German *Blitz*, 29 December 1940\nThe air Battle of Britain[105] began in early July with Luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours.[106] The United Kingdom rejected Hitler's peace offer,[107] and the German air superiority campaign started in August but failed to defeat RAF Fighter Command, forcing the indefinite postponement of the proposed German invasion of Britain. The German strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on London and other cities in the Blitz, but largely ended in May 1941[108] after failing to significantly disrupt the British war effort.[106]\n\n\nUsing newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success against an over-extended Royal Navy, using U-boats against British shipping in the Atlantic.[109] The British Home Fleet scored a significant victory on 27 May 1941 by sinking the German battleship *Bismarck*.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Advances in technology and its application\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)A V-2 rocket launched from a fixed site in Peenemünde, 21 June 1943\nMain article: Technology during World War II\n\nAircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role developed considerably. Innovations included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);[428] and strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).[429] Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.[430]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 1943, the British and Americans began a strategic bombing campaign against Germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and \"de-house\" the civilian population.[235] The firebombing of Hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre.[236]\n\n\n\n#### Allies gain momentum (1943–1944)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPost-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.[337] The long period of political tensions and military competition between them--the Cold War--would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and number of proxy wars throughout the world.[338]\n\n\nIn Asia, the United States led the occupation of Japan and administered Japan's former islands in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands.[339] Korea, formerly under Japanese colonial rule, was divided and occupied by the Soviet Union in the North and the United States in the South between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea, which led ultimately to the Korean War.[340]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSoviet troops stormed and captured Berlin in late April.[293] In Italy, German forces surrendered on 29 April. On 30 April, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany,[294] and the Berlin garrison surrendered on 2 May.\n\n\nMajor changes in leadership occurred on both sides during this period. On 12 April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by his vice president, Harry S. Truman. Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April.[295] On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide in his headquarters, and he was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Joseph Goebbels. Total and unconditional surrender in Europe was signed on 7 and 8 May, to be effective by the end of 8 May.[296] German Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May.[297]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the East, the intended gains of *Lebensraum* were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders.[413] Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the \"inferior people\" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by mass atrocities and war crimes.[414] The Nazis killed an estimated 2.77 million ethnic Poles during the war in addition to Polish-Jewish victims of the Holocaust.[415][*better source needed*] Although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East[416] or the West[417] until late 1943.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ben-Horin, Eliahu (1943). *The Middle East: Crossroads of History*.

On 5 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' well-constructed defences,[240] and for the first time in the war, Hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success.[241] This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month.[242]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases.[112] Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941.[113] In December 1940, Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the United States to become an \"arsenal of democracy\" and promoting Lend-Lease programmes of military and humanitarian aid to support the British war effort; Lend-Lease was later extended to the other Allies, including the Soviet Union after it was invaded by Germany.[107] The United States started strategic planning to prepare for a full-scale offensive against Germany.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)German advance into Belgium and Northern France, 10 May – 4 June 1940, swept past the Maginot Line (shown in dark red)\nIn April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to protect shipments of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies were attempting to cut off.[94] Denmark capitulated after six hours, and despite Allied support, Norway was conquered within two months.[95] British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the resignation of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who was replaced by Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)American troops approaching Omaha Beach during the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944\nOn 6 June 1944 (commonly known as D-Day), after three years of Soviet pressure,[270] the Western Allies invaded northern France. After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also attacked southern France.[271] These landings were successful and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France. Paris was liberated on 25 August by the local resistance assisted by the Free French Forces, both led by General Charles de Gaulle,[272] and the Western Allies continued to push back German forces in western Europe during the latter part of the year. An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands failed.[273] After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but failed to cross the Rur river. In Italy, the Allied advance slowed due to the last major German defensive line.[274]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe exact date of the war's end is not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, which officially ended the war in Asia. A peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951.[12] A 1990 treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place and resolved most post–World War II issues.[13] No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed,[14] although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which also restored full diplomatic relations between them.[15]\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### Background\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Causes of World War II\n\n#### Aftermath of World War I\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n183. **^** Dower 1986, p. 5, calls attention to the fact that \"the Allied struggle against Japan exposed the racist underpinnings of the European and American colonial structure.

The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,[243] giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.[244][245] The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther–Wotan line, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and the Lower Dnieper Offensive.[246]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLand warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of World War I, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.[440] In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I,[441] and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.[442][443] At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.[444] This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n362. **^** O'Brien, Joseph V. \"World War II: Combatants and Casualties (1937–1945)\". *Obee's History Page*.

Following Hindenburg's death in 1934, Hitler proclaimed himself *Führer* of Germany and abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign.[20] France, seeking to secure its alliance with Italy, allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany, and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.[21]\n\n\n\n#### European treaties\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland after having staged several false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the invasion.[65] The first German attack of the war came against the Polish defenses at Westerplatte.[66] The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum for Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany,[67] followed by Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada. During the Phoney War period, the alliance provided no direct military support to Poland, outside of a cautious French probe into the Saarland.[68] The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.[69] Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the Stresa Front in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards military globalisation; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the Franco-Soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.[22] The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany annexed western Poland and occupied central Poland; the Soviet Union annexed eastern Poland; small shares of Polish territory were transferred to Lithuania and Slovakia. On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union.

Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate *Lebensraum* (\"living space\")[137] by dispossessing the native population,[138] and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.[139]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese attacks led the United States, United Kingdom, China, Australia, and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.[187] Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States[188] in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.[135][189] The Japanese invasion of Thailand led to Thailand's decision to ally itself with Japan.\n\n\n\n#### Axis advance stalls (1942–1943)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 1 January 1942, the Allied Big Four[190]—the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United Nations, thereby affirming the Atlantic Charter[191] and agreeing not to sign a separate peace with the Axis powers.[192]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 3 September 1943, the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland, following Italy's armistice with the Allies and the ensuing German occupation of Italy.[247] Germany, with the help of fascists, responded to the armistice by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas,[248] and creating a series of defensive lines.[249] German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic,[250] causing an Italian civil war. The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in mid-November.[251]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe situation became a crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border. On 23 August the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Germany,[59] after tripartite negotiations for a military alliance between France, the United Kingdom, and Soviet Union had stalled.[60] This pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet \"spheres of influence\" (western Poland and Lithuania for Germany; eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Bessarabia for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of continuing Polish independence.[61] The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I. Immediately afterwards, Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August--but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Blinkhorn, Martin (2006) [1984]. *Mussolini and Fascist Italy* (3rd ed.).

A month later, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy joined the following year.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Asia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Kuomintang (KMT) party in China launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party allies[26] and new regional warlords. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China[27] as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, staged the Mukden Incident as a pretext to invade Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAdvances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship (in place of the battleship).[431][432][433] In the Atlantic, escort carriers became a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap.[434] Carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft[435] and because they are not required to be as heavily armoured.[436] Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War,[437] were expected by all combatants to be important in the second. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ———; Andrew, Stephen (2002). *The Japanese Army, 1931–45*.

In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against Allied positions in Assam, India,[265] and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima.[266] In May 1944, British and Indian forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma by July,[266] and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.[267] The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.[268] By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha.[269]\n\n\n\n#### Allies close in (1944)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before the war,[140] *Operation* *Barbarossa* forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt strategic defence. During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By mid-August, however, the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad.[141] The Kyiv offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further advance into Crimea and industrially-developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov).[142]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom.[102] The Germans turned south against the weakened French army, and Paris fell to them on 14 June. Eight days later France signed an armistice with Germany; it was divided into German and Italian occupation zones,[103] and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany. France kept its fleet, which the United Kingdom attacked on 3 July in an attempt to prevent its seizure by Germany.[104]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Adamthwaite, Anthony P.

This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region.[262] By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops.[263] The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, Rome was captured on June 4.[264]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline (1995). *Stalin's Cold War: Soviet Strategies in Europe, 1943–56*.

The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a baby boom, and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy.[344] The Allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany from 1945 to 1948.[345] Due to international trade interdependencies, this policy led to an economic stagnation in Europe and delayed European recovery from the war for several years.[346][347]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Waltz, Susan (2002). \"Reclaiming and Rebuilding the History of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\". *Third World Quarterly*. **23** (3): 437–448. doi:10.1080/01436590220138378.

In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish \"war-mongers\" and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro-German client state, the Slovak Republic.[54] Hitler also delivered an ultimatum to Lithuania on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the Klaipėda Region, formerly the German *Memelland*.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. This policy would prove difficult to maintain in light of the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War[48] and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward and eventually led to war with the United States and the Western Allies.[49][50]\n\n\n\n#### European occupations and agreements\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Red Army soldiers on the counterattack during the Battle of Stalingrad, February 1943\nDespite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.[214] In May, the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov,[215] and then in June 1942 launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy the Kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.[216]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the eastern territories, Silesia, Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken over by Poland,[315] and East Prussia was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, followed by the expulsion to Germany of the nine million Germans from these provinces,[316][317] as well as three million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. By the 1950s, one-fifth of West Germans were refugees from the east. The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon line,[318] from which 2 million Poles were expelled;[317][319] north-east Romania,[320][321] parts of eastern Finland,[322] and the Baltic states were annexed into the Soviet Union.[323][324] Italy lost its monarchy, colonial empire and some European territories.[325]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of Warsaw. The Polish counter-offensive to the west halted the German advance for several days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the *Wehrmacht*. Remnants of the Polish army broke through to besieged Warsaw. On 17 September 1939, two days after signing a cease-fire with Japan, the Soviet Union invaded Poland[71] under the supposed pretext that the Polish state had ceased to exist.[72] On 27 September, the Warsaw garrison surrendered to the Germans, and the last large operational unit of the Polish Army surrendered on 6 October. Despite the military defeat, Poland never surrendered; instead, it formed the Polish government-in-exile and a clandestine state apparatus remained in occupied Poland.[73] A significant part of Polish military personnel evacuated to Romania and Latvia; many of them later fought against the Axis in other theatres of the war.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n447. **^** Sprague, Oliver; Griffiths, Hugh (2006). \"The AK-47: the worlds favourite killing machine\" (PDF). controlarms.org. p. 1.

These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all its overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Germany\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)German Panzer III of the Afrika Korps advancing across the North African desert, April–May 1941\nIn December 1940, British Empire forces began counter-offensives against Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa.[120] The offensives were successful; by early February 1941, Italy had lost control of eastern Libya, and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission after a carrier attack at Taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan.[121]\n\n\nItalian defeats prompted Germany to deploy an expeditionary force to North Africa; at the end of March 1941, Rommel's Afrika Korps launched an offensive which drove back Commonwealth forces.[122] In less than a month, Axis forces advanced to western Egypt and besieged the port of Tobruk.[123]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Second Italo-Ethiopian War was a brief colonial war that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936.

Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did little when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's Covenant.[32] The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.[33] Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing Austria.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Spanish Civil War (1936–1939)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n307. **^** Ward Wilson. \"The Winning Weapon?

In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha.[201] These easy victories over the unprepared U.S. and European opponents left Japan overconfident, and overextended.[202]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.[131] On 31 July 1940, Hitler decided that the Soviet Union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of Ukraine, the Baltic states and Byelorussia.[132] However, other senior German officials like Ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a Euro-Asian bloc against the British Empire by inviting the Soviet Union into the Tripartite Pact.[133] In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the pact. The Soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable.

In May 1943, Canadian and U.S. forces were sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians.[237] Soon after, the United States, with support from Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands.[238] By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands.

In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichsmarks (27.8 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.[411] Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on.[412]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the Battle of the Coral Sea.[203] Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid, was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.[204] In mid-May, Japan started the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.[205][206] In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans had broken Japanese naval codes in late May and were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy.[207]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their first major victory at Taierzhuang, but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by the Japanese in May.[44][*unreliable source?*] In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow River; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan, but the city was taken by October.[45] Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead, the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war.[46][47]\n\n\n\n#### Soviet–Japanese border conflicts\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Soviet–Japanese border conflicts\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Chamberlain, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini, and Ciano pictured just before signing the Munich Agreement, 29 September 1938\nIn Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive.

Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.[52] Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary, and Poland annexed the Trans-Olza region of Czechoslovakia.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince early 1941, the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations, Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.[169] At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them.[170] Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946) and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any \"neighboring countries\".[170]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Slim, William (1956). *Defeat into Victory*.

From September to November, the Japanese attacked Taiyuan, engaged the Kuomintang Army around Xinkou,[39][*unreliable source?*] and fought Communist forces in Pingxingguan.[40][41] Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai, but after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the Japanese.[42][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChina appealed to the League of Nations to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its incursion into Manchuria.

Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan.[29] After the 1936 Xi'an Incident, the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose Japan.[30]\n\n\n\n### Pre-war events\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Second Italo-Ethiopian War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nculminating in the failed Dieppe Raid,[227] demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.[228][*page needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n376. **^** Geiger, Vladimir (2012). \"Human Losses of the Croats in World War II and the Immediate Post-War Period Caused by the Chetniks (Yugoslav Army in the Fatherand) and the Partisans (People's Liberation Army and the Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia/Yugoslav Army) and the Communist Authorities: Numerical Indicators\". *Review of Croatian History*. **VIII** (1).

Nazi Germany extensively used forced labourers; about 12 million Europeans from German-occupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in German industry, agriculture and war economy.[402]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The League of Nations assembly, held in Geneva, Switzerland, 1930\nWorld War I had radically altered the political European map with the defeat of the Central Powers—including Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire—and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and Russian Empires.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTo prevent a future world war, the League of Nations was created during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military and naval disarmament, and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n285. **^** Jowett & Andrew 2002, p. 8.\n286. **^** Howard 2004, p. 140.\n287. **^** Drea 2003, p. 54.\n288. **^** Cook & Bewes 1997, p. 305.\n289. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Parker 2004, pp. xiii–xiv, 6–8, 68–70, 329–330\n290. **^** Glantz 2001, p. 85.\n291. **^** Beevor 2012, pp. 709–722.\n292. **^** Buchanan 2006, p. 21.\n293. **^** Kershaw 2001, pp. 793–829.\n294. **^** Shepardson 1998\n295. **^** O'Reilly 2001, p. 244.\n296. **^** Evans 2008, p. 737.\n297. **^** Glantz 1998, p. 24.\n298. **^** Chant, Christopher (1986). *The Encyclopedia of Codenames of World War II*.

As a result, East Germany,[333] Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania[334] became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the Soviet Union.[335] A Communist uprising in Greece was put down with Anglo-American support and the country remained aligned with the West.[336]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAxis forces employed biological and chemical weapons.

Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing, and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power, promising the creation of a \"New Roman Empire\".[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"German-American Relations – Treaty on the Final Settlement concerning Germany\". usa.usembassy.de. 12 September 1990.

In 1939, the United States notified Japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and American public opinion opposing Japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctions--the Export Control Acts-- which banned U.S. exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to Japan, and increased economic pressure on the Japanese regime.[107][157][158] During 1939 Japan launched its first attack against Changsha, but was repulsed by late September.[159] Despite several offensives by both sides, by 1940 the war between China and Japan was at a stalemate. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina in September 1940.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Soviet Union was responsible for the Katyn massacre of 22,000 Polish officers,[390] and the imprisonment or execution of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners by the NKVD secret police, along with mass civilian deportations to Siberia, in the Baltic states and eastern Poland annexed by the Red Army.[391] Soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories, especially in Germany.[392][393] The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain, but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many as two million,[394] while figures for women raped by German soldiers in the Soviet Union go as far as ten million.[395][396]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWestern world and culture\n |\n| --- |\n| Foundations | * Cradle of civilization\n* Old World\n* Greco-Roman world\n\t+ Greece\n\t+ Hellenistic Kingdoms\n\t+ Rome\n\t+ Roman Empire\n\t\t- Western\n\t\t- Eastern\n* Roman legacy\n* Romanization\n* Romano-Germanic culture\n\t+ Gallo-Roman\n* Christendom\n |\n| History | * European Bronze Age\n* Classical antiquity\n\t+ Late antiquity\n* Middle Ages\n\t+ early\n\t+ high\n\t+ late\n* Renaissance\n* Modern period\n\t+ Early modern period\n\t+ Age of Discovery\n\t+ Reformation\n\t+ Age of Enlightenment\n\t+ Scientific Revolution\n\t+ Age of Revolution\n\t+ Romanticism\n\t+ Abolitionism\n\t+ Emancipation\n\t+ Capitalism\n\t+ Industrial Revolution\n\t+ Great Divergence\n\t+ Modernism\n\t+ World War I\n\t+ Interwar period\n\t+ Universal suffrage\n\t+ World War II\n\t+ Cold War\n* Post–Cold War era\n\t+ Information age\n\t+ War on terror\n |\n| Culture | * Alphabet\n\t+ Greek\n\t+ Latin\n\t+ Cyrillic\n* Architecture\n* Art\n\t+ Periods\n* Calendar\n* Cuisine\n\t+ Diet\n* Classical tradition\n\t+ Studies\n* Clothing\n\t+ History\n* Dance\n* Education\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940.

The Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939,[82] and was subsequently expelled from the League of Nations for this crime of aggression.[83] Despite overwhelming numerical superiority, Soviet military success during the Winter War was modest,[84] and the Finno-Soviet war ended in March 1940 with some Finnish concessions of territory.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.[279] By this point, the communist-led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern Serbia, the Soviet Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an effort to maintain world peace,[326] the Allies formed the United Nations,[327] which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945,[328] and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations.[329] The great powers that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States—became the permanent members of the UN's Security Council.[330] The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its successor state, the Russian Federation, following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.[331]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe UDHR is viewable here [1] Archived 3 July 2017 at the Wayback Machine\n330. **^** *The UN Security Council*, archived from the original on 20 June 2012, retrieved 15 May 2012\n331. **^** Kantowicz 2000, p. 6.\n332. **^** Trachtenberg 1999, p. 33.\n333. **^** Applebaum 2012.\n334. **^** Naimark 2010.\n335. **^** Swain 1992.\n336. **^** \"Greek Civil War\". *Encyclopedia Britannica*. 28 May 2023.\n337. **^** Borstelmann 2005, p. 318.\n338. **^** Leffler & Westad 2010.\n339. **^** Weinberg 2005, p. 911.\n340. **^** Stueck 2010, p. 71.\n341. **^** Lynch 2010, pp. 12–13.\n342. **^** Roberts 1997, p. 589.\n343. **^** Darwin 2007, pp. 441–443, 464–68.\n344. **^** Dear & Foot 2001, p. 1006; Harrison 1998, pp. 34–55.\n345. **^** Balabkins 1964, p. 207.\n346. **^** Petrov 1967, p. 263.\n347. **^** Balabkins 1964, pp. 208–209.\n348. **^** \"The Bretton Woods Conference, 1944\".

Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes[449] and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma that benefited from information given to the United Kingdom by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war.[450] Another component of military intelligence was deception, which the Allies used to great effect in operations such as Mincemeat and Bodyguard.[449][451]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n426. **^** BBSU 1998, p. 84; Lindberg & Todd 2001, p. 126.\n427. **^** Unidas, Naciones (2005). *World Economic And Social Survey 2004: International Migration*.

Many participating countries invested all available economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities into this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war.

The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories; the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops; Hitler's suicide; and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* May, Ernest R.

The United Nations was established to foster international cooperation and prevent conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US—becoming the permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the US emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the Cold War. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonization of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.\n\n\n\n\n## Start and end dates\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of timelines of World War II\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** Weinberg 2005, p. 6.\n2. **^** Wells, Anne Sharp (2014) *Historical Dictionary of World War II: The War against Germany and Italy*.

With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany, and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941.[129] By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy late March 1941, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact; however, the Yugoslav government was overthrown two days later by pro-British nationalists. Germany and Italy responded with simultaneous invasions of both Yugoslavia and Greece, commencing on 6 April 1941; both nations were forced to surrender within the month.[124] The airborne invasion of the Greek island of Crete at the end of May completed the German conquest of the Balkans.[125] Partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, which continued until the end of the war.[126]\n\n\nIn the Middle East in May, Commonwealth forces quashed an uprising in Iraq which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled Syria.[127] Between June and July, British-led forces invaded and occupied the French possessions of Syria and Lebanon, assisted by the Free French.[128]\n\n\n\n#### Axis attack on the Soviet Union (1941)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Eastern Front (World War II)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe causes of the war are debated; contributing factors included the rise of fascism in Europe, the Spanish Civil War, the Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, and tensions in the aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their \"spheres of influence\" across Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, in a military alliance, called the Axis, with Italy, Japan, and other countries. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n156. **^** Beevor 1998, pp. 41–42; Evans 2008, pp. 213–214, notes that \"Zhukov had pushed the Germans back where they had launched Operation Typhoon two months before. ...

By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign.[252] In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin in Tehran.[253] The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory[254] and the military planning for the Burma campaign,[255] while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.[256]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n187. **^** Dunn 1998, p. 157.

Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin\nOn 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt to split the Allies on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes and along the French-German border, hoping to encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and prompt a political settlement after capturing their primary supply port at Antwerp.[289] By 16 January 1945, this offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.[289] In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Red Army attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia.[290] On 4 February Soviet, British, and U.S. leaders met for the Yalta Conference. They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan.[291]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 1940, the Soviet Union occupied the entire territories of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,[80] as well as the Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and the Hertsa region. In August 1940, Hitler imposed the Second Vienna Award on Romania which led to the transfer of Northern Transylvania to Hungary.[86] In September 1940, Bulgaria demanded Southern Dobruja from Romania with German and Italian support, leading to the Treaty of Craiova.[87] The loss of one-third of Romania's 1939 territory caused a coup against King Carol II, turning Romania into a fascist dictatorship under Marshal Ion Antonescu, with a course set towards the Axis in the hopes of a German guarantee.[88] Meanwhile, German-Soviet political relations and economic co-operation[89][90] gradually stalled,[91][92] and both states began preparations for war.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Western Europe (1940–1941)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Western Front (World War II)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** Timothy Neeno. \"Nomonhan: The Second Russo-Japanese War\".

The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. The Soviets demanded a second front. The British argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolstering resistance forces; Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour, without using large-scale armies.[193] Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.[194]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWorld War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939[1][2] with the German invasion of Poland and the United Kingdom and France's declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939. Dates for the beginning of the Pacific War include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July 1937,[3][4] or the earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria, on 19 September 1931.[5][6] Others follow the British historian A. J. P. Taylor, who stated that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in 1941.[7] Other theorized starting dates for World War II include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935.[8] The British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939.[9] Others view the Spanish Civil War as the start or prelude to World War II.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research, the development of artificial harbours, and oil pipelines under the English Channel.[452] Penicillin was first developed, mass-produced, and used during the war.[453]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n\n* Opposition to World War II\n* World War III\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Levine, Alan J.

By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr, encircling the German Army Group B.[292] In early March, in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and to retake Budapest, Germany launched its last major offensive against Soviet troops near Lake Balaton. In two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the Soviets advanced to Vienna, and captured the city. In early April, Soviet troops captured Königsberg, while the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April, leaving several unoccupied pockets in southern Germany and around Berlin.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy mid-November, the Germans had nearly taken Stalingrad in bitter street fighting. The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad,[217] and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously.[218] By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated,[219] and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk.[220]\n\n\n\n##### Western Europe/Atlantic and Mediterranean (1942–1943)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ross, Steven T.

To circumvent the strong Maginot Line fortifications on the Franco-German border, Germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.[97] The Germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the Ardennes region,[98] which was mistakenly perceived by the Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.[99][100] By successfully implementing new *Blitzkrieg* tactics, the *Wehrmacht* rapidly advanced to the Channel and cut off the Allied forces in Belgium, trapping the bulk of the Allied armies in a cauldron on the Franco-Belgian border near Lille. The United Kingdom was able to evacuate a significant number of Allied troops from the continent by early June, although they had to abandon almost all their equipment.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n194. **^** \"The Elimination of the Alternatives.

In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on Pearl Harbor which resulted in the United States and the United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The European Axis powers declared war on the US in solidarity. Japan soon conquered much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including German defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of September 1940, the Tripartite Pact formally united Japan, Italy, and Germany as the Axis powers. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country--with the exception of the Soviet Union--that attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.[115] The Axis expanded in November 1940 when Hungary, Slovakia, and Romania joined.[116] Romania and Hungary later made major contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union, in Romania's case partially to recapture territory ceded to the Soviet Union.[117]\n\n\n\n#### Mediterranean (1940–1941)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Evans, David C.; Peattie, Mark R.

By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops.[211] In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first was a disastrous offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942 that forced a retreat back to India by May 1943.[212] The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese frontlines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.[213]\n\n\n\n##### Eastern Front (1942–1943)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Koch, H.W.

In mid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo, and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Axis collapse and Allied victory (1944–1945)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThough the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies and the war evolved into one of attrition.[422] While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed[*by whom?*] to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force,[423] Allied strategic bombing,[424] and Germany's late shift to a war economy[425] contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so.[426] To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers;[427] Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe,[402] while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.[409][410]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFile:View from St Paul's Cathedral after the Blitz.jpgLondon seen from St. Paul's Cathedral after the German *Blitz*, 29 December 1940\nThe air Battle of Britain[105] began in early July with Luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours.[106] The United Kingdom rejected Hitler's peace offer,[107] and the German air superiority campaign started in August but failed to defeat RAF Fighter Command, forcing the indefinite postponement of the proposed German invasion of Britain. The German strategic bombing offensive intensified with night attacks on London and other cities in the Blitz, but largely ended in May 1941[108] after failing to significantly disrupt the British war effort.[106]\n\n\nUsing newly captured French ports, the German Navy enjoyed success against an over-extended Royal Navy, using U-boats against British shipping in the Atlantic.[109] The British Home Fleet scored a significant victory on 27 May 1941 by sinking the German battleship *Bismarck*.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Advances in technology and its application\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)A V-2 rocket launched from a fixed site in Peenemünde, 21 June 1943\nMain article: Technology during World War II\n\nAircraft were used for reconnaissance, as fighters, bombers, and ground-support, and each role developed considerably. Innovations included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);[428] and strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).[429] Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery, in particular the introduction of the proximity fuze. The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.[430]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 1943, the British and Americans began a strategic bombing campaign against Germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and \"de-house\" the civilian population.[235] The firebombing of Hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre.[236]\n\n\n\n#### Allies gain momentum (1943–1944)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPost-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.[337] The long period of political tensions and military competition between them--the Cold War--would be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and number of proxy wars throughout the world.[338]\n\n\nIn Asia, the United States led the occupation of Japan and administered Japan's former islands in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands.[339] Korea, formerly under Japanese colonial rule, was divided and occupied by the Soviet Union in the North and the United States in the South between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea, which led ultimately to the Korean War.[340]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSoviet troops stormed and captured Berlin in late April.[293] In Italy, German forces surrendered on 29 April. On 30 April, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany,[294] and the Berlin garrison surrendered on 2 May.\n\n\nMajor changes in leadership occurred on both sides during this period. On 12 April, President Roosevelt died and was succeeded by his vice president, Harry S. Truman. Benito Mussolini was killed by Italian partisans on 28 April.[295] On 30 April, Hitler committed suicide in his headquarters, and he was succeeded by Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Joseph Goebbels. Total and unconditional surrender in Europe was signed on 7 and 8 May, to be effective by the end of 8 May.[296] German Army Group Centre resisted in Prague until 11 May.[297]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the East, the intended gains of *Lebensraum* were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders.[413] Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the \"inferior people\" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by mass atrocities and war crimes.[414] The Nazis killed an estimated 2.77 million ethnic Poles during the war in addition to Polish-Jewish victims of the Holocaust.[415][*better source needed*] Although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East[416] or the West[417] until late 1943.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ben-Horin, Eliahu (1943). *The Middle East: Crossroads of History*.

On 5 July 1943, Germany attacked Soviet forces around the Kursk Bulge. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' well-constructed defences,[240] and for the first time in the war, Hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success.[241] This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month.[242]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases.[112] Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941.[113] In December 1940, Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the United States to become an \"arsenal of democracy\" and promoting Lend-Lease programmes of military and humanitarian aid to support the British war effort; Lend-Lease was later extended to the other Allies, including the Soviet Union after it was invaded by Germany.[107] The United States started strategic planning to prepare for a full-scale offensive against Germany.[114]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)German advance into Belgium and Northern France, 10 May – 4 June 1940, swept past the Maginot Line (shown in dark red)\nIn April 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway to protect shipments of iron ore from Sweden, which the Allies were attempting to cut off.[94] Denmark capitulated after six hours, and despite Allied support, Norway was conquered within two months.[95] British discontent over the Norwegian campaign led to the resignation of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who was replaced by Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)American troops approaching Omaha Beach during the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944\nOn 6 June 1944 (commonly known as D-Day), after three years of Soviet pressure,[270] the Western Allies invaded northern France. After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also attacked southern France.[271] These landings were successful and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France. Paris was liberated on 25 August by the local resistance assisted by the Free French Forces, both led by General Charles de Gaulle,[272] and the Western Allies continued to push back German forces in western Europe during the latter part of the year. An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands failed.[273] After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but failed to cross the Rur river. In Italy, the Allied advance slowed due to the last major German defensive line.[274]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe exact date of the war's end is not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, which officially ended the war in Asia. A peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was signed in 1951.[12] A 1990 treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place and resolved most post–World War II issues.[13] No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed,[14] although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which also restored full diplomatic relations between them.[15]\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### Background\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Causes of World War II\n\n#### Aftermath of World War I\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n183. **^** Dower 1986, p. 5, calls attention to the fact that \"the Allied struggle against Japan exposed the racist underpinnings of the European and American colonial structure.

The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,[243] giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.[244][245] The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified Panther–Wotan line, but the Soviets broke through it at Smolensk and the Lower Dnieper Offensive.[246]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLand warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of World War I, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.[440] In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I,[441] and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.[442][443] At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.[444] This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n362. **^** O'Brien, Joseph V. \"World War II: Combatants and Casualties (1937–1945)\". *Obee's History Page*.

Following Hindenburg's death in 1934, Hitler proclaimed himself *Führer* of Germany and abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign.[20] France, seeking to secure its alliance with Italy, allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany, and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.[21]\n\n\n\n#### European treaties\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland after having staged several false flag border incidents as a pretext to initiate the invasion.[65] The first German attack of the war came against the Polish defenses at Westerplatte.[66] The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum for Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany,[67] followed by Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Canada. During the Phoney War period, the alliance provided no direct military support to Poland, outside of a cautious French probe into the Saarland.[68] The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.[69] Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the Stresa Front in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards military globalisation; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an independent naval agreement with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the Franco-Soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.[22] The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the Neutrality Act in August of the same year.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany annexed western Poland and occupied central Poland; the Soviet Union annexed eastern Poland; small shares of Polish territory were transferred to Lithuania and Slovakia. On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union.

Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate Communism, generate *Lebensraum* (\"living space\")[137] by dispossessing the native population,[138] and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.[139]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese attacks led the United States, United Kingdom, China, Australia, and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.[187] Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States[188] in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.[135][189] The Japanese invasion of Thailand led to Thailand's decision to ally itself with Japan.\n\n\n\n#### Axis advance stalls (1942–1943)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 1 January 1942, the Allied Big Four[190]—the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the Declaration by United Nations, thereby affirming the Atlantic Charter[191] and agreeing not to sign a separate peace with the Axis powers.[192]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 3 September 1943, the Western Allies invaded the Italian mainland, following Italy's armistice with the Allies and the ensuing German occupation of Italy.[247] Germany, with the help of fascists, responded to the armistice by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas,[248] and creating a series of defensive lines.[249] German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic,[250] causing an Italian civil war. The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the main German defensive line in mid-November.[251]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe situation became a crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border. On 23 August the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Germany,[59] after tripartite negotiations for a military alliance between France, the United Kingdom, and Soviet Union had stalled.[60] This pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet \"spheres of influence\" (western Poland and Lithuania for Germany; eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Bessarabia for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of continuing Polish independence.[61] The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I. Immediately afterwards, Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August--but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Blinkhorn, Martin (2006) [1984]. *Mussolini and Fascist Italy* (3rd ed.).

A month later, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy joined the following year.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Asia\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Kuomintang (KMT) party in China launched a unification campaign against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a civil war against its former Chinese Communist Party allies[26] and new regional warlords. In 1931, an increasingly militaristic Empire of Japan, which had long sought influence in China[27] as the first step of what its government saw as the country's right to rule Asia, staged the Mukden Incident as a pretext to invade Manchuria and establish the puppet state of Manchukuo.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAdvances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship (in place of the battleship).[431][432][433] In the Atlantic, escort carriers became a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap.[434] Carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft[435] and because they are not required to be as heavily armoured.[436] Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War,[437] were expected by all combatants to be important in the second. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ———; Andrew, Stephen (2002). *The Japanese Army, 1931–45*.

In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against Allied positions in Assam, India,[265] and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at Imphal and Kohima.[266] In May 1944, British and Indian forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma by July,[266] and Chinese forces that had invaded northern Burma in late 1943 besieged Japanese troops in Myitkyina.[267] The second Japanese invasion of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.[268] By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha.[269]\n\n\n\n#### Allies close in (1944)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the Red Army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before the war,[140] *Operation* *Barbarossa* forced the Soviet supreme command to adopt strategic defence. During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By mid-August, however, the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad.[141] The Kyiv offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further advance into Crimea and industrially-developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov).[142]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 10 June, Italy invaded France, declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom.[102] The Germans turned south against the weakened French army, and Paris fell to them on 14 June. Eight days later France signed an armistice with Germany; it was divided into German and Italian occupation zones,[103] and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany. France kept its fleet, which the United Kingdom attacked on 3 July in an attempt to prevent its seizure by Germany.[104]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Adamthwaite, Anthony P.

This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region.[262] By late May 1944, the Soviets had liberated Crimea, largely expelled Axis forces from Ukraine, and made incursions into Romania, which were repulsed by the Axis troops.[263] The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, Rome was captured on June 4.[264]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline (1995). *Stalin's Cold War: Soviet Strategies in Europe, 1943–56*.

The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a baby boom, and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy.[344] The Allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany from 1945 to 1948.[345] Due to international trade interdependencies, this policy led to an economic stagnation in Europe and delayed European recovery from the war for several years.[346][347]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Waltz, Susan (2002). \"Reclaiming and Rebuilding the History of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\". *Third World Quarterly*. **23** (3): 437–448. doi:10.1080/01436590220138378.

In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish \"war-mongers\" and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, Germany invaded the remainder of Czechoslovakia and subsequently split it into the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a pro-German client state, the Slovak Republic.[54] Hitler also delivered an ultimatum to Lithuania on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the Klaipėda Region, formerly the German *Memelland*.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in Manchukuo had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and Mongolia. The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. This policy would prove difficult to maintain in light of the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War[48] and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a Neutrality Pact in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of Nanshin-ron, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward and eventually led to war with the United States and the Western Allies.[49][50]\n\n\n\n#### European occupations and agreements\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Red Army soldiers on the counterattack during the Battle of Stalingrad, February 1943\nDespite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in central and southern Russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.[214] In May, the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov,[215] and then in June 1942 launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy the Kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.[216]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the eastern territories, Silesia, Neumark and most of Pomerania were taken over by Poland,[315] and East Prussia was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, followed by the expulsion to Germany of the nine million Germans from these provinces,[316][317] as well as three million Germans from the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia. By the 1950s, one-fifth of West Germans were refugees from the east. The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon line,[318] from which 2 million Poles were expelled;[317][319] north-east Romania,[320][321] parts of eastern Finland,[322] and the Baltic states were annexed into the Soviet Union.[323][324] Italy lost its monarchy, colonial empire and some European territories.[325]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of Warsaw. The Polish counter-offensive to the west halted the German advance for several days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the *Wehrmacht*. Remnants of the Polish army broke through to besieged Warsaw. On 17 September 1939, two days after signing a cease-fire with Japan, the Soviet Union invaded Poland[71] under the supposed pretext that the Polish state had ceased to exist.[72] On 27 September, the Warsaw garrison surrendered to the Germans, and the last large operational unit of the Polish Army surrendered on 6 October. Despite the military defeat, Poland never surrendered; instead, it formed the Polish government-in-exile and a clandestine state apparatus remained in occupied Poland.[73] A significant part of Polish military personnel evacuated to Romania and Latvia; many of them later fought against the Axis in other theatres of the war.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n447. **^** Sprague, Oliver; Griffiths, Hugh (2006). \"The AK-47: the worlds favourite killing machine\" (PDF). controlarms.org. p. 1.

These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all its overseas possessions, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Germany\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)German Panzer III of the Afrika Korps advancing across the North African desert, April–May 1941\nIn December 1940, British Empire forces began counter-offensives against Italian forces in Egypt and Italian East Africa.[120] The offensives were successful; by early February 1941, Italy had lost control of eastern Libya, and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission after a carrier attack at Taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan.[121]\n\n\nItalian defeats prompted Germany to deploy an expeditionary force to North Africa; at the end of March 1941, Rommel's Afrika Korps launched an offensive which drove back Commonwealth forces.[122] In less than a month, Axis forces advanced to western Egypt and besieged the port of Tobruk.[123]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Second Italo-Ethiopian War was a brief colonial war that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936.

Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did little when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's Covenant.[32] The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.[33] Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing Austria.[34]\n\n\n\n#### Spanish Civil War (1936–1939)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n307. **^** Ward Wilson. \"The Winning Weapon?

In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese victory at Changsha.[201] These easy victories over the unprepared U.S. and European opponents left Japan overconfident, and overextended.[202]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.[131] On 31 July 1940, Hitler decided that the Soviet Union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of Ukraine, the Baltic states and Byelorussia.[132] However, other senior German officials like Ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a Euro-Asian bloc against the British Empire by inviting the Soviet Union into the Tripartite Pact.[133] In November 1940, negotiations took place to determine if the Soviet Union would join the pact. The Soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable.

In May 1943, Canadian and U.S. forces were sent to eliminate Japanese forces from the Aleutians.[237] Soon after, the United States, with support from Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands.[238] By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major Japanese base at Truk in the Caroline Islands.

In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the annexed portions of Czechoslovakia) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichsmarks (27.8 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the plunder of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.[411] Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on.[412]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the Battle of the Coral Sea.[203] Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid, was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.[204] In mid-May, Japan started the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.[205][206] In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans had broken Japanese naval codes in late May and were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy.[207]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their first major victory at Taierzhuang, but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by the Japanese in May.[44][*unreliable source?*] In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by flooding the Yellow River; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at Wuhan, but the city was taken by October.[45] Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead, the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war.[46][47]\n\n\n\n#### Soviet–Japanese border conflicts\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Soviet–Japanese border conflicts\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Chamberlain, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini, and Ciano pictured just before signing the Munich Agreement, 29 September 1938\nIn Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive.

Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.[52] Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to cede additional territory to Hungary, and Poland annexed the Trans-Olza region of Czechoslovakia.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince early 1941, the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations, Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.[169] At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them.[170] Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946) and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any \"neighboring countries\".[170]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Slim, William (1956). *Defeat into Victory*.

From September to November, the Japanese attacked Taiyuan, engaged the Kuomintang Army around Xinkou,[39][*unreliable source?*] and fought Communist forces in Pingxingguan.[40][41] Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai, but after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were murdered by the Japanese.[42][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChina appealed to the League of Nations to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its incursion into Manchuria.

Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan.[29] After the 1936 Xi'an Incident, the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present a united front to oppose Japan.[30]\n\n\n\n### Pre-war events\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Second Italo-Ethiopian War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nculminating in the failed Dieppe Raid,[227] demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.[228][*page needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n376. **^** Geiger, Vladimir (2012). \"Human Losses of the Croats in World War II and the Immediate Post-War Period Caused by the Chetniks (Yugoslav Army in the Fatherand) and the Partisans (People's Liberation Army and the Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia/Yugoslav Army) and the Communist Authorities: Numerical Indicators\". *Review of Croatian History*. **VIII** (1).

Nazi Germany extensively used forced labourers; about 12 million Europeans from German-occupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in German industry, agriculture and war economy.[402]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The League of Nations assembly, held in Geneva, Switzerland, 1930\nWorld War I had radically altered the political European map with the defeat of the Central Powers—including Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire—and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and Russian Empires.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTo prevent a future world war, the League of Nations was created during the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military and naval disarmament, and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n285. **^** Jowett & Andrew 2002, p. 8.\n286. **^** Howard 2004, p. 140.\n287. **^** Drea 2003, p. 54.\n288. **^** Cook & Bewes 1997, p. 305.\n289. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Parker 2004, pp. xiii–xiv, 6–8, 68–70, 329–330\n290. **^** Glantz 2001, p. 85.\n291. **^** Beevor 2012, pp. 709–722.\n292. **^** Buchanan 2006, p. 21.\n293. **^** Kershaw 2001, pp. 793–829.\n294. **^** Shepardson 1998\n295. **^** O'Reilly 2001, p. 244.\n296. **^** Evans 2008, p. 737.\n297. **^** Glantz 1998, p. 24.\n298. **^** Chant, Christopher (1986). *The Encyclopedia of Codenames of World War II*.

As a result, East Germany,[333] Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Albania[334] became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the Soviet Union.[335] A Communist uprising in Greece was put down with Anglo-American support and the country remained aligned with the West.[336]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAxis forces employed biological and chemical weapons.

Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the promises made by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the Fascist movement led by Benito Mussolini seized power in Italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing, and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power, promising the creation of a \"New Roman Empire\".[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"German-American Relations – Treaty on the Final Settlement concerning Germany\". usa.usembassy.de. 12 September 1990.

In 1939, the United States notified Japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and American public opinion opposing Japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctions--the Export Control Acts-- which banned U.S. exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to Japan, and increased economic pressure on the Japanese regime.[107][157][158] During 1939 Japan launched its first attack against Changsha, but was repulsed by late September.[159] Despite several offensives by both sides, by 1940 the war between China and Japan was at a stalemate. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina in September 1940.[160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Soviet Union was responsible for the Katyn massacre of 22,000 Polish officers,[390] and the imprisonment or execution of hundreds of thousands of political prisoners by the NKVD secret police, along with mass civilian deportations to Siberia, in the Baltic states and eastern Poland annexed by the Red Army.[391] Soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories, especially in Germany.[392][393] The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain, but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many as two million,[394] while figures for women raped by German soldiers in the Soviet Union go as far as ten million.[395][396]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWestern world and culture\n |\n| --- |\n| Foundations | * Cradle of civilization\n* Old World\n* Greco-Roman world\n\t+ Greece\n\t+ Hellenistic Kingdoms\n\t+ Rome\n\t+ Roman Empire\n\t\t- Western\n\t\t- Eastern\n* Roman legacy\n* Romanization\n* Romano-Germanic culture\n\t+ Gallo-Roman\n* Christendom\n |\n| History | * European Bronze Age\n* Classical antiquity\n\t+ Late antiquity\n* Middle Ages\n\t+ early\n\t+ high\n\t+ late\n* Renaissance\n* Modern period\n\t+ Early modern period\n\t+ Age of Discovery\n\t+ Reformation\n\t+ Age of Enlightenment\n\t+ Scientific Revolution\n\t+ Age of Revolution\n\t+ Romanticism\n\t+ Abolitionism\n\t+ Emancipation\n\t+ Capitalism\n\t+ Industrial Revolution\n\t+ Great Divergence\n\t+ Modernism\n\t+ World War I\n\t+ Interwar period\n\t+ Universal suffrage\n\t+ World War II\n\t+ Cold War\n* Post–Cold War era\n\t+ Information age\n\t+ War on terror\n |\n| Culture | * Alphabet\n\t+ Greek\n\t+ Latin\n\t+ Cyrillic\n* Architecture\n* Art\n\t+ Periods\n* Calendar\n* Cuisine\n\t+ Diet\n* Classical tradition\n\t+ Studies\n* Clothing\n\t+ History\n* Dance\n* Education\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940.

The Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939,[82] and was subsequently expelled from the League of Nations for this crime of aggression.[83] Despite overwhelming numerical superiority, Soviet military success during the Winter War was modest,[84] and the Finno-Soviet war ended in March 1940 with some Finnish concessions of territory.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into Yugoslavia and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.[279] By this point, the communist-led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern Serbia, the Soviet Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn an effort to maintain world peace,[326] the Allies formed the United Nations,[327] which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945,[328] and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations.[329] The great powers that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States—became the permanent members of the UN's Security Council.[330] The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its successor state, the Russian Federation, following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.[331]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe UDHR is viewable here [1] Archived 3 July 2017 at the Wayback Machine\n330. **^** *The UN Security Council*, archived from the original on 20 June 2012, retrieved 15 May 2012\n331. **^** Kantowicz 2000, p. 6.\n332. **^** Trachtenberg 1999, p. 33.\n333. **^** Applebaum 2012.\n334. **^** Naimark 2010.\n335. **^** Swain 1992.\n336. **^** \"Greek Civil War\". *Encyclopedia Britannica*. 28 May 2023.\n337. **^** Borstelmann 2005, p. 318.\n338. **^** Leffler & Westad 2010.\n339. **^** Weinberg 2005, p. 911.\n340. **^** Stueck 2010, p. 71.\n341. **^** Lynch 2010, pp. 12–13.\n342. **^** Roberts 1997, p. 589.\n343. **^** Darwin 2007, pp. 441–443, 464–68.\n344. **^** Dear & Foot 2001, p. 1006; Harrison 1998, pp. 34–55.\n345. **^** Balabkins 1964, p. 207.\n346. **^** Petrov 1967, p. 263.\n347. **^** Balabkins 1964, pp. 208–209.\n348. **^** \"The Bretton Woods Conference, 1944\".

Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes[449] and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma that benefited from information given to the United Kingdom by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war.[450] Another component of military intelligence was deception, which the Allies used to great effect in operations such as Mincemeat and Bodyguard.[449][451]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n426. **^** BBSU 1998, p. 84; Lindberg & Todd 2001, p. 126.\n427. **^** Unidas, Naciones (2005). *World Economic And Social Survey 2004: International Migration*.
