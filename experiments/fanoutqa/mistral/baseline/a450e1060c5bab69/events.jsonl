He is the founder, chairman, and CEO of Dell Technologies, one of the world's largest technology infrastructure companies.[1] He is the 18th richest person in the world according to the *Bloomberg Billionaires Index*, with a net worth of $65 billion as of November 2023.[2]\n\n\nIn 2011, his 243.35 million shares of Dell stock were worth $3.5 billion, giving him 12% ownership of the company.[3] His remaining wealth of roughly $10 billion is invested in other companies and is managed by DFO Management, which incorporates his initials.[4] In January 2013 it was announced that he had bid to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest management buyout since the Great Recession. Dell Inc. officially went private in October 2013.[5] The company once again went public in December 2018.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDell was born in 1965 in Houston to a Jewish family. His parents were Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[7] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist. Michael attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[8] He would go on to attend Memorial High School.[9] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight.[10] In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[11]\n\n\nDell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[12] Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the *Houston Post* in the summer.[13] Dell's parents wanted him to be a doctor and in order to please them, he took up pre-med at the University of Texas in 1983.[14] Dell continued learning to target specific populations for newspaper subscriptions rather than just making cold calls.[15] He discovered that people who were most likely to get a subscription were newlyweds and people moving to a new home. After collecting the contact information of this population from public records, he sent direct mail appeals and earned $18,000 in one year.[13] He hired several employees, and after earning a gross profit of nearly $200,000 in his first year of business, Dell dropped out of the University of Texas at age 19.[16]\n\n\n\n## Business career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A PC's Limited Turbo PC signed by Dell\n![](image)Michael Dell lecturing at the Oracle OpenWorld, San Francisco 2010\nWhile a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building.[9][17] He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[18][19][20]\n\n\nIn January 1984, Dell believed that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel.[21] In January 1984, Dell registered his company as \"PC's Limited\". Dell’s strategy was to sell directly to customers by manufacturing computers only after they were ordered.[22] Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 worth of PC upgrades, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as \"Dell Computer Corporation\" and relocated to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few people as order takers, a few more to fill the orders, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff consisting of \"three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables\". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[23][24]\n\n\nIn 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in *Fortune* magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[25] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon[*when?*] reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[26] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, surpassing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitors' sales were shrinking.[27]\n\n\nIn 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[28] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[29]\n\n\nIn 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the company.[30]\n\n\nOn October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the \"highest-valued tech acquisition in history\".[31][32] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[33]\n\n\n\n## Penalty[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[34] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each and former CFO James Schneider agreed to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[34]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nAccolades for Dell include \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" (at age 24) from *Inc.* magazine;[35] \"Top CEO in American Business\" from *Worth* magazine; \"CEO of the Year\" from *Financial World*, *IndustryWeek* and *Chief Executive* magazines. Dell also received the 1998 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[36] and the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[37]\n\n\n\n## Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nDell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[38]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Governor Greg Abbott named Dell to the Strike Force to Open Texas – a group \"tasked with finding safe and effective ways to slowly reopen the state\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.[39] He also serves as an advisor on the COVID-19 Technology Task Force, a technology industry coalition founded in March 2020 collaborating on solutions to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.[40]\n\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\nDell's 1999 book, *Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry* (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[41]\n\n\nDell's second book, *Play Nice But Win: A CEO's Journey from Founder to Leader* (by Portfolio), is a story of inside battles that defined him as a leader. The book was written in collaboration with James Kaplan.[42]\n\n\n\n## Wealth[edit]\n\n\n*Forbes* estimated Dell's net worth at $71.5 billion as of October 2023.[43]\n\n\nIn February 2018, it was reported that in 2014, Dell had paid $100.5 million for Manhattan's One57 penthouse, which was then a record for the most expensive home ever sold in the city.[44]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989, in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[45][46][47]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to complement the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[48] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.[49] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa.[50] Dell is also behind the founding of the Dell Jewish Community Campus in the Northwest Hills neighborhood of Austin.[51]\n\n\nBy 2011, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa.[52] Today the foundation has over $466 million in assets under management.[53]\n\n\nIn 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[54]\n\n\nIn 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[55]\n\n\nIn 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[56]\n\n\nIn 2017, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Dell, a Houston native, pledged $36 million to relief efforts.[57]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Dell donated $1 billion to his foundation, which focuses on child poverty; it makes both impact investments and charitable donations.[58]\n\n\nIn 2018, Dell Technologies returned to public markets through a complicated financial restructuring.[59]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation donated $100 million to support small businesses and others endure the COVID-19 pandemic and help finding treatments for coronavirus.[60]\n\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation donated $38 million to three non-profit organizations that are devoted to housing homeless people in Austin.[61]\n\n\nIn 2023, it was noted that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation has donated over $2.43 billion so far.[62]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Surrounding oneself with the best talent\". *Industr*.

He is the founder, chairman, and CEO of Dell Technologies, one of the world's largest technology infrastructure companies.[1] He is the 18th richest person in the world according to the *Bloomberg Billionaires Index*, with a net worth of $65 billion as of November 2023.[2]\n\n\nIn 2011, his 243.35 million shares of Dell stock were worth $3.5 billion, giving him 12% ownership of the company.[3] His remaining wealth of roughly $10 billion is invested in other companies and is managed by DFO Management, which incorporates his initials.[4] In January 2013 it was announced that he had bid to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest management buyout since the Great Recession. Dell Inc. officially went private in October 2013.[5] The company once again went public in December 2018.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDell was born in 1965 in Houston to a Jewish family. His parents were Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[7] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist. Michael attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[8] He would go on to attend Memorial High School.[9] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight.[10] In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[11]\n\n\nDell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[12] Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the *Houston Post* in the summer.[13] Dell's parents wanted him to be a doctor and in order to please them, he took up pre-med at the University of Texas in 1983.[14] Dell continued learning to target specific populations for newspaper subscriptions rather than just making cold calls.[15] He discovered that people who were most likely to get a subscription were newlyweds and people moving to a new home. After collecting the contact information of this population from public records, he sent direct mail appeals and earned $18,000 in one year.[13] He hired several employees, and after earning a gross profit of nearly $200,000 in his first year of business, Dell dropped out of the University of Texas at age 19.[16]\n\n\n\n## Business career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A PC's Limited Turbo PC signed by Dell\n![](image)Michael Dell lecturing at the Oracle OpenWorld, San Francisco 2010\nWhile a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building.[9][17] He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[18][19][20]\n\n\nIn January 1984, Dell believed that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel.[21] In January 1984, Dell registered his company as \"PC's Limited\". Dell’s strategy was to sell directly to customers by manufacturing computers only after they were ordered.[22] Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 worth of PC upgrades, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as \"Dell Computer Corporation\" and relocated to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few people as order takers, a few more to fill the orders, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff consisting of \"three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables\". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[23][24]\n\n\nIn 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in *Fortune* magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[25] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon[*when?*] reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[26] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, surpassing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitors' sales were shrinking.[27]\n\n\nIn 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[28] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[29]\n\n\nIn 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the company.[30]\n\n\nOn October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the \"highest-valued tech acquisition in history\".[31][32] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[33]\n\n\n\n## Penalty[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[34] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each and former CFO James Schneider agreed to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[34]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nAccolades for Dell include \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" (at age 24) from *Inc.* magazine;[35] \"Top CEO in American Business\" from *Worth* magazine; \"CEO of the Year\" from *Financial World*, *IndustryWeek* and *Chief Executive* magazines. Dell also received the 1998 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[36] and the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[37]\n\n\n\n## Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nDell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[38]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Governor Greg Abbott named Dell to the Strike Force to Open Texas – a group \"tasked with finding safe and effective ways to slowly reopen the state\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.[39] He also serves as an advisor on the COVID-19 Technology Task Force, a technology industry coalition founded in March 2020 collaborating on solutions to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.[40]\n\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\nDell's 1999 book, *Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry* (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[41]\n\n\nDell's second book, *Play Nice But Win: A CEO's Journey from Founder to Leader* (by Portfolio), is a story of inside battles that defined him as a leader. The book was written in collaboration with James Kaplan.[42]\n\n\n\n## Wealth[edit]\n\n\n*Forbes* estimated Dell's net worth at $71.5 billion as of October 2023.[43]\n\n\nIn February 2018, it was reported that in 2014, Dell had paid $100.5 million for Manhattan's One57 penthouse, which was then a record for the most expensive home ever sold in the city.[44]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989, in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[45][46][47]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to complement the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[48] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.[49] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa.[50] Dell is also behind the founding of the Dell Jewish Community Campus in the Northwest Hills neighborhood of Austin.[51]\n\n\nBy 2011, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa.[52] Today the foundation has over $466 million in assets under management.[53]\n\n\nIn 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[54]\n\n\nIn 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[55]\n\n\nIn 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[56]\n\n\nIn 2017, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Dell, a Houston native, pledged $36 million to relief efforts.[57]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Dell donated $1 billion to his foundation, which focuses on child poverty; it makes both impact investments and charitable donations.[58]\n\n\nIn 2018, Dell Technologies returned to public markets through a complicated financial restructuring.[59]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation donated $100 million to support small businesses and others endure the COVID-19 pandemic and help finding treatments for coronavirus.[60]\n\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation donated $38 million to three non-profit organizations that are devoted to housing homeless people in Austin.[61]\n\n\nIn 2023, it was noted that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation has donated over $2.43 billion so far.[62]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Surrounding oneself with the best talent\". *Industr*.

In 1916 the family moved to San Francisco after his father, Albion Walter Hewlett, took a similar position at Stanford Medical School, located at the time in San Francisco. He attended Lowell High School and was the 1929-1930 Battalion Commander of the school's Army JROTC program. He was accepted at Stanford University as a favor to his late father who died of a brain tumor in 1925.[1]\n\n\nHewlett received his bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 1934, a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1936, and a post-masters engineering degree in electrical engineering from Stanford in 1939. He joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity during his time at Stanford. Hewlett also had dyslexia, which caused him to struggle with reading and taking notes.[2]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Hewlett-Packard\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett attended undergraduate classes taught by Fred Terman at Stanford and became acquainted with David Packard. Packard and he began discussing forming a company in August 1937, and founded Hewlett-Packard Company as a partnership on January 1, 1939. A flip of a coin decided the ordering of their names.[3] Their first big breakthrough came when Disney purchased eight audio oscillators designed by Hewlett which were used for the production of the film *Fantasia*.[4]\n\n\nThe company incorporated in 1947 and tendered an initial public offering in 1957.[1] Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were proud of their company culture which came to be known as the HP Way. The HP Way is a corporate culture that claimed to be centered not only on making money but also on respecting and nurturing its employees. Hewlett was president of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1954.[5]\n\n\nHe was president of HP from 1964 to 1977 and served as CEO from 1968 to 1978, after which he was succeeded by John A. Young. He remained chairman of the executive committee until 1983, and then served as vice chairman of the board until 1987.\n\n\nA young Steve Jobs, then age 12,[6] called Hewlett (whose number was in the phone book) and requested any available parts for a frequency counter he was building. Hewlett, impressed with Jobs' initiative, offered him a summer job assembling frequency counters.[7] Jobs then considered HP one of the companies that he admired, regarding it among the handful of companies (Disney and Intel were the others) that were built “to last, not just to make money”.[8] Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple along with Jobs, unsuccessfully attempted five times to sell the Apple I computer to HP while working there. The early Apple computers were built with HP parts, under a legal release from HP.[9] Of the missed opportunity, Hewlett reportedly said, \"You win some, you lose some.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### Military service\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett served in the Army during World War II as a Signal Corps Officer. He then led the electronics section of the Development Division, a new part of the War Department Special Staff. After the war he was part of a special team that inspected Japanese Industry.[11]\n\n\n\n### Other companies\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett was a Director for Hexcel Products Incorporated (became Hexcel, founded by his wife Flora's brother in law Roscoe \"Bud\" Hughes) from 1956 to 1965, and worked on their executive committee. Hewlett served as a Director of Chase Manhattan Bank (became JPMorgan Chase) from 1969 to 1980. Hewlett was also elected to the board of directors for Chrysler Corporation in 1966, a position he held until 1983.[12]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting in the 1960s Hewlett committed much of his time and wealth towards numerous philanthropic causes. In 1966, William Hewlett and his wife Flora founded the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which became one of the largest private foundations in the United States. Aside from the foundation Hewlett gave millions of dollars to universities, schools, museums, non-profit organizations and other organizations. Stanford University was a large recipient of his philanthropy.[12]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett married Flora Lamson in 1939, and had 5 children with her: Eleanor, Walter, James, William and Mary. They had 12 grandchildren. His wife died in 1977. In 1978, Hewlett married Rosemary Kopmeier Bradford.\n\n\nHe was a committed conservationist and avid outdoorsman. As an amateur photographer and botanist, he took many photographs and samples of wildflowers. Some of these were donated to the California Academy of Sciences.[13]\n\n\nHewlett died of heart failure in Palo Alto, California on January 12, 2001 (aged 87),[14][15] and was interred at Los Gatos Memorial Park, San Jose, California.[16]\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, the William R. Hewlett Teaching Center at Stanford was named in his honor. The building is located in the Science and Engineering Quad, adjacent to the David Packard Electrical Engineering Building.[17]\n\n\n\n## Awards\n\n[edit]\n\n* member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1970)[18]\n* IEEE Founders Medal (1973)\n* Vermilye Medal (1975)\n* member, National Academy of Sciences (1977)[19]\n* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1981)[20]\n* member, American Philosophical Society (1981)[21]\n* National Medal of Science (1983)\n* National Inventors Hall of Fame (1992)[22]\n* Lemelson-MIT Prize Lifetime Achievement Award (1995)\n* The 3rd Annual Heinz Award Chairman's Medal (with David Packard) (1997)[23]\n* Entrepreneur Walk of Fame (2011)\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** David Packard (1995). *The HP Way*.

In 1916 the family moved to San Francisco after his father, Albion Walter Hewlett, took a similar position at Stanford Medical School, located at the time in San Francisco. He attended Lowell High School and was the 1929-1930 Battalion Commander of the school's Army JROTC program. He was accepted at Stanford University as a favor to his late father who died of a brain tumor in 1925.[1]\n\n\nHewlett received his bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 1934, a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1936, and a post-masters engineering degree in electrical engineering from Stanford in 1939. He joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity during his time at Stanford. Hewlett also had dyslexia, which caused him to struggle with reading and taking notes.[2]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Hewlett-Packard\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett attended undergraduate classes taught by Fred Terman at Stanford and became acquainted with David Packard. Packard and he began discussing forming a company in August 1937, and founded Hewlett-Packard Company as a partnership on January 1, 1939. A flip of a coin decided the ordering of their names.[3] Their first big breakthrough came when Disney purchased eight audio oscillators designed by Hewlett which were used for the production of the film *Fantasia*.[4]\n\n\nThe company incorporated in 1947 and tendered an initial public offering in 1957.[1] Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were proud of their company culture which came to be known as the HP Way. The HP Way is a corporate culture that claimed to be centered not only on making money but also on respecting and nurturing its employees. Hewlett was president of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1954.[5]\n\n\nHe was president of HP from 1964 to 1977 and served as CEO from 1968 to 1978, after which he was succeeded by John A. Young. He remained chairman of the executive committee until 1983, and then served as vice chairman of the board until 1987.\n\n\nA young Steve Jobs, then age 12,[6] called Hewlett (whose number was in the phone book) and requested any available parts for a frequency counter he was building. Hewlett, impressed with Jobs' initiative, offered him a summer job assembling frequency counters.[7] Jobs then considered HP one of the companies that he admired, regarding it among the handful of companies (Disney and Intel were the others) that were built “to last, not just to make money”.[8] Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple along with Jobs, unsuccessfully attempted five times to sell the Apple I computer to HP while working there. The early Apple computers were built with HP parts, under a legal release from HP.[9] Of the missed opportunity, Hewlett reportedly said, \"You win some, you lose some.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### Military service\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett served in the Army during World War II as a Signal Corps Officer. He then led the electronics section of the Development Division, a new part of the War Department Special Staff. After the war he was part of a special team that inspected Japanese Industry.[11]\n\n\n\n### Other companies\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett was a Director for Hexcel Products Incorporated (became Hexcel, founded by his wife Flora's brother in law Roscoe \"Bud\" Hughes) from 1956 to 1965, and worked on their executive committee. Hewlett served as a Director of Chase Manhattan Bank (became JPMorgan Chase) from 1969 to 1980. Hewlett was also elected to the board of directors for Chrysler Corporation in 1966, a position he held until 1983.[12]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting in the 1960s Hewlett committed much of his time and wealth towards numerous philanthropic causes. In 1966, William Hewlett and his wife Flora founded the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which became one of the largest private foundations in the United States. Aside from the foundation Hewlett gave millions of dollars to universities, schools, museums, non-profit organizations and other organizations. Stanford University was a large recipient of his philanthropy.[12]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett married Flora Lamson in 1939, and had 5 children with her: Eleanor, Walter, James, William and Mary. They had 12 grandchildren. His wife died in 1977. In 1978, Hewlett married Rosemary Kopmeier Bradford.\n\n\nHe was a committed conservationist and avid outdoorsman. As an amateur photographer and botanist, he took many photographs and samples of wildflowers. Some of these were donated to the California Academy of Sciences.[13]\n\n\nHewlett died of heart failure in Palo Alto, California on January 12, 2001 (aged 87),[14][15] and was interred at Los Gatos Memorial Park, San Jose, California.[16]\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, the William R. Hewlett Teaching Center at Stanford was named in his honor. The building is located in the Science and Engineering Quad, adjacent to the David Packard Electrical Engineering Building.[17]\n\n\n\n## Awards\n\n[edit]\n\n* member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1970)[18]\n* IEEE Founders Medal (1973)\n* Vermilye Medal (1975)\n* member, National Academy of Sciences (1977)[19]\n* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1981)[20]\n* member, American Philosophical Society (1981)[21]\n* National Medal of Science (1983)\n* National Inventors Hall of Fame (1992)[22]\n* Lemelson-MIT Prize Lifetime Achievement Award (1995)\n* The 3rd Annual Heinz Award Chairman's Medal (with David Packard) (1997)[23]\n* Entrepreneur Walk of Fame (2011)\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** David Packard (1995). *The HP Way*.

Liu is the founder of Lenovo, the world's largest personal computer vendor by unit sales.[1][2] He remains one of the leaders of the company.\n\n\n\n\n## Business activities\n\n[edit]\n\n### Lenovo\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Lenovo\n\nBy the early 1980s, Liu had achieved relative success as a computer scientist but still felt frustrated with his career. While his work on magnetic data storage was important, it lacked direct practical applications. He said, \"We were the top computer technology research organization in China. We developed the first electron-tube computer and the first transistor computer. But we only produced one of each. Then we went on to develop something different. The work was just filed away.\" Liu was also anxious about his economic circumstances; in 1984, Liu had a growing family but an income of only 100RMB per month.[3]\n\n\nLiu founded Lenovo (originally called Legend), in 1984 with a group of ten other engineers in Beijing with 200,000 yuan and an office roughly 20 square yards in size. Liu came up with the idea to start Lenovo in response to a lack of funding at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Liu's superior arranged for the academy to loan him and the other co-founders the afore-mentioned 200,000 yuan. Of this time, Liu said, \"It wasn't easy. The lowest thing you could do in the early '80s, as a scientist, was to go into business. China had a strict planned economy and there was barely room for a freewheeling company like ours.\"[3]\n\n\nLiu emphasized developing an effective working relationship with his superiors at the CAS from the very start. Despite its rhetoric of market-oriented reform, the Chinese government was reluctant to relax state control of the economy. Liu feared that his company might fail due to government micro-management. Liu also worried about dealing with local government officials and party cadres. He said, \"We were totally immersed in the environment of a planned economy. I didn't care that the investment was small, but I knew I must have control over finances, human resources and decision-making.\" Liu's superiors immediately granted his request for autonomy.[3]\n\n\nLenovo's founders, all scientists and engineers, faced difficulty from their lack of familiarity with market-oriented business practices, traditional Chinese ambivalence towards commerce, and anti-capitalist communist ideology. During this period many Chinese intellectuals felt that commerce was immoral and degrading. The fact that in the 1980s entrepreneurs were drawn from lower classes, and often dishonest as well, made the private sector even more unattractive. This was readily apparent to Liu and his collaborators due to their proximity to Zhongguancun, where the proliferation of fly-by-night electronics traders lead to the area being dubbed \"Swindlers Valley.\"[3]\n\n\nTheir first significant transaction, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon invested money in developing a circuit board that would allow IBM PCs to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. In 1990, Lenovo started to assemble and sell computers under its original brand name, Legend.[4][3]\n\n\nLenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" Lenovo's early difficulties were compounded by the fact that its staff had little business experience. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market,\" Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting—but also very dangerous,\" said Liu.[3]\n\n\nLiu received government permission to open a subsidiary in Hong Kong and was allowed to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, supported his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. In order to save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. In order to keep up appearances they rented hotel rooms for meetings.[3]\n\n\nLenovo became a publicly traded company after listing in Hong Kong in 1994, raising nearly US$30 million. Prior to Lenovo's IPO, many analysts were optimistic. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. During the first day of trading the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America, and Australia; expand and improve production and research and development; and increase working capital. Lenovo's Hong Kong and Mainland China business units conducted a merger and secondary offering in 1997.[3]\n\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"[3]\n\n\nLiu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration for Lenovo. In an interview with The Economist he said, \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo served as Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.[5] Speaking about Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"[4]\n\n\nLenovo's later takeover of IBM's personal computing business made him the first Chinese CEO to lead the takeover of a major American firm.[6] During an interview, Liu acknowledged the major risks involved with the IBM deal. \"We had three serious risks. Number one: After the acquisition, would clients buy from the new owner? Number two: Would employees continue to work for the new owner? Number three: Would there be potential conflicts between the Chinese management and the Western management?\"[6]\n\n\nBusiness ethics were a key challenge for Liu in establishing and expanding Lenovo. Liu says that at first he behaved \"like a kind of dictator\" and spent much time yelling. He had five corrupt executives imprisoned. Being late for a meeting could be punished by having to stand in silence before the group, a punishment that Liu accepted three times himself. Lenovo's culture gradually changed and Liu was able to relax his authoritarian style. Lenovo became an employer of choice for Chinese engineers and managers with overseas education.[5]\n\n\n\n### Legend Holdings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Legend Holdings\n\nIn June 2012, Liu stepped down as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo. In the years just prior to his resignation, Liu focused on improving Legend's growth, building-up its core assets, and conducting a public stock offering between 2014 and 2016. Legend's major assets include Lenovo, Legend Capital, a real-estate venture called Raycom, Digital China, and Hony Capital.[7][8]\n\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Liu said that his vision for Legend was for it \"to become an industry in its own right\" and that he wants it \"to become the top enterprise across industries...not only in China, but in the whole world.\" Liu said that he realized that his vision was extremely ambitious and may have to be left to his successors to implement.[9]\n\n\nLiu said in an interview with *Forbes* that he hoped to diversify away from IT-related businesses and that Legend Holding's assets would be mainly concentrated in information technology, real estate, services, coal processing, and agriculture. He said agriculture \"will become the next strategic development area for Legend Holdings.\" Liu said agriculture is just one part of what he sees as \"huge\" opportunities in sectors that cater to Chinese consumers. In the same interview, Liu said that Legend's focus would continue to remain on China. \"Whatever we do has to fit into something we are doing in China,\" said Liu when referring to plans for overseas investment.[8] Liu said in July 2012 that he plans to take Legend Holdings public with a listing in Hong Kong. Forbes speculated that Liu may be trying to \"create a Chinese version of General Electric.\"[10]\n\n\nLiu led an initial public offering for Legend on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2015. The offering received regulatory approval in June of that year. Liu said in an interview that he planned to float Legend's stock on a domestic Chinese exchange before his retirement.[11]\n\n\nIn 2019, Liu Chuanzhi, the 75-year-old founder of Lenovo Group, has resigned as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of the world's largest personal computer supplier.[12]\n\n\n\n### Joyvio\n\n[edit]\n\nJoyvio is Legend Holdings' vehicle for investment in the food industry. Legend has invested more than 1 billion yuan in Joyvio. Joyvio will pursue complete vertical integration from farming all the way to retailing. Joyvio's first product was blueberries. In November 2013, its product range was expanded to kiwifruit. The kiwifruit has been named \"Liu Kiwi,\" in honor of Liu Chuanzhi. Liu is responsible for Legend's move into food. Since 2011, Joyvio has acquired farms around the world including blueberry fields in Shandong and Chile and kiwifruit plantations in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, and Chile. The firm had plans to start selling cherries and grapes from the United States, Australia, and Chile by the end of 2013.[13]\n\n\nJoyvio took advantage of Legend's experience in information technology to set up a tracking system to ensure the quality and safety of its products. Customers can scan codes on its packages in order to find out what farm the product came from, who supervised production, what tests were performed, and information on soil and water quality. The company is also applying the OEM business model common in the technology industry in order to work effectively with small family farms and agricultural cooperatives. Joyvio holds training exercises with farmers in order to prepare them to deal quickly and effectively with bad weather.[13]\n\n\nJoyvio entered the imported wine business in late 2013.[14]\n\n\nJoyvio announced on 30 March 2014 that it had acquired a 60 per cent share of Hangzhou Longguan Tea Industrial Company for about 30 million yuan or about US$4.83 million. Longguan was previously a fully state-owned enterprise operating under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Longguan produces Hangzhou's famous Longjing tea. The company had sales of 32.45 million yuan in 2012. According to the company's annual report it has been growing 40 to 50 per cent per year. Joyvio has taken over day-to-day control of Longguan. Liu Chuanzhi said he aims to bring innovation and commercial methods to the tea industry. Liu said that Joyvio would invest in other well-known tea brands and related products.[15]\n\n\n\n### Other positions\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2013, Liu served as a senior advisor at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.\n\n\n\n## Education and early career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1962, Liu applied to be a military pilot and passed all the associated exams. Despite his father's revolutionary credentials, Liu was declared unfit for military service because a relative had been denounced as a rightist. In autumn of the same year, Liu entered the People's Liberation Army Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, now known as Xidian University. Due to his political and class background, Liu was deemed unsuitable for such sensitive subjects and assigned to study radar. During his studies Liu received an introduction to computing.[3]\n\n\nLiu was labeled an \"intellectual element\" during the Cultural Revolution. In 1966, he told his classmates that the revolution was a terrible idea and was sent to a state-owned rice farm near Macau in Guangdong as a result. From there he was sent to a farm in Hunan dedicated to reform through hard labor. Liu returned to Beijing where he took up a post in 1970 as an engineer-administrator at the Computer Institute that had earlier developed the Number 104, Number 109, and Number 111 mainframe computers. Liu worked on the development of the Number 757 mainframe computer. In 1984, he resigned to become a cadre in the personnel office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.[3] He remained there until he co-founded Legend in 1984.[5]\n\n\n\n## Political opinions\n\n[edit]\n\nUnlike many other Chinese business leaders, Liu has often spoken out on political issues. Liu has criticized others' tendency for silence. He said, \"when it comes to the inappropriate actions the government takes, businessmen don't have the courage or capacity to go against them; second, they lack the social responsibility to care for the whole world and what they do is to 'mind their own business.'\"[6]\n\n\nDuring an interview with *Caijing* in October 2012, he advocated for what he called \"elite selection\" of political leaders. He said, \"I'm not sure how practical it would be to have universal voting in the near future. I hope the country's leaders could be elected by the elites of the society.\" Liu is also deeply concerned with the rule of law. He said, \"My biggest worry is an unlawful world. I tell my employees to be careful all the time; don't disrespect the government or bribe anyone - even so, I'm still not at peace because there are always some corrupt individuals coming along to cause problems.\"[6]\n\n\nIn December 2013 Liu expressed optimism about economic reform in China. He said, \"Now if the market is to play a central role and the government only plays the referee, only you will decide if you are going to win the race.\"[16]\n\n\n\n## Public service and awards\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2002, Liu served as vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.[17] Since 2004, Liu has served as director of the Computer Technology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Liu was a delegate to the 16th National Congress of Chinese Communist Party and a deputy to the 9th and 10th sessions of the National People's Congress, China's highest legislative body.[18]\n\n\nLiu has been named \"Asian Businessman,\" one of the \"Global 25 Most Influential Business Leaders,\" and many other awards. He received Second National Technology Entrepreneurs Gold Award in 1990. He was named a Model Worker and Man of Reform in China, both in 1995. He was named one of the \"Ten Most Influential Men of the Commercial Sector\" in China in 1996. Liu was named one of the \"Stars of Asia\" by *BusinessWeek* magazine in 2000. In 2001, Liu was selected by *Time Magazine* as one of the \"25 Most Influential Global Executives.\" In 2012, *Forbes* named Liu one of the 10 most important business leaders in China.[10]\n\n\nLiu is a member of the China Entrepreneurs Club (CEC). The CEC was founded in 2006. Its purpose is to strengthen the sense of social responsibility among China's young entrepreneurs.[19]\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n[edit]\n\nLiu was born in 1945 in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, where his paternal grandfather was head of a traditional Chinese bank.[20][21] Liu's grandfather sent his father, Liu Gushu (柳谷书), to study in Shanghai. Liu Gushu abandoned scholarship and passed an exam for employment with the Bank of China. Liu Gushu was a \"patriotic capitalist\" who worked secretly for the Communist Party before the revolution of 1949. He became a senior executive with the Bank of China and later became a patent lawyer and chairman of the China Technology Licensing Company. Liu Chuanzhi's maternal grandfather served as finance minister for the warlord Sun Chuanfang.[3] After the Communist victory in 1949, Liu's family moved to Beijing, where they lived in a traditional courtyard home located on a hutong in the Wangfujing area. Liu's father continued his work with the Bank of China and joined the Chinese Communist Party. Liu's father developed a reputation as an honest and skilled banker.[3][22]\n\n\nLiu is married and has three children. Liu's daughter Liu Qing (柳青) is an alumna of Peking University. Liu Qing joined Didi Chuxing as chief operating officer in July 2014 after working at Goldman Sachs for 12 years.[23]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Mary Ma, former CFO of Lenovo\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Canalys Newsroom - Global PC shipments pass 340 million in 2021 and 2022 is set to be even stronger\".\n2. **^** \"Gartner Says Worldwide PC Shipments Declined 5% in Fourth Quarter of 2021 but Grew Nearly 10% for the Year\".\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** Ling, Zhijun (2006). *The Lenovo Affair*.

Liu is the founder of Lenovo, the world's largest personal computer vendor by unit sales.[1][2] He remains one of the leaders of the company.\n\n\n\n\n## Business activities\n\n[edit]\n\n### Lenovo\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Lenovo\n\nBy the early 1980s, Liu had achieved relative success as a computer scientist but still felt frustrated with his career. While his work on magnetic data storage was important, it lacked direct practical applications. He said, \"We were the top computer technology research organization in China. We developed the first electron-tube computer and the first transistor computer. But we only produced one of each. Then we went on to develop something different. The work was just filed away.\" Liu was also anxious about his economic circumstances; in 1984, Liu had a growing family but an income of only 100RMB per month.[3]\n\n\nLiu founded Lenovo (originally called Legend), in 1984 with a group of ten other engineers in Beijing with 200,000 yuan and an office roughly 20 square yards in size. Liu came up with the idea to start Lenovo in response to a lack of funding at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Liu's superior arranged for the academy to loan him and the other co-founders the afore-mentioned 200,000 yuan. Of this time, Liu said, \"It wasn't easy. The lowest thing you could do in the early '80s, as a scientist, was to go into business. China had a strict planned economy and there was barely room for a freewheeling company like ours.\"[3]\n\n\nLiu emphasized developing an effective working relationship with his superiors at the CAS from the very start. Despite its rhetoric of market-oriented reform, the Chinese government was reluctant to relax state control of the economy. Liu feared that his company might fail due to government micro-management. Liu also worried about dealing with local government officials and party cadres. He said, \"We were totally immersed in the environment of a planned economy. I didn't care that the investment was small, but I knew I must have control over finances, human resources and decision-making.\" Liu's superiors immediately granted his request for autonomy.[3]\n\n\nLenovo's founders, all scientists and engineers, faced difficulty from their lack of familiarity with market-oriented business practices, traditional Chinese ambivalence towards commerce, and anti-capitalist communist ideology. During this period many Chinese intellectuals felt that commerce was immoral and degrading. The fact that in the 1980s entrepreneurs were drawn from lower classes, and often dishonest as well, made the private sector even more unattractive. This was readily apparent to Liu and his collaborators due to their proximity to Zhongguancun, where the proliferation of fly-by-night electronics traders lead to the area being dubbed \"Swindlers Valley.\"[3]\n\n\nTheir first significant transaction, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon invested money in developing a circuit board that would allow IBM PCs to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. In 1990, Lenovo started to assemble and sell computers under its original brand name, Legend.[4][3]\n\n\nLenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" Lenovo's early difficulties were compounded by the fact that its staff had little business experience. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market,\" Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting—but also very dangerous,\" said Liu.[3]\n\n\nLiu received government permission to open a subsidiary in Hong Kong and was allowed to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, supported his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. In order to save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. In order to keep up appearances they rented hotel rooms for meetings.[3]\n\n\nLenovo became a publicly traded company after listing in Hong Kong in 1994, raising nearly US$30 million. Prior to Lenovo's IPO, many analysts were optimistic. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. During the first day of trading the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America, and Australia; expand and improve production and research and development; and increase working capital. Lenovo's Hong Kong and Mainland China business units conducted a merger and secondary offering in 1997.[3]\n\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"[3]\n\n\nLiu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration for Lenovo. In an interview with The Economist he said, \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo served as Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.[5] Speaking about Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"[4]\n\n\nLenovo's later takeover of IBM's personal computing business made him the first Chinese CEO to lead the takeover of a major American firm.[6] During an interview, Liu acknowledged the major risks involved with the IBM deal. \"We had three serious risks. Number one: After the acquisition, would clients buy from the new owner? Number two: Would employees continue to work for the new owner? Number three: Would there be potential conflicts between the Chinese management and the Western management?\"[6]\n\n\nBusiness ethics were a key challenge for Liu in establishing and expanding Lenovo. Liu says that at first he behaved \"like a kind of dictator\" and spent much time yelling. He had five corrupt executives imprisoned. Being late for a meeting could be punished by having to stand in silence before the group, a punishment that Liu accepted three times himself. Lenovo's culture gradually changed and Liu was able to relax his authoritarian style. Lenovo became an employer of choice for Chinese engineers and managers with overseas education.[5]\n\n\n\n### Legend Holdings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Legend Holdings\n\nIn June 2012, Liu stepped down as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo. In the years just prior to his resignation, Liu focused on improving Legend's growth, building-up its core assets, and conducting a public stock offering between 2014 and 2016. Legend's major assets include Lenovo, Legend Capital, a real-estate venture called Raycom, Digital China, and Hony Capital.[7][8]\n\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Liu said that his vision for Legend was for it \"to become an industry in its own right\" and that he wants it \"to become the top enterprise across industries...not only in China, but in the whole world.\" Liu said that he realized that his vision was extremely ambitious and may have to be left to his successors to implement.[9]\n\n\nLiu said in an interview with *Forbes* that he hoped to diversify away from IT-related businesses and that Legend Holding's assets would be mainly concentrated in information technology, real estate, services, coal processing, and agriculture. He said agriculture \"will become the next strategic development area for Legend Holdings.\" Liu said agriculture is just one part of what he sees as \"huge\" opportunities in sectors that cater to Chinese consumers. In the same interview, Liu said that Legend's focus would continue to remain on China. \"Whatever we do has to fit into something we are doing in China,\" said Liu when referring to plans for overseas investment.[8] Liu said in July 2012 that he plans to take Legend Holdings public with a listing in Hong Kong. Forbes speculated that Liu may be trying to \"create a Chinese version of General Electric.\"[10]\n\n\nLiu led an initial public offering for Legend on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2015. The offering received regulatory approval in June of that year. Liu said in an interview that he planned to float Legend's stock on a domestic Chinese exchange before his retirement.[11]\n\n\nIn 2019, Liu Chuanzhi, the 75-year-old founder of Lenovo Group, has resigned as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of the world's largest personal computer supplier.[12]\n\n\n\n### Joyvio\n\n[edit]\n\nJoyvio is Legend Holdings' vehicle for investment in the food industry. Legend has invested more than 1 billion yuan in Joyvio. Joyvio will pursue complete vertical integration from farming all the way to retailing. Joyvio's first product was blueberries. In November 2013, its product range was expanded to kiwifruit. The kiwifruit has been named \"Liu Kiwi,\" in honor of Liu Chuanzhi. Liu is responsible for Legend's move into food. Since 2011, Joyvio has acquired farms around the world including blueberry fields in Shandong and Chile and kiwifruit plantations in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, and Chile. The firm had plans to start selling cherries and grapes from the United States, Australia, and Chile by the end of 2013.[13]\n\n\nJoyvio took advantage of Legend's experience in information technology to set up a tracking system to ensure the quality and safety of its products. Customers can scan codes on its packages in order to find out what farm the product came from, who supervised production, what tests were performed, and information on soil and water quality. The company is also applying the OEM business model common in the technology industry in order to work effectively with small family farms and agricultural cooperatives. Joyvio holds training exercises with farmers in order to prepare them to deal quickly and effectively with bad weather.[13]\n\n\nJoyvio entered the imported wine business in late 2013.[14]\n\n\nJoyvio announced on 30 March 2014 that it had acquired a 60 per cent share of Hangzhou Longguan Tea Industrial Company for about 30 million yuan or about US$4.83 million. Longguan was previously a fully state-owned enterprise operating under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Longguan produces Hangzhou's famous Longjing tea. The company had sales of 32.45 million yuan in 2012. According to the company's annual report it has been growing 40 to 50 per cent per year. Joyvio has taken over day-to-day control of Longguan. Liu Chuanzhi said he aims to bring innovation and commercial methods to the tea industry. Liu said that Joyvio would invest in other well-known tea brands and related products.[15]\n\n\n\n### Other positions\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2013, Liu served as a senior advisor at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.\n\n\n\n## Education and early career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1962, Liu applied to be a military pilot and passed all the associated exams. Despite his father's revolutionary credentials, Liu was declared unfit for military service because a relative had been denounced as a rightist. In autumn of the same year, Liu entered the People's Liberation Army Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, now known as Xidian University. Due to his political and class background, Liu was deemed unsuitable for such sensitive subjects and assigned to study radar. During his studies Liu received an introduction to computing.[3]\n\n\nLiu was labeled an \"intellectual element\" during the Cultural Revolution. In 1966, he told his classmates that the revolution was a terrible idea and was sent to a state-owned rice farm near Macau in Guangdong as a result. From there he was sent to a farm in Hunan dedicated to reform through hard labor. Liu returned to Beijing where he took up a post in 1970 as an engineer-administrator at the Computer Institute that had earlier developed the Number 104, Number 109, and Number 111 mainframe computers. Liu worked on the development of the Number 757 mainframe computer. In 1984, he resigned to become a cadre in the personnel office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.[3] He remained there until he co-founded Legend in 1984.[5]\n\n\n\n## Political opinions\n\n[edit]\n\nUnlike many other Chinese business leaders, Liu has often spoken out on political issues. Liu has criticized others' tendency for silence. He said, \"when it comes to the inappropriate actions the government takes, businessmen don't have the courage or capacity to go against them; second, they lack the social responsibility to care for the whole world and what they do is to 'mind their own business.'\"[6]\n\n\nDuring an interview with *Caijing* in October 2012, he advocated for what he called \"elite selection\" of political leaders. He said, \"I'm not sure how practical it would be to have universal voting in the near future. I hope the country's leaders could be elected by the elites of the society.\" Liu is also deeply concerned with the rule of law. He said, \"My biggest worry is an unlawful world. I tell my employees to be careful all the time; don't disrespect the government or bribe anyone - even so, I'm still not at peace because there are always some corrupt individuals coming along to cause problems.\"[6]\n\n\nIn December 2013 Liu expressed optimism about economic reform in China. He said, \"Now if the market is to play a central role and the government only plays the referee, only you will decide if you are going to win the race.\"[16]\n\n\n\n## Public service and awards\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2002, Liu served as vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.[17] Since 2004, Liu has served as director of the Computer Technology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Liu was a delegate to the 16th National Congress of Chinese Communist Party and a deputy to the 9th and 10th sessions of the National People's Congress, China's highest legislative body.[18]\n\n\nLiu has been named \"Asian Businessman,\" one of the \"Global 25 Most Influential Business Leaders,\" and many other awards. He received Second National Technology Entrepreneurs Gold Award in 1990. He was named a Model Worker and Man of Reform in China, both in 1995. He was named one of the \"Ten Most Influential Men of the Commercial Sector\" in China in 1996. Liu was named one of the \"Stars of Asia\" by *BusinessWeek* magazine in 2000. In 2001, Liu was selected by *Time Magazine* as one of the \"25 Most Influential Global Executives.\" In 2012, *Forbes* named Liu one of the 10 most important business leaders in China.[10]\n\n\nLiu is a member of the China Entrepreneurs Club (CEC). The CEC was founded in 2006. Its purpose is to strengthen the sense of social responsibility among China's young entrepreneurs.[19]\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n[edit]\n\nLiu was born in 1945 in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, where his paternal grandfather was head of a traditional Chinese bank.[20][21] Liu's grandfather sent his father, Liu Gushu (柳谷书), to study in Shanghai. Liu Gushu abandoned scholarship and passed an exam for employment with the Bank of China. Liu Gushu was a \"patriotic capitalist\" who worked secretly for the Communist Party before the revolution of 1949. He became a senior executive with the Bank of China and later became a patent lawyer and chairman of the China Technology Licensing Company. Liu Chuanzhi's maternal grandfather served as finance minister for the warlord Sun Chuanfang.[3] After the Communist victory in 1949, Liu's family moved to Beijing, where they lived in a traditional courtyard home located on a hutong in the Wangfujing area. Liu's father continued his work with the Bank of China and joined the Chinese Communist Party. Liu's father developed a reputation as an honest and skilled banker.[3][22]\n\n\nLiu is married and has three children. Liu's daughter Liu Qing (柳青) is an alumna of Peking University. Liu Qing joined Didi Chuxing as chief operating officer in July 2014 after working at Goldman Sachs for 12 years.[23]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Mary Ma, former CFO of Lenovo\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Canalys Newsroom - Global PC shipments pass 340 million in 2021 and 2022 is set to be even stronger\".\n2. **^** \"Gartner Says Worldwide PC Shipments Declined 5% in Fourth Quarter of 2021 but Grew Nearly 10% for the Year\".\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** Ling, Zhijun (2006). *The Lenovo Affair*.

He was adopted shortly after his birth. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Shankland, Stephen (October 23, 2011). \"'Steve Jobs' biography: A wealth of detail\". *CNET*.

Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in the company.[113] The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs's comeback event,[114] a lavish invitation-only gala launch event[115] that was described as a multimedia extravaganza.[116] The celebration was held at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, California, on Wednesday, October 12, 1988.

Brennan suggested the name \"Lisa\" which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name \"Lisa\" while he \"was also publicly denying paternity\". She would discover later that during this time, Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name (his first choice was \"Claire\" after St. Clare). She stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby's name for a computer and he hid the plans from her. Jobs worked with his team to come up with the phrase, \"Local Integrated Software Architecture\" as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa.[85] Decades later, however, Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that \"obviously, it was named for my daughter\".[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n200. **^** Helft, Miguel (January 17, 2010). \"Apple Says Steve Jobs Will Take a New Medical Leave\". *The New York Times*.

He was adopted shortly after his birth. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Shankland, Stephen (October 23, 2011). \"'Steve Jobs' biography: A wealth of detail\". *CNET*.

Under Jobs's guidance, the company increased sales significantly with the introduction of the iMac and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for Apple. At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Jobs officially dropped the \"interim\" modifier from his title at Apple and became permanent CEO.[143] Jobs quipped at the time that he would be using the title \"iCEO\".[144]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNeXT\n |\n| --- |\n| Corporate directors | * Steve Jobs\n* Ross Perot\n* John Patrick Crecine\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Team members | * Susan Barnes\n* George Crow\n* Joanna Hoffman\n* Steve Jobs\n* Susan Kare\n* Rich Page\n* Bud Tribble\n |\n| Hardware products | * NeXT Computer\n* NeXTcube\n* NeXTcube Turbo\n* NeXTstation\n* NeXTdimension\n* NeXT MegaPixel Display\n* NeXT Laser Printer\n |\n| Software products | * NeXTSTEP\n* OpenStep\n* WebObjects\n* Interface Builder\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves, lanyards, and packages.

He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor in 2011, at the age of 56, with Tim Cook succeeding him as CEO of Apple.

To fund the first batch, Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator and Jobs sold his Volkswagen van.[69][70] Later that year, computer retailer Paul Terrell purchased 50 fully assembled Apple I units for $500 each.[71][72] Eventually about 200 Apple I computers were produced in total.[73]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External image |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) Jobs and Steve Wozniak with an Apple I circuit board, c. 1976. |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSculley's and Jobs's respective visions for the company greatly differed. Sculley favored open architecture computers like the Apple II, targeting education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to IBM. Jobs wanted the company to focus on the closed architecture Macintosh as a business alternative to the IBM PC. President and CEO Sculley had little control over chairman of the board Jobs's Macintosh division; it and the Apple II division operated like separate companies, duplicating services.[106] Although its products provided 85% of Apple's sales in early 1985, the company's January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or employees. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n290. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Isaacson 2011, p. 257.\n291. **^** Conversations: Malek Jandali, Mona Simpson, & James Gelvin Archived April 14, 2018, at the Wayback Machine (UCLA Hammer Museum event). *Hammer.UCLA.edu*.

A year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon. Eventually, Jobs attracted the attention of billionaire Ross Perot, who invested heavily in the company.[113] The NeXT computer was shown to the world in what was considered Jobs's comeback event,[114] a lavish invitation-only gala launch event[115] that was described as a multimedia extravaganza.[116] The celebration was held at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, San Francisco, California, on Wednesday, October 12, 1988.

While distant, Jobs worked with her on a name for the baby, which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket. Brennan suggested the name \"Lisa\" which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name \"Lisa\" while he \"was also publicly denying paternity\". She would discover later that during this time, Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name (his first choice was \"Claire\" after St. Clare). She stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby's name for a computer and he hid the plans from her. Jobs worked with his team to come up with the phrase, \"Local Integrated Software Architecture\" as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa.[85] Decades later, however, Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that \"obviously, it was named for my daughter\".[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n200. **^** Helft, Miguel (January 17, 2010). \"Apple Says Steve Jobs Will Take a New Medical Leave\". *The New York Times*.
