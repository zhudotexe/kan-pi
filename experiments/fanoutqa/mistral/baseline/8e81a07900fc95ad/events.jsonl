A concussion substitution did not count towards a team's quota of regular substitutions.[39] Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand suffered a concussion in his country's opening match against England and was replaced by Hossein Hosseini.

It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]\n\n\nThis tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December instead of in the traditional months of May, June, or July.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations.

Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of the first two World Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting rights of the 2002 World Cup in 1996 without ever having qualified for the finals, although they qualified for the 1998 edition. Of the eight stadiums used in the tournament, six were located in the Doha metropolitan area, making it the first World Cup since 1930 in which most of the stadiums were in one city. While this decreased the distance that fans and players needed to commute, Qatar itself struggled to accommodate the numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space.[319]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** \"From zeroes to heroes – How the lowest ranked team in the World Cup stand a chance\". *SBS*. 13 September 2022.

Frappart then officially became the first-ever female referee to officiate a World Cup match when she worked the Costa Rica vs Germany match in Group E on 1 December.[122]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n302. **^** McTague, Tom (19 November 2022). \"The Qatar World Cup Exposes Soccer's Shame\". *The Atlantic*.

The arrests continued in the United States, where several FIFA officers were arrested, and FIFA buildings were raided. The arrests were made on the information of at least a $150 million corruption and bribery scandal.[379] From those arrested, $40 million was forfeited under guilty pleas.[380] In 2022, the president of the El Salvador soccer association, Reynaldo Vasquez, was sentenced to 16 months in prison in connection to over $350,000 in bribes.[381]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009.

Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids.[385] At the end of the investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report. The FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge, Hans Joachim Eckert, who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations, stating that Qatar \"pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways\" but did not \"compromise the integrity\" of the overall bid process.[386] Michael Garcia reacted almost immediately, stating that the report is \"materially incomplete\" and contains \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\".[386]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe final draw was held at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center in Doha, Qatar,[108] on 1 April 2022,[109] 19:00 AST, prior to the completion of qualification.

Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of the first two World Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting rights of the 2002 World Cup in 1996 without ever having qualified for the finals, although they qualified for the 1998 edition. Of the eight stadiums used in the tournament, six were located in the Doha metropolitan area, making it the first World Cup since 1930 in which most of the stadiums were in one city. While this decreased the distance that fans and players needed to commute, Qatar itself struggled to accommodate the numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space.[319]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** \"From zeroes to heroes – How the lowest ranked team in the World Cup stand a chance\". *SBS*. 13 September 2022.

National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register interest.[41] Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico withdrew from proceedings,[42][43] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the bid.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBefore submitting their final squad for the tournament, teams named a provisional squad of up to 55 players. Teams were required to have their 55-player roster submitted to FIFA by 21 October.[103] Teams were required to name their final squads by 13 November.[104] In August 2022, FIFA increased the final squad size to 26 players from a total of 23 players at the 2018 edition.[105] All teams had a total of 26 players in their final squads except for France and Iran, who chose 25 players.[106][107]\n\n\n\n### Draw[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended Qatar's decision to host the tournament.[355] Others have asserted that Qatar has a better human rights record than Russia and China, which were subjected to less harsh criticism for the same problems when hosting important athletic events in the years before the tournament.[356]\n\n\n\n### Move to November and December[edit]\n\n\nOwing to the climate in Qatar, concerns were expressed over holding the World Cup in its traditional time frame of June and July.[5] In October 2013, a task force was commissioned to consider alternative dates and report after the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.[357] On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022,[358] to avoid the summer heat and also avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, the 2022 Winter Paralympics in March and Ramadan in April.[359][360]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n265. **^** \"Fine Hygienic Holding Wins License To Market FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Fine Facial Tissues\".

It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938. Host nation  Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, and had qualified for the last three World Cups. Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify. The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.[61] The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.[62]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.[59] Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Pot 1\n | Pot 2\n | Pot 3\n | Pot 4\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Russia (65) *(hosts)*![](image) Germany (1)![](image) Brazil (2)![](image) Belgium (3)![](image) Portugal (4)![](image) Argentina (5)![](image) Poland (6)![](image) France (7)\n | ![](image) Spain (8)![](image) Peru (10)![](image)  Switzerland (11)![](image) England (12)![](image) Colombia (13)![](image) Mexico (16)![](image) Uruguay (17)![](image) Croatia (18)\n | ![](image) Denmark (19)![](image) Iceland (21)![](image) Costa Rica (22)![](image) Sweden (25)![](image) Tunisia (28)![](image) Egypt (30)![](image) Senegal (32)![](image) Iran (34)\n | ![](image) Serbia (38)![](image) Nigeria (41)![](image) Australia (43)![](image) Japan (44)![](image) Morocco (48)![](image) Panama (49)![](image) South Korea (62)![](image) Saudi Arabia (63)\n |\n\n\n### Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup squads\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England's FA to boycott the tournament.[35] They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.[36] FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.[37] Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n | **UEFA** (14)\n* ![](image) Belgium (3)\n* ![](image) Croatia (20)\n* ![](image) Denmark (joint 12)\n* ![](image) England (joint 12)\n* ![](image) France (7)\n* ![](image) Germany (1)\n* ![](image) Iceland (22)\n* ![](image) Poland (8)\n* ![](image) Portugal (4)\n* ![](image) Russia (70) (hosts)\n* ![](image) Serbia (34)\n* ![](image) Spain (10)\n* ![](image) Sweden (24)\n* ![](image)  Switzerland (6)\n | ![](image)Qualified\n Did not qualify\n Disqualified\n Not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n### Draw[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\n![](image)Italian World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro in Moscow at the 2018 World Cup draw\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.[63][64] The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n281. **^** \"McDonald's looking ahead to 2018\". *FIFA.com*.

Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.[89]\n\n\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10.[90] He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".[91]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup,[252] and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro),[253] the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.[254][255][256]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Russian bid personnel celebrate the awarding of the 2018 World Cup to Russia on 2 December 2010.\n![](image)The 100-ruble commemorative banknote celebrates the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, and the first time they were held in Eastern Europe. At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938. Host nation  Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, and had qualified for the last three World Cups. Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify. The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments.[61] The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\n\n\nNote: Numbers in parentheses indicate positions in the FIFA World Rankings at the time of the tournament.[62]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup.[59] Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; and Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Pot 1\n | Pot 2\n | Pot 3\n | Pot 4\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Russia (65) *(hosts)*![](image) Germany (1)![](image) Brazil (2)![](image) Belgium (3)![](image) Portugal (4)![](image) Argentina (5)![](image) Poland (6)![](image) France (7)\n | ![](image) Spain (8)![](image) Peru (10)![](image)  Switzerland (11)![](image) England (12)![](image) Colombia (13)![](image) Mexico (16)![](image) Uruguay (17)![](image) Croatia (18)\n | ![](image) Denmark (19)![](image) Iceland (21)![](image) Costa Rica (22)![](image) Sweden (25)![](image) Tunisia (28)![](image) Egypt (30)![](image) Senegal (32)![](image) Iran (34)\n | ![](image) Serbia (38)![](image) Nigeria (41)![](image) Australia (43)![](image) Japan (44)![](image) Morocco (48)![](image) Panama (49)![](image) South Korea (62)![](image) Saudi Arabia (63)\n |\n\n\n### Squads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup squads\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England's FA to boycott the tournament.[35] They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win.[36] FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash.[37] Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n | **UEFA** (14)\n* ![](image) Belgium (3)\n* ![](image) Croatia (20)\n* ![](image) Denmark (joint 12)\n* ![](image) England (joint 12)\n* ![](image) France (7)\n* ![](image) Germany (1)\n* ![](image) Iceland (22)\n* ![](image) Poland (8)\n* ![](image) Portugal (4)\n* ![](image) Russia (70) (hosts)\n* ![](image) Serbia (34)\n* ![](image) Spain (10)\n* ![](image) Sweden (24)\n* ![](image)  Switzerland (6)\n | ![](image)Qualified\n Did not qualify\n Disqualified\n Not a FIFA member\n\n\n |\n\n### Draw[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 FIFA World Cup seeding\n\n![](image)Italian World Cup winner Fabio Cannavaro in Moscow at the 2018 World Cup draw\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow.[63][64] The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n281. **^** \"McDonald's looking ahead to 2018\". *FIFA.com*.

In preparation for this, the teams were organised into four pots with the seven highest-ranked teams joining host nation Brazil in the seeded pot.[19] As with the previous tournaments, FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations.[20][21] The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia, during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cup-winning players.[22][23] Under the draw procedure, one randomly drawn team – Italy – was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams.[24]\n\n\n\n### Officials[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup officials\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2014 FIFA World Cup stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| * Mineirão (Belo Horizonte)\n* Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha (Brasília)\n* Arena Pantanal (Cuiabá)\n* Arena da Baixada (Curitiba)\n* Castelão (Fortaleza)\n* Arena da Amazônia (Manaus)\n* Arena das Dunas (Natal)\n* Beira-Rio (Porto Alegre)\n* Arena Pernambuco (Recife)\n* Maracanã (Rio de Janeiro)\n* Arena Fonte Nova (Salvador)\n* Arena Corinthians (São Paulo)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nReferees at the 2014 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| AFC | * Ravshan Irmatov\n* Yuichi Nishimura\n* Nawaf Shukralla\n* Ben Williams\n |\n| CAF | * Noumandiez Doué\n* Bakary Gassama\n* Djamel Haimoudi\n |\n| CONCACAF | * Joel Aguilar\n* Mark Geiger\n* Marco Antonio Rodríguez\n |\n| CONMEBOL | * Enrique Osses\n* Néstor Pitana\n* Wilmar Roldán\n* Sandro Ricci\n* Carlos Vera\n |\n| OFC | * Peter O'Leary\n |\n| UEFA | * Felix Brych\n* Cüneyt Çakır\n* Jonas Eriksson\n* Björn Kuipers\n* Milorad Mažić\n* Pedro Proença\n* Nicola Rizzoli\n* Carlos Velasco Carballo\n* Howard Webb\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **2014 FIFA World Cup** was the 20th FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for men's national football teams organised by FIFA.

It was the second time that Brazil staged the competition, the first being in 1950, and the fifth time that it was held in South America.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender Álvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious.[156] The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.[157]\n\n\nSecond, in the Final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli whether the match he was playing in was the World Cup Final.[158]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup\n* FIFA World Cup\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 31 January 2014, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team,[32] having earlier circulated a brochure of 84 prospective locations.[35] Most teams opted to stay in the Southeast Region of Brazil, with only eight teams choosing other regions; five teams (Croatia, Germany, Ghana, Greece and Switzerland) opted to stay in the Northeast Region and three teams (Ecuador, South Korea and Spain) opted to stay in the South Region. None opted to stay in the North Region or the Central-West Region.[36] Campo Bahia, the base camp of the eventual champion Germany, attracted much interest.[37]\n\n\n\n\n\n| National squads' base camps\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Passarinho, Nathalia; Matoso, Filipe (14 July 2014). \"Em balanço da Copa, Dilma diz que Brasil derrotou prognósticos 'terríveis'\". *G1* (in Portuguese).

Uruguay were eliminated in the round of 16, and France exited in the quarter-finals.

Prominent examples were the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and São Paulo's Vale do Anhangabaú.[38][39] The first official event took place on Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on 8 June 2014.[40]\n\n\n\n## Innovations[edit]\n\n\n### Technologies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930.[67] The group stage produced a total of 136 goals (an average of 2.83 goals per match), nine fewer than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament.[68] This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since the 32-team system was implemented in 1998[69] and the largest average in a group stage since 1958.[70] World Cup holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy's from the 1950 tournament.[71] Spain also became the fourth nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Italy in 1950 (and again in 2010), Brazil in 1966, and France in 2002.[72] For the first time, two teams from Africa advanced to the second round, a feat that would be repeated in the 2022 tournament.\n\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe marketing of the 2014 FIFA World Cup included sale of tickets, support from sponsors and promotion through events that utilise the symbols and songs of the tournament. Popular merchandise included items featuring the official mascot as well as an official video game that has been developed by EA Sports.[118] As a partner of the German Football Association, part of German major airline Lufthansa's fleet was branded \"Fanhansa\" for the time being. Branded planes flew the Germany national team, media representatives and football fans to Brazil.[119]\n\n\nThe Sony Xperia Z2 was dubbed the \"official smartphone of the 2014 FIFA World Cup\".[120]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe sponsors of the 2014 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.[121]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n145. **^** Peck, Brooks (29 May 2013). \"Sepp Blatter, Brazil president Dilma booed at Confederations Cup opening ceremony\". *Sports.yahoo.com*.

The water-based spray, which disappears within minutes of application, can be used to mark a ten-yard line for the defending team during a free kick and also to draw where the ball is to be placed for a free kick.[45]\n\n\nThe Adidas Brazuca was the official match ball of the 2014 FIFA World Cup[46][47][48][49] and was supplied by Forward Sports of Sialkot, Pakistan.[46] Adidas created a new design of ball after criticisms of the Adidas Jabulani used in the previous World Cup. The number of panels was reduced to six, with the panels being thermally bonded. This created a ball with increased consistency and aerodynamics compared to its predecessor. Furthermore, Adidas underwent an extensive testing process lasting more than two years to produce a ball that would meet the approval of football professionals.\n\n\n\n### Cooling breaks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** Setterlund, Carl (28 June 2014). \"Colombia topples Uruguay to reach first World Cup quarterfinals\".

In preparation for this, the teams were organised into four pots with the seven highest-ranked teams joining host nation Brazil in the seeded pot.[19] As with the previous tournaments, FIFA aimed to create groups which maximised geographic separation and therefore the unseeded teams were arranged into pots based on geographic considerations.[20][21] The draw took place on 6 December 2013 at the Costa do Sauípe resort in Bahia, during which the teams were drawn by various past World Cup-winning players.[22][23] Under the draw procedure, one randomly drawn team – Italy – was firstly relocated from Pot 4 to Pot 2 to create four equal pots of eight teams.[24]\n\n\n\n### Officials[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 FIFA World Cup officials\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2014 FIFA World Cup stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| * Mineirão (Belo Horizonte)\n* Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha (Brasília)\n* Arena Pantanal (Cuiabá)\n* Arena da Baixada (Curitiba)\n* Castelão (Fortaleza)\n* Arena da Amazônia (Manaus)\n* Arena das Dunas (Natal)\n* Beira-Rio (Porto Alegre)\n* Arena Pernambuco (Recife)\n* Maracanã (Rio de Janeiro)\n* Arena Fonte Nova (Salvador)\n* Arena Corinthians (São Paulo)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nReferees at the 2014 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| AFC | * Ravshan Irmatov\n* Yuichi Nishimura\n* Nawaf Shukralla\n* Ben Williams\n |\n| CAF | * Noumandiez Doué\n* Bakary Gassama\n* Djamel Haimoudi\n |\n| CONCACAF | * Joel Aguilar\n* Mark Geiger\n* Marco Antonio Rodríguez\n |\n| CONMEBOL | * Enrique Osses\n* Néstor Pitana\n* Wilmar Roldán\n* Sandro Ricci\n* Carlos Vera\n |\n| OFC | * Peter O'Leary\n |\n| UEFA | * Felix Brych\n* Cüneyt Çakır\n* Jonas Eriksson\n* Björn Kuipers\n* Milorad Mažić\n* Pedro Proença\n* Nicola Rizzoli\n* Carlos Velasco Carballo\n* Howard Webb\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe **2014 FIFA World Cup** was the 20th FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for men's national football teams organised by FIFA.

It was the second time that Brazil staged the competition, the first being in 1950, and the fifth time that it was held in South America.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the tournament, FIFA received significant criticism for the way head injuries are handled during matches. Two incidents in particular attracted the most attention. First, in a group stage match, after Uruguayan defender Álvaro Pereira received a blow to the head, he lay unconscious.[156] The Uruguayan doctor signaled for the player to be substituted, but he returned to the match. The incident drew criticism from the professional players' union FIFPro, and from Michel D'Hooghe, a member of the FIFA executive board and chairman of its medical committee.[157]\n\n\nSecond, in the Final, German midfielder Christoph Kramer received a blow to the head from a collision in the 14th minute, but returned to the match before collapsing in the 31st minute. During that time, Kramer was disoriented and confused, and asked the referee Nicola Rizzoli whether the match he was playing in was the World Cup Final.[158]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup\n* FIFA World Cup\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 31 January 2014, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team,[32] having earlier circulated a brochure of 84 prospective locations.[35] Most teams opted to stay in the Southeast Region of Brazil, with only eight teams choosing other regions; five teams (Croatia, Germany, Ghana, Greece and Switzerland) opted to stay in the Northeast Region and three teams (Ecuador, South Korea and Spain) opted to stay in the South Region. None opted to stay in the North Region or the Central-West Region.[36] Campo Bahia, the base camp of the eventual champion Germany, attracted much interest.[37]\n\n\n\n\n\n| National squads' base camps\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Passarinho, Nathalia; Matoso, Filipe (14 July 2014). \"Em balanço da Copa, Dilma diz que Brasil derrotou prognósticos 'terríveis'\". *G1* (in Portuguese).

Uruguay were eliminated in the round of 16, and France exited in the quarter-finals.

Prominent examples were the Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which already held a Fan Fest in 2010, and São Paulo's Vale do Anhangabaú.[38][39] The first official event took place on Iracema Beach, in Fortaleza, on 8 June 2014.[40]\n\n\n\n## Innovations[edit]\n\n\n### Technologies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first drawn (and goalless) match did not occur until the 13th match of the tournament, between Iran and Nigeria: a drought longer than any World Cup since 1930.[67] The group stage produced a total of 136 goals (an average of 2.83 goals per match), nine fewer than were scored during the entire 2010 tournament.[68] This is the largest number of goals in the group stage since the 32-team system was implemented in 1998[69] and the largest average in a group stage since 1958.[70] World Cup holders Spain were eliminated after only two games, the quickest exit for the defending champions since Italy's from the 1950 tournament.[71] Spain also became the fourth nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Italy in 1950 (and again in 2010), Brazil in 1966, and France in 2002.[72] For the first time, two teams from Africa advanced to the second round, a feat that would be repeated in the 2022 tournament.\n\n\n\n### Group A[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe marketing of the 2014 FIFA World Cup included sale of tickets, support from sponsors and promotion through events that utilise the symbols and songs of the tournament. Popular merchandise included items featuring the official mascot as well as an official video game that has been developed by EA Sports.[118] As a partner of the German Football Association, part of German major airline Lufthansa's fleet was branded \"Fanhansa\" for the time being. Branded planes flew the Germany national team, media representatives and football fans to Brazil.[119]\n\n\nThe Sony Xperia Z2 was dubbed the \"official smartphone of the 2014 FIFA World Cup\".[120]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe sponsors of the 2014 World Cup are divided into three categories: FIFA Partners, FIFA World Cup Sponsors and National Supporters.[121]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n145. **^** Peck, Brooks (29 May 2013). \"Sepp Blatter, Brazil president Dilma booed at Confederations Cup opening ceremony\". *Sports.yahoo.com*.

The water-based spray, which disappears within minutes of application, can be used to mark a ten-yard line for the defending team during a free kick and also to draw where the ball is to be placed for a free kick.[45]\n\n\nThe Adidas Brazuca was the official match ball of the 2014 FIFA World Cup[46][47][48][49] and was supplied by Forward Sports of Sialkot, Pakistan.[46] Adidas created a new design of ball after criticisms of the Adidas Jabulani used in the previous World Cup. The number of panels was reduced to six, with the panels being thermally bonded. This created a ball with increased consistency and aerodynamics compared to its predecessor. Furthermore, Adidas underwent an extensive testing process lasting more than two years to produce a ball that would meet the approval of football professionals.\n\n\n\n### Cooling breaks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** Setterlund, Carl (28 June 2014). \"Colombia topples Uruguay to reach first World Cup quarterfinals\".

It took place in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July 2010. The bidding process for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations. In 2004, the international football federation, FIFA, selected South Africa over Egypt and Morocco to become the first African nation to host the finals.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe winning bid was announced by FIFA president Sepp Blatter at a media conference on 15 May 2004 in Zürich; in the first round of voting, South Africa received 14 votes, Morocco received 10 votes and Egypt no votes. South Africa, which had narrowly failed to win the right to host the 2006 event, was thus awarded the right to host the tournament.[12] Campaigning for South Africa to be granted host status, Nelson Mandela had previously spoken of the importance of football in his life, stating that while incarcerated in Robben Island prison playing football \"made us feel alive and triumphant despite the situation we found ourselves in\".[13] With South Africa winning their bid, an emotional Mandela raised the FIFA World Cup Trophy.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** \"Theron, Beckham and Gebrselassie to star at the Final Draw on 4 December\". *FIFA.com*.

In the second leg of the play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee, handled the ball in the lead up to a late goal, which enabled France to qualify ahead of Ireland, sparking widespread comment and debate. FIFA rejected a request from the Football Association of Ireland to replay the match,[23] and Ireland later withdrew a request to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant.[24][25] As a result, FIFA announced a review into the use of technology or extra officials at the highest level, but decided against the widely expected fast-tracking of goal-line referee's assistants for the South African tournament.[26]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe FIFA Organising Committee approved the procedure for the final draw on 2 December 2009. The seeding was based on the October 2009 FIFA World Ranking and seven squads joined hosts South Africa as seeded teams for the final draw. No two teams from the same confederation were to be drawn in the same group, except allowing a maximum of two European teams in a group.[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFIFA President Sepp Blatter took the unusual step of apologising to England and Mexico for the decisions that went against them, saying: \"Yesterday I spoke to the two federations directly concerned by referees' mistakes [...] I apologised to England and Mexico. The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it.\"[85] Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: \"We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting.\"[85] Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.[85]\n\n\n\n26 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2010 FIFA World Cup| * isiZulu: *iNdebe Yomhlaba Ye-FIFA ka-2010*\n* Afrikaans: *FIFA Sokker-Wêreldbekertoernooi in 2010*\n* isiXhosa: *2010 FIFuRoni da Futboll*\n* Northern Sotho: *Mogopo wa Lefase wa FIFA wa 2010*\n* Sesotho: *Mohope wa lefatse wa FIFA 2010*\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)*Ke Nako* (Tswana and Sotho)*It's time.

Blazer stated, \"I and others on the FIFA executive committee agreed to accept bribes in conjunction with the selection of South Africa as the host nation for the 2010 World Cup.\"[20][21]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2015, *The Daily Telegraph* reported that Morocco had actually won the vote, but South Africa was awarded the tournament instead.[22]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Spain's Joan Capdevila holding the FIFA World Cup Trophy after defeating the Netherlands in the final\nThe **2010 FIFA World Cup**, also branded as **South Africa 2010**, was the 19th FIFA World Cup, the world championship for men's national football teams. It took place in South Africa from 11 June to 11 July 2010. The bidding process for hosting the tournament finals was open only to African nations. In 2004, the international football federation, FIFA, selected South Africa over Egypt and Morocco to become the first African nation to host the finals.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe winning bid was announced by FIFA president Sepp Blatter at a media conference on 15 May 2004 in Zürich; in the first round of voting, South Africa received 14 votes, Morocco received 10 votes and Egypt no votes. South Africa, which had narrowly failed to win the right to host the 2006 event, was thus awarded the right to host the tournament.[12] Campaigning for South Africa to be granted host status, Nelson Mandela had previously spoken of the importance of football in his life, stating that while incarcerated in Robben Island prison playing football \"made us feel alive and triumphant despite the situation we found ourselves in\".[13] With South Africa winning their bid, an emotional Mandela raised the FIFA World Cup Trophy.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** \"Theron, Beckham and Gebrselassie to star at the Final Draw on 4 December\". *FIFA.com*.

Schmidt, and, reportedly, some FIFA executives expressed concern over the planning, organisation, and pace of South Africa's preparations.[15][17] FIFA officials repeatedly expressed their confidence in South Africa as host, stating that a contingency plan existed only to cover natural catastrophes, as had been in place at previous FIFA World Cups.[18]\n\n\n\n### Bribery and corruption[edit]\n\n\nOn 28 May 2015, media covering the 2015 FIFA corruption case reported that high-ranking officials from the South African bid committee had secured the right to host the World Cup by paying US$10 million in bribes to then-FIFA Vice President Jack Warner and to other FIFA Executive Committee members.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts § 2010 FIFA World Cup\n\nAfrica was chosen as the host for the 2010 World Cup as part of a short-lived rotation policy, abandoned in 2007,[11] to rotate the event among football confederations. Five African nations placed bids to host the 2010 World Cup: Egypt, Morocco, South Africa and a joint bid from Libya and Tunisia.\n\n\nFollowing the decision of the FIFA Executive Committee not to allow co-hosted tournaments, Tunisia withdrew from the bidding process. The committee also decided not to consider Libya's solo bid as it no longer met all the stipulations laid down in the official *List of Requirements*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Referee designations: matches 63 – 64\". *FIFA.com*.

Spain became the eighth nation to win the tournament and the first European nation to win a World Cup hosted outside its home continent: all previous World Cups held outside Europe had been won by South American nations. They are also the first national team since 1978 to win a World Cup after losing a game in the group stage. As a result of their win, Spain represented the World in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Host nation South Africa were eliminated in the group stage and both 2006 World Cup finalists Italy and France were also eliminated at the group stage. It was the first time that the hosts had been eliminated in the first stage.

The result also marked the first time that a European nation had won a World Cup Finals that was not hosted on European soil.\n\n\nA closing ceremony was held before the final, featuring singer Shakira.

Each participating national association had to confirm their final 23-player squad by 1 June 2010. Teams were permitted to make late replacements in the event of serious injury, at any time up to 24 hours before their first game.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome controversies arose during the qualifications. In the second leg of the play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee, handled the ball in the lead up to a late goal, which enabled France to qualify ahead of Ireland, sparking widespread comment and debate. FIFA rejected a request from the Football Association of Ireland to replay the match,[23] and Ireland later withdrew a request to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant.[24][25] As a result, FIFA announced a review into the use of technology or extra officials at the highest level, but decided against the widely expected fast-tracking of goal-line referee's assistants for the South African tournament.[26]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe FIFA Organising Committee approved the procedure for the final draw on 2 December 2009. The seeding was based on the October 2009 FIFA World Ranking and seven squads joined hosts South Africa as seeded teams for the final draw. No two teams from the same confederation were to be drawn in the same group, except allowing a maximum of two European teams in a group.[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFIFA President Sepp Blatter took the unusual step of apologising to England and Mexico for the decisions that went against them, saying: \"Yesterday I spoke to the two federations directly concerned by referees' mistakes [...] I apologised to England and Mexico. The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some and you lose some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it.\"[85] Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: \"We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting.\"[85] Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.[85]\n\n\n\n26 June 2010\n16:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2010 FIFA World Cup| * isiZulu: *iNdebe Yomhlaba Ye-FIFA ka-2010*\n* Afrikaans: *FIFA Sokker-Wêreldbekertoernooi in 2010*\n* isiXhosa: *2010 FIFuRoni da Futboll*\n* Northern Sotho: *Mogopo wa Lefase wa FIFA wa 2010*\n* Sesotho: *Mohope wa lefatse wa FIFA 2010*\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)*Ke Nako* (Tswana and Sotho)*It's time.

This saw a total of US$40 million paid to domestic clubs. This was the result of an agreement reached in 2008 between FIFA and European clubs to disband the G-14 group and drop their claims for compensation dating back to 2005 over the financial cost of injuries sustained to their players while on international duty, such as that from Belgian club Charleroi S.C. for injury to Morocco's Abdelmajid Oulmers in a friendly game in 2004, and from English club Newcastle United for an injury to England's Michael Owen in the 2006 World Cup.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\n**Map all coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Tie-breaking criteria for group play\n |\n| --- |\n| Teams were ranked on the following criteria:[77]\n1.

The final attracted an estimated audience of 715.1 million people.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts\n\nThe vote to choose the hosts of the 2006 tournament was held in July 2000 in Zürich, Switzerland. It involved four bidding nations after Brazil had withdrawn three days earlier: Germany, South Africa, England and Morocco.[2] Three rounds of voting were required, each round eliminating the nation with the fewest votes. The first two rounds were held on 6 July 2000, and the final round was held on 7 July 2000, which Germany won over South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Voting results[3] |\n| --- |\n| Country\n | Round 1\n | Round 2\n | Round 3\n |\n| Germany | **10** | **11** | **12** |\n| South Africa | 6 | **11** | 11\n |\n| England | 5 | 2 | –\n |\n| Morocco | 3 | – | –\n |\n\n\n### Bribery and corruption allegations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItaly won the tournament, claiming their fourth World Cup title, defeating France 5–3 in a penalty shoot-out in the final after extra time had finished in a 1–1 draw. Germany defeated Portugal 3–1 to finish in third place. Angola, Ukraine, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Trinidad and Tobago and Togo made their first appearances in the finals. It was also the only appearance of Serbia and Montenegro under that name; they had previously appeared in 1998 as Yugoslavia. In late May 2006, immediately prior to the tournament, Montenegro voted in a referendum to become an independent nation and dissolve the loose confederacy then existing between it and Serbia; Serbia recognised the results of the referendum in early June. Due to time constraints, FIFA had Serbia and Montenegro play in the World Cup tournament as one team, marking the first instance of multiple sovereign nations competing as one team in a major football tournament since UEFA Euro 1992.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Cup and Television\" (PDF).

Italy's Andrea Pirlo won the most Man of the Match awards with three in total. Miroslav Klose, Agustín Delgado, Arjen Robben, Zé Roberto, Alexander Frei, Michael Ballack and Patrick Vieira each received two awards.\n\n\n\n### All-star team[edit]\n\n\nThe All-star team is a squad consisting of the 23 most impressive players at the 2006 World Cup, as selected by FIFA's Technical Study Group. The team was chosen from a shortlist of over 50 players, and was selected based on performances from the second round onwards.[47][48]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccusations of bribery and corruption had marred the success of Germany's bid from the very beginning. On the very day of the vote, a hoax bribery affair was made public, leading to calls for a re-vote.[4] On the night before the vote, German satirical magazine *Titanic* sent letters to FIFA representatives, offering joke gifts like cuckoo clocks and Black Forest ham in exchange for their vote for Germany. Oceania delegate Charlie Dempsey, who had initially backed England, had then been instructed to support South Africa following England's elimination. He abstained, citing \"intolerable pressure\" on the eve of the vote.[5] Had Dempsey voted as originally instructed, the vote would have resulted with a 12–12 tie, and FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who favoured the South African bid,[6] would have had to cast the deciding vote.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Fans in celebratory motorcade\n![](image)Celebrating fans in Olympiapark in Munich during the opening match between Germany and Costa Rica\nFIFA president Sepp Blatter stated the organization of the tournament was the best in history and that Germany had a welcoming public.[102] Through the many fanfests and large-screen broadcasts the feeling of a four-week national festival developed, in which much of the population took part.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 22 March 2016, it was announced that the FIFA Ethics Committee was opening proceedings into the bid.[15][16][17]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\n198 teams attempted to qualify for the 2006 World Cup.[18] Germany, the host nation, was granted automatic qualification, with the remaining 31 finals places divided among the continental confederations. Thirteen places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia), and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and CONCACAF and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFIFA predetermined that, hosts, Germany would be placed in Group A, thus being assured of the venues of their group matches in advance of the draw. They also announced, in advance, that Brazil (the defending champion) would be allocated to Group F.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite early success by Australia, Ecuador and Ghana, the tournament marked a return to dominance of traditional football powers. Four years after the 2002 tournament, in which teams from North America (the United States), Africa (Senegal) and Asia (South Korea) made it deep into the knockout stages and Turkey finished third, all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout stages and none of the quarter-finalists were from outside Europe or South America. Six former champions took part in the quarter-finals, with Ukraine and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal as the only relative outsiders.[41] Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals, leaving an all-European final four for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\n\n### Scoring[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFile:FIFA World Cup 2006 Opening Ceremony.jpg2006 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Munich\nThe finals tournament of the 2006 World Cup began on 9 June. The 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four teams each, within which the teams competed in a round-robin tournament to determine which two of those four teams would advance to the sixteen-team knock-out stage, which started on 24 June. In total, 64 games were played.\n\n\n\n### Hosting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 2006 FIFA World Cup:\n\t+ A time to make friends\n\t+ Broadcasting rights\n\t+ Controversies\n\t+ Disciplinary record\n\t+ Officials\n\t+ Organizing Committee\n\t+ Qualification\n\t+ Seeding\n\t+ Sponsorship\n\t+ Squads\n\t+ FIFA World Cup records\n* Leeuwenhosen controversy\n* *Strangers*, a 2007 film which takes place during the 2006 World Cup\n* *Deutschland.

No two teams from the same group qualified for the quarters, all eight teams were from different groups.\n\n\nEngland struggled against Ecuador but won 1–0 thanks to a David Beckham free kick. Brazil won 3–0 against Ghana, in a game which included Ronaldo's record 15th World Cup goal. *Der Spiegel* reported that the match may have been influenced by an Asian betting syndicate.[44] Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0. The only goal came courtesy of a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match, which marked a new World Cup record with 16 yellow cards (Portugal: 9, the Netherlands: 7) and 4 players being sent off for a second bookable offence. France came from behind to defeat Spain 3–1 thanks to goals from Franck Ribéry, Patrick Vieira, and Zinedine Zidane.\n\n\n\n24 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Voting procedure for 2006 FIFA World Cup decision\".

The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament, but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites, causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria.[39]\nIn any event, the finals tournament saw only two pairs of teams level on points: Argentina and the Netherlands at 7 points in Group C; Tunisia and Saudi Arabia at 1 point in Group H. Both of these ties were resolved on total goal difference. Also, in both cases the teams had tied their match, so the order of ranking criteria made no difference.\n\n\n\n## Finals tournament[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPictures of football supporters celebrating in front of video walls became a typical illustration of atmosphere in the country, while \"Fanmeile\" was later picked up as the German Word of the Year.[60] In 2007, FIFA and the 12 host cities received the German Marketing Prize for Sports for the innovative nature and marketing concept of Fan Fests.[61] FIFA and the Host Cities succeeded in creating and comfortable environment for foreign fans as 95% of them surveyed at Fan Fests agreed that it was an unequivocal declaration of international nature of World Cup and not a mere event for Germans.[58] A thought-out implementation of public viewing at such a large-scale football event as the 2006 World Cup became set a precedent. Immediately after the World Cup, FIFA announced that it registered the trademark for Fan Fests, taking over the organisation and marketing and making Fan Fests an integral part of future World Cups.[62]\n\n\n\n### Locations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Teams listed by FIFA ranking as of May 2006[19] |\n| --- |\n|  | Country | Confederation | Rank\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Brazil | CONMEBOL | 1\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Czech Republic | UEFA | 2\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Netherlands | UEFA | 3\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Mexico | CONCACAF | 4\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) United States | CONCACAF | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | UEFA | 5\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Portugal | UEFA | 7\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) France | UEFA | 8\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Argentina | CONMEBOL | 9\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) England | UEFA | 10\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Italy | UEFA | 13\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Sweden | UEFA | 16\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Japan | AFC | 18\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Germany | UEFA | 19\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Tunisia | CAF | 21\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) Iran | AFC | 23\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | UEFA | 23\n |\n| 18 | ![](image) Costa Rica | CONCACAF | 25\n |\n| 19 | ![](image) South Korea | AFC | 29\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | UEFA | 29\n |\n| 21 | ![](image) Ivory Coast | CAF | 32\n |\n| 22 | ![](image) Paraguay | CONMEBOL | 33\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Gelsenkirchen, England faced Portugal in a repeat of their Euro 2004 quarter-final. This time Wayne Rooney was sent off, and Portugal again won on penalties, 3–1 after a 0–0 draw to reach their first World Cup semi-final since the days of Eusébio 40 years earlier. This gave manager Luiz Felipe Scolari his third consecutive tournament quarter-final win over Sven-Göran Eriksson's England, first with Brazil en route to their 2002 World Cup win, then with Portugal in 2004 and 2006.\n\n\nItaly defeated quarter-final debutants Ukraine 3–0. France eliminated Brazil 1–0 to advance into the semi-finals. Brazil only managed one shot on goal, while Zinedine Zidane's dribbling earned him Man of the Match and his free-kick to Thierry Henry resulted in the winning goal.\n\n\n\n30 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 4–2 | ![](image) Costa Rica |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Lahm ![](image) 6'\n* Klose ![](image) 17', 61'\n* Frings ![](image) 87'\n | Report | * Wanchope ![](image) 12', 73'\n |\n\nFIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich\nAttendance: 66,000\nReferee: Horacio Elizondo (Argentina)\n\n9 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Poland ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image) Ecuador |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * C.

During the tournament, many of them were known by different names, as FIFA prohibits sponsorship of stadia unless the stadium sponsors are also official FIFA sponsors.[20] For example, the Allianz Arena in Munich was known during the competition as *FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich* (German: *FIFA WM-Stadion München*), and even the letters of the company Allianz were removed or covered.[20] Some of the stadia also had a lower capacity for the World Cup, as FIFA regulations ban standing room; nonetheless, this was accommodated as several stadia had a UEFA five-star ranking. The stadia in Berlin, Munich, Dortmund and Stuttgart hosted six matches each, while the other eight stadia hosted five matches each.\n\n\n\n* *A cross denotes an indoor stadium.*\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** \"WM-Vergabe 2006: Niersbachs Erklärung zur 6,7-Millionen-Euro-Zahlung\". *Spiegel Online* (in German). 22 October 2015.

The team's trainer, Jürgen Klinsmann, in February 2007 was furthermore awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz, not least for his reformed methods of modern training and playing methods, in which he persevered despite harsh criticism. Nevertheless, Klinsmann announced after the tournament that he would not extend his contract as trainer of the national team, since he felt completely burned-out and wished to spend more time with his family in California. The German Football Association (DFB) on the same day named as Klinsmann's successor his assistant trainer Joachim Löw, since in the opinion of the DFB leadership he would best continue Klinsmann's work and training methods.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the opening match of the tournament, Germany and Costa Rica played a game which ended 4–2 for the host in the highest scoring opening match in the tournament's history. Germany went on to win the Group A after edging Poland and breezing past Ecuador 3–0. Despite the defeat, Ecuador had already joined the host in the Round of 16 having beaten Poland and Costa Rica 2–0 and 3–0, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Germany (H) | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 8\n | 2\n | +6\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Ecuador | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 5\n | 3\n | +2\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Poland | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | −2\n | 3\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Costa Rica | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 3\n | 9\n | −6\n | 0\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria  \n(H) Hosts\n\n9 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tournament had a record number of yellow and red cards, breaking the previous record set by the 1998 World Cup.

Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarter-final and semi-final matches respectively. FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final, should their teams make it that far.

Playing in their first World Cup for 32 years, Australia came from behind to defeat Japan 3–1, and, despite losing 0–2 to Brazil, a 2–2 draw with Croatia was enough to give the Australians a place in the Round of 16 in a game where two players were sent-off for second bookings and one, erroneously, for a third booking by English referee Graham Poll. The Brazilians won all three games to qualify first in the group. Their 1–0 win against Croatia was through a goal late in the first-half by Kaká. Croatia and Japan went out of the tournament without a single win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n10 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Paraguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Gamarra ![](image) 4' (o.g.)\n | Report |  |\n\nWaldstadion, Frankfurt\nAttendance: 48,000\nReferee: Marco Rodríguez (Mexico)\n\n10 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n| Trinidad and Tobago ![](image) | 0–0 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n\nWestfalenstadion, Dortmund\nAttendance: 62,959\nReferee: Shamsul Maidin (Singapore)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n15 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n| England ![](image) | 2–0 | ![](image) Trinidad and Tobago |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Crouch ![](image) 83'\n* Gerrard ![](image) 90+1'\n | Report |  |\n\nFrankenstadion, Nuremberg\nAttendance: 41,000\nReferee: Toru Kamikawa (Japan)\n\n15 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Sweden ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Paraguay |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Ljungberg ![](image) 89'\n | Report |  |\n\nOlympiastadion, Berlin\nAttendance: 72,000\nReferee: Ľuboš Micheľ (Slovakia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n20 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n14 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| Spain ![](image) | 4–0 | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Alonso ![](image) 13'\n* Villa ![](image) 17', 48' (pen.)\n* Torres ![](image) 81'\n | Report |  |\n\nZentralstadion, Leipzig\nAttendance: 43,000\nReferee: Massimo Busacca (Switzerland)\n\n14 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n| Tunisia ![](image) | 2–2 | ![](image) Saudi Arabia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Jaziri ![](image) 23'\n* Jaïdi ![](image) 90+2'\n | Report | * Al-Qahtani ![](image) 57'\n* Al-Jaber ![](image) 84'\n |\n\nFIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich\nAttendance: 66,000\nReferee: Mark Shield (Australia)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n19 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n| Saudi Arabia ![](image) | 0–4 | ![](image) Ukraine |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Rusol ![](image) 4'\n* Rebrov ![](image) 36'\n* Shevchenko ![](image) 46'\n* Kalynychenko ![](image) 84'\n |\n\nVolksparkstadion, Hamburg\nAttendance: 50,000\nReferee: Graham Poll (England)\n\n19 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"1f16325b-66a8-4d8a-8219-a1d6e7b47656","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The final attracted an estimated audience of 715.1 million people.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Host selection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA World Cup hosts\n\nThe vote to choose the hosts of the 2006 tournament was held in July 2000 in Zürich, Switzerland. It involved four bidding nations after Brazil had withdrawn three days earlier: Germany, South Africa, England and Morocco.[2] Three rounds of voting were required, each round eliminating the nation with the fewest votes. The first two rounds were held on 6 July 2000, and the final round was held on 7 July 2000, which Germany won over South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Voting results[3] |\n| --- |\n| Country\n | Round 1\n | Round 2\n | Round 3\n |\n| Germany | **10** | **11** | **12** |\n| South Africa | 6 | **11** | 11\n |\n| England | 5 | 2 | –\n |\n| Morocco | 3 | – | –\n |\n\n\n### Bribery and corruption allegations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nItaly won the tournament, claiming their fourth World Cup title, defeating France 5–3 in a penalty shoot-out in the final after extra time had finished in a 1–1 draw. Germany defeated Portugal 3–1 to finish in third place. Angola, Ukraine, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Trinidad and Tobago and Togo made their first appearances in the finals. It was also the only appearance of Serbia and Montenegro under that name; they had previously appeared in 1998 as Yugoslavia. In late May 2006, immediately prior to the tournament, Montenegro voted in a referendum to become an independent nation and dissolve the loose confederacy then existing between it and Serbia; Serbia recognised the results of the referendum in early June. Due to time constraints, FIFA had Serbia and Montenegro play in the World Cup tournament as one team, marking the first instance of multiple sovereign nations competing as one team in a major football tournament since UEFA Euro 1992.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Cup and Television\" (PDF).

The team was chosen from a shortlist of over 50 players, and was selected based on performances from the second round onwards.[47][48]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccusations of bribery and corruption had marred the success of Germany's bid from the very beginning. On the very day of the vote, a hoax bribery affair was made public, leading to calls for a re-vote.[4] On the night before the vote, German satirical magazine *Titanic* sent letters to FIFA representatives, offering joke gifts like cuckoo clocks and Black Forest ham in exchange for their vote for Germany. Oceania delegate Charlie Dempsey, who had initially backed England, had then been instructed to support South Africa following England's elimination. He abstained, citing \"intolerable pressure\" on the eve of the vote.[5] Had Dempsey voted as originally instructed, the vote would have resulted with a 12–12 tie, and FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who favoured the South African bid,[6] would have had to cast the deciding vote.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Fans in celebratory motorcade\n![](image)Celebrating fans in Olympiapark in Munich during the opening match between Germany and Costa Rica\nFIFA president Sepp Blatter stated the organization of the tournament was the best in history and that Germany had a welcoming public.[102] Through the many fanfests and large-screen broadcasts the feeling of a four-week national festival developed, in which much of the population took part.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 22 March 2016, it was announced that the FIFA Ethics Committee was opening proceedings into the bid.[15][16][17]\n\n\n\n## Qualification[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification\n\n198 teams attempted to qualify for the 2006 World Cup.[18] Germany, the host nation, was granted automatic qualification, with the remaining 31 finals places divided among the continental confederations. Thirteen places were contested by UEFA teams (Europe), five by CAF teams (Africa), four by CONMEBOL teams (South America), four by AFC teams (Asia), and three by CONCACAF teams (North and Central America and Caribbean). The remaining two places were decided by playoffs between AFC and CONCACAF and between CONMEBOL and OFC (Oceania).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFIFA predetermined that, hosts, Germany would be placed in Group A, thus being assured of the venues of their group matches in advance of the draw. They also announced, in advance, that Brazil (the defending champion) would be allocated to Group F.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite early success by Australia, Ecuador and Ghana, the tournament marked a return to dominance of traditional football powers. Four years after the 2002 tournament, in which teams from North America (the United States), Africa (Senegal) and Asia (South Korea) made it deep into the knockout stages and Turkey finished third, all eight seeded teams progressed to the knockout stages and none of the quarter-finalists were from outside Europe or South America. Six former champions took part in the quarter-finals, with Ukraine and Euro 2004 runners-up Portugal as the only relative outsiders.[41] Argentina and Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals, leaving an all-European final four for only the fourth time (after the 1934, 1966 and 1982 tournaments).\n\n\n\n### Scoring[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFile:FIFA World Cup 2006 Opening Ceremony.jpg2006 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Munich\nThe finals tournament of the 2006 World Cup began on 9 June. The 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four teams each, within which the teams competed in a round-robin tournament to determine which two of those four teams would advance to the sixteen-team knock-out stage, which started on 24 June. In total, 64 games were played.\n\n\n\n### Hosting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 2006 FIFA World Cup:\n\t+ A time to make friends\n\t+ Broadcasting rights\n\t+ Controversies\n\t+ Disciplinary record\n\t+ Officials\n\t+ Organizing Committee\n\t+ Qualification\n\t+ Seeding\n\t+ Sponsorship\n\t+ Squads\n\t+ FIFA World Cup records\n* Leeuwenhosen controversy\n* *Strangers*, a 2007 film which takes place during the 2006 World Cup\n* *Deutschland.

No two teams from the same group qualified for the quarters, all eight teams were from different groups.\n\n\nEngland struggled against Ecuador but won 1–0 thanks to a David Beckham free kick. Brazil won 3–0 against Ghana, in a game which included Ronaldo's record 15th World Cup goal. *Der Spiegel* reported that the match may have been influenced by an Asian betting syndicate.[44] Portugal defeated the Netherlands 1–0. The only goal came courtesy of a Maniche strike in an acrimonious match, which marked a new World Cup record with 16 yellow cards (Portugal: 9, the Netherlands: 7) and 4 players being sent off for a second bookable offence. France came from behind to defeat Spain 3–1 thanks to goals from Franck Ribéry, Patrick Vieira, and Zinedine Zidane.\n\n\n\n24 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Voting procedure for 2006 FIFA World Cup decision\".

Czech Republic and Ukraine were making their first appearance as independent nations, but had previously been represented as part of Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union respectively; Serbia and Montenegro had competed as Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1998, as well as making up part of Yugoslav teams from 1930 to 1990. As of 2022, this was the last time Togo, Angola, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Trinidad and Tobago qualified for a FIFA World Cup finals, and the last time Uruguay failed to qualify.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the original version of the rules for the finals tournament, the ranking criteria were in a different order, with head-to-head results taking precedence over total goal difference. The rules were changed to the above in advance of the tournament, but older versions were still available on the FIFA and UEFA websites, causing some confusion among those trying to identify the correct criteria.[39]\nIn any event, the finals tournament saw only two pairs of teams level on points: Argentina and the Netherlands at 7 points in Group C; Tunisia and Saudi Arabia at 1 point in Group H. Both of these ties were resolved on total goal difference. Also, in both cases the teams had tied their match, so the order of ranking criteria made no difference.\n\n\n\n## Finals tournament[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPictures of football supporters celebrating in front of video walls became a typical illustration of atmosphere in the country, while \"Fanmeile\" was later picked up as the German Word of the Year.[60] In 2007, FIFA and the 12 host cities received the German Marketing Prize for Sports for the innovative nature and marketing concept of Fan Fests.[61] FIFA and the Host Cities succeeded in creating and comfortable environment for foreign fans as 95% of them surveyed at Fan Fests agreed that it was an unequivocal declaration of international nature of World Cup and not a mere event for Germans.[58] A thought-out implementation of public viewing at such a large-scale football event as the 2006 World Cup became set a precedent. Immediately after the World Cup, FIFA announced that it registered the trademark for Fan Fests, taking over the organisation and marketing and making Fan Fests an integral part of future World Cups.[62]\n\n\n\n### Locations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Teams listed by FIFA ranking as of May 2006[19] |\n| --- |\n|  | Country | Confederation | Rank\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) Brazil | CONMEBOL | 1\n |\n| 2 | ![](image) Czech Republic | UEFA | 2\n |\n| 3 | ![](image) Netherlands | UEFA | 3\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) Mexico | CONCACAF | 4\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) United States | CONCACAF | 5\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | UEFA | 5\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) Portugal | UEFA | 7\n |\n| 8 | ![](image) France | UEFA | 8\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) Argentina | CONMEBOL | 9\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) England | UEFA | 10\n |\n| 11 | ![](image) Italy | UEFA | 13\n |\n| 12 | ![](image) Sweden | UEFA | 16\n |\n| 13 | ![](image) Japan | AFC | 18\n |\n| 14 | ![](image) Germany | UEFA | 19\n |\n| 15 | ![](image) Tunisia | CAF | 21\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) Iran | AFC | 23\n |\n| ![](image) Croatia | UEFA | 23\n |\n| 18 | ![](image) Costa Rica | CONCACAF | 25\n |\n| 19 | ![](image) South Korea | AFC | 29\n |\n| ![](image) Poland | UEFA | 29\n |\n| 21 | ![](image) Ivory Coast | CAF | 32\n |\n| 22 | ![](image) Paraguay | CONMEBOL | 33\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Gelsenkirchen, England faced Portugal in a repeat of their Euro 2004 quarter-final. This time Wayne Rooney was sent off, and Portugal again won on penalties, 3–1 after a 0–0 draw to reach their first World Cup semi-final since the days of Eusébio 40 years earlier. This gave manager Luiz Felipe Scolari his third consecutive tournament quarter-final win over Sven-Göran Eriksson's England, first with Brazil en route to their 2002 World Cup win, then with Portugal in 2004 and 2006.\n\n\nItaly defeated quarter-final debutants Ukraine 3–0. France eliminated Brazil 1–0 to advance into the semi-finals. Brazil only managed one shot on goal, while Zinedine Zidane's dribbling earned him Man of the Match and his free-kick to Thierry Henry resulted in the winning goal.\n\n\n\n30 June 2006\n17:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Germany ![](image) | 4–2 | ![](image) Costa Rica |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Lahm ![](image) 6'\n* Klose ![](image) 17', 61'\n* Frings ![](image) 87'\n | Report | * Wanchope ![](image) 12', 73'\n |\n\nFIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich\nAttendance: 66,000\nReferee: Horacio Elizondo (Argentina)\n\n9 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Poland ![](image) | 0–2 | ![](image) Ecuador |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * C.

During the tournament, many of them were known by different names, as FIFA prohibits sponsorship of stadia unless the stadium sponsors are also official FIFA sponsors.[20] For example, the Allianz Arena in Munich was known during the competition as *FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich* (German: *FIFA WM-Stadion München*), and even the letters of the company Allianz were removed or covered.[20] Some of the stadia also had a lower capacity for the World Cup, as FIFA regulations ban standing room; nonetheless, this was accommodated as several stadia had a UEFA five-star ranking. The stadia in Berlin, Munich, Dortmund and Stuttgart hosted six matches each, while the other eight stadia hosted five matches each.\n\n\n\n* *A cross denotes an indoor stadium.*\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** \"WM-Vergabe 2006: Niersbachs Erklärung zur 6,7-Millionen-Euro-Zahlung\". *Spiegel Online* (in German). 22 October 2015.

The team's trainer, Jürgen Klinsmann, in February 2007 was furthermore awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz, not least for his reformed methods of modern training and playing methods, in which he persevered despite harsh criticism. Nevertheless, Klinsmann announced after the tournament that he would not extend his contract as trainer of the national team, since he felt completely burned-out and wished to spend more time with his family in California. The German Football Association (DFB) on the same day named as Klinsmann's successor his assistant trainer Joachim Löw, since in the opinion of the DFB leadership he would best continue Klinsmann's work and training methods.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the opening match of the tournament, Germany and Costa Rica played a game which ended 4–2 for the host in the highest scoring opening match in the tournament's history. Germany went on to win the Group A after edging Poland and breezing past Ecuador 3–0. Despite the defeat, Ecuador had already joined the host in the Round of 16 having beaten Poland and Costa Rica 2–0 and 3–0, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Germany (H) | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 8\n | 2\n | +6\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Ecuador | 3\n | 2\n | 0\n | 1\n | 5\n | 3\n | +2\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Poland | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | −2\n | 3\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Costa Rica | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 3\n | 3\n | 9\n | −6\n | 0\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria  \n(H) Hosts\n\n9 June 2006\n18:00\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tournament had a record number of yellow and red cards, breaking the previous record set by the 1998 World Cup. Players received a record-breaking 345 yellow cards and 28 red cards, with Russian referee Valentin Ivanov handing out 16 yellow and 4 red cards in the round of 16 match between Portugal and the Netherlands in a match known as the Battle of Nuremberg. Portugal had two players suspended for each of the quarter-final and semi-final matches respectively. FIFA President Sepp Blatter hinted that he may allow some rule changes for future tournaments so that earlier accumulated bookings will not force players to miss the final, should their teams make it that far. The tournament also saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly hand out three yellow cards to Croatia's Josip Šimunić in their match against Australia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Pos | Team* v\n* t\n* e\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts | Qualification\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Brazil | 3\n | 3\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n | 1\n | +6\n | 9\n | Advance to knockout stage |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Australia | 3\n | 1\n | 1\n | 1\n | 5\n | 5\n | 0\n | 4\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Croatia | 3\n | 0\n | 2\n | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | −1\n | 2\n |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Japan | 3\n | 0\n | 1\n | 2\n | 2\n | 7\n | −5\n | 1\n |\n\nSource: FIFA  \nRules for classification: Tie-breaking criteria\n\n12 June 2006\n15:00\n\n\n| Australia ![](image) | 3–1 | ![](image) Japan |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Cahill ![](image) 84', 89'\n* Aloisi ![](image) 90+2'\n | Report | * Nakamura ![](image) 26'\n |\n\nFritz-Walter-Stadion, Kaiserslautern\nAttendance: 46,000\nReferee: Essam Abd El Fatah (Egypt)\n\n13 June 2006\n21:00\n\n\n| Brazil ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Croatia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Kaká ![](image) 44'\n | Report |  |\n\nOlympiastadion, Berlin\nAttendance: 72,000\nReferee: Benito Archundia (Mexico)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Munich](image)\nMunich\n![Stuttgart](image)\nStuttgart\n![Gelsenkirchen](image)\nGelsenkirchen\n![Hamburg](image)\nHamburg\n![Frankfurt](image)\nFrankfurt\n![Cologne](image)\nCologne\n![Hanover](image)\nHanover\n![Leipzig](image)\nLeipzig\n![Kaiserslautern](image)\nKaiserslautern\n![Nuremberg](image)\nNuremberg\n2006 FIFA World Cup (Germany)\n | Hamburg |\n| Arena AufSchalke†**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Gelsenkirchen)** | AOL Arena**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Hamburg)** |\n| 51°33′16.21″N 7°4′3.32″E﻿ / ﻿51.5545028°N 7.0675889°E﻿ / 51.5545028; 7.0675889﻿ (Arena AufSchalke) | 53°35′13.77″N 9°53′55.02″E﻿ / ﻿53.5871583°N 9.8986167°E﻿ / 53.5871583; 9.8986167﻿ (AOL Arena) |\n| Capacity: **52,000**[25] | Capacity: **50,000**[26] |\n|  | ![](image) |\n| Frankfurt, Hesse | Kaiserslautern, Rhineland-Palatinate |\n| Commerzbank-Arena†**(FIFA World Cup Stadium, Frankfurt)** | Fritz-Walter-Stadion |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 16 October 2015, German news magazine *Der Spiegel* alleged that a slush fund with money from then-Adidas CEO Robert Louis-Dreyfus was used to influence the vote of four Asian members of the FIFA executive committee.[10] The sum of €6.7 million was later demanded back by Dreyfus. In order to retrieve the money, the Organising Committee paid an equivalent sum to the FIFA, allegedly as a German share for the cost of a closing ceremony, which never materialized.[8] Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German Football Association (DFB), denied the allegations on 17 October 2015, saying that \"the World Cup was not bought\" and that he could \"absolutely and categorically rule out the existence of a slush fund\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Spain ![](image) | 3–1 | ![](image) Tunisia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Raúl ![](image) 71'\n* Torres ![](image) 76', 90+1' (pen.)\n | Report | * Mnari ![](image) 8'\n |\n\nGottlieb-Daimler-Stadion, Stuttgart\nAttendance: 52,000\nReferee: Carlos Simon (Brazil)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n23 June 2006\n16:00\n\n\n| Saudi Arabia ![](image) | 0–1 | ![](image) Spain |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report | * Juanito ![](image) 36'\n |\n\nFritz-Walter-Stadion, Kaiserslautern\nAttendance: 46,000\nReferee: Coffi Codjia (Benin)\n\n23 June 2006\n16:00\n\n\n| Ukraine ![](image) | 1–0 | ![](image) Tunisia |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Shevchenko ![](image) 70' (pen.)\n | Report |  |\n\nOlympiastadion, Berlin\nAttendance: 72,000\nReferee: Carlos Amarilla (Paraguay)\n\n## Knockout stage[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2006 FIFA World Cup knockout stage\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \n> 1.

Playing in their first World Cup for 32 years, Australia came from behind to defeat Japan 3–1, and, despite losing 0–2 to Brazil, a 2–2 draw with Croatia was enough to give the Australians a place in the Round of 16 in a game where two players were sent-off for second bookings and one, erroneously, for a third booking by English referee Graham Poll. The Brazilians won all three games to qualify first in the group. Their 1–0 win against Croatia was through a goal late in the first-half by Kaká.
