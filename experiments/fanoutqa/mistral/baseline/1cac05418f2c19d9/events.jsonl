Developing countries that participate in the coffee market wield considerate influence on global coffee economics.[5][6]\n\n\n\n## Main exporters by country[edit]\n\n\n* ![A world map of countries by

Vietnam shares land borders with China to the north, and Laos and Cambodia to the west. It shares maritime borders with Thailand through the Gulf of Thailand, and the Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia through the South China Sea. Its capital is Hanoi and its largest city is Ho Chi Minh City (commonly referred to by its former name, Saigon).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA developing country with a lower-middle-income economy, Vietnam is one of the fastest-growing economies of the 21st century. Vietnam has high levels of corruption, censorship, environmental issues and a poor human rights record; the country ranks among the lowest in international measurements of civil liberties, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion and ethnic minorities. It is part of international and intergovernmental institutions including the ASEAN, the APEC, the CPTPP, the Non-Aligned Movement, the OIF, and the WTO.

This led many of them to leave Vietnam.[393][394]\n\n\n\n### Urbanisation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Vietnam\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![A tree map of Vietnam's exports in 2012](image)Tree map showing Vietnam's exports\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities and municipalities in VietnamSource: 2019 Vietnamese census,[401] National Assembly[note 1]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Hanoi](image)Hanoi | 1 | Ho Chi Minh City | Municipality | 8,993,082 | 11 | Tân Uyên | Bình Dương | 466,053\n | ![Haiphong](image)Haiphong![Cần Thơ](image)Cần Thơ |\n| 2 | Hanoi | Municipality | 8,053,663 | 12 | Nha Trang | Khánh Hòa | 422,601\n |\n| 3 | Haiphong | Municipality | 2,028,514 | 13 | Dĩ An | Bình Dương | 403,760\n |\n| 4 | Cần Thơ | Municipality | 1,235,171 | 14 | Buôn Ma Thuột | Đắk Lắk | 375,590\n |\n| 5 | Da Nang | Municipality | 1,134,310 | 15 | Thanh Hóa | Thanh Hóa | 359,910\n |\n| 6 | Biên Hòa | Đồng Nai | 1,055,414 | 16 | Vũng Tàu | Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu | 357,124\n |\n| 7 | Thủ Đức | Ho Chi Minh City | 1,013,795 | 17 | Bến Cát | Bình Dương | 355,663\n |\n| 8 | Huế | Thừa Thiên Huế | 652,572 | 18 | Thái Nguyên | Thái Nguyên | 340,403\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n5.

Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil, the highlands account for 16% of the country's arable land and 22% of its total forested land.[180] The soil in much of the southern part of Vietnam is relatively low in nutrients as a result of intense cultivation.[181] Several minor earthquakes have been recorded.[182][183] The northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta. Fansipan (also known as Phan Xi Păng), which is located in Lào Cai Province, is the highest mountain in Vietnam, standing 3,143 m (10,312 ft) high.[184] From north to south Vietnam, the country also has numerous islands; Phú Quốc is the largest.[185] The Hang Sơn Đoòng Cave is considered the largest known cave passage in the world since its discovery in 2009. The Ba Bể Lake and Mekong River are the largest lake and longest river in the country.[186][187][188]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe household gas sector in Vietnam is dominated by PetroVietnam, which controls nearly 70% of the country's domestic market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).[343] Since 2011, the company also operates five renewable energy power plants including the Nhơn Trạch 2 Thermal Power Plant (750 MW), Phú Quý Wind Power Plant (6 MW), Hủa Na Hydro-power Plant (180 MW), Dakdrinh Hydro-power Plant (125 MW) and Vũng Áng 1 Thermal Power Plant (1,200 MW).[344]\n\n\nAccording to statistics from British Petroleum (BP), Vietnam is listed among the 52 countries that have proven crude oil reserves. In 2015 the reserve was approximately 4.4 billion barrels ranking Vietnam first place in Southeast Asia, while the proven gas reserves were about 0.6 trillion cubic metres (tcm) and ranking it third in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and Malaysia.[345]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunication[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in Vietnam\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n272. **^** Ngoc Vo & Le 2014, p. 7. sfn error: no target: CITEREFNgoc\\_VoLe2014 (help)\n273. **^** Van Tho 2003, p. 11.\n274. **^** Litvack, Litvack & Rondinelli 1999, p. 31.\n275. **^** Freeman 2002.\n276. **^** Litvack, Litvack & Rondinelli 1999, p. 33.\n277. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Van Tho 2003, p. 5.\n278. **^** Hoang Vuong & Dung Tran 2009.\n279. **^** Hoang Vuong 2014.\n280. **^** Largo 2002, p. 66.\n281. **^** International Monetary Fund 1999, p. 23. sfn error: no target: CITEREFInternational\\_Monetary\\_Fund1999 (help)\n282. **^** Cockburn 1994.\n283. **^** Pincus 2015, p. 27; this article refers to the so-called \"Vent for surplus\" theory of international trade.\n284. **^** Quang Vinh, p. 13.\n285. **^** \"WTO | Accessions: Viet Nam\". *www.wto.org*.\n286. **^** Asian Development Bank 2010, p. 388.\n287. **^** Thanh Niên 2010.\n288. **^** Vierra & Vierra 2011, p. 5.\n289. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Vandemoortele & Bird 2010.\n290. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Cuong Le et al. 2010, p. 23.\n291. **^** H.

However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010.[202] In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world's twelve original cultivar centres. The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank preserves 12,300 cultivars of 115 species.[197] The Vietnamese government spent US$49.07 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone and has established 126 conservation areas, including 30 national parks.[197]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standard of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas. This results in changes to economic structures. In 1985, agriculture made up 37.2% of Vietnam's GDP; in 2008, that number had declined to 18.5%.[398] In 1985, industry made up only 26.2% of Vietnam's GDP; by 2008, that number had increased to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people's standards of living. Access to electricity grew from 14% of total households with electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009.[398] In terms of access to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies shows that only 12% of households in the area covered by them had access to the water network in 2002; by 2007, more than 70% of the population was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, and air and water pollution.[398]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Van Nam, Nguyen; de Vries, Peter J.; Van Toi, Le; Nagelkerke, Nico (2005). \"Malaria control in Vietnam: the Binh Thuan experience\". *Tropical Medicine & International Health*. **10** (4): 357–365. doi:10.1111/j.1365-3156.2005.01387.x.

Vietnam shares land borders with China to the north, and Laos and Cambodia to the west.

As a result, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the two major cities in the Red River Delta and Southeast regions respectively) increased their share of the total urban population from 8.5% and 24.9% to 15.9% and 31% respectively.[395] The Vietnamese government, through its construction ministry, forecasts the country will have a 45% urbanisation rate by 2020 although it was confirmed to only be 34.4% according to the 2019 census.[2] Urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n216. **^** Agent Orange Record.\n217. **^** Grantham, H.

Comprising five relatively flat plateaus of basalt soil, the highlands account for 16% of the country's arable land and 22% of its total forested land.[180] The soil in much of the southern part of Vietnam is relatively low in nutrients as a result of intense cultivation.[181] Several minor earthquakes have been recorded.[182][183] The northern part of the country consists mostly of highlands and the Red River Delta. Fansipan (also known as Phan Xi Păng), which is located in Lào Cai Province, is the highest mountain in Vietnam, standing 3,143 m (10,312 ft) high.[184] From north to south Vietnam, the country also has numerous islands; Phú Quốc is the largest.[185] The Hang Sơn Đoòng Cave is considered the largest known cave passage in the world since its discovery in 2009. The Ba Bể Lake and Mekong River are the largest lake and longest river in the country.[186][187][188]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe household gas sector in Vietnam is dominated by PetroVietnam, which controls nearly 70% of the country's domestic market for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).[343] Since 2011, the company also operates five renewable energy power plants including the Nhơn Trạch 2 Thermal Power Plant (750 MW), Phú Quý Wind Power Plant (6 MW), Hủa Na Hydro-power Plant (180 MW), Dakdrinh Hydro-power Plant (125 MW) and Vũng Áng 1 Thermal Power Plant (1,200 MW).[344]\n\n\nAccording to statistics from British Petroleum (BP), Vietnam is listed among the 52 countries that have proven crude oil reserves. In 2015 the reserve was approximately 4.4 billion barrels ranking Vietnam first place in Southeast Asia, while the proven gas reserves were about 0.6 trillion cubic metres (tcm) and ranking it third in Southeast Asia after Indonesia and Malaysia.[345]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunication[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in Vietnam\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n272. **^** Ngoc Vo & Le 2014, p. 7. sfn error: no target: CITEREFNgoc\\_VoLe2014 (help)\n273. **^** Van Tho 2003, p. 11.\n274. **^** Litvack, Litvack & Rondinelli 1999, p. 31.\n275. **^** Freeman 2002.\n276. **^** Litvack, Litvack & Rondinelli 1999, p. 33.\n277. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Van Tho 2003, p. 5.\n278. **^** Hoang Vuong & Dung Tran 2009.\n279. **^** Hoang Vuong 2014.\n280. **^** Largo 2002, p. 66.\n281. **^** International Monetary Fund 1999, p. 23. sfn error: no target: CITEREFInternational\\_Monetary\\_Fund1999 (help)\n282. **^** Cockburn 1994.\n283. **^** Pincus 2015, p. 27; this article refers to the so-called \"Vent for surplus\" theory of international trade.\n284. **^** Quang Vinh, p. 13.\n285. **^** \"WTO | Accessions: Viet Nam\". *www.wto.org*.\n286. **^** Asian Development Bank 2010, p. 388.\n287. **^** Thanh Niên 2010.\n288. **^** Vierra & Vierra 2011, p. 5.\n289. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Vandemoortele & Bird 2010.\n290. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Cuong Le et al. 2010, p. 23.\n291. **^** H.

However, the last individual of the species in Vietnam was reportedly shot in 2010.[202] In agricultural genetic diversity, Vietnam is one of the world's twelve original cultivar centres. The Vietnam National Cultivar Gene Bank preserves 12,300 cultivars of 115 species.[197] The Vietnamese government spent US$49.07 million on the preservation of biodiversity in 2004 alone and has established 126 conservation areas, including 30 national parks.[197]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standard of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas. This results in changes to economic structures. In 1985, agriculture made up 37.2% of Vietnam's GDP; in 2008, that number had declined to 18.5%.[398] In 1985, industry made up only 26.2% of Vietnam's GDP; by 2008, that number had increased to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people's standards of living. Access to electricity grew from 14% of total households with electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009.[398] In terms of access to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies shows that only 12% of households in the area covered by them had access to the water network in 2002; by 2007, more than 70% of the population was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, and air and water pollution.[398]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Van Nam, Nguyen; de Vries, Peter J.; Van Toi, Le; Nagelkerke, Nico (2005). \"Malaria control in Vietnam: the Binh Thuan experience\". *Tropical Medicine & International Health*. **10** (4): 357–365. doi:10.1111/j.1365-3156.2005.01387.x.

The population growth rate for 2016 is estimated to be 0.9%.[285] About 26.8% of the population were 15 years old or younger, 65.7% were between 15 and 64 years old, and 7.4% were over 65 years old.

The populations of the major cities also include mestizos. Mestizo *campesinos* (people living in rural areas) also live in the Andean highlands where some Spanish conquerors mixed with the women of Amerindian chiefdoms. Mestizos include artisans and small tradesmen that have played a major part in the urban expansion of recent decades.[302]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNon-traditional exports have boosted the growth of Colombian foreign sales as well as the diversification of destinations of export thanks to new free trade agreements.[240] Recent economic growth has led to a considerable increase of new millionaires, including the new entrepreneurs, Colombians with a net worth exceeding US$1 billion.[241][242]\n\n\nIn 2017, however, the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) reported that 26.9% of the population were living below the poverty line, of which 7.4% were in \"extreme poverty\".

It is the only country in South America with coastlines (and islands) along both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Colombia is a key member of major global and regional organizations including the UN, the WTO, the OECD, the OAS, the Pacific Alliance and the Andean Community; it is also a NATO Global Partner.[30] Its diversified economy is the third-largest in South America, with macroeconomic stability and favorable long-term growth prospects.[31][32]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEast of the Andes lies the savanna of the *Llanos*, part of the Orinoco River basin, and in the far southeast, the jungle of the Amazon rainforest. Together these lowlands make up over half Colombia's territory, but they contain less than 6% of the population. To the north the Caribbean coast, home to 21.9% of the population and the location of the major port cities of Barranquilla and Cartagena, generally consists of low-lying plains, but it also contains the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range, which includes the country's tallest peaks (Pico Cristóbal Colón and Pico Simón Bolívar), and the La Guajira Desert. By contrast the narrow and discontinuous Pacific coastal lowlands, backed by the Serranía de Baudó mountains, are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation. The principal Pacific port is Buenaventura.[160][163][164]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColombia's market economy grew steadily in the latter part of the 20th century, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an average rate of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998. The country suffered a recession in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the Great Depression), and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 6.9% in 2007, one of the highest rates of growth in Latin America.[26] According to International Monetary Fund estimates, in 2012, Colombia's GDP (PPP) was US$500 billion (28th in the world and third in South America).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt 2,600 m (8,530 ft), Bogotá is the highest city of its size in the world.[160]\n\n\nThe main rivers of Colombia are Magdalena, Cauca, Guaviare, Atrato, Meta, Putumayo and Caquetá. Colombia has four main drainage systems: the Pacific drain, the Caribbean drain, the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin.

Urban migration, industrialization, globalization, and other political, social and economic changes have also left an impression.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMany national symbols, both objects and themes, have arisen from Colombia's diverse cultural traditions and aim to represent what Colombia, and the Colombian people, have in common. Cultural expressions in Colombia are promoted by the government through the Ministry of Culture.[340]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n237. **^** \"International Trade Centre: Colombia Exports\". intracen.org.

The populations of the major cities also include mestizos. Mestizo *campesinos* (people living in rural areas) also live in the Andean highlands where some Spanish conquerors mixed with the women of Amerindian chiefdoms.

By contrast the narrow and discontinuous Pacific coastal lowlands, backed by the Serranía de Baudó mountains, are sparsely populated and covered in dense vegetation. The principal Pacific port is Buenaventura.[160][163][164]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColombia's market economy grew steadily in the latter part of the 20th century, with gross domestic product (GDP) increasing at an average rate of over 4% per year between 1970 and 1998. The country suffered a recession in 1999 (the first full year of negative growth since the Great Depression), and the recovery from that recession was long and painful. However, in recent years growth has been impressive, reaching 6.9% in 2007, one of the highest rates of growth in Latin America.[26] According to International Monetary Fund estimates, in 2012, Colombia's GDP (PPP) was US$500 billion (28th in the world and third in South America).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt 2,600 m (8,530 ft), Bogotá is the highest city of its size in the world.[160]\n\n\nThe main rivers of Colombia are Magdalena, Cauca, Guaviare, Atrato, Meta, Putumayo and Caquetá. Colombia has four main drainage systems: the Pacific drain, the Caribbean drain, the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin. The Orinoco and Amazon Rivers mark limits with Colombia to Venezuela and Peru respectively.[166]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Colombia\n\n![](image)Colombia map of Köppen climate classification\nThe climate of Colombia is characterized for being tropical presenting variations within six natural regions and depending on the altitude, temperature, humidity, winds and rainfall.[167] Colombia has a diverse range of climate zones, including tropical rainforests, savannas, steppes, deserts and mountain climates.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nColombia is rich in natural resources, and it is heavily dependent on energy and mining exports.[236] Colombia's main exports include mineral fuels, oils, distillation products, fruit and other agricultural products, sugars and sugar confectionery, food products, plastics, precious stones, metals, forest products, chemical goods, pharmaceuticals, vehicles, electronic products, electrical equipment, perfumery and cosmetics, machinery, manufactured articles, textile and fabrics, clothing and footwear, glass and glassware, furniture, prefabricated buildings, military products, home and office material, construction equipment, software, among others.[237] Principal trading partners are the United States, China, the European Union and some Latin American countries.[238][239]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 10 | Bello | Antioquia | 495,483 | 20 | Armenia | Quindío | 287,245\n |\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Colombia\n\nSee also: Festivals in Colombia and Colombian folklore\n\nColombia lies at the crossroads of Latin America and the broader American continent, and as such has been hit by a wide range of cultural influences. Native American, Spanish and other European, African, American, Caribbean, and Middle Eastern influences, as well as other Latin American cultural influences, are all present in Colombia's modern culture. Urban migration, industrialization, globalization, and other political, social and economic changes have also left an impression.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMany national symbols, both objects and themes, have arisen from Colombia's diverse cultural traditions and aim to represent what Colombia, and the Colombian people, have in common. Cultural expressions in Colombia are promoted by the government through the Ministry of Culture.[340]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n237. **^** \"International Trade Centre: Colombia Exports\". intracen.org.

Its primary industries are fishing, petroleum, timber, paper products, cotton cloth, tourism, petroleum mining, natural gas, bauxite, coal and tin. Its main agricultural products are rice, coconuts, soybeans, bananas, coffee, tea, palm, rubber, and sugar cane.[184] These commodities make up a large portion of the country's exports, with palm oil and coal briquettes as the leading export commodities. In addition to refined and crude petroleum as the primary imports, telephones, vehicle parts and wheat cover the majority of additional imports.

They are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.[107] Problems include the destruction of peatlands, large-scale illegal deforestation (causing extensive haze across parts of Southeast Asia), over-exploitation of marine resources, air pollution, garbage management, and reliable water and wastewater services.[107] These issues contribute to Indonesia's low ranking (number 116 out of 180 countries) in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index. The report also indicates that Indonesia's performance is generally below average in both regional and global context.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n330. **^** Shannon L., Smith; Lloyd Grayson J.

Also, the Dutch language never had a substantial number of speakers or official status despite the Dutch presence for almost 350 years.[238] The small minorities that can speak it or Dutch-based creole languages fluently are the aforementioned ethnic groups and descendants of Dutch colonisers.

They are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels and weak, under-resourced governance.[107] Problems include the destruction of peatlands, large-scale illegal deforestation (causing extensive haze across parts of Southeast Asia), over-exploitation of marine resources, air pollution, garbage management, and reliable water and wastewater services.[107] These issues contribute to Indonesia's low ranking (number 116 out of 180 countries) in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index. The report also indicates that Indonesia's performance is generally below average in both regional and global context.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n330. **^** Shannon L., Smith; Lloyd Grayson J.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) identified 140 species of mammals as threatened and 15 as critically endangered, including the Bali myna,[116] Sumatran orangutan,[117] and Javan rhinoceros.[118] Some academics describe the deforestation and other environmental destruction in the country as an ecocide.[119][120][121]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite guaranteeing religious freedom in the constitution,[242][126] the government officially recognises only six religions: Islam, Protestantism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism,[243][244] with indigenous religions only partly acknowledged.[244] With 231 million adherents (86.7%) in 2018, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority country,[245][246] with Sunnis being the majority (99%).[247] The Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1% (1–3 million) and 0.2% (200,000–400,000) of Muslims.[244][248] About 10% of Indonesians are Christians, who form the majority in several provinces in eastern Indonesia.[249] Most Hindus are Balinese,[250] and most Buddhists are Chinese Indonesians.[251]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Countriesand territories\n | * Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Central African Republic\n* Northern Cyprus1\n* Russia\n* Thailand\n |\n| Muslimcommunities\n | * Moro National Liberation Front\n |\n| Internationalorganizations\n | * Economic Cooperation Organization\n* African Union\n* Arab League\n* Non-Aligned Movement\n* United Nations\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| History | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Declarations | * Abuja Declaration (1989)\n* Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam (1990)\n* OIC Resolution 10/11 (2008)\n* OIC Council of Foreign Ministers Resolution 10/37 (2010)\n |\n\n |\n| Sessions | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Extraordinary | * First\n* Second\n* Third\n* Fourth\n* Fifth\n* Sixth\n* Seventh\n* Eighth\n* Ninth\n* Arab–Islamic (2023)\n |\n\n |\n| Demographics | * Economy\n\t+ GDP\n\t+ GDP per capita\n\t+ Exports\n\t+ Imports\n* Population\n* Largest cities\n* Education\n |\n| * 1 As the \"Turkish Cypriot State\".\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Organizations | * NAM News Network (News Agencies Pool)\n* \"Josip Broz Tito\" Art Gallery of the Nonaligned Countries\n |\n| Principles | * Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence\n |\n| Summits | * Bandung Conference\n* Brioni Meeting\n* 1st\n* 2nd\n* 3rd\n* 4th\n* 5th\n* 6th\n* 7th\n* 8th\n* 9th\n* 10th\n* 16th\n* 18th\n* 19th\n |\n| Founders | * Josip Broz Tito (Yugoslavia)\n* Sukarno (Indonesia)\n* Jawaharlal Nehru (India)\n* Kwame Nkrumah (Ghana)\n* Gamal Abdel Nasser (Egypt)\n |\n| People | * Houari Boumediene\n* Fidel Castro\n* Nelson Mandela\n* Mohamed Morsi\n* Nicolás Maduro\n* Sirimavo Bandaranaike\n |\n\n |\n| ‡ denotes a former member state of the Non-Aligned Movement\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndonesia consists of thousands of distinct native ethnic and hundreds of linguistic groups, with Javanese being the largest.

The small domestic market and competition from more industrially advanced countries in the region have inhibited more complex industrialization.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, according to the National Institute of Statistics of Honduras (INE), 73% of the country's population is poor and 53% lives in extreme poverty.[80] The country is one of the most unequal in Latin America.[81]\n![](image)Historical GDP per capita development of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Honduran people are among the poorest in Latin America; gross national income per capita (2007) is US$1,649; the average for Central America is $6,736.[79]\nHonduras is the fourth poorest country in the Western Hemisphere; only Haiti, Nicaragua, and Guyana are poorer.

A 2012 US State Department estimate suggested that between 800,000 and one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time, nearly 15% of the Honduran population.[43] The large uncertainty about numbers is because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa.

Bananas, formerly the country's second-largest export until being virtually wiped out by 1998's Hurricane Mitch, recovered in 2000 to 57% of pre-Mitch levels.

The nation saw a poverty increase of 13.2 percent and in extreme poverty of 26.3 percent in just 3 years.[86] Furthermore, unemployment grew between 2008 and 2012 from 6.8 percent to 14.1 percent.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe CIA Factbook lists Honduras as 97% Catholic and 3% Protestant.[1] Commenting on statistical variations everywhere, John Green of Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life notes that: \"It isn't that ... numbers are more right than [someone else's] numbers ... but how one conceptualizes the group.\"[122] Often people attend one church without giving up their \"home\" church. Many who attend evangelical megachurches in the US, for example, attend more than one church.[123] This shifting and fluidity is common in Brazil where two-fifths of those who were raised evangelical are no longer evangelical and Catholics seem to shift in and out of various churches, often while still remaining Catholic.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** Schaffer, Kathryn (18 January 2018). \"Gender, Environment and Development in Honduras: An Applied Anthropology Internship\". *Practicing Anthropology*. **22** (3): 25–26. doi:10.17730/praa.22.3.t76310161617758g.

Still, in Honduras are thriving Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist, Lutheran, Latter-day Saint (Mormon) and Pentecostal churches. There are Protestant seminaries. The Catholic Church, still the only \"church\" that is recognized, is also thriving in the number of schools, hospitals, and pastoral institutions (including its own medical school) that it operates. Its archbishop, Cardinal Óscar Andrés Rodriguez Maradiaga, is also very popular with the government, other churches, and in his own church.

Honduras's manufacturing sector has not yet developed beyond simple textile and agricultural processing industries and assembly operations. The small domestic market and competition from more industrially advanced countries in the region have inhibited more complex industrialization.\n\n\n\nIn 2022, according to the National Institute of Statistics of Honduras (INE), 73% of the country's population is poor and 53% lives in extreme poverty.[80] The country is one of the most unequal in Latin America.[81]\n![](image)Historical GDP per capita development of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras\n### Poverty[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Honduran people are among the poorest in Latin America; gross national income per capita (2007) is US$1,649; the average for Central America is $6,736.[79]\nHonduras is the fourth poorest country in the Western Hemisphere; only Haiti, Nicaragua, and Guyana are poorer.

A majority of expatriate Hondurans live in the United States. A 2012 US State Department estimate suggested that between 800,000 and one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time, nearly 15% of the Honduran population.[43] The large uncertainty about numbers is because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa.

The country's leading export is coffee (US$340 million), which accounted for 22% of the total Honduran export revenues. Bananas, formerly the country's second-largest export until being virtually wiped out by 1998's Hurricane Mitch, recovered in 2000 to 57% of pre-Mitch levels. Cultivated shrimp is another important export sector.

The nation saw a poverty increase of 13.2 percent and in extreme poverty of 26.3 percent in just 3 years.[86] Furthermore, unemployment grew between 2008 and 2012 from 6.8 percent to 14.1 percent.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe CIA Factbook lists Honduras as 97% Catholic and 3% Protestant.[1] Commenting on statistical variations everywhere, John Green of Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life notes that: \"It isn't that ... numbers are more right than [someone else's] numbers ... but how one conceptualizes the group.\"[122] Often people attend one church without giving up their \"home\" church. Many who attend evangelical megachurches in the US, for example, attend more than one church.[123] This shifting and fluidity is common in Brazil where two-fifths of those who were raised evangelical are no longer evangelical and Catholics seem to shift in and out of various churches, often while still remaining Catholic.[124]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** Schaffer, Kathryn (18 January 2018). \"Gender, Environment and Development in Honduras: An Applied Anthropology Internship\". *Practicing Anthropology*. **22** (3): 25–26. doi:10.17730/praa.22.3.t76310161617758g.

The Honduran economy grew 4.8% in 2000, recovering from the Mitch-induced recession (−1.9%) of 1999. The Honduran maquiladora sector, the third-largest in the world, continued its strong performance in 2000, providing employment to over 120,000 and generating more than $528  million in foreign exchange for the country. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was 10.1% in 2000, down slightly from the 10.9% recorded in 1999. The country's international reserve position continued to be strong in 2000, at slightly over US$1 billion. Remittances from Hondurans living abroad (mostly in the United States) rose 28% to $410 million in 2000. The Lempira (currency) was devaluing for many years, but stabilized at L19 to the United States dollar in 2005. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Central America and Caribbean :: HONDURAS\".

A large undeveloped lowland jungle, *La Mosquitia* lies in the northeast, and the heavily populated lowland Sula valley in the northwest. In La Mosquitia lies the UNESCO world-heritage site Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve, with the Coco River which divides Honduras from Nicaragua.\n\n\nThe Islas de la Bahía and the Swan Islands are off the north coast. Misteriosa Bank and Rosario Bank, 130 to 150 kilometres (81 to 93 miles) north of the Swan Islands, fall within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Honduras.\n\n\nNatural resources include timber, gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, iron ore, antimony, coal, fish, shrimp, and hydropower.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Köppen climate types of Honduras\nMain article: Geography of Honduras § Climate\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring colonization the majority of Honduras's indigenous population died of diseases like smallpox and measles resulting in a more homogenous indigenous population compared to other colonies.[96] Nine indigenous and African groups are recognized by the government in Honduras.[110] The majority of Amerindians in Honduras are Lenca, followed by the Miskito, Cho'rti', Tolupan, Pech and Sumo.[110] Around 50,000 Lenca individuals live in the west and western interior of Honduras while the other small native groups are located throughout the country.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFurther information: List of cities in Honduras\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in HondurasAccording to the 2013 Census[119]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | Department | Municipal pop.\n |  |\n| ![Tegucigalpa](image)Tegucigalpa![San Pedro Sula](image)San Pedro Sula | 1 | Tegucigalpa | Francisco Morazán | 996,658\n | ![La Ceiba](image)La Ceiba![Choloma](image)Choloma |\n| 2 | San Pedro Sula | Cortés | 598,519\n |\n| 3 | La Ceiba | Atlántida | 176,212\n |\n| 4 | Choloma | Cortés | 163,818\n |\n| 5 | El Progreso | Yoro | 114,934\n |\n| 6 | Comayagua | Comayagua | 92,883\n |\n| 7 | Choluteca | Choluteca | 86,179\n |\n| 8 | Danlí | El Paraíso | 64,976\n |\n| 9 | La Lima | Cortés | 62,903\n |\n| 10 | Villanueva | Cortés | 62,711\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Honduras\n\nReligions: in Honduras %[107]\n\n\n\nCatholic (46%)\nProtestant (39%)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Honduras's Human Development Index is adjusted for inequality (known as the IHDI) Honduras's development index is reduced to .443.[11] The levels of inequality in each aspect of development can also be assessed.[11] In 2015 inequality of life expectancy at birth was 19.6%, inequality in education was 24.4% and inequality in income was 41.5% [11] The overall loss in human development due to inequality was 29.2.[11]\n\n\nThe IHDI for Latin America and the Caribbean overall is 0.575 with an overall loss of 23.4%.[11] In 2015 for the entire region, inequality of life expectancy at birth was 22.9%, inequality in education was 14.0% and inequality in income was 34.9%.[11] While Honduras has a higher life expectancy than other countries in the region (before and after inequality adjustments), its quality of education and economic standard of living are lower.[11] Income inequality and education inequality have a large impact on the overall development of the nation.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMiddle class Honduras is a small group defined by relatively low membership and income levels.[96] Movement from lower to middle class is typically facilitated by higher education.[96] Professionals, students, farmers, merchants, business employees, and civil servants are all considered a part of the Honduran middle class.[96] Opportunities for employment and the industrial and commercial sectors are slow-growing, limiting middle class membership.[96]\n\n\nThe Honduran upper class has much higher income levels than the rest of the Honduran population reflecting large amounts of income inequality.[96] Much of the upper class affords their success to the growth of cotton and livestock exports post-World War II.[96] The wealthy are not politically unified and differ in political and economic views.[96]\n\n\n\n### Trade[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United Nations Development Program (UNDP) ranks Honduras 116th for measures including women's political power, and female access to resources.[111] The Gender Inequality Index (GII) depicts gender-based inequalities in Honduras according to reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity.[11] Honduras has a GII of .461 and ranked 101 of 159 countries in 2015.[11] 25.8% of Honduras's parliament is female and 33.4% of adult females have a secondary education or higher while only 31.1% of adult males do.[11] Despite this, while male participation in the labor market is 84.4, female participation is 47.2%.[11] Honduras's maternal mortality ratio is 129 and the adolescent birth rate is 65.0 for women ages 15–19.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHonduras has rain forests, cloud forests (which can rise up to nearly 3,000 metres or 9,800 feet above sea level), mangroves, savannas and mountain ranges with pine and oak trees, and the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. In the Bay Islands there are bottlenose dolphins, manta rays, parrot fish, schools of blue tang and whale shark.\n\n\nDeforestation resulting from logging is rampant in Olancho Department. The clearing of land for agriculture is prevalent in the largely undeveloped La Mosquitia region, causing land degradation and soil erosion. Honduras had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.48/10, ranking it 126th globally out of 172 countries.[62]\n\n\nLake Yojoa, which is Honduras's largest source of fresh water, is polluted by heavy metals produced from mining activities.[63] Some rivers and streams are also polluted by mining.[64]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Honduras\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)San Pedro Sula is a major center of business and commerce in Honduras, and is home to many large manufacturers and companies.

After holding berries, he was advised exhibit to priests in nearby monastery. One monk called the generosity of Kaldi \"the Devil work\" and tossed to the fire, generating aromatic odor.

However, the service sector represents the largest portion of the GDP.[19] Many other economic activities depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly by small-scale farmers and enterprises, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include coffee, legumes, oilseeds, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables. Ethiopia is also a Vavilov centre of diversity for domesticated crops, including enset,[246] coffee and teff.\n\n\nExports are almost entirely agricultural commodities (with the exception of Gold exports), and coffee is the largest foreign exchange earner. Ethiopia is Africa's second biggest maize producer.[247] According to UN estimations the per capita GDP of Ethiopia has reached $357 as of 2011[update].[248]\n\n\n\n### Exports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"Country Level\". *2007 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia*.

Inflation surged to 40% in August 2011 because of loose monetary policy, large civil service wage increase in early 2011, and high food prices.[238] For 2011–12, end-year inflation was projected to be about 22%, and single digit inflation is projected in 2012–13 with the implementation of tight monetary and fiscal policies.[239]\n\n\nIn spite of fast growth in recent years, GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and the economy faces a number of serious structural problems. However, with a focused investment in public infrastructure and industrial parks, Ethiopia's economy is addressing its structural problems to become a hub for light manufacturing in Africa.[240] In 2019 a law was passed allowing expatriate Ethiopians to invest in Ethiopia's financial service industry.[241]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the private sector growing slowly, designer leather products like bags are becoming a big export business, with Taytu becoming the first luxury designer label in the country.[256] Additional small-scale export products include cereals, pulses, cotton, sugarcane, potatoes, and hides.

Lake Tana in the north is the source of the Blue Nile. It also has many endemic species, notably the gelada, the walia ibex and the Ethiopian wolf (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n\nThe nation is a land of geographical contrasts, ranging from the vast fertile west, with its forests and numerous rivers, to the world's hottest settlement of Dallol in its north.

Unlike most countries, coffee is served in presence of social gathering, in family, friend or neighborhood level. There are three rounds of coffee drinking: the first one called \"awol\" (Tigrinya: ኣዎል), the second \"tona\" (ቶና) and the third \"baraka\" (ባርካ). The tradition of coffee legend goes back to Kaldi, a goat herder from Keffa Zone who noticed his goat was caught up with hysteria after they eat shrub that stimulate them to dance uncontrollably with rampant. After holding berries, he was advised exhibit to priests in nearby monastery. One monk called the generosity of Kaldi \"the Devil work\" and tossed to the fire, generating aromatic odor. The legend told that Kaldi lived in 850 CE, commonly associated with belief of starting coffee cultivation in Ethiopia in the 9th century.[249]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethiopian art\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in Ethiopia\nAgriculture constitutes around 85% of the labour force. However, the service sector represents the largest portion of the GDP.[19] Many other economic activities depend on agriculture, including marketing, processing, and export of agricultural products. Production is overwhelmingly by small-scale farmers and enterprises, and a large part of commodity exports are provided by the small agricultural cash-crop sector. Principal crops include coffee, legumes, oilseeds, cereals, potatoes, sugarcane, and vegetables. Ethiopia is also a Vavilov centre of diversity for domesticated crops, including enset,[246] coffee and teff.\n\n\nExports are almost entirely agricultural commodities (with the exception of Gold exports), and coffee is the largest foreign exchange earner. Ethiopia is Africa's second biggest maize producer.[247] According to UN estimations the per capita GDP of Ethiopia has reached $357 as of 2011[update].[248]\n\n\n\n### Exports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"Country Level\". *2007 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia*.

Inflation surged to 40% in August 2011 because of loose monetary policy, large civil service wage increase in early 2011, and high food prices.[238] For 2011–12, end-year inflation was projected to be about 22%, and single digit inflation is projected in 2012–13 with the implementation of tight monetary and fiscal policies.[239]\n\n\nIn spite of fast growth in recent years, GDP per capita is one of the lowest in the world, and the economy faces a number of serious structural problems. However, with a focused investment in public infrastructure and industrial parks, Ethiopia's economy is addressing its structural problems to become a hub for light manufacturing in Africa.[240] In 2019 a law was passed allowing expatriate Ethiopians to invest in Ethiopia's financial service industry.[241]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the private sector growing slowly, designer leather products like bags are becoming a big export business, with Taytu becoming the first luxury designer label in the country.[256] Additional small-scale export products include cereals, pulses, cotton, sugarcane, potatoes, and hides.

Lake Tana in the north is the source of the Blue Nile. It also has many endemic species, notably the gelada, the walia ibex and the Ethiopian wolf (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n\nThe nation is a land of geographical contrasts, ranging from the vast fertile west, with its forests and numerous rivers, to the world's hottest settlement of Dallol in its north. The Ethiopian Highlands are the largest continuous mountain ranges in Africa, and the Sof Omar Caves contains the largest cave on the continent.

These include hydropower, biomass, solar, geothermal, peat and fossil fuels.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the majority of energy in Uganda came from charcoal and wood. However, oil was found in the Lake Albert area, totaling an estimated 95 million cubic metres (3.4×10~~^~~9 cu ft) of crude.[134] Heritage Oil discovered one of the largest crude oil finds in Uganda, and continues operations there.[172]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUganda has a large diaspora, residing mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom. This diaspora has contributed enormously to Uganda's economic growth through remittances and other investments (especially property). According to the World Bank, Uganda received in 2016 an estimated US$1.099 billion in remittances from abroad, second only to Kenya (US$1.574 billion) in the East African Community,[145] and seventh in Africa.[146] Uganda also serves as an economic hub for a number of neighbouring countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo,[147] South Sudan,[148] and Rwanda.[149]\n\n\nThe Ugandan Bureau of Statistics announced inflation was 4.6 percent in November 2016.[150] On 29 June 2018, Uganda's statistics agency said the country registered a drop in inflation to 3.4 percent in the financial year ending 2017/18 compared to the 5.7 percent recorded in the financial year 2016/17.[151]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUganda is one of the poorest nations in the world. In 2012, 37.8 percent of the population lived on less than $1.25 a day.[155] Despite making enormous progress in reducing the countrywide poverty incidence from 56 percent of the population in 1992 to 24.5 percent in 2009, poverty remains deep-rooted in the country's rural areas, which are home to 84 percent of Ugandans.[156]\n\n\nPeople in rural areas of Uganda depend on farming as the main source of income and 90 per cent of all rural women work in the agricultural sector.[157] In addition to agricultural work, rural women are responsible for the caretaking of their families. The average Ugandan woman spends 9 hours a day on domestic tasks, such as preparing food and clothing, fetching water and firewood, and caring for the elderly, the sick as well as orphans. As such, women on average work longer hours than men, between 12 and 18 hours per day, with a mean of 15 hours, as compared to men, who work between 8 and 10 hours a day.[158]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * APRM\n* Foreign relations\n* African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights\n* African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights\n* Enlargement\n* United States Africa Command (United States military bases)\n* United States ambassadors\n* African Union–Ethiopia relations\n |\n| Symbols | * Anthem\n* Emblem\n* Flag\n* Passport\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | * Currencies (Gold standard)\n* Development Bank\n* African Economic Community\n* NEPAD\n* African Continental Free Trade Area\n* Single African Air Transport Market\n |\n| Culture | * Africa Day\n |\n| Theory | * Afro\n* United States of Africa\n* United States of Latin Africa\n* East African Federation\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Secretary-General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation: Hissein Brahim Taha\n |\n| Member states | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n169. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Q1-Market Report 2015\" (PDF). *Reports & Surveys*.

Over the same period, the number of researchers doubled (in head counts) from 1 387 to 2 823, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. This represents a leap from 44 to 83 researchers per million inhabitants over the same period. One in four researchers is a woman.\nUganda has been able to manufacture prototype of cars called kiira in which the government invested US$70.[207]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Uganda\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Uganda**,[b] officially the **Republic of Uganda**,[c] is a landlocked country in East Africa. The country is bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by Tanzania. The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region, lies within the Nile basin, and has a varied but generally modified equatorial climate. As of 2023, it has a population of around 49.6 million, of which 8.5 million live in the capital and largest city of Kampala.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n134. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Uganda's oil rush: Derricks in the darkness Archived 27 February 2023 at the Wayback Machine.

These include hydropower, biomass, solar, geothermal, peat and fossil fuels.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the majority of energy in Uganda came from charcoal and wood. However, oil was found in the Lake Albert area, totaling an estimated 95 million cubic metres (3.4×10~~^~~9 cu ft) of crude.[134] Heritage Oil discovered one of the largest crude oil finds in Uganda, and continues operations there.[172]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUganda has a large diaspora, residing mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom. This diaspora has contributed enormously to Uganda's economic growth through remittances and other investments (especially property). According to the World Bank, Uganda received in 2016 an estimated US$1.099 billion in remittances from abroad, second only to Kenya (US$1.574 billion) in the East African Community,[145] and seventh in Africa.[146] Uganda also serves as an economic hub for a number of neighbouring countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo,[147] South Sudan,[148] and Rwanda.[149]\n\n\nThe Ugandan Bureau of Statistics announced inflation was 4.6 percent in November 2016.[150] On 29 June 2018, Uganda's statistics agency said the country registered a drop in inflation to 3.4 percent in the financial year ending 2017/18 compared to the 5.7 percent recorded in the financial year 2016/17.[151]\n\n\n\n### Industry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUganda is one of the poorest nations in the world. In 2012, 37.8 percent of the population lived on less than $1.25 a day.[155] Despite making enormous progress in reducing the countrywide poverty incidence from 56 percent of the population in 1992 to 24.5 percent in 2009, poverty remains deep-rooted in the country's rural areas, which are home to 84 percent of Ugandans.[156]\n\n\nPeople in rural areas of Uganda depend on farming as the main source of income and 90 per cent of all rural women work in the agricultural sector.[157] In addition to agricultural work, rural women are responsible for the caretaking of their families. The average Ugandan woman spends 9 hours a day on domestic tasks, such as preparing food and clothing, fetching water and firewood, and caring for the elderly, the sick as well as orphans. As such, women on average work longer hours than men, between 12 and 18 hours per day, with a mean of 15 hours, as compared to men, who work between 8 and 10 hours a day.[158]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * APRM\n* Foreign relations\n* African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights\n* African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights\n* Enlargement\n* United States Africa Command (United States military bases)\n* United States ambassadors\n* African Union–Ethiopia relations\n |\n| Symbols | * Anthem\n* Emblem\n* Flag\n* Passport\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | * Currencies (Gold standard)\n* Development Bank\n* African Economic Community\n* NEPAD\n* African Continental Free Trade Area\n* Single African Air Transport Market\n |\n| Culture | * Africa Day\n |\n| Theory | * Afro\n* United States of Africa\n* United States of Latin Africa\n* East African Federation\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOrganisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Secretary-General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation: Hissein Brahim Taha\n |\n| Member states | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n169. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Q1-Market Report 2015\" (PDF). *Reports & Surveys*.

The largest distribution company, UMEME is privately owned and has a 20-year concession for distribution and retail. The country, however, is divided into 13 rural service territories, and 6 of these are being managed by small distribution companies. Independent power producers (IPPs) currently account for nearly 60% of generation capacity.

The Mexican Revolution (c. 1910–1920) greatly impacted population increases. The growth rate increased dramatically between the 1930s and the 1980s, when the country registered growth rates of over 3% (1950–1980). The Mexican population doubled in twenty years, and at that rate it was expected that by 2000 there would be 120 million people living in Mexico. Mexico's population grew from 70 million in 1982 to 120 million in 2015.[250]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n182. **^** \"World in 2050 – The BRICs and beyond: prospects, challenges and opportunities\" (PDF).

The OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average.[205] This is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the average among OECD nations whereas its literacy levels are in the median range of OECD nations. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMexico is now firmly established as an upper middle-income country. After the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2, 3.0 and 4.8 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006,[179] even though it is considered to be well below Mexico's potential growth.[180] The International Monetary Fund predicts growth rates of 2.3% and 2.7% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.[175] By 2050, Mexico could potentially become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy.[181][182]\n\n\nThe electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. Mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry in the world after China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Mexico is the second-largest exporter of electronics to the United States where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011.[183] The Mexican electronics industry grew 20% between 2010 and 2011, up from its constant growth rate of 17% between 2003 and 2009.[183] Currently electronics represent 30% of Mexico's exports.[183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mexican Stock Exchange building, in Mexico City\n![](image)Headquarters of América Móvil in Mexico City, the largest mobile network operator outside Asia\nAs of April 2018, Mexico has the 15th largest nominal GDP (US$1.15 trillion)[175] and the 11th largest by purchasing power parity (US$2.45 trillion).

Some of Mexico's native culinary ingredients include: maize, tomato, beans, squash, chocolate, vanilla, avocado, guava, chayote, epazote, camote, jícama, nopal, zucchini, tejocote, huitlacoche, sapote, mamey sapote, and a great variety of chiles, such as the habanero and the jalapeño.

While Mestizos are a prominent ethnic group in contemporary Mexico, the subjective and ever-changing definition of this category have led to its estimations being imprecise, having been observed that many Mexicans do not identify as Mestizos,[261][262] favoring instead ethnoracial labels such as White or Indigenous due to having more consistent and \"static\" definitions.[263]\n\n\n\n![](image)Regional variation of ancestry according to a study made by Ruiz-Linares in 2014; each dot represents a volunteer, with most coming from south Mexico and Mexico City.[264]\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Mexico\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt ranks poorly on the Global Peace Index,[31] due in large part to ongoing conflict between drug trafficking syndicates.

As of 2010, Pentecostal churches together have more than 1.3 million adherents, which in net numbers place them as the second Christian creed in Mexico. The situation changes when the different Pentecostal denominations are considered as separate entities.

The OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average.[205] This is also reflected by the fact that infant mortality in Mexico is three times higher than the average among OECD nations whereas its literacy levels are in the median range of OECD nations. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMexico is now firmly established as an upper middle-income country. After the slowdown of 2001 the country has recovered and has grown 4.2, 3.0 and 4.8 percent in 2004, 2005 and 2006,[179] even though it is considered to be well below Mexico's potential growth.[180] The International Monetary Fund predicts growth rates of 2.3% and 2.7% for 2018 and 2019, respectively.[175] By 2050, Mexico could potentially become the world's fifth or seventh largest economy.[181][182]\n\n\nThe electronics industry of Mexico has grown enormously within the last decade. Mexico has the sixth largest electronics industry in the world after China, the United States, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Mexico is the second-largest exporter of electronics to the United States where it exported $71.4 billion worth of electronics in 2011.[183] The Mexican electronics industry grew 20% between 2010 and 2011, up from its constant growth rate of 17% between 2003 and 2009.[183] Currently electronics represent 30% of Mexico's exports.[183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mexican Stock Exchange building, in Mexico City\n![](image)Headquarters of América Móvil in Mexico City, the largest mobile network operator outside Asia\nAs of April 2018, Mexico has the 15th largest nominal GDP (US$1.15 trillion)[175] and the 11th largest by purchasing power parity (US$2.45 trillion). GDP annual average growth was 2.9% in 2016 and 2% in 2017.[175] Agriculture has comprised 4% of the economy over the last two decades, while industry contributes 33% (mostly automotive, oil, and electronics) and services (notably financial services and tourism) contribute 63%.[175] Mexico's GDP in PPP per capita was US$18,714.05. The World Bank reported in 2009 that the country's gross national income in market exchange rates was the second highest in Latin America, after Brazil at US$1,830.392 billion,[176] which led to the highest income per capita in the region at $15,311.[177][178]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** Paweł Bożyk (2006). \"Newly Industrialized Countries\". *Globalization and the Transformation of Foreign Economic Policy*.

Some of Mexico's native culinary ingredients include: maize, tomato, beans, squash, chocolate, vanilla, avocado, guava, chayote, epazote, camote, jícama, nopal, zucchini, tejocote, huitlacoche, sapote, mamey sapote, and a great variety of chiles, such as the habanero and the jalapeño.

As of 2010, Pentecostal churches together have more than 1.3 million adherents, which in net numbers place them as the second Christian creed in Mexico.

Mines produce gold, silver, zinc, cobalt and nickel.[187] The agricultural sector accounts for about two-fifths of exports, and half of the labor force. Organic coffee, sugar, textiles, fresh vegetables, and bananas are the country's main exports.

Critics say that this development leads to higher prices for staple foods like corn, a major ingredient in the Guatemalan diet. As a consequence of the subsidization of US American corn, Guatemala imports nearly half of its corn from the United States that is using 40 percent of its crop harvest for biofuel production.[185] In 2014, the government was considering ways to legalize poppy and marijuana production, hoping to tax production and use tax revenues to fund drug prevention programs and other social projects.[186]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Most indigenous Guatemalans (41.7% of the national population) are of the Maya people, namely K'iche' (11.0% of the total population), Q'eqchi (8.3%), Kaqchikel (7.8%), Mam (5.2%), and \"other Maya\" (7.6%). 2% of the national population is indigenous non-Maya. 1.8% of the population is Xinca (mesoamerican), and 0.1% of the population is Garifuna (African/Carib mix).[203] \"However, indigenous rights activists put the indigenous figure closer to 61 per cent.\"\n[204]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe estimated median age in Guatemala is 20 years old, 19.4 for males and 20.7 years for females.[180] Guatemala is demographically one of the youngest countries in the Western Hemisphere, comparable to most of central Africa and Iraq.

As a consequence of the subsidization of US American corn, Guatemala imports nearly half of its corn from the United States that is using 40 percent of its crop harvest for biofuel production.[185] In 2014, the government was considering ways to legalize poppy and marijuana production, hoping to tax production and use tax revenues to fund drug prevention programs and other social projects.[186]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Subsequently, Guatemala received waves of immigration from Europe in the mid 19th century and early 20th century.[*clarification needed*] Primarily from Germany, these immigrants installed coffee and cardamom fincas in Alta Verapaz, Zacapa, Quetzaltenango, Baja Verapaz and Izabal.

According to the 2018 Census conducted by the National Institute of Statistics (INE), 56% of the population is Ladino reflecting mixed indigenous and European heritage.[203] Indigenous Guatemalans are 43.6% of the national population, which is one of the largest percentages in Latin America, behind only Peru and Bolivia. Most indigenous Guatemalans (41.7% of the national population) are of the Maya people, namely K'iche' (11.0% of the total population), Q'eqchi (8.3%), Kaqchikel (7.8%), Mam (5.2%), and \"other Maya\" (7.6%). 2% of the national population is indigenous non-Maya. 1.8% of the population is Xinca (mesoamerican), and 0.1% of the population is Garifuna (African/Carib mix).[203] \"However, indigenous rights activists put the indigenous figure closer to 61 per cent.\"\n[204]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe estimated median age in Guatemala is 20 years old, 19.4 for males and 20.7 years for females.[180] Guatemala is demographically one of the youngest countries in the Western Hemisphere, comparable to most of central Africa and Iraq.
