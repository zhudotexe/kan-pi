{"id": "05451952c20e474b", "answer": "### Digital camera\n\nA **digital camera** is a camera that captures photographs in digital memory. Most cameras produced today are digital, largely replacing those that capture images on photographic film. Digital cameras are now widely incorporated into mobile devices like smartphones with the same or more capabilities and features of dedicated cameras (which are still available). High-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals and those who desire to take higher-quality photographs.\n\n### History\n\n#### Early digital cameras\n\nThe first semiconductor image sensor was the charge-coupled device (CCD), invented by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969, based on MOS capacitor technology. The NMOS active-pixel sensor was later invented by Tsutomu Nakamura's team at Olympus in 1985, which led to the development of the CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1993.\n\nIn the 1960s, Eugene F. Lally of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was thinking about how to use a mosaic photosensor to capture digital images. His idea was to take pictures of the planets and stars while travelling through space to give information about the astronauts' position. As with Texas Instruments employee Willis Adcock's film-less camera (US patent 4,057,830) in 1972, the technology had yet to catch up with the concept.\n\nIn 1972, Thomas McCord from MIT and James Westphal from Cal Tech together developed a digital camera for use with telescopes. Their 1972 \"photometer-digitizer system\" used an analog-to-digital converter and a digital frame memory to store 256 x 256-pixel images of planets and stars, which were then recorded on digital magnetic tape.\n\nThe Cromemco Cyclops was an all-digital camera introduced as a commercial product in 1975. Its design was published as a hobbyist construction project in the February 1975 issue of *Popular Electronics* magazine. It used a 32\u200532 metal\u2009oxide\u2009semiconductor (MOS) image sensor, which was a modified MOS dynamic RAM (DRAM) memory chip.\n\nAlso in 1972, Steven Sasson, an engineer at Eastman Kodak, built a self-contained electronic camera that used a monochrome Fairchild CCD image sensor in 1975. Around the same time, Fujifilm began developing CCD technology in the 1970s. Early uses were mainly military and scientific; followed by medical and news applications.\n\nThe first filmless SLR (single lens reflex) camera was publicly demonstrated by Sony in August 1981. The Sony \"Mavica\" (magnetic still video camera) used a color-striped 2/3\" format CCD sensor with 280K pixels, along with analogue video signal processing and recording. The Mavica electronic still camera recorded FM modulated analog video signals on a newly developed 2\" magnetic floppy disk, dubbed the \"Mavipak\". The disk format was later standardized as the \"Still Video Floppy\", or \"SVF\".\n\n#### Film cameras\n\nFilm camera sales hit their peak at about 37 million units in 1997, while digital camera sales began in 1989. By 2008, the film camera market had died and digital camera sales hit their peak at 121 million units in 2010. In 2002, cell phones with an integrated camera had been introduced and in 2003 the cell phone with an integrated camera had sold 80 million units per year. By 2011, cell phones with an integrated camera were selling hundreds of millions per year, which were causing a decline in digital cameras. In 2015, digital camera sales were 35 million units or only less than a third of digital camera sales numbers at their peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number at their peak.\n\n### Connectivity\n\n#### Transferring photos\n\nMany digital cameras can connect directly to a computer to transfer data:\n\n- **Onboard (internal) flash memory**: Some cameras use internal flash memory to store images temporarily.\n- **SuperDisk (LS120)**: Used in two Panasonic digital cameras, the PV-SD4090 and PV-SD5000, which allowed them to use both SuperDisk and 3.5\" floppy disks.\n- **PC Card hard drives**: Early professional cameras (discontinued).\n- **Thermal printer**: Known only in one model of camera that printed images immediately rather than storing.\n- **Zink technology**: Printing images immediately rather than storing.\n\nMost cameras produced today are digital, largely replacing those that capture images on photographic film. Digital cameras are now widely incorporated into mobile devices like smartphones with the same or more capabilities and features of dedicated cameras (which are still available). High-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals and those who desire to take higher-quality photographs.\n\n### Image sensors\n\nThe two major types of digital image sensors are CCD and CMOS. A CCD sensor has one amplifier for all the pixels, while each pixel in a CMOS active-pixel sensor has its own amplifier. Compared to CCDs, CMOS sensors use less power. Cameras with a small sensor use a back-side-illuminated CMOS (BSI-CMOS) sensor. The image processing capabilities of the camera determine the outcome of the final image quality much more than the sensor type.\n\n### Integration into other devices\n\nIn an inversion, some phone makers have introduced smartphones with cameras designed to resemble traditional digital cameras. In 2012, Nikon and Samsung released the Coolpix S800c and Galaxy Camera, the first two digital cameras to run the Android operating system. Since this software platform is used in many smartphones, they can integrate with some of the same services (such as e-mail attachments, social networks and photo sharing sites) that smartphones do and use other Android-compatible software.\n\nSmartphones with integrated digital cameras were introduced in Japan in 2001 by J-Phone. In 2003 camera phones outsold stand-alone digital cameras, and in 2006 they outsold film and digital stand-alone cameras. Five billion camera phones were sold in five years, and by 2007 more than half of the installed base of all mobile phones were camera phones. Sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008.\n\n### Notable digital camera manufacturers\n\nMain article: List of digital camera brands\n\n### Market trends\n\nDigital cameras come in a wide range of sizes, prices, and capabilities. In addition to general-purpose digital cameras, specialized cameras including multispectral imaging equipment and astrographs are used for scientific, military, medical, and other special purposes.\n\nDigital and digital movie cameras share an optical system, typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device. The diaphragm and shutter admit a controlled amount of light to the image, just as with film, but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory. Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound. Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing.\n\nDigital cameras utilize either proprietary or standard consumer batteries. As of March 2014, most cameras use proprietary lithium-ion batteries while some use standard AA batteries or primarily use a proprietary Lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack but have an optional AA battery holder available.\n\nDigital cameras have become smaller over time, resulting in an ongoing need to develop a battery small enough to fit in the camera and yet able to power it for a reasonable length of time.\n\n### Proprietary\n\nThe most common class of battery used in digital cameras is proprietary battery formats. These are built to a manufacturer's custom specifications. Almost all proprietary batteries are lithium-ion. In addition to being available from the OEM, aftermarket replacement batteries are commonly available for most camera models.\n\n### Standard consumer batteries\n\nOne disadvantage of mirrorless cameras compared to a typical DSLR is its battery life due to the energy consumption of the electronic viewfinder, but this can be mitigated by a setting inside the camera in some models.\n\nOlympus and Panasonic released many Micro Four Thirds cameras with interchangeable lenses that are fully compatible with each other without any adapter, while others have proprietary mounts. In 2014, Kodak released its first Micro Four Third system camera.\n\nAs of March 2014, mirrorless cameras are fast becoming appealing to both amateurs and professionals alike due to their simplicity, compatibility", "question": "Identify the inventors of five key 20th-century inventions: the airplane, the internet, the personal computer, the mobile phone, and the digital camera.", "log_dir": "/mnt/nlpgpu-io1/data/andrz/redel/experiments/fanoutqa/mistral/baseline/05451952c20e474b"}

{"id": "a46a16ef82d421f7", "answer": "Romans who inhabited the island of Malta were known as the Phoenicians. They were involved in smuggling activities, trading with other Mediterranean peoples, and were known for piracy. The Romans left a significant influence on the island, including introducing Christianity and building many of the island's early structures, such as the Temple of Apollo and the Basilica of St. Paul.[1] The Roman period also saw the establishment of the city of Melita (modern-day Mdina), which became an important commercial and administrative center during the Roman era.[2] After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Malta became part of the Byzantine Empire and was eventually conquered by the Arabs in the 9th century.[3] The Normans, who ruled Malta from 1194 to 1266, greatly influenced the island's development, including the construction of many fortifications and the establishment of a feudal system.[4] The Knights of St. John, who ruled Malta from 1530 to 1523, further developed the island, making Maltese a vassal state of the Holy Roman Empire.[5] The island was eventually passed on to the Republic of Venice in 1480, becoming part of the Venetian Empire until its dissolution in 1797.[6] After a brief period of French rule, Malta became an independent republic in 1964.[7] The island's strategic location in the Mediterranean has made it a valuable base for various powers throughout history, and its unique culture and history have shaped its identity.[8]", "question": "What are the official languages of the five smallest countries in Europe by land area?", "log_dir": "/mnt/nlpgpu-io1/data/andrz/redel/experiments/fanoutqa/mistral/baseline/a46a16ef82d421f7"}

{"id": "9079b63f36e57692", "answer": "### Description\nThe **Parthenon** is an ancient Greek temple in Athens, Greece, dedicated to the goddess Athena. It was built in the fifth century BC and is considered one of the finest examples of Greek architecture. The temple is a peripteral octastyle Doric temple with Ionic architectural features. It stands on a platform or stylobate of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of post and lintel construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an entablature. There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and seventeen on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the *cella,* which is divided into two compartments. The *opisthodomos* (the back room of the cella) contained the monetary contributions of the Delian League. At either end of the building, the gable is finished with a triangular pediment originally occupied by sculpted figures.[63]\n\n### History\nThe **Parthenon** was built primarily by men who knew how to work marble. These quarrymen had exceptional skills and were able to cut the blocks of marble to very specific measurements. The quarrymen also knew how to avoid the faults, which were numerous in the Pentelic marble. If the marble blocks were not up to standard, the architects would reject them. The marble was worked with iron tools \\u2013 picks, points, punches, chisels, and drills. The quarrymen would hold their tools against the marble block and firmly tap the surface of the rock.[62]\n\nA big project like the Parthenon attracted stonemasons from far and wide who travelled to Athens to assist in the project. Slaves and foreigners worked together with the Athenian citizens in the building of the Parthenon, doing the same jobs for the same pay. Temple building was a specialized craft, and there were not many men in Greece qualified to build temples like the Parthenon, so these men would travel and work where they were needed.[62]\n\nIn March 2022, the Acropolis Museum launched a new website with \\\"photographs of all the frieze blocks preserved today in the Acropolis Museum, the British Museum and the Louvre\\\".[79]\n\n### Destruction\nThe **Parthenon** was destroyed in 480 BC when the Persians sacked Athens. It was partially restored in 1885-1890 during the excavations of Bert Hodge Hill. Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step D\\u00f6rpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at 23.51 by 66.888 metres (77.13\\u00a0ft \\u00d7\\u00a0219.45\\u00a0ft).[143]\n\n### Sources\n* *Queyrel, Fran\\u00e7ois (2008). *Le Parth\\u00e9non: un monument dans l'Histoire*, Paris, \\u00c9ditions Bartillat, 2020, pp. 199\\u2013200.\n* *Sakis, Ioannidis (5 May 2019). \\\"Parthenon's Inner Sanctum to be Restored\\\". *Greece Is*.

{"id": "14b7db2b18bf897c", "answer": "I found the list of the highest mountains of Pakistan.\n\nPakistan is home to 108 peaks above 7,000 meters and 4,555 above 6,000 m. There is no count of the peaks above 5,000 and 4,000 m. Five of the 14 highest independent peaks in the world (the eight-thousanders) are in Pakistan (four of which lie in the surroundings of Concordia; the confluence of Baltoro Glacier and Godwin Austen Glacier). Most of the highest peaks in Pakistan lie in the Karakoram mountain range (which lies almost entirely in the Gilgit\u2013Baltistan region of Pakistan, and is considered to be a separate range from Himalayan range) but some peaks above 7,000 m are included in the Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges. Moreover, Pakistan is home to over 7,000 glaciers, more than anywhere except the polar regions.\n\nThe list is an incomplete list of mountains in Pakistan. There are many named and unnamed peaks in Pakistan that are currently not included in this list. The list also includes many peaks that are not usually classed as independent mountains, but instead are considered sub-peaks of other mountains, due to having low topographic prominence (the height of a peak above the highest saddle connecting it to a higher summit). Also, many of the elevations listed are approximate, due to imprecise and inconsistent surveys. The ranks in the peaks above 7,000 metres (23,000\u00a0ft) are derived from the list of highest mountains.\n\nThe dividing line between a mountain with multiple peaks and separate mountains is not always clear (see Highest unclimbed mountain). A common threshold is to define a mountain as a summit with 300 m prominence (1,000\u00a0ft; also 10 traditional rope lengths). Alternatively, a relative prominence (prominence or height) is used (usually 7\u20138%) to reflect that in higher mountain ranges everything is on a larger scale. The list of highest mountains ranks the highest 100 summits with at least 500 m prominence, approximating a 7% relative prominence. A drawback of a prominence-based list is that it may exclude peaks commonly thought of as mountains that are connected via a high ridge to a taller summit. Many such peaks and mountains with less than sufficient prominence are included but not numbered in the list.\n\nIt is very unlikely that all the heights given are correct to the nearest meter; indeed, problems of definition of sea level can arise when a mountain is remote from the sea. Different sources often differ by many meters, and many mountains in the Karakorum differ by over 100 metres on different maps. These discrepancies serve to emphasise the uncertainties in the listed heights.\n\nMost of the highest mountains in Pakistan are located in the Karakoram range (the highest of which is K2, globally ranked 2nd, 8611m), some high mountains are in Himalaya (the highest of which is Nanga Parbat, globally ranked 9th, 8126 m) and Hindu Kush (the highest of which is Tirich Mir, globally ranked 33rd, 7708 m).\n\nThe locations of the highest mountains are shown on the composite satellite image of Karakoram and Hindu Kush below. The numbers refer to the global ranking in this \"List of highest mountains\". For clarity, lower peaks with labels overlapping higher peaks are left out of the main image.\n\nMost of the high peaks in Pakistan lie specifically in Gilgit\u2013Baltistan with the exception of a few 7,000+ m peaks in the high Hindu Kush (the peaks marked in the northwest most region of Pakistan).\n\nThe peak marked as number 9 is Nanga Parbat (8,125 m), which is the 2nd highest Himalayan peak in Pakistan. All other peaks above 8,000m are in the Baltoro Muztagh subrange of Karakoram.\n\n| World Rank | Rank (Pakistan) | Name | Height (m) | Location |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2 | 1 | K2 | 8611 | Karakoram |\n| 9 | 2 | Nanga Parbat | 8126 | Himalaya |\n| 11 | 3 | Gasherbrum I (K5) | 8080 | Karakoram |\n| 12 | 4 | Broad Peak | 8051 | Karakoram |\n| 13 | 5 | Gasherbrum II (K4) | 8035 | Karakoram |", "question": "Which of the world's five highest mountains were first successfully climbed by British mountaineers?", "log_dir": "/mnt/nlpgpu-io1/data/andrz/redel/experiments/fanoutqa/mistral/baseline/14b7db2b18bf897c"}
