The presidency is a part of the system of people's congress based on the principle of unified power in which the National People's Congress (NPC) functions as the only branch of government and as the highest state organ of power. The presidency is a state organ of the NPC and equivalent to, for instance, the State Council and the National Supervisory Commission, rather than a political office, unlike the premier of the State Council. Together with the NPC Standing Committee, the presidency performs certain heads of state functions. The president can engage in state affairs with the consent of the NPC Standing Committee. While the presidency is not a powerful organ in itself, since 27 March 1993, the president has concurrently served as general secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and chairman of the Central Military Commission, making the incumbent China's paramount leader and commander-in-chief.\n\n\nThe first state representative of the People's Republic of China was the chairman of the Central People's Government, which was established on 1 October 1949 by a decision of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It was replaced in Constitution in 1954 with the office of state chairman. It was successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant. The post of chairman was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, and the function of state representative was bestowed on the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. The office was reinstated in the Constitution of 1982 but with reduced powers. Since 1982, the title's official English-language translation has been \"president\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.[note 1]\n\n\nDuring the Mao era, there were no term limits for the presidency. Between 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. In 2018, term limits were abolished in order to align the presidency with the position of CCP general secretary, which does not have term limits. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Establishment in 1954[edit]\n\n\nThe office of state chairman (the original English translation) was first established under the 1954 Constitution.[2] Though the ceremonial powers of the office were largely identical to those in the current Constitution, the powers of the 1954 office differed from those of the current office in two areas: military and governmental.[2] The state chairman's military powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China commands the armed forces of the state, and is chairman of the National Defence Council (Chinese: 国防委员会).\"[2] The National Defence Council was unique to the 1954 Constitution, and was mandated as the civil command for the People's Liberation Army. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution.\n\n\nThe state chairman's governmental powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China, whenever necessary, convenes a Supreme State Conference (Chinese: 最高国务会议) and acts as its chairman.\"[2] The members of the Supreme State Conference included the main officers of state, and its views were to be presented to the main organs of state and government, including the National People's Congress and the State and National Defense Councils.[2] The Supreme State Conference was also unique to the 1954 Constitution. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.\n\n\n\n### History up to 1974[edit]\n\n\nCCP Chairman Mao Zedong was the first to hold the office of state chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1954. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by Liu Shaoqi, first-ranked Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Liu was reelected as state chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of state chairman. This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.[*citation needed*] After Liu's removal in 1968, the office of state chairman was vacant. From 1972 to 1975, however, state media referred to Vice State Chairman Dong Biwu as \"acting state chairman\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Abolition in 1975[edit]\n\n\nWhen the 4th NPC was convened in 1975, its main act was to adopt a new Constitution which eliminated the office of state chairman and emphasized instead the leadership of the Communist Party over the state, including an article that made the CCP chairman supreme commander of the PLA in concurrence as chairman of the party CMC, while the duties of state representative were transferred to the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.[3] The 5th NPC was convened two years early, in 1978, and a third Constitution was adopted, which also lacked the office of state chairman, but did place a greater emphasis on the ceremonial roles performed by the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress as state representative.[4][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Restoration in 1982[edit]\n\n\nWhen it was agreed to amend the constitution again in 1980, questions to whether to restore the presidency arose. Research showed that having the NPCSC chairman as the national representative created problems, as the position was equivalent to the speaker of parliament in other countries. Deng Xiaoping agreed to restore the presidency, but without powers in specific government affairs.[4]\n\n\nThe office was reinstated in the fourth Constitution, adopted by the 5th Session of the 5th NPC in 1982.[4] In the 1982 Constitution, the party developed policy while the state executed it, and the president was conceived of as a ceremonial and replacement figure with a role similar to that of equivalent of figurehead presidents in parliamentary republics. Actual state power was vested in the general secretary of the Communist Party, the premier, and the chairman of the Central Military Commission. As part of the effort to prevent another leader from rising above the party as Mao had done, all four posts were intended to be held by separate people. The president therefore performed ceremonial duties such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff, and did not intervene in the affairs of the State Council or the party. The constitution also mandated term limits for the office, stipulating the president and vice president could not serve more than two consecutive terms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe posts of the premier, president and CCP general secretary were held by different individuals in the 1980s. That said, in reality political power was concentrated on Deng Xiaoping, effectively the paramount leader, who controlled the Party, government and the military from \"behind the scenes\" without holding any of the three posts. However, presidents Li Xiannian (1983–1988) and Yang Shangkun (1988–1993) were not simple figureheads, but actually significant players in the highest leadership. They derived most of their power from being amongst the Eight Elders, rather than the office of president.[5]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict between Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, was terminated. In 1993, Jiang Zemin, who had been general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Commission since 1989, assumed the presidency as well, becoming the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.[6][7] Jiang stepped down as president in 2003, handing the post to then–Vice President Hu Jintao, the first vice president to assume the office. Hu had already become general secretary in 2002. In turn, Hu vacated both offices for Xi Jinping in 2012 and 2013, who had also previously served as vice president under Hu.[8]\n\n\nOn March 11, 2018, the first session of the 13th National People's Congress, by a vote of 2,958 in favor, two opposed and three abstaining, passed a constitutional amendment that removed the previous term limits for the president and the vice president.[9] Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align the presidency with his more powerful posts of general secretary of the party and CMC chairman, which do not have term limits.[10]\n\n\n\n## Selection[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle 79 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for being elected for the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\n\n\n\n* be a Chinese citizen;\n* have the right to vote and stand for election;\n* be at least 45 years old.[11][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n### Election[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Organic Law of the National People's Congress (NPC), constitutionally China's highest organ of state power, the president is nominated by the NPC Presidium, the Congress's executive organ.[12][*non-primary source needed*] However, the nomination is effectively made by the Chinese Communist Party, with the decisions being made among Party leaders.[13] Although the Presidium could theoretically nominate multiple candidates for the presidency, leading the election to be competitive, it has always nominated a single candidate for the office.[13]\n\n\nAfter the nomination, the president is elected by the NPC, which also has the power to remove the president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[11][*non-primary source needed*] The length of the president's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years.[11] Since 2018, the president is required to recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[13]\n\n\n\n## Powers and duties[edit]\n\n\nThe president functions as the state representative of the PRC as well as the supreme representative of China both internally and externally.[14] According to the constitution, the presidency is not a position but a state institution that represents the PRC in state activities, but the presidency is served by one person.[4][*better source needed*]\n\n\nUnder the current constitution, instated in 1982 with minor revisions in later years, the president has the power to promulgate laws, select and dismiss the premier (head of government), vice premiers, state councilors as well as ministers of the State Council, grant presidential pardons, declare states of emergency, issue mass mobilization orders, and issue state honors. In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, and signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the National People's Congress (NPC),[11][*non-primary source needed*] which the office is subject to.[14]\n\n\nThe president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic.[note 2] Under the constitution, the \"state visit\" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the NPC. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of state. It is therefore conceived to mainly function as a symbolic institution of the state rather than an office with true executive powers.[15][16][17]\n\n\nIn theory, the president has discretion over the selection of the premier, though in practice the premier has historically been selected through the top-level discussions of the Chinese Communist Party. Upon the nomination of the premier, the NPC convenes to confirm the nomination, but since only one name is on the ballot, it can only approve or reject. To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination.[18] Since the premier, the head of government in China, is the most important political appointment in the Chinese government, the nomination power, under some circumstances, may give the president real political influence.[19]\n\n\nThe director of the Office of the President of the PRC (Chinese: 中华人民共和国主席办公室; pinyin: *Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó Zhǔxí Bàngōngshì*) is Cai Qi, who is also the director of the CCP General Office and the director of the CCP General Secretary Office.[20]\n\n\n\n## Political ranking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orders of precedence in China\n\nThe political ranking of the presidency has changed throughout the decades, influenced by the officeholder of the time. 2nd President Liu Shaoqi was also the first-ranked vice chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and ranked second in the Chinese Communist Party, behind CCP Chairman Mao Zedong.[21] President Li Xiannian was also the 5th ranked member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the CCP general secretary and Chinese premier.[22] President Yang Shangkun was not a member of CCP Politburo Standing Committee, but he ranked third after CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang/Jiang Zemin and CMC Chairman Deng Xiaoping.[23] Since Jiang Zemin's accession to the office in 1993, the president has also the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, ranking first in party and state.[24]\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n## Post title[edit]\n\n\nThe title of the office (Chinese: 国家主席; pinyin: *Guójiā Zhǔxí*), which literally translates to \"state chairman\", was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" has been adopted since 1982, instead of \"Chairman of the People's Republic of China\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Order of succession[edit]\n\n\nArticle 84 of the Constitution of China. If the office of president falls vacant, then the vice president succeeds to the office. If both offices fall vacant, then the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee temporarily acts as president until the NPC can elect a new president and vice president.[25]\n\n\n\n## List of state representatives[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of state representatives of the People's Republic of China.\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n### Chairmen[edit]\n\n\n* ![Mao Zedong (27 September 1954 – 27 April 1959; Chairman of the Central People's Government 1 October 1949 – 27 September 1954)](image)\n\n**Mao Zedong**  \n(27 September 1954 –  \n27 April 1959;  \n*Chairman of the Central People's Government*  \n1 October 1949 –  \n27 September 1954)\n* ![Liu Shaoqi (27 April 1959 – 31 October 1968)](image)\n\n**Liu Shaoqi**  \n(27 April 1959 –  \n31 October 1968)\n* ![Dong Biwu (Vice-Chairman acted as the Chairman 31 October 1968 – 24 February 1972; Acted Chairman 24 February 1972 – 17 January 1975)](image)\n\n**Dong Biwu**  \n(*Vice-Chairman acted as the Chairman*  \n31 October 1968 –  \n24 February 1972;  \n*Acted Chairman*  \n24 February 1972 –  \n17 January 1975)\n* ![Song Qingling (Vice-Chairwoman acted as the Chairman 31 October 1968 – 24 February 1972; Honorary Chairwoman 16 May 1981 – present, died 29 May 1981)](image)\n\n**Song Qingling**  \n(*Vice-Chairwoman acted as the Chairman*  \n31 October 1968 –  \n24 February 1972;  \n*Honorary Chairwoman*  \n16 May 1981 – present,  \ndied 29 May 1981)\n\n\n### Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress[edit]\n\n\n* ![Zhu De (17 January 1975 – 6 July 1976)](image)\n\n**Zhu De**  \n(17 January 1975 –  \n6 July 1976)\n* ![Song Qingling (Acting Chairman 6 July 1976 – 5 March 1978)](image)\n\n**Song Qingling**  \n(*Acting Chairman*  \n6 July 1976 –  \n5 March 1978)\n* ![Ye Jianying (5 March 1978 – 18 June 1983)](image)\n\n**Ye Jianying**  \n(5 March 1978 –  \n18 June 1983)\n\n\n### Presidents[edit]\n\n\n* ![Li Xiannian (18 June 1983 – 8 April 1988)](image)\n\n**Li Xiannian**  \n(18 June 1983 –  \n8 April 1988)\n* ![Yang Shangkun (8 April 1988 – 27 March 1993)](image)\n\n**Yang Shangkun**  \n(8 April 1988 –  \n27 March 1993)\n* ![Jiang Zemin (27 March 1993 – 15 March 2003)](image)\n\n**Jiang Zemin**  \n(27 March 1993 –  \n15 March 2003)\n* ![Hu Jintao (15 March 2003 – 14 March 2013)](image)\n\n**Hu Jintao**  \n(15 March 2003 –  \n14 March 2013)\n* ![Xi Jinping (14 March 2013 – present)](image)\n\n**Xi Jinping**  \n(14 March 2013 –  \npresent)\n\n\n### Statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| #\n | President\n | Date of birth\n | Age at ascension(first term) | Time in office(total) | Age at retirement(last term) | Date of death\n | Longevity\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Zedong, MaoMao Zedong | 1893122626 December 1893(26 December 1893) | 60 27560 years, 275 days\n | 04 2124 years, 212 days\n | 64 12264 years, 122 days\n | 197609099 September 1976\n | 30,20782 years, 258 days\n |\n| 2\n | Shaoqi, LiuLiu Shaoqi | 1898112424 November 1898(24 November 1898) | 60 15460 years, 154 days\n | 09 1879 years, 187 days\n | 69 34269 years, 342 days\n | 1969111212 November 1969\n | 25,92070 years, 353 days\n |\n| Presidency vacant\n |\n| *acting* | Biwu, DongDong Biwu | 188603055 March 1886(5 March 1886) | 85 35685 years, 356 days\n | 02 3272 years, 327 days\n | 88 31888 years, 318 days\n | 197504022 April 1975\n | 32,53489 years, 28 days\n |\n| *Hon.* | Ching-ling, SoongSoong Ching-ling | 1893012727 January 1893(27 January 1893) | 83 16188 years, 109 days\n | 01 242Honorary[26][27] | –\n85 037\n | 1981052929 May 1981\n | 32,26388 years, 122 days\n |\n| Presidency abolished\n |\n| 3\n | Xiannian, LiLi Xiannian | 1909062323 June 1909(23 June 1909) | 73 36073 years, 360 days\n | 04 2954 years, 295 days\n | 78 29078 years, 290 days\n | 1992062121 June 1992\n | 30,31482 years, 364 days\n |\n| 4\n | Shangkun, YangYang Shangkun | 190708033 August 1907(3 August 1907) | 80 25080 years, 250 days\n | 04 3524 years, 352 days\n | 85 23685 years, 236 days\n | 1998091414 September 1998\n | 33,28091 years, 42 days\n |\n| 5\n | Zemin, JiangJiang Zemin | 1926081717 August 1926(17 August 1926) | 66 22266 years, 222 days\n | 09 3539 years, 353 days\n | 76 21076 years, 210 days\n | 2022113030 November 2022\n | 35,16996 years, 105 days\n |\n| 6\n | Jintao, HuHu Jintao | 1942122121 December 1942(21 December 1942) | 60 08460 years, 84 days\n | 09 3649 years, 365 days\n | 70 08470 years, 84 days\n | Living\n | 29,76081 years, 175 days (Living)\n |\n| 7\n | Jinping, XiXi Jinping | 1953061515 June 1953(15 June 1953) | 59 years, 272 days\n | 11 years, 91 days (Incumbent)\n | Incumbent\n | Living\n | 25,93170 years, 364 days (Living)\n |\n\n\n## Spouse of the president[edit]\n\n\nSince the first president, six presidents have had a spouse during their term in office.

The presidency is a part of the system of people's congress based on the principle of unified power in which the National People's Congress (NPC) functions as the only branch of government and as the highest state organ of power. The presidency is a state organ of the NPC and equivalent to, for instance, the State Council and the National Supervisory Commission, rather than a political office, unlike the premier of the State Council. Together with the NPC Standing Committee, the presidency performs certain heads of state functions. The president can engage in state affairs with the consent of the NPC Standing Committee. While the presidency is not a powerful organ in itself, since 27 March 1993, the president has concurrently served as general secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and chairman of the Central Military Commission, making the incumbent China's paramount leader and commander-in-chief.\n\n\nThe first state representative of the People's Republic of China was the chairman of the Central People's Government, which was established on 1 October 1949 by a decision of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It was replaced in Constitution in 1954 with the office of state chairman. It was successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant. The post of chairman was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, and the function of state representative was bestowed on the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. The office was reinstated in the Constitution of 1982 but with reduced powers. Since 1982, the title's official English-language translation has been \"president\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.[note 1]\n\n\nDuring the Mao era, there were no term limits for the presidency. Between 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. In 2018, term limits were abolished in order to align the presidency with the position of CCP general secretary, which does not have term limits. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Establishment in 1954[edit]\n\n\nThe office of state chairman (the original English translation) was first established under the 1954 Constitution.[2] Though the ceremonial powers of the office were largely identical to those in the current Constitution, the powers of the 1954 office differed from those of the current office in two areas: military and governmental.[2] The state chairman's military powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China commands the armed forces of the state, and is chairman of the National Defence Council (Chinese: 国防委员会).\"[2] The National Defence Council was unique to the 1954 Constitution, and was mandated as the civil command for the People's Liberation Army. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution.\n\n\nThe state chairman's governmental powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China, whenever necessary, convenes a Supreme State Conference (Chinese: 最高国务会议) and acts as its chairman.\"[2] The members of the Supreme State Conference included the main officers of state, and its views were to be presented to the main organs of state and government, including the National People's Congress and the State and National Defense Councils.[2] The Supreme State Conference was also unique to the 1954 Constitution. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.\n\n\n\n### History up to 1974[edit]\n\n\nCCP Chairman Mao Zedong was the first to hold the office of state chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1954. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by Liu Shaoqi, first-ranked Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Liu was reelected as state chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of state chairman. This was in violation of the Constitution, which required a vote by the NPC to remove the state chairman.[*citation needed*] After Liu's removal in 1968, the office of state chairman was vacant. From 1972 to 1975, however, state media referred to Vice State Chairman Dong Biwu as \"acting state chairman\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Abolition in 1975[edit]\n\n\nWhen the 4th NPC was convened in 1975, its main act was to adopt a new Constitution which eliminated the office of state chairman and emphasized instead the leadership of the Communist Party over the state, including an article that made the CCP chairman supreme commander of the PLA in concurrence as chairman of the party CMC, while the duties of state representative were transferred to the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.[3] The 5th NPC was convened two years early, in 1978, and a third Constitution was adopted, which also lacked the office of state chairman, but did place a greater emphasis on the ceremonial roles performed by the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress as state representative.[4][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Restoration in 1982[edit]\n\n\nWhen it was agreed to amend the constitution again in 1980, questions to whether to restore the presidency arose. Research showed that having the NPCSC chairman as the national representative created problems, as the position was equivalent to the speaker of parliament in other countries. Deng Xiaoping agreed to restore the presidency, but without powers in specific government affairs.[4]\n\n\nThe office was reinstated in the fourth Constitution, adopted by the 5th Session of the 5th NPC in 1982.[4] In the 1982 Constitution, the party developed policy while the state executed it, and the president was conceived of as a ceremonial and replacement figure with a role similar to that of equivalent of figurehead presidents in parliamentary republics. Actual state power was vested in the general secretary of the Communist Party, the premier, and the chairman of the Central Military Commission. As part of the effort to prevent another leader from rising above the party as Mao had done, all four posts were intended to be held by separate people. The president therefore performed ceremonial duties such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff, and did not intervene in the affairs of the State Council or the party. The constitution also mandated term limits for the office, stipulating the president and vice president could not serve more than two consecutive terms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe posts of the premier, president and CCP general secretary were held by different individuals in the 1980s. That said, in reality political power was concentrated on Deng Xiaoping, effectively the paramount leader, who controlled the Party, government and the military from \"behind the scenes\" without holding any of the three posts. However, presidents Li Xiannian (1983–1988) and Yang Shangkun (1988–1993) were not simple figureheads, but actually significant players in the highest leadership. They derived most of their power from being amongst the Eight Elders, rather than the office of president.[5]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the experiment of separating party and state posts, which led to conflict between Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, was terminated. In 1993, Jiang Zemin, who had been general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the Central Military Commission since 1989, assumed the presidency as well, becoming the undisputed top leader of the party and the state.[6][7] Jiang stepped down as president in 2003, handing the post to then–Vice President Hu Jintao, the first vice president to assume the office. Hu had already become general secretary in 2002. In turn, Hu vacated both offices for Xi Jinping in 2012 and 2013, who had also previously served as vice president under Hu.[8]\n\n\nOn March 11, 2018, the first session of the 13th National People's Congress, by a vote of 2,958 in favor, two opposed and three abstaining, passed a constitutional amendment that removed the previous term limits for the president and the vice president.[9] Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align the presidency with his more powerful posts of general secretary of the party and CMC chairman, which do not have term limits.[10]\n\n\n\n## Selection[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle 79 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for being elected for the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\n\n\n\n* be a Chinese citizen;\n* have the right to vote and stand for election;\n* be at least 45 years old.[11][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n### Election[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Organic Law of the National People's Congress (NPC), constitutionally China's highest organ of state power, the president is nominated by the NPC Presidium, the Congress's executive organ.[12][*non-primary source needed*] However, the nomination is effectively made by the Chinese Communist Party, with the decisions being made among Party leaders.[13] Although the Presidium could theoretically nominate multiple candidates for the presidency, leading the election to be competitive, it has always nominated a single candidate for the office.[13]\n\n\nAfter the nomination, the president is elected by the NPC, which also has the power to remove the president and other state officers from office. Elections and removals are decided by majority vote.[11][*non-primary source needed*] The length of the president's term of office is the same as the NPC, which is 5 years.[11] Since 2018, the president is required to recite the constitutional oath of office before assuming office.[13]\n\n\n\n## Powers and duties[edit]\n\n\nThe president functions as the state representative of the PRC as well as the supreme representative of China both internally and externally.[14] According to the constitution, the presidency is not a position but a state institution that represents the PRC in state activities, but the presidency is served by one person.[4][*better source needed*]\n\n\nUnder the current constitution, instated in 1982 with minor revisions in later years, the president has the power to promulgate laws, select and dismiss the premier (head of government), vice premiers, state councilors as well as ministers of the State Council, grant presidential pardons, declare states of emergency, issue mass mobilization orders, and issue state honors. In addition, the president names and dismisses ambassadors to foreign countries, and signs and annuls treaties with foreign entities. According to the Constitution, all of these powers require the approval or confirmation of the National People's Congress (NPC),[11][*non-primary source needed*] which the office is subject to.[14]\n\n\nThe president also conducts state visits on behalf of the People's Republic.[note 2] Under the constitution, the \"state visit\" clause is the only presidential power that does not stipulate any form of oversight from the NPC. As the vast majority of presidential powers are dependent on the ratification of the NPC, the president is, in essence, a symbolic post without any direct say in the governance of state. It is therefore conceived to mainly function as a symbolic institution of the state rather than an office with true executive powers.[15][16][17]\n\n\nIn theory, the president has discretion over the selection of the premier, though in practice the premier has historically been selected through the top-level discussions of the Chinese Communist Party. Upon the nomination of the premier, the NPC convenes to confirm the nomination, but since only one name is on the ballot, it can only approve or reject. To date, it has never rejected a personnel nomination.[18] Since the premier, the head of government in China, is the most important political appointment in the Chinese government, the nomination power, under some circumstances, may give the president real political influence.[19]\n\n\nThe director of the Office of the President of the PRC (Chinese: 中华人民共和国主席办公室; pinyin: *Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó Zhǔxí Bàngōngshì*) is Cai Qi, who is also the director of the CCP General Office and the director of the CCP General Secretary Office.[20]\n\n\n\n## Political ranking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orders of precedence in China\n\nThe political ranking of the presidency has changed throughout the decades, influenced by the officeholder of the time. 2nd President Liu Shaoqi was also the first-ranked vice chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, and ranked second in the Chinese Communist Party, behind CCP Chairman Mao Zedong.[21] President Li Xiannian was also the 5th ranked member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the CCP general secretary and Chinese premier.[22] President Yang Shangkun was not a member of CCP Politburo Standing Committee, but he ranked third after CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang/Jiang Zemin and CMC Chairman Deng Xiaoping.[23] Since Jiang Zemin's accession to the office in 1993, the president has also the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, ranking first in party and state.[24]\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on**Orders of succession** |\n| Presidencies |\n| * Argentina\n* Austria\n* Brazil\n* Colombia\n* China\n* DR Congo\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Ireland\n* Republic of Korea\n* Mexico\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Romania\n* Sri Lanka\n* Taiwan\n* United States\n* Uruguay\n* Vietnam\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n## Post title[edit]\n\n\nThe title of the office (Chinese: 国家主席; pinyin: *Guójiā Zhǔxí*), which literally translates to \"state chairman\", was unchanged in the Chinese text, but a new English translation of \"President of the People's Republic of China\" has been adopted since 1982, instead of \"Chairman of the People's Republic of China\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Order of succession[edit]\n\n\nArticle 84 of the Constitution of China. If the office of president falls vacant, then the vice president succeeds to the office. If both offices fall vacant, then the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee temporarily acts as president until the NPC can elect a new president and vice president.[25]\n\n\n\n## List of state representatives[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of state representatives of the People's Republic of China.\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n### Chairmen[edit]\n\n\n* ![Mao Zedong (27 September 1954 – 27 April 1959; Chairman of the Central People's Government 1 October 1949 – 27 September 1954)](image)\n\n**Mao Zedong**  \n(27 September 1954 –  \n27 April 1959;  \n*Chairman of the Central People's Government*  \n1 October 1949 –  \n27 September 1954)\n* ![Liu Shaoqi (27 April 1959 – 31 October 1968)](image)\n\n**Liu Shaoqi**  \n(27 April 1959 –  \n31 October 1968)\n* ![Dong Biwu (Vice-Chairman acted as the Chairman 31 October 1968 – 24 February 1972; Acted Chairman 24 February 1972 – 17 January 1975)](image)\n\n**Dong Biwu**  \n(*Vice-Chairman acted as the Chairman*  \n31 October 1968 –  \n24 February 1972;  \n*Acted Chairman*  \n24 February 1972 –  \n17 January 1975)\n* ![Song Qingling (Vice-Chairwoman acted as the Chairman 31 October 1968 – 24 February 1972; Honorary Chairwoman 16 May 1981 – present, died 29 May 1981)](image)\n\n**Song Qingling**  \n(*Vice-Chairwoman acted as the Chairman*  \n31 October 1968 –  \n24 February 1972;  \n*Honorary Chairwoman*  \n16 May 1981 – present,  \ndied 29 May 1981)\n\n\n### Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress[edit]\n\n\n* ![Zhu De (17 January 1975 – 6 July 1976)](image)\n\n**Zhu De**  \n(17 January 1975 –  \n6 July 1976)\n* ![Song Qingling (Acting Chairman 6 July 1976 – 5 March 1978)](image)\n\n**Song Qingling**  \n(*Acting Chairman*  \n6 July 1976 –  \n5 March 1978)\n* ![Ye Jianying (5 March 1978 – 18 June 1983)](image)\n\n**Ye Jianying**  \n(5 March 1978 –  \n18 June 1983)\n\n\n### Presidents[edit]\n\n\n* ![Li Xiannian (18 June 1983 – 8 April 1988)](image)\n\n**Li Xiannian**  \n(18 June 1983 –  \n8 April 1988)\n* ![Yang Shangkun (8 April 1988 – 27 March 1993)](image)\n\n**Yang Shangkun**  \n(8 April 1988 –  \n27 March 1993)\n* ![Jiang Zemin (27 March 1993 – 15 March 2003)](image)\n\n**Jiang Zemin**  \n(27 March 1993 –  \n15 March 2003)\n* ![Hu Jintao (15 March 2003 – 14 March 2013)](image)\n\n**Hu Jintao**  \n(15 March 2003 –  \n14 March 2013)\n* ![Xi Jinping (14 March 2013 – present)](image)\n\n**Xi Jinping**  \n(14 March 2013 –  \npresent)\n\n\n### Statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| #\n | President\n | Date of birth\n | Age at ascension(first term) | Time in office(total) | Age at retirement(last term) | Date of death\n | Longevity\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Zedong, MaoMao Zedong | 1893122626 December 1893(26 December 1893) | 60 27560 years, 275 days\n | 04 2124 years, 212 days\n | 64 12264 years, 122 days\n | 197609099 September 1976\n | 30,20782 years, 258 days\n |\n| 2\n | Shaoqi, LiuLiu Shaoqi | 1898112424 November 1898(24 November 1898) | 60 15460 years, 154 days\n | 09 1879 years, 187 days\n | 69 34269 years, 342 days\n | 1969111212 November 1969\n | 25,92070 years, 353 days\n |\n| Presidency vacant\n |\n| *acting* | Biwu, DongDong Biwu | 188603055 March 1886(5 March 1886) | 85 35685 years, 356 days\n | 02 3272 years, 327 days\n | 88 31888 years, 318 days\n | 197504022 April 1975\n | 32,53489 years, 28 days\n |\n| *Hon.* | Ching-ling, SoongSoong Ching-ling | 1893012727 January 1893(27 January 1893) | 83 16188 years, 109 days\n | 01 242Honorary[26][27] | –\n85 037\n | 1981052929 May 1981\n | 32,26388 years, 122 days\n |\n| Presidency abolished\n |\n| 3\n | Xiannian, LiLi Xiannian | 1909062323 June 1909(23 June 1909) | 73 36073 years, 360 days\n | 04 2954 years, 295 days\n | 78 29078 years, 290 days\n | 1992062121 June 1992\n | 30,31482 years, 364 days\n |\n| 4\n | Shangkun, YangYang Shangkun | 190708033 August 1907(3 August 1907) | 80 25080 years, 250 days\n | 04 3524 years, 352 days\n | 85 23685 years, 236 days\n | 1998091414 September 1998\n | 33,28091 years, 42 days\n |\n| 5\n | Zemin, JiangJiang Zemin | 1926081717 August 1926(17 August 1926) | 66 22266 years, 222 days\n | 09 3539 years, 353 days\n | 76 21076 years, 210 days\n | 2022113030 November 2022\n | 35,16996 years, 105 days\n |\n| 6\n | Jintao, HuHu Jintao | 1942122121 December 1942(21 December 1942) | 60 08460 years, 84 days\n | 09 3649 years, 365 days\n | 70 08470 years, 84 days\n | Living\n | 29,76081 years, 175 days (Living)\n |\n| 7\n | Jinping, XiXi Jinping | 1953061515 June 1953(15 June 1953) | 59 years, 272 days\n | 11 years, 91 days (Incumbent)\n | Incumbent\n | Living\n | 25,93170 years, 364 days (Living)\n |\n\n\n## Spouse of the president[edit]\n\n\nSince the first president, six presidents have had a spouse during their term in office.

When parliament thinks fit it may accord additional executive powers to the president per Article 70 which may be further delegated by the president to the governors of states per Article 160.

In particular, Presidents have made a number of interventions into government and lawmaking, which have established and challenged some conventions concerning presidential intervention.\n\n\n\n### Proving majority in the parliament[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vote of confidence\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## President vs Prime minister[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe nomination of a candidate for election to the office of the president must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders. Each candidate has to make a security deposit of ₹15,000 (US$180) in the Reserve Bank of India.[46] The security deposit is liable to be forfeited in case the candidate fails to secure one-sixth of the votes polled.\n\n\nThe election is held in accordance with the system of proportional representation (PR) by means of the instant-runoff voting (IRV) method.[47] The voting takes place by a secret ballot system. The manner of election of President is provided by Article 55 of the constitution.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952,[44] a candidate to be nominated for the office of president needs 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders for their name to appear on the ballot.[45]\n\n\n\n## Time of election[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president appoints as prime minister, the person most likely to command the support of the majority in the Lok Sabha (usually the leader of the majority party or coalition). The president then appoints the other members of the Council of Ministers, distributing portfolios to them on the advice of the prime minister.[20]: 72 The Council of Ministers remains in power at the 'pleasure' of the president.\n\n\nThe president appoints 12 members of the Rajya Sabha from amongst persons who have special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as literature, science, art and social service. The president may nominate not more than two members of Anglo Indian community as Lok Sabha members per Article 331, which was removed in 2019.\n\n\nGovernors of states are also appointed by the president who shall work at the pleasure of the president. Per Article 156, the president is empowered to dismiss a governor who has violated the constitution in their acts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe president of India used to receive ₹10,000 (US$100) per month per the Second Schedule of the constitution. This amount was increased to ₹50,000 (equivalent to ₹230,000 or US$2,700 in 2023) in 1998. On 11 September 2008, the Government of India increased the salary of the president to ₹1.5 lakh (equivalent to ₹4.2 lakh or US$5,000 in 2023). This amount was further increased to ₹5 lakh (equivalent to ₹6.7 lakh or US$8,000 in 2023) in the 2018 Union budget of India. However, almost everything that the president does or wants to do is taken care of by an annual ₹225 million (equivalent to ₹630 million or US$7.5 million in 2023) budget that the Government allots for their upkeep.[52] Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president's official residence, is the largest Presidential palace in the world.[53][54] The Rashtrapati Nilayam at Bolarum, Hyderabad and Retreat Building at Chharabra, Shimla are the official Retreat Residences of the president of India. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo meet the contingency of an election to the office of President not being completed in time due to unforeseen circumstances like countermanding of an election due to death of a candidate or on account of the postponement of the poll for any valid reason, Article 56(1)(c) provides that the president shall, notwithstanding the expiration of their term, continue to hold office until their successor enters into office.\n\n\n\n### Conditions for the presidency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electoral College (India)\n\nCertain conditions, per Article 59 of the Indian constitution, debar an otherwise eligible citizen from contesting the presidential elections.

The president summons both the houses (Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha) of the parliament and prorogues them.

The president shall not accept any actions of the executive or legislature which are unconstitutional. The president is the foremost, most empowered and prompt defender of the constitution (Article 60), who has pre-emptive power for ensuring constitutionality in the actions of the executive or legislature. The role of the judiciary in upholding the Constitution of India is the second line of defence in nullifying any unconstitutional actions of the executive and legislative entities of the Indian Union.\n\n\n\n## Powers and duties[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Indian parliament has enacted the law—*The President (Discharge of Functions) Act, 1969* —[61] for the discharge of the functions of the president when vacancies occur in the offices of the president and the vice-president simultaneously, owing to removal, death, resignation of the incumbent or otherwise. In such an eventuality, the chief justice—or in their absence, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court of India available—discharges the functions of the president until a newly elected president enters upon their office or a newly elected vice-president begins to act as president under Article 65 of the constitution, whichever is the earlier.[22]: 96 For example, in 1969, when President Zakir Husain died in Office, Vice-President V. V. Giri served as the acting president of India. However, later, V.V Giri resigned from both posts (Acting President of India and Vice-President of India) as he became a candidate in the 1969 presidential election in India. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs mentioned in Article 72 of the Indian constitution, the president is empowered with the powers to grant pardons in the following situations:[21]\n\n\n\n* punishment for an offence against Union law\n* punishment by a military court\n* a death sentence[28]\n\n\nThe decisions involving pardoning and other rights by the president are independent of the opinion of the prime minister or the Lok Sabha majority.

Typically, the aspirants have been asked to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is in addition to the requirement that a prime minister proves he has the support of the Lok Sabha (by a vote on the floor of the house) within weeks of being sworn into office.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### Vetoing of a Bill[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pocket veto and Zail Singh\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** \"President appoints Manmohan Prime Minister\". *The Hindu*.

In particular, Presidents have made a number of interventions into government and lawmaking, which have established and challenged some conventions concerning presidential intervention.\n\n\n\n### Proving majority in the parliament[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vote of confidence\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## President vs Prime minister[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe nomination of a candidate for election to the office of the president must be subscribed by at least 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders. Each candidate has to make a security deposit of ₹15,000 (US$180) in the Reserve Bank of India.[46] The security deposit is liable to be forfeited in case the candidate fails to secure one-sixth of the votes polled.\n\n\nThe election is held in accordance with the system of proportional representation (PR) by means of the instant-runoff voting (IRV) method.[47] The voting takes place by a secret ballot system. The manner of election of President is provided by Article 55 of the constitution.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952,[44] a candidate to be nominated for the office of president needs 50 electors as proposers and 50 electors as seconders for their name to appear on the ballot.[45]\n\n\n\n## Time of election[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe president appoints as prime minister, the person most likely to command the support of the majority in the Lok Sabha (usually the leader of the majority party or coalition). The president then appoints the other members of the Council of Ministers, distributing portfolios to them on the advice of the prime minister.[20]: 72 The Council of Ministers remains in power at the 'pleasure' of the president.\n\n\nThe president appoints 12 members of the Rajya Sabha from amongst persons who have special knowledge or practical experience in respect of such matters as literature, science, art and social service. The president may nominate not more than two members of Anglo Indian community as Lok Sabha members per Article 331, which was removed in 2019.\n\n\nGovernors of states are also appointed by the president who shall work at the pleasure of the president. Per Article 156, the president is empowered to dismiss a governor who has violated the constitution in their acts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe president of India used to receive ₹10,000 (US$100) per month per the Second Schedule of the constitution. This amount was increased to ₹50,000 (equivalent to ₹230,000 or US$2,700 in 2023) in 1998. On 11 September 2008, the Government of India increased the salary of the president to ₹1.5 lakh (equivalent to ₹4.2 lakh or US$5,000 in 2023). This amount was further increased to ₹5 lakh (equivalent to ₹6.7 lakh or US$8,000 in 2023) in the 2018 Union budget of India. However, almost everything that the president does or wants to do is taken care of by an annual ₹225 million (equivalent to ₹630 million or US$7.5 million in 2023) budget that the Government allots for their upkeep.[52] Rashtrapati Bhavan, the president's official residence, is the largest Presidential palace in the world.[53][54] The Rashtrapati Nilayam at Bolarum, Hyderabad and Retreat Building at Chharabra, Shimla are the official Retreat Residences of the president of India. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo meet the contingency of an election to the office of President not being completed in time due to unforeseen circumstances like countermanding of an election due to death of a candidate or on account of the postponement of the poll for any valid reason, Article 56(1)(c) provides that the president shall, notwithstanding the expiration of their term, continue to hold office until their successor enters into office.\n\n\n\n### Conditions for the presidency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Electoral College (India)\n\nCertain conditions, per Article 59 of the Indian constitution, debar an otherwise eligible citizen from contesting the presidential elections.

The president shall not accept any actions of the executive or legislature which are unconstitutional. The president is the foremost, most empowered and prompt defender of the constitution (Article 60), who has pre-emptive power for ensuring constitutionality in the actions of the executive or legislature.

In such an eventuality, the chief justice—or in their absence, the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court of India available—discharges the functions of the president until a newly elected president enters upon their office or a newly elected vice-president begins to act as president under Article 65 of the constitution, whichever is the earlier.[22]: 96 For example, in 1969, when President Zakir Husain died in Office, Vice-President V. V. Giri served as the acting president of India.

Typically, the aspirants have been asked to produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is in addition to the requirement that a prime minister proves he has the support of the Lok Sabha (by a vote on the floor of the house) within weeks of being sworn into office.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### Vetoing of a Bill[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pocket veto and Zail Singh\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** \"President appoints Manmohan Prime Minister\". *The Hindu*.

The president leads the executive branch of the Indonesian government and is the commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. Since 2004, the president and vice president are directly elected to a five-year term, once renewable, allowing for a maximum of 10 years in office.\n\n\nJoko Widodo is the seventh and current president of Indonesia. He assumed office on 20 October 2014.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Sukarno era[edit]\n\n\nThe Indonesian presidency was established during the formulation of the 1945 Constitution by the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK). The office was first filled on 18 August 1945 when Sukarno was elected by acclamation by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) because according to the Transitional Provisions of the, \"the President and the Vice President for the first time shall be elected by the PPKI.\" Also, the body responsible for the presidential elections, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), had not yet been formed.[3]: 138 On 16 October 1945, Vice President Mohammad Hatta announced a vice-presidential decree which gave the Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) legislative powers.[3]: 152 On 11 November 1945, the KNIP made the decision to separate the role of Head of State from that of Head of Government. Although a new constitution had not been set up yet, Indonesia was now a de facto parliamentary democracy with the president as a ceremonial Head of State whose function was to ask the prime minister as the Head of the Government to form a new Cabinet.\n\n\nDuring the Indonesian National Revolution, both Sukarno and Hatta were captured by the Dutch in Yogyakarta on 18 December 1948. Sukarno then gave a mandate for Sjafruddin Prawiranegara to form an emergency government.[4] This was done and the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) was formed in Sumatra with Prawiranegara as its chairman. Prawiranegara handed back his mandate to Sukarno on 13 July 1949.[5] On 17 December 1949, Sukarno was elected president of the Republic of the United States of Indonesia (RIS) and presidential mandate passed to Assaat.[6] When it became clear that RIS was going to be replaced by a unitary state, Asaat stepped down from the presidency and Sukarno once again became president on 15 August 1950.\n\n\nIndonesia now adopted the constitution that had been intended for RIS. Officially known as the Provisional Constitution, the document confirmed the president's role as the head of state, but limited him to a mostly ceremonial role. He appointed a prime minister on the advice of formateurs.[7]\n\n\nDespite his limited constitutional role, Sukarno commanded great moral authority. Nonetheless, he was never content with the role of ceremonial head of State, and grew increasingly disenchanted with western-style parliamentary democracy. In the early 1950s, he began calling for the implementation of \"Guided Democracy,\" in which decisions would be made after lengthy deliberation with a view toward achieving a consensus under presidential \"guidance.\"\n\n\nThe rest of the decade saw a series of unstable governments. Taking advantage of the situation, Sukarno made a speech in April 1959 and suggested that Indonesia return to the 1945 Constitution.[8] The People reacted enthusiastically and there was strong pressure on the Constitutional Assembly, the body responsible for formulating a new constitution, to adopt the 1945 Constitution. When the assembly did not budge, Sukarno issued a presidential decree on 5 July 1959 declaring that Indonesia was returning to the 1945 Constitution.[8] That document made the president head of government as well as head of state. In May 1963, the People's Consultative Assembly appointed Sukarno president for Life.[9]\n\n\nAlthough Indonesia had re-adopted the 1945 Constitution, it did not mean that it was strictly adhered to. The MPR, which at this stage was still on a provisional basis (MPRS), was subservient to the president despite its status of the Nation's highest Governing Body. It was only in 1966, when the political tide began to turn against Sukarno that the MPRS nominally regained its rightful constitutional status. In 1967, Sukarno was forced to resign as president, and army chief of staff Suharto was appointed as acting president.\n\n\n\n### Suharto era[edit]\n\n\nSuharto was appointed president in his own right in 1968. During his rise to power, Suharto seemed determined to observe at least the forms of the constitution, and this continued when he became president. Under the constitution, the MPR was responsible for formulating the Outlines of State Policy (GBHN); as president, Suharto was responsible for implementing them. Suharto also made it a presidential obligation to deliver accountability speeches near the end of his terms. During the speech, Suharto outlined the achievements that his administration had made and how those achievements had adhered to the GBHN set by the MPR. Despite the constitutional and democratic façade, Suharto made sure that the MPR was subservient to him. In 1969, a law was passed that required appointments to the MPR to be made official by the president.[10] He also took measures that largely emasculated the opposition parties. For example, he had the power to issue governmental regulations in lieu of law. Nominally, if these regulations were not approved by the House of People's Representatives (DPR, the pre-2004 legislative branch), they were considered revoked. However, given the DPR's infrequent sessions and the near-total dominance of the pro-government political grouping, Golkar, such approval was a mere formality. Thus, for all intents and purposes, Suharto ruled by decree for most of his tenure. For the better part of Suharto's rule, he effectively held all governing power in the nation.\n\n\n\n### Reform era[edit]\n\n\nSuharto fell from power in May 1998 and the presidency experienced changes as a result of the reform movement. Compared to Suharto, who had all of his accountability speeches accepted, B. J. Habibie had his only accountability speech rejected.[11] Abdurrahman Wahid then became the first president who had to beat another candidate to be elected, as Sukarno and Suharto had been sole candidates. As a result of this, Wahid was also the first president to be elected through counting votes instead of by acclamation. However, Wahid was impeached and removed from office by the MPR. This was a clear sign that while the presidency is the key institution, the MPR was now truly a check on the president's power. Wahid was replaced by his vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of Sukarno and former opposition leader during Suharto's presidency. Megawati is the first and, so far, only female ever to become President of Indonesia.[12]\n\n\nDuring the 2001 MPR Annual Session, it was finally decided that from 2004 onwards, the president will directly be elected by the people.[13] In response to Sukarno and Suharto's abuses of power, other amendments passed at that session hedged the presidency about with numerous checks and balances to prevent another president from completely dominating the system. For example, the president was limited to two terms, whether successive or separated. He also lost the right to legislate, but could propose legislation.\n\n\nIn 2004 election, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono became Indonesia's first directly elected president, beating incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri in the runoff election. He was re-elected in 2009. In 2014, Yudhoyono finished his second presidential term and was barred from seeking re-election.\n\n\nThe 3rd Indonesian presidential election was held on 9 July 2014 and matched former general and Suharto's ex-son in law Prabowo Subianto against the governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo. On 22 July the General Elections Commission announced Joko Widodo's victory. He and his vice president, Jusuf Kalla, were sworn in on 20 October 2014, for a 5-year term.\n\n\n\n## Requirements to run for office[edit]\n\n\n**The Amended 1945 Constitution**: The presidential candidate has to be an Indonesian citizen since their birth, who has not willingly become a citizen in another nation, has not betrayed the nation, and is physically and mentally capable of performing the duties. Amended Constitution also states that further criteria will be determined by laws.

If the Constitutional Court decides that the president has violated the law, the DPR can motion for the MPR to convene. The president would then be given one last chance to defend himself before the MPR makes the decision whether or not the president should be impeached. The decision of the MPR to dismiss the President and/or the Vice President is made with the approval of at least 2/3 of the members of the MPR who are present at the session which is attended by at least 3/4 of all members of the MPR (at least 50% of the total members of the MPR).\n\n\n**The Original 1945 Constitution**: If the president dies, resigns, or is unable to perform their duties for any reason, they are replaced by the vice president.\n\n\n**The 1950 Provisional Constitution**: If the president dies, resigns, or is unable to perform their duties for any reason, they are replaced by the vice president.\n\n\nAlthough there is no article about president (and vice president) impeachment in the original 1945 Constitution, Sukarno and Abdurrahman Wahid were still impeached in 1967 and 2001. Article on the impeachment of the president and vice president were made after the impeachment of Abdurrahman Wahid in the 3rd amendment to the Constitution.\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency and decorations[edit]\n\n\n### Post-presidency rights[edit]\n\n\nLaw No.7 of 1978[17] stipulates that former presidents are entitled to a pension.

The president leads the executive branch of the Indonesian government and is the commander-in-chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. Since 2004, the president and vice president are directly elected to a five-year term, once renewable, allowing for a maximum of 10 years in office.\n\n\nJoko Widodo is the seventh and current president of Indonesia. He assumed office on 20 October 2014.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Sukarno era[edit]\n\n\nThe Indonesian presidency was established during the formulation of the 1945 Constitution by the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK). The office was first filled on 18 August 1945 when Sukarno was elected by acclamation by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) because according to the Transitional Provisions of the, \"the President and the Vice President for the first time shall be elected by the PPKI.\" Also, the body responsible for the presidential elections, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), had not yet been formed.[3]: 138 On 16 October 1945, Vice President Mohammad Hatta announced a vice-presidential decree which gave the Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) legislative powers.[3]: 152 On 11 November 1945, the KNIP made the decision to separate the role of Head of State from that of Head of Government. Although a new constitution had not been set up yet, Indonesia was now a de facto parliamentary democracy with the president as a ceremonial Head of State whose function was to ask the prime minister as the Head of the Government to form a new Cabinet.\n\n\nDuring the Indonesian National Revolution, both Sukarno and Hatta were captured by the Dutch in Yogyakarta on 18 December 1948. Sukarno then gave a mandate for Sjafruddin Prawiranegara to form an emergency government.[4] This was done and the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI) was formed in Sumatra with Prawiranegara as its chairman. Prawiranegara handed back his mandate to Sukarno on 13 July 1949.[5] On 17 December 1949, Sukarno was elected president of the Republic of the United States of Indonesia (RIS) and presidential mandate passed to Assaat.[6] When it became clear that RIS was going to be replaced by a unitary state, Asaat stepped down from the presidency and Sukarno once again became president on 15 August 1950.\n\n\nIndonesia now adopted the constitution that had been intended for RIS. Officially known as the Provisional Constitution, the document confirmed the president's role as the head of state, but limited him to a mostly ceremonial role. He appointed a prime minister on the advice of formateurs.[7]\n\n\nDespite his limited constitutional role, Sukarno commanded great moral authority. Nonetheless, he was never content with the role of ceremonial head of State, and grew increasingly disenchanted with western-style parliamentary democracy. In the early 1950s, he began calling for the implementation of \"Guided Democracy,\" in which decisions would be made after lengthy deliberation with a view toward achieving a consensus under presidential \"guidance.\"\n\n\nThe rest of the decade saw a series of unstable governments. Taking advantage of the situation, Sukarno made a speech in April 1959 and suggested that Indonesia return to the 1945 Constitution.[8] The People reacted enthusiastically and there was strong pressure on the Constitutional Assembly, the body responsible for formulating a new constitution, to adopt the 1945 Constitution. When the assembly did not budge, Sukarno issued a presidential decree on 5 July 1959 declaring that Indonesia was returning to the 1945 Constitution.[8] That document made the president head of government as well as head of state. In May 1963, the People's Consultative Assembly appointed Sukarno president for Life.[9]\n\n\nAlthough Indonesia had re-adopted the 1945 Constitution, it did not mean that it was strictly adhered to. The MPR, which at this stage was still on a provisional basis (MPRS), was subservient to the president despite its status of the Nation's highest Governing Body. It was only in 1966, when the political tide began to turn against Sukarno that the MPRS nominally regained its rightful constitutional status. In 1967, Sukarno was forced to resign as president, and army chief of staff Suharto was appointed as acting president.\n\n\n\n### Suharto era[edit]\n\n\nSuharto was appointed president in his own right in 1968. During his rise to power, Suharto seemed determined to observe at least the forms of the constitution, and this continued when he became president. Under the constitution, the MPR was responsible for formulating the Outlines of State Policy (GBHN); as president, Suharto was responsible for implementing them. Suharto also made it a presidential obligation to deliver accountability speeches near the end of his terms. During the speech, Suharto outlined the achievements that his administration had made and how those achievements had adhered to the GBHN set by the MPR. Despite the constitutional and democratic façade, Suharto made sure that the MPR was subservient to him. In 1969, a law was passed that required appointments to the MPR to be made official by the president.[10] He also took measures that largely emasculated the opposition parties. For example, he had the power to issue governmental regulations in lieu of law. Nominally, if these regulations were not approved by the House of People's Representatives (DPR, the pre-2004 legislative branch), they were considered revoked. However, given the DPR's infrequent sessions and the near-total dominance of the pro-government political grouping, Golkar, such approval was a mere formality. Thus, for all intents and purposes, Suharto ruled by decree for most of his tenure. For the better part of Suharto's rule, he effectively held all governing power in the nation.\n\n\n\n### Reform era[edit]\n\n\nSuharto fell from power in May 1998 and the presidency experienced changes as a result of the reform movement. Compared to Suharto, who had all of his accountability speeches accepted, B. J. Habibie had his only accountability speech rejected.[11] Abdurrahman Wahid then became the first president who had to beat another candidate to be elected, as Sukarno and Suharto had been sole candidates. As a result of this, Wahid was also the first president to be elected through counting votes instead of by acclamation. However, Wahid was impeached and removed from office by the MPR. This was a clear sign that while the presidency is the key institution, the MPR was now truly a check on the president's power. Wahid was replaced by his vice president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of Sukarno and former opposition leader during Suharto's presidency. Megawati is the first and, so far, only female ever to become President of Indonesia.[12]\n\n\nDuring the 2001 MPR Annual Session, it was finally decided that from 2004 onwards, the president will directly be elected by the people.[13] In response to Sukarno and Suharto's abuses of power, other amendments passed at that session hedged the presidency about with numerous checks and balances to prevent another president from completely dominating the system. For example, the president was limited to two terms, whether successive or separated. He also lost the right to legislate, but could propose legislation.\n\n\nIn 2004 election, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono became Indonesia's first directly elected president, beating incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri in the runoff election. He was re-elected in 2009. In 2014, Yudhoyono finished his second presidential term and was barred from seeking re-election.\n\n\nThe 3rd Indonesian presidential election was held on 9 July 2014 and matched former general and Suharto's ex-son in law Prabowo Subianto against the governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo. On 22 July the General Elections Commission announced Joko Widodo's victory. He and his vice president, Jusuf Kalla, were sworn in on 20 October 2014, for a 5-year term.\n\n\n\n## Requirements to run for office[edit]\n\n\n**The Amended 1945 Constitution**: The presidential candidate has to be an Indonesian citizen since their birth, who has not willingly become a citizen in another nation, has not betrayed the nation, and is physically and mentally capable of performing the duties.

If the president is viewed to have violated the law in the form of treason against the state, corruption, bribery, other serious crimes, or disgraceful acts, and/or no longer meets the requirements to be president, the DPR can ask the Constitutional Court to look into the matter, during which it has 90 days to make a decision.

If the Constitutional Court decides that the president has violated the law, the DPR can motion for the MPR to convene. The president would then be given one last chance to defend himself before the MPR makes the decision whether or not the president should be impeached. The decision of the MPR to dismiss the President and/or the Vice President is made with the approval of at least 2/3 of the members of the MPR who are present at the session which is attended by at least 3/4 of all members of the MPR (at least 50% of the total members of the MPR).\n\n\n**The Original 1945 Constitution**: If the president dies, resigns, or is unable to perform their duties for any reason, they are replaced by the vice president.\n\n\n**The 1950 Provisional Constitution**: If the president dies, resigns, or is unable to perform their duties for any reason, they are replaced by the vice president.\n\n\nAlthough there is no article about president (and vice president) impeachment in the original 1945 Constitution, Sukarno and Abdurrahman Wahid were still impeached in 1967 and 2001.

The president is the nominal head of the executive and the supreme commander of the Pakistan Armed Forces.[4][5] Arif Alvi is the 13th and current president, in office since 9 September 2018.\n\n\nThe office of president was created upon the proclamation of Islamic Republic on 23 March 1956. The then serving governor-general, Major-General Iskander Mirza, assumed office as the first president. Following the 1958 *coup d'etat*, the office of prime minister was abolished, leaving the Presidency as the most powerful office in the country. This position was further strengthened when the 1962 Constitution was adopted. It turned Pakistan into a Presidential Republic, giving all executive powers to the president. In 1973, the new Constitution established Parliamentary democracy and reduced the president's role to a ceremonial one. Nevertheless, the military takeover in 1977 reversed the changes. The 8th Amendment turned Pakistan into a semi-presidential republic and in the period between 1985 and 2010, the executive power was shared by the president and prime minister. The 18th Amendment in 2010 restored Parliamentary Democracy in the country, and reduced the presidency to a ceremonial position.[6]\n\n\nThe constitution prohibits the president from directly running the government.[7] Instead, the executive power is exercised on his behalf by the prime minister who keeps him informed on all matters of internal and foreign policy, as well as all legislative proposals.[8] The Constitution however, vests the president with the powers of granting pardons, reprieves, and the control over military; however, all appointments at higher commands of the military must be made by the President on a \"required and necessary\" basis, upon consultation and approval from the prime minister.[9]\n\n\nThe president is indirectly elected by the Electoral College for a five-year term. The Constitution requires the president to be a \"Muslim of not less than forty five (45) years of age\". The president resides in an estate in Islamabad known as Aiwan-e-Sadar (President's House). In his absence, the chairman of Senate exercises the responsibilities of the post, until the actual president resumes office, or the next office holder is elected.\n\n\nThere have been a total of 13 presidents. The first president was Iskander Ali Mirza who entered office on 23 March 1956. The current office holder is Dr Arif Alvi, who took charge on 9 September 2018, following his victory in the 2018 elections.\n\n\n\n\n## Powers and authority[edit]\n\n\n### Role of the president[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Ceremonial guard of honour at the *Aiwan-e-Sadr*.\nThe official residence and principal workplace of the president is Aiwan-e-Sadr— the presidential palace located in northeastern Islamabad.

The president can be removed for violation of the Constitution of Pakistan.[31]\n\n\nThe impeachment process may start in either of the two houses of the Parliament. The house initiates the process by leveling the charges against the president.[32] The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by either the chairman or the speaker of the National Assembly through a two-thirds majority.[32] The notice is sent up to the president, and 14 days later it is taken up for consideration.[33]\n\n\nA resolution to impeach the president has to be passed by the two-thirds majority.[34] The speaker of the National Assembly then summons the joint session not earlier than seven days.[35] The president has the right to defend oneself.[36]\n\n\nIf the resolution is passed by the two-thirds majority at the joint session declaring that the president is unfit to hold the office due to incapacity or is guilty of violating the Constitution or of gross misconduct, then the president shall cease to hold office immediately on the passing of the resolution.[37]\n\n\nNo president has been impeached. However, the proceedings have been used in 2008 in an attempt to impeach former president Pervez Musharraf who tendered the resignation after the proceedings above were used.[38]\n\n\n\n## List of presidents[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of presidents of Pakistan and List of heads of state of Pakistan\n\n## Political background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Presidential standard (1956–1967)\n### Early origins[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1947 until 1956, the governor-general of Pakistan acted for the head of state: King George VI (until 1952) and Queen Elizabeth II (from 1952). With the promulgation of the first constitution, Pakistan became an Islamic republic in 1956, and the governor-general was replaced with the presidency. The incumbent governor-general, Iskander Mirza, became Pakistan's first president. He reportedly suspended the first constitution in 1958, and appointed Army commander-in-chief General Ayub Khan as the first chief martial law administrator. Khan subsequently dismissed Mirza in order to become the president.\n\n\n\n![](image)Iskander Mirza became the 1st President of Pakistan in 1956\nThe second constitution introduced by President Ayub Khan turned the country into a presidential republic without direct elections. Succumbing to internal and international pressure, however, Khan held a nationwide presidential election in 1965. Khan successfully campaigned against his opponent, Fatima Jinnah, for a second term, but some have alleged that elections were rigged in favour of Ayub Khan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Presidential standard (1974–1998)\nControversy regarding the U-2 incident (1960), privatization (1963), and war with India (1965), fueled a fierce left-wing opposition movement led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of the PPP and Bengali nationalist Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who, with the support of demonstrators, aimed to further weaken the presidency. Suffering from paralysis and declining health, Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to army chief General Yahya Khan, who imposed martial law and announced that national elections would be held in 1970. Eventually, general elections were held in 1970 which saw the PPP gaining a majority of seats in West Pakistan (current-day Pakistan) and the Awami League gaining a majority in East Pakistan (current-day Bangladesh).\n\n\nAfter he was unable to reach a compromise between the PPP and the Awami League, President Yahya Khan invited Nurul Amin of the Pakistan Muslim League to become the prime minister, and also appointed him as the first vice president. The growing instigated violence against Pakistanis in East Pakistan forced President Yahya Khan to use force in order to maintain order there, which further escalated Bengali resistance (1970). Preemptive strikes against India led to another war in 1971, which freed East Pakistan and created Bangladesh.\n\n\nTaking personal responsibility for the political isolation and devastation of Pakistan after the fall of East Pakistan, President Yahya Khan stepped down and ceded power to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. President Bhutto created the current Constitution of Pakistan in 1973, transforming Pakistan into a parliamentary democracy, and reducing presidential powers to that of a ceremonial figurehead.\n\n\n\n### Past Interventions[edit]\n\n\nThe general elections held in 1977 resulted in an atmosphere of civil unrest instigated by the right-wing alliance, the Pakistan National Alliance. The events leading to it resulted in military intervention by chief of army staff General Zia-ul-Haq and Chairman Joint Chiefs Admiral Mohammad Shariff. Suspending the Constitution in 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq took over the presidency in 1978. Zia's presidency oversaw the modern growth of far-right ideas in the country. Succumbing to domestic pressure to restore the Constitution, President Zia-ul-Haq held a referendum (1984) and called for general elections in 1985. President Zia-ul-Haq appointed Mohammad Junejo as prime minister and assumed more powers through the constitutional amendment. After dismissing Prime Minister Junejo, President Zia-ul-Haq announced that new general elections would be held, but President Zia died in a plane crash in 1988.\n\n\nThe general elections held in 1988 witnessed the victory of PPP in 1988 and appointed Senate chairman Ghulam Ishaq Khan to the presidency. The conflict between Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan arose in two areas regarding the issues of appointments. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan repeatedly intervened in government matters and leveled charges against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto; thus dismissing Prime Minister Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1990. After holding general elections in 1990, Nawaz Sharif brought up an ideologically conservative government and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan unsuccessfully tried to dismiss Sharif. After a successful intervention by Supreme Court and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Shamim Allam, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tendered resignations in 1993.\n\n\nFollowing the new elections held in 1993, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto established a strong government after appointing loyalist Farooq Leghari to the presidency. However, the corruption charges and the controversial death of Murtaza Bhutto in 1996 resulted in President Farooq Leghari dismissing Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. In 1997, President Farooq Leghari could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by the public in 1997. President Leghari unsuccessfully supported Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah— both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the Judiciary, the Executive, and the Parliament. After appointing Rafiq Tarar, the Parliament successfully passed constitutional amendment to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial self coup in 1999, General Pervez Musharraf dismissed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Rafiq Tarar in 2001 while assuming more powers to the presidency. In January 2004, the Electoral College elected Musharraf, and as a result he was, according to the Constitution, \"deemed to be elected\".[39]\n\n\nPresident Musharraf's repeated unconstitutional intervention resulted in a standoff with the Judiciary, and declared a state of emergency in 2007, after dismissing the senior justices of the Supreme Court. Although Musharraf was elected in 2007, the constitutional legality of Musharraf's rule was found dubious. A populist constitutional movement eventually resulted in Musharraf's departure. On 22 August 2008, the electoral commission called for presidential nominations to be delivered by 26 August 2008 and for elections to be held on 6 September 2008.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### Figurehead overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Arif Alvi visits Maritime Ministry, flanked by Ali Zaidi and Rizwan Ahmed\nAfter the presidential election held in 2008, Asif Ali Zardari lobbied for constitutional amendment to restore the Constitution as it was in 1973.[42][43][44][45] In 2010, the Parliament unanimously and with a large majority, passed the eighteenth amendment of the constitution. It revoked the presidential powers and changed Pakistan from a semi-presidential system of government to a parliamentary republic, with great hopes of governmental stability in the future.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Principal Secretary to the President of Pakistan\n* Air transports of heads of state and government\n* Official state car\n* Prime Minister of Pakistan\n* Chief Justice of Pakistan\n* Chief Justice of the Federal Shariat Court\n* Chief of Army Staff of the Pakistan Army\n* Constitution of Pakistan\n* Foreign Minister of Pakistan\n* Finance Minister of Pakistan\n* Interior Minister of Pakistan\n* Minister of Defence (Pakistan)\n* Vice President of Pakistan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Gupta, K.

The president is the nominal head of the executive and the supreme commander of the Pakistan Armed Forces.[4][5] Arif Alvi is the 13th and current president, in office since 9 September 2018.\n\n\nThe office of president was created upon the proclamation of Islamic Republic on 23 March 1956. The then serving governor-general, Major-General Iskander Mirza, assumed office as the first president. Following the 1958 *coup d'etat*, the office of prime minister was abolished, leaving the Presidency as the most powerful office in the country. This position was further strengthened when the 1962 Constitution was adopted. It turned Pakistan into a Presidential Republic, giving all executive powers to the president. In 1973, the new Constitution established Parliamentary democracy and reduced the president's role to a ceremonial one. Nevertheless, the military takeover in 1977 reversed the changes. The 8th Amendment turned Pakistan into a semi-presidential republic and in the period between 1985 and 2010, the executive power was shared by the president and prime minister. The 18th Amendment in 2010 restored Parliamentary Democracy in the country, and reduced the presidency to a ceremonial position.[6]\n\n\nThe constitution prohibits the president from directly running the government.[7] Instead, the executive power is exercised on his behalf by the prime minister who keeps him informed on all matters of internal and foreign policy, as well as all legislative proposals.[8] The Constitution however, vests the president with the powers of granting pardons, reprieves, and the control over military; however, all appointments at higher commands of the military must be made by the President on a \"required and necessary\" basis, upon consultation and approval from the prime minister.[9]\n\n\nThe president is indirectly elected by the Electoral College for a five-year term. The Constitution requires the president to be a \"Muslim of not less than forty five (45) years of age\". The president resides in an estate in Islamabad known as Aiwan-e-Sadar (President's House). In his absence, the chairman of Senate exercises the responsibilities of the post, until the actual president resumes office, or the next office holder is elected.\n\n\nThere have been a total of 13 presidents. The first president was Iskander Ali Mirza who entered office on 23 March 1956. The current office holder is Dr Arif Alvi, who took charge on 9 September 2018, following his victory in the 2018 elections.\n\n\n\n\n## Powers and authority[edit]\n\n\n### Role of the president[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Ceremonial guard of honour at the *Aiwan-e-Sadr*.\nThe official residence and principal workplace of the president is Aiwan-e-Sadr— the presidential palace located in northeastern Islamabad.

The president can be removed for violation of the Constitution of Pakistan.[31]\n\n\nThe impeachment process may start in either of the two houses of the Parliament. The house initiates the process by leveling the charges against the president.[32] The charges are contained in a notice that has to be signed by either the chairman or the speaker of the National Assembly through a two-thirds majority.[32] The notice is sent up to the president, and 14 days later it is taken up for consideration.[33]\n\n\nA resolution to impeach the president has to be passed by the two-thirds majority.[34] The speaker of the National Assembly then summons the joint session not earlier than seven days.[35] The president has the right to defend oneself.[36]\n\n\nIf the resolution is passed by the two-thirds majority at the joint session declaring that the president is unfit to hold the office due to incapacity or is guilty of violating the Constitution or of gross misconduct, then the president shall cease to hold office immediately on the passing of the resolution.[37]\n\n\nNo president has been impeached. However, the proceedings have been used in 2008 in an attempt to impeach former president Pervez Musharraf who tendered the resignation after the proceedings above were used.[38]\n\n\n\n## List of presidents[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of presidents of Pakistan and List of heads of state of Pakistan\n\n## Political background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Presidential standard (1956–1967)\n### Early origins[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1947 until 1956, the governor-general of Pakistan acted for the head of state: King George VI (until 1952) and Queen Elizabeth II (from 1952). With the promulgation of the first constitution, Pakistan became an Islamic republic in 1956, and the governor-general was replaced with the presidency. The incumbent governor-general, Iskander Mirza, became Pakistan's first president. He reportedly suspended the first constitution in 1958, and appointed Army commander-in-chief General Ayub Khan as the first chief martial law administrator. Khan subsequently dismissed Mirza in order to become the president.\n\n\n\n![](image)Iskander Mirza became the 1st President of Pakistan in 1956\nThe second constitution introduced by President Ayub Khan turned the country into a presidential republic without direct elections. Succumbing to internal and international pressure, however, Khan held a nationwide presidential election in 1965. Khan successfully campaigned against his opponent, Fatima Jinnah, for a second term, but some have alleged that elections were rigged in favour of Ayub Khan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Presidential standard (1974–1998)\nControversy regarding the U-2 incident (1960), privatization (1963), and war with India (1965), fueled a fierce left-wing opposition movement led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of the PPP and Bengali nationalist Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who, with the support of demonstrators, aimed to further weaken the presidency. Suffering from paralysis and declining health, Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to army chief General Yahya Khan, who imposed martial law and announced that national elections would be held in 1970. Eventually, general elections were held in 1970 which saw the PPP gaining a majority of seats in West Pakistan (current-day Pakistan) and the Awami League gaining a majority in East Pakistan (current-day Bangladesh).\n\n\nAfter he was unable to reach a compromise between the PPP and the Awami League, President Yahya Khan invited Nurul Amin of the Pakistan Muslim League to become the prime minister, and also appointed him as the first vice president. The growing instigated violence against Pakistanis in East Pakistan forced President Yahya Khan to use force in order to maintain order there, which further escalated Bengali resistance (1970). Preemptive strikes against India led to another war in 1971, which freed East Pakistan and created Bangladesh.\n\n\nTaking personal responsibility for the political isolation and devastation of Pakistan after the fall of East Pakistan, President Yahya Khan stepped down and ceded power to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. President Bhutto created the current Constitution of Pakistan in 1973, transforming Pakistan into a parliamentary democracy, and reducing presidential powers to that of a ceremonial figurehead.\n\n\n\n### Past Interventions[edit]\n\n\nThe general elections held in 1977 resulted in an atmosphere of civil unrest instigated by the right-wing alliance, the Pakistan National Alliance. The events leading to it resulted in military intervention by chief of army staff General Zia-ul-Haq and Chairman Joint Chiefs Admiral Mohammad Shariff. Suspending the Constitution in 1977, General Zia-ul-Haq took over the presidency in 1978. Zia's presidency oversaw the modern growth of far-right ideas in the country. Succumbing to domestic pressure to restore the Constitution, President Zia-ul-Haq held a referendum (1984) and called for general elections in 1985. President Zia-ul-Haq appointed Mohammad Junejo as prime minister and assumed more powers through the constitutional amendment. After dismissing Prime Minister Junejo, President Zia-ul-Haq announced that new general elections would be held, but President Zia died in a plane crash in 1988.\n\n\nThe general elections held in 1988 witnessed the victory of PPP in 1988 and appointed Senate chairman Ghulam Ishaq Khan to the presidency. The conflict between Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan arose in two areas regarding the issues of appointments. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan repeatedly intervened in government matters and leveled charges against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto; thus dismissing Prime Minister Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1990. After holding general elections in 1990, Nawaz Sharif brought up an ideologically conservative government and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan unsuccessfully tried to dismiss Sharif. After a successful intervention by Supreme Court and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Shamim Allam, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tendered resignations in 1993.\n\n\nFollowing the new elections held in 1993, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto established a strong government after appointing loyalist Farooq Leghari to the presidency. However, the corruption charges and the controversial death of Murtaza Bhutto in 1996 resulted in President Farooq Leghari dismissing Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. In 1997, President Farooq Leghari could not overcome the heavy mandate bestowed on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by the public in 1997. President Leghari unsuccessfully supported Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah— both of them resigned, ending the conflict between the Judiciary, the Executive, and the Parliament. After appointing Rafiq Tarar, the Parliament successfully passed constitutional amendment to decisively limit the presidency. After staging a controversial self coup in 1999, General Pervez Musharraf dismissed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Rafiq Tarar in 2001 while assuming more powers to the presidency. In January 2004, the Electoral College elected Musharraf, and as a result he was, according to the Constitution, \"deemed to be elected\".[39]\n\n\nPresident Musharraf's repeated unconstitutional intervention resulted in a standoff with the Judiciary, and declared a state of emergency in 2007, after dismissing the senior justices of the Supreme Court. Although Musharraf was elected in 2007, the constitutional legality of Musharraf's rule was found dubious. A populist constitutional movement eventually resulted in Musharraf's departure. On 22 August 2008, the electoral commission called for presidential nominations to be delivered by 26 August 2008 and for elections to be held on 6 September 2008.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### Figurehead overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Arif Alvi visits Maritime Ministry, flanked by Ali Zaidi and Rizwan Ahmed\nAfter the presidential election held in 2008, Asif Ali Zardari lobbied for constitutional amendment to restore the Constitution as it was in 1973.[42][43][44][45] In 2010, the Parliament unanimously and with a large majority, passed the eighteenth amendment of the constitution. It revoked the presidential powers and changed Pakistan from a semi-presidential system of government to a parliamentary republic, with great hopes of governmental stability in the future.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Principal Secretary to the President of Pakistan\n* Air transports of heads of state and government\n* Official state car\n* Prime Minister of Pakistan\n* Chief Justice of Pakistan\n* Chief Justice of the Federal Shariat Court\n* Chief of Army Staff of the Pakistan Army\n* Constitution of Pakistan\n* Foreign Minister of Pakistan\n* Finance Minister of Pakistan\n* Interior Minister of Pakistan\n* Minister of Defence (Pakistan)\n* Vice President of Pakistan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Gupta, K.
