Having previously hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing became the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics.

There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics. These new buildings are located in the southern area of Olympic Green on the neighbourhood of the National Olympic Sports Center and will serves as Chinese Olympic Committee residential complex for those athletes who will undergo training sessions at the nearby venues.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Beijing National Stadium** was an iconic venue in the Beijing Zone, and it is also known as the **Bird's Nest** (鸟巢; *Niǎocháo*). The Beijing National Stadium was the site that hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the 2022 Winter Olympics, but it was no longer a venue for any competition in 2022.[20]\n\n\nThe **National Aquatics Center (**国家游泳中心 Guójiā Yóuyǒng Zhōngxīn /gwor-jyaa yoh-yong jong-sshin/), also known as the **Water Cube**, was the venue for Curling competition.[21] In the 2022 Winter Olympics, the National Aquatics Center became the first Olympic venue to incorporate a curling track in the swimming pool.[22]\n\n\nThe **Shougang Big Air** (首钢滑雪大跳台中心 Shǒugāng Huáxuě Dàtiàotái Zhōngxīn /shoh-gung hwaa-sshwair daa-tyao-teye jong-sshin/) was a newly constructed site for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[23] The Shougang Big Air hosted the freestyle skiing and snowboarding events.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe United States and its followers are plotting anti-Chinese conspiracies to obstruct the successful hosting of the Olympics, but this is an insult to the spirit of the Olympic Charter and an act to damage China's international image. We firmly oppose and reject these actions.\"[82]\n\n\nThe following 91 National Olympic Committees have qualified athletes (two fewer than four years earlier), with Haiti and Saudi Arabia making their Winter Olympic débuts.[83][84] Kenya qualified one athlete, but withdrew.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2022 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the Winter Olympics\nThe yellow circle is the host city (Beijing)\n\n![](image)Country by team size\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Coliseum (3 December 2020). \"'Water Cube' revamped for Beijing 2022\". *Coliseum*.

The city withdrew its application for government funding after a majority of the Norwegian parliament had stated their intention to decline the application. In the days before the decision, Norwegian media had revealed the IOC's \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Snow Ruyi – ski jumping, Nordic combined (ski jumping) *6,000*\n* National Biathlon Centre – biathlon *6,024*\n* Genting Snow Park\n\t+ Park A – Ski and snowboard cross *1,774*\n\t+ Park B – Halfpipe and Slopestyle (freestyle skiing and snowboard) *2,550*\n\t+ Park C – Aerials and Moguls *1,597*\n* National Cross-Country Centre – Nordic combined (cross-country), cross-country *6,023*\n* Zhangjiakou Olympic Village\n* Zhangjiakou Medals Plaza\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Olympic medal\n\nThe design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 26 October 2021.

Having previously hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing became the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics.

The city withdrew its application for government funding after a majority of the Norwegian parliament had stated their intention to decline the application. In the days before the decision, Norwegian media had revealed the IOC's \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Snow Ruyi – ski jumping, Nordic combined (ski jumping) *6,000*\n* National Biathlon Centre – biathlon *6,024*\n* Genting Snow Park\n\t+ Park A – Ski and snowboard cross *1,774*\n\t+ Park B – Halfpipe and Slopestyle (freestyle skiing and snowboard) *2,550*\n\t+ Park C – Aerials and Moguls *1,597*\n* National Cross-Country Centre – Nordic combined (cross-country), cross-country *6,023*\n* Zhangjiakou Olympic Village\n* Zhangjiakou Medals Plaza\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Olympic medal\n\nThe design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 26 October 2021.

At least 150,000 spectators from outside the \"closed loop\" were expected to attend.

This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as attendance levels at the sessions.[48]\n\n\nConversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.[49]\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. **^** \"PyeongChang will host first major 5G video demonstrations for Olympics viewers\". *VentureBeat*. 31 January 2018.

He argued that not only was doping rife among Russian athletes but that there was no sign of it being eradicated.[125] The CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals was also fiercely criticized, by Olympic officials, IOC president Thomas Bach and whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov's lawyer.[126]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2018 Winter Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in South Korea\n\t+ 1988 Summer Olympics – Seoul\n\t+ 2018 Winter Olympics – Pyeongchang\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* Soohorang and Bandabi\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Including United Korean (COR) women's ice hockey team.\n2. **^** \"French and English are the official languages for the Olympic Games.\", [1].(..)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| IOC | * Charter\n* Olympic Congress\n* IOC meetings\n* International sports federations\n |\n| Medals | * Medal table\n* All-time medal table\n\t+ youth\n* Medal table leaders by Olympic Games\n* Medalists\n\t+ youth\n* Medal ties\n* Incentives by country\n* Stripped medals\n* Olympic diploma\n* Olive wreath\n |\n| Nations | * Summer Olympics\n* Winter Olympics\n\t+ tropical nations\n\t+ country codes\n |\n| Host cities | * Bids\n\t+ youth\n* Venues\n\t+ youth\n\t+ Olympic Stadium\n |\n| Ceremonies | * People who opened the Olympics\n* Torch relays\n\t+ lighters of the Olympic cauldron\n* Keepers of the Olympic flag\n |\n| Media | * Television\n\t+ Olympic Broadcasting Services\n\t+ Olympic Channel\n* Social media\n* Films\n\t+ summer\n\t+ winter\n* Video games\n |\n| Symbols | * Flame\n* Olympiad\n* Oath\n* Songs and anthems\n\t+ Hymn\n* Emblem\n* Poster\n* Mascots\n* Coins\n\t+ summer\n\t+ winter\n* Pierre de Coubertin medal\n* Olympic Cup\n* Olympic Diploma of Merit\n* Olympic Laurel\n* Olympic Order\n |\n| Other | * Art competitions at the Olympics\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen won bronze in the women's team sprint and gold in the 30 km classical event, bringing her total Olympic medal haul to fifteen, the most won by any athlete (male or female) in Winter Olympics history.[66] The record was previously held by fellow Norwegian athlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen who has thirteen Olympic medals.\n* Germany and Canada tied for gold in the two-man bobsleigh event, only the second time in history that two countries had tied for a gold medal in this particular event, the first time being in the 1998 Winter Olympics twenty years earlier.[67]\n* Norway won a total of 39 medals, setting a new record for the highest number of medals won at a single Winter Olympics.

The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games (POCOG) was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the organizing committee were putting together a master plan for the Games as well as forming a design for the venues.[8] The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012. By then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village.[9][10] In June 2012, construction began on a high-speed rail line that would connect Pyeongchang to Seoul.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the United States, the Games were once again broadcast by NBCUniversal properties under a long-term contract (this would be the only time that the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics will be held on NBC on the same year).[78][79] On 28 March 2017, NBC announced that it would adopt a new format for its primetime coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, with a focus on live coverage in all time zones to take advantage of Pyeongchang's 14-hour difference with U.S. Eastern Time (and 17-hour difference with U.S. Pacific Time), and to address criticism of its previous tape delay practices. As before, the primetime block began at 8:00 p.m. ET (5:00 p.m. PT), and unlike previous Olympics, was available for streaming. Figure skating events were deliberately scheduled with morning sessions so they could be aired during primetime in the Americas (and in turn, NBC's coverage; due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 11 October 2017, domestic ticket sales for the Games were reported to be slow. Of the 750,000 seats allocated to South Koreans, only 20.7% had been sold. International sales were more favorable, with 59.7% of the 320,000 allocated tickets sold.[23][24] However, as of 31 January 2018, 77% of all tickets had been sold.[25]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Parade of Nations at 2018 Olympic opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018.

This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as attendance levels at the sessions.[48]\n\n\nConversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.[49]\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. **^** \"PyeongChang will host first major 5G video demonstrations for Olympics viewers\". *VentureBeat*. 31 January 2018.

The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games (POCOG) was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the organizing committee were putting together a master plan for the Games as well as forming a design for the venues.[8] The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012. By then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village.[9][10] In June 2012, construction began on a high-speed rail line that would connect Pyeongchang to Seoul.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the United States, the Games were once again broadcast by NBCUniversal properties under a long-term contract (this would be the only time that the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics will be held on NBC on the same year).[78][79] On 28 March 2017, NBC announced that it would adopt a new format for its primetime coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, with a focus on live coverage in all time zones to take advantage of Pyeongchang's 14-hour difference with U.S. Eastern Time (and 17-hour difference with U.S. Pacific Time), and to address criticism of its previous tape delay practices. As before, the primetime block began at 8:00 p.m. ET (5:00 p.m. PT), and unlike previous Olympics, was available for streaming. Figure skating events were deliberately scheduled with morning sessions so they could be aired during primetime in the Americas (and in turn, NBC's coverage; due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 11 October 2017, domestic ticket sales for the Games were reported to be slow. Of the 750,000 seats allocated to South Koreans, only 20.7% had been sold. International sales were more favorable, with 59.7% of the 320,000 allocated tickets sold.[23][24] However, as of 31 January 2018, 77% of all tickets had been sold.[25]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Parade of Nations at 2018 Olympic opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018.

Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium.

Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium.

Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.[14]\n\n\nFor the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters–Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã–as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games.[15][16] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park.[14] Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes.

The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio de Janeiro)\n |\n| --- |\n| Barra Cluster | * Carioca Arena 1\n* Carioca Arena 2\n* Carioca Arena 3\n* Future Arena\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium\n* Olympic Golf Course\n* Olympic Tennis Centre\n* Rio Olympic Arena\n* Pontal\n* Riocentro (four venues)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Copacabana Cluster | * Copacabana Stadium\n* Fort Copacabana\n* Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon\n* Marina da Glória\n |\n| Deodoro Cluster | * Deodoro Aquatics Centre\n* Deodoro Stadium\n* National Equestrian Center\n* National Shooting Center\n* Olympic BMX Centre\n* Olympic Hockey Centre\n* Mountain Bike Centre\n* Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\n* Youth Arena\n |\n| Maracanã-Engenho de Dentro Cluster | * Estádio Olímpico João Havelange\n* Maracanã Stadium\n* Maracanãzinho\n* Sambódromo\n |\n| Football stadia | * Maracanã Stadium\n* Estádio Olímpico João Havelange\n* Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha\n* Arena Fonte Nova\n* Mineirão\n* Arena Corinthians\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Slovakia | Barra da Tijuca | Casa Eslovaca\n |\n| Tokyo 2020 | Barra da Tijuca | Casa de Tóquio 2020\n |\n| Tokyo Metropolitan Government | Paço Imperial | Casa do Governo Metropolitano de Tóquio\n |\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nThis is currently based on the schedule released on the same day as ticket sales began, 31 March 2015.[70]\n\n\n\n*All dates are Brasília Time (UTC–3)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | ● | Event competitions\n | **1** | Gold medal events\n | **EG** | Exhibition gala\n | **CC** | Closing ceremony\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history.

The next category was the best Olympic feature, for which TV Globo's show *Esporte Espetacular* finished third, and CCTV from China feature *A Sequel of Love* came second. The winner was NBC Olympics for their feature *The Most Beautiful Thing*. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF from Belgium collected the third place prize for their profile of Nafi Thiam.

To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third.

A final vote was held on 9 October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. At this session, a new voting system was in place: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.[51][52]\n\n\nThe 121st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio 2016 Olympic programme.[53] The tally for rugby was 81 in favor, with eight against,[54] and golf was approved by 63 votes to 26.[55] Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics; rugby last featured in 1924, and golf in 1904.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Olympic rings displayed in Rio de Janeiro\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** \"Windsurfing restored to Brazil 2016 Olympics\". *BBC Sport*. 10 November 2012.

The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January, would act during the Olympic Games.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00 p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23 billion for Rio 2016),[71][72] as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo. As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET, 9:00 p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe urban renovation involved 700 km (430 mi) of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 4 km (2.5 mi) of tunnels; 70 km (43 mi) of roads; 650 km2 (250 sq mi) of sidewalks; 17 km (11 mi) of bike path; 15,000 trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.[23]\n\n\nThe Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.[18]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) National Olympic Committees at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa | * Algeria\n* Angola\n* Benin\n* Botswana\n* Burkina Faso\n* Burundi\n* Cameroon\n* Cape Verde\n* Central African Republic\n* Chad\n* Comoros\n* Congo\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* Djibouti\n* Egypt\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* Eritrea\n* Ethiopia\n* Gabon\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Guinea\n* Guinea-Bissau\n* Ivory Coast\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Libya\n* Madagascar\n* Malawi\n* Mali\n* Mauritania\n* Mauritius\n* Morocco\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Niger\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* São Tomé and Príncipe\n* Senegal\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somalia\n* South Africa\n* South Sudan\n* Sudan\n* Swaziland\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tunisia\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Americas | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Argentina\n* Aruba\n* Bahamas\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Bermuda\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* British Virgin Islands\n* Canada\n* Cayman Islands\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* Dominica\n* Dominican Republic\n* Ecuador\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint).

Great Britain finished second and became the first country to increase its tally of medals in the Olympiad immediately after being host nation in 2012.[6] China finished third in the medal table. Host nation Brazil won seven gold medals and 19 medals, its best result at any Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Bahrain, Fiji, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan and Vietnam all won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndirect capital costs were not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, for hotel upgrades, or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Rio Olympics' cost of US$4.6 billion compares with costs of US$40–44 billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51 billion for Sochi 2014, the two most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost of the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2 billion.[80]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBarra Olympic Park\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below.

Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14 January 2008. On 4 June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities—Baku, Doha, and Prague—failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.[14]\n\n\nFor the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters–Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracanã–as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games.[15][16] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park.[14] Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes. Of the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6 billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Carioca Arena 1 – basketball (capacity: 16,000)\n* Carioca Arena 2 – wrestling, judo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Carioca Arena 3 – fencing, taekwondo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Future Arena – handball (capacity: 12,000)\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre – diving, synchronized swimming, water polo (capacity: 5,000)\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium – swimming, water polo play-offs (capacity: 15,000)\n* Olympic Tennis Centre – tennis (capacity: 10,000 Main Court)\n* Rio Olympic Arena – gymnastics (capacity: 12,000)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome – track cycling (capacity: 5,000)\n\n\n#### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nAs well as the Estádio Olímpico João Havelange and Maracanã and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Brasília and Manaus.\n\n\n\n* ![Maracanã Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nMaracanã Stadium  \nRio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Olympic Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2016 Summer Olympics bidding results[11]\n| **City** | **NOC** | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** |\n|  **Rio de Janeiro** |  **![](image) Brazil** | 26\n | **46** | **66** |\n| Madrid | ![](image) Spain | **28** | 29\n | 32\n |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | 22\n | 20\n | —\n |\n| Chicago | ![](image) United States | 18\n | —\n | —\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 June 2011, it was reported on AroundTheRings.com that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC. This came just five months after CCO Flávio Pestana quit for personal reasons.[12] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO.[13]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOthers included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time.[8]\n\n\nNawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids, which was awarded to London, United Kingdom. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2 September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics (Rio de Janeiro)\n |\n| --- |\n| Barra Cluster | * Carioca Arena 1\n* Carioca Arena 2\n* Carioca Arena 3\n* Future Arena\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium\n* Olympic Golf Course\n* Olympic Tennis Centre\n* Rio Olympic Arena\n* Pontal\n* Riocentro (four venues)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Copacabana Cluster | * Copacabana Stadium\n* Fort Copacabana\n* Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon\n* Marina da Glória\n |\n| Deodoro Cluster | * Deodoro Aquatics Centre\n* Deodoro Stadium\n* National Equestrian Center\n* National Shooting Center\n* Olympic BMX Centre\n* Olympic Hockey Centre\n* Mountain Bike Centre\n* Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\n* Youth Arena\n |\n| Maracanã-Engenho de Dentro Cluster | * Estádio Olímpico João Havelange\n* Maracanã Stadium\n* Maracanãzinho\n* Sambódromo\n |\n| Football stadia | * Maracanã Stadium\n* Estádio Olímpico João Havelange\n* Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha\n* Arena Fonte Nova\n* Mineirão\n* Arena Corinthians\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Slovakia | Barra da Tijuca | Casa Eslovaca\n |\n| Tokyo 2020 | Barra da Tijuca | Casa de Tóquio 2020\n |\n| Tokyo Metropolitan Government | Paço Imperial | Casa do Governo Metropolitano de Tóquio\n |\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nThis is currently based on the schedule released on the same day as ticket sales began, 31 March 2015.[70]\n\n\n\n*All dates are Brasília Time (UTC–3)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | ● | Event competitions\n | **1** | Gold medal events\n | **EG** | Exhibition gala\n | **CC** | Closing ceremony\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracanã Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history.

These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense.

Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** *Rio 2007 Pan Am Games Get Debriefed Ahead Of 2016 Bid*, Toronto, Canada: GamesBids, 9 March 2008, archived from the original on 23 October 2008, retrieved 5 May 2009.\n17. **^** \"An introduction to the Venues at the 2016 Rio Games\". *Rio2016.com*.

The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third. The next category was the best Olympic feature, for which TV Globo's show *Esporte Espetacular* finished third, and CCTV from China feature *A Sequel of Love* came second. The winner was NBC Olympics for their feature *The Most Beautiful Thing*. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF from Belgium collected the third place prize for their profile of Nafi Thiam.

To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third.

A final vote was held on 9 October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. At this session, a new voting system was in place: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.[51][52]\n\n\nThe 121st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio 2016 Olympic programme.[53] The tally for rugby was 81 in favor, with eight against,[54] and golf was approved by 63 votes to 26.[55] Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics; rugby last featured in 1924, and golf in 1904.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Olympic rings displayed in Rio de Janeiro\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** \"Windsurfing restored to Brazil 2016 Olympics\". *BBC Sport*. 10 November 2012.

The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January, would act during the Olympic Games.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00 p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23 billion for Rio 2016),[71][72] as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo. As Brasília time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00 p.m. ET, 9:00 p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe urban renovation involved 700 km (430 mi) of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 4 km (2.5 mi) of tunnels; 70 km (43 mi) of roads; 650 km2 (250 sq mi) of sidewalks; 17 km (11 mi) of bike path; 15,000 trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodoviária Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.[23]\n\n\nThe Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.[18]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) National Olympic Committees at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa | * Algeria\n* Angola\n* Benin\n* Botswana\n* Burkina Faso\n* Burundi\n* Cameroon\n* Cape Verde\n* Central African Republic\n* Chad\n* Comoros\n* Congo\n* Democratic Republic of the Congo\n* Djibouti\n* Egypt\n* Equatorial Guinea\n* Eritrea\n* Ethiopia\n* Gabon\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Guinea\n* Guinea-Bissau\n* Ivory Coast\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Libya\n* Madagascar\n* Malawi\n* Mali\n* Mauritania\n* Mauritius\n* Morocco\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Niger\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* São Tomé and Príncipe\n* Senegal\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somalia\n* South Africa\n* South Sudan\n* Sudan\n* Swaziland\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tunisia\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Americas | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Argentina\n* Aruba\n* Bahamas\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Bermuda\n* Bolivia\n* Brazil\n* British Virgin Islands\n* Canada\n* Cayman Islands\n* Chile\n* Colombia\n* Costa Rica\n* Cuba\n* Dominica\n* Dominican Republic\n* Ecuador\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint).
