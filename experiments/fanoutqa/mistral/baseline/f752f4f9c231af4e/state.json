In 2005, Philadelphia had a district graduation rate of 52%. This number increased to 65% in 2014, still below the national and state averages. Scores on the state's standardized test, the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) trended upward from 2005 to 2011 but subsequently decreased. In 2005, the district-run schools scored an average of 37.4% on math and 35.5% on reading. The city's schools reached their peak scores in 2011 with 59.0% on math and 52.3% on reading. In 2014, the scores dropped significantly to 45.2% on math and 42.0% on reading.[150]\n\n\nOf the city's public high schools, including charter schools, only four performed above the national average on the SAT (1497 out of 2400[164]) in 2014: Masterman, Central, Girard Academic Music Program, and MaST Community Charter School.

The municipal court has 27 judges elected by the voters.[259]\n\n\nPennsylvania's three appellate courts also have sittings in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the court of last resort in the state, regularly hears arguments in Philadelphia City Hall.[260] The Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania also sit in Philadelphia several times a year.[261][262] Judges for these courts are elected at large.[263] The state Supreme Court and Superior Court have deputy prothonotary offices in Philadelphia.[264][265]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe City Planning Commission, tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the *Philadelphia2035* physical development plan.[90][91] Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007 to 2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors John F. Street and Michael Nutter. The zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning maps to facilitate future community development, as the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs will be added by 2035.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, the PHA is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, serving about 81,000 people with affordable housing, while employing 1,400 on a budget of $371\u00a0million.[92] The Philadelphia Parking Authority is responsible for ensuring adequate parking for city residents, businesses, and visitors.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhiladelphia's economic sectors include financial services, health care, biotechnology, information technology, trade and transportation, manufacturing, oil refining, food processing, and tourism. Metropolitan Philadelphia is one of the top five American venture capital hubs, credited to its proximity to New York City's financial and tech and biotechnology ecosystems.[22] Financial activities account for the largest economic sector of the metropolitan area, which is also one of the largest health education and research centers in the United States. The city's two largest employers are the federal and city governments. Philadelphia's largest private employer is the University of Pennsylvania, followed by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.[150] A study commissioned by the city's government in 2011 projected 40,000 jobs would be added to the city within 25 years, raising the number of jobs from 675,000 in 2010 to an estimated 715,000 by 2035.[151]\n\n\n\n### Corporations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city's largest university, as noted by number of students, is Temple University, followed by Drexel University.[167] The city's nationally ranked research universities comprise the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, Drexel University, and Thomas Jefferson University. Philadelphia is also home to five schools of medicine: Drexel University College of Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, Temple University School of Medicine, and Thomas Jefferson University's Sidney Kimmel Medical College. Hospitals, universities, and higher education research institutions in Philadelphia's four congressional districts received more than $252\u00a0million in National Institutes of Health grants in 2015.[168]\n\n\nOther institutions of higher learning within the city's borders include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n149. **^** \"Gross domestic product (GDP) by metropolitan area\".

It also was the nation's financial and cultural center until ultimately being eclipsed in total population by New York City in 1790. In 1816, the city's free Black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent Black denomination in the country, and the first Black Episcopal Church. The free Black community also established many schools for its children with the help of Quakers.

In addition, suburbanization enticed many affluent residents to depart the city for its outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The resulting reduction in Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government caused the city to struggle through a long period of adjustment, and it approached bankruptcy by the late 1980s.[72][73]\n\n\nIn 1985, the MOVE Bombing of the Cobbs Creek neighborhood by city helicopters occurred, killing 11 and destroying 61 homes.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Aerial view of Philadelphia International Airport, the busiest airport in Pennsylvania and 21st-busiest in the nation\nTwo airports serve Philadelphia: the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) south-southwest of Center City on the boundary with Delaware County, providing scheduled domestic and international air service,[337] while Northeast Philadelphia Airport (PNE) is a general aviation relief airport in Northeast Philadelphia serving general and corporate aviation.[338] Philadelphia International Airport is among the busiest airports in the world measured by traffic movements (i.e., takeoffs and landings).[339] More than 30\u00a0million passengers pass through the airport annually on 25 airlines, including all major domestic carriers.

The refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer.[364][365]\n\n\n\n#### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Area codes 215, 267, and 445\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania[273]\n| Year\n | Republican | Democratic | Third party |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No.\u202f | % | No.\u202f | % | No.\u202f | %\n |\n| **2020** | 132,870\n | 17.86%\n | 604,175\n | **81.21%** | 6,921\n | 0.93%\n |\n| **2016** | 108,748\n | 15.32%\n | 584,025\n | **82.30%** | 16,845\n | 2.37%\n |\n| **2012** | 96,467\n | 13.97%\n | 588,806\n | **85.24%** | 5,503\n | 0.80%\n |\n| **2008** | 117,221\n | 16.33%\n | 595,980\n | **83.00%** | 4,824\n | 0.67%\n |\n| **2004** | 130,099\n | 19.30%\n | 542,205\n | **80.44%** | 1,765\n | 0.26%\n |\n| **2000** | 100,959\n | 17.99%\n | 449,182\n | **80.04%** | 11,039\n | 1.97%\n |\n| **1996** | 85,345\n | 16.00%\n | 412,988\n | **77.44%** | 34,944\n | 6.55%\n |\n| **1992** | 133,328\n | 20.90%\n | 434,904\n | **68.16%** | 69,826\n | 10.94%\n |\n| **1988** | 219,053\n | 32.45%\n | 449,566\n | **66.60%** | 6,358\n | 0.94%\n |\n| **1984** | 267,178\n | 34.60%\n | 501,369\n | **64.94%** | 3,555\n | 0.46%\n |\n| **1980** | 244,108\n | 33.99%\n | 421,253\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lucas Downey and Somer Anderson (May 19, 2022). \"Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX)\".

Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22121.8\u00a0\u00b0C), and lows of 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from \u221222\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221230\u00a0\u00b0C), on January 19, 1994 to 103\u00a0\u00b0F (39\u00a0\u00b0C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is \u22123\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221219\u00a0\u00b0C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The neighborhoods are Arlington Heights, Bluff, Brighton Heights, Crafton Heights, Duquesne Heights, East Hills, Fineview, Highland Park, Middle Hill, Mount Oliver, Mount Washington, Northview Heights, Perry North (also known as Observatory Hill), Perry South (also known as Perry Hilltop), Polish Hill, Ridgemont, South Side Slopes, Spring Hill-City View, Squirrel Hill, Stanton Heights, Summer Hill, Troy Hill, and Upper Hill.\n2. **^** The warmest daily minimum at the current observation location, Pittsburgh Int'l, is only 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 23, 2010, and July 16, 1980.[74]\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*) if the 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) if the \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C (27\u00a0\u00b0F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[69][70][71] The city and river valleys lie in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b while higher elevated areas and some suburbs lie in zone 6a.[72] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** \"Cloudiness \u2013 Mean Number of Days\". National Climatic Data Center.

For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[82][83] The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging.

The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Water quality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lebanon Valley\n* Lehigh Valley\n* Mahoning Valley\n* Main Line\n* Nittany Valley\n* Northeastern\n* Northern Tier\n* North Central\n* North Penn Valley\n* Ohio Valley\n* Oil Region\n* Oley Valley\n* Pennsylvania Highlands\n* Pennsylvania Wilds\n* Penns Valley\n* Piedmont\n* Pocono Mountains\n* Ridge and Valley\n* South Central\n* Susquehanna Valley\n* Western\n* Wyoming Valley\n |\n| Counties | * Adams\n* Allegheny\n* Armstrong\n* Beaver\n* Bedford\n* Berks\n* Blair\n* Bradford\n* Bucks\n* Butler\n* Cambria\n* Cameron\n* Carbon\n* Centre\n* Chester\n* Clarion\n* Clearfield\n* Clinton\n* Columbia\n* Crawford\n* Cumberland\n* Dauphin\n* Delaware\n* Elk\n* Erie\n* Fayette\n* Forest\n* Franklin\n* Fulton\n* Greene\n* Huntingdon\n* Indiana\n* Jefferson\n* Juniata\n* Lackawanna\n* Lancaster\n* Lawrence\n* Lebanon\n* Lehigh\n* Luzerne\n* Lycoming\n* McKean\n* Mercer\n* Mifflin\n* Monroe\n* Montgomery\n* Montour\n* Northampton\n* Northumberland\n* Perry\n* Philadelphia\n* Pike\n* Potter\n* Schuylkill\n* Snyder\n* Somerset\n* Sullivan\n* Susquehanna\n* Tioga\n* Union\n* Venango\n* Warren\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Top publicly traded companiesin the Pittsburgh region for 2022**(ranked by revenues)*with metropolitan and U.S. ranks* |\n| **Metro** |  | **corporation** |  | **US** |  |\n| 1 |  | The Kraft Heinz Company |  | 139\n |  |\n| 2 |  | U.S. Steel |  | 172\n |  |\n| 3 |  | PNC Financial Services |  | 178\n |  |\n| 4 |  | Viatris |  | 204\n |  |\n| 5 |  | PPG Industries |  | 218\n |  |\n| 6 |  | Dick's Sporting Goods |  | 307\n |  |\n| 7 |  | Alcoa |  | 312\n |  |\n| 8 |  | WESCO International |  | 357\n |  |\n| 9 |  | Wabtec |  | 439\n |  |\n| 10 |  | Arconic |  | 452\n |  |\n|  |\n\n Education is a major economic driver in the region.

The mayor and the nine-member council each serve four-year terms. Since the 1950s the Mayor's Chief of Staff has assumed a large role in advising, long term planning, and as a \"gatekeeper\" to the mayor. City council members are chosen by plurality elections in each of nine districts. The government's official offices are in the Pittsburgh City-County Building.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2018, much of Pittsburgh's population density was concentrated in the central, southern, and eastern areas. The city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile; its most densely populated parts are North Oakland (at 21,200 per square mile) and Uptown Pittsburgh (at 19,869 per square mile). Outside of the city limits, Dormont and Mount Oliver are Pittsburgh's most densely-populated neighborhoods, with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively.[118]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Pittsburgh\n\nSee also: List of corporations in Pittsburgh\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nResidents living in extremely low-lying areas near the rivers or one of the 1,400 creeks and streams may have occasional floods,[178] such as those caused when the remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit rainfall records in 2004.[179] River flooding is relatively rare due to federal flood control efforts extensively managing locks, dams, and reservoirs.[178][180][181] Residents living near smaller tributary streams are less protected from occasional flooding. The cost of a comprehensive flood control program for the region has been estimated at a prohibitive $50\u00a0billion.[178]\n\n\nPittsburgh has the greatest number of bars per capita in the nation.[15]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Pittsburgh\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2015, Pittsburgh was listed among the \"eleven most livable cities in the world\" by *Metropolis* magazine.[135][136] *The Economist*'s Global Liveability Ranking placed Pittsburgh as the most or second-most livable city in the United States in 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2018.[137][138]\n\n\n\n## Arts and culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Pittsburgh\n\n### Entertainment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)East Room of the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens\nPittsburgh has a rich history in arts and culture dating from 19th century industrialists commissioning and donating public works, such as Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts and the Benedum Center, home to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Pittsburgh Opera, respectively as well as such groups as the River City Brass Band and the Pittsburgh Youth Symphony Orchestra.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n112. **^** \"Geography Profile: Pittsburg city, PA\". *data.census.gov*.

By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[42] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[43] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[44]\n\n\nDuring World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95\u00a0million tons of steel for the war effort.[27] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[45][46] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. **^** Seltenrich, Nate (February 18, 2013). \"Tree on the Corner May Be Worth More Than Your House\". *Next City*.

This district contains many theaters and arts venues and is home to a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a four-block mixed-use \"green\" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers of between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south.[56] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 13.9\n | 14.0\n | 13.9\n | 13.5\n | 12.4\n | 11.2\n | 10.5\n | 9.8\n | 11.1\n | 12.0\n | 14.6\n | 153.7\n |\n| Average snowy days (\u2265 0.1 in) | 12.2\n | 9.3\n | 5.9\n | 1.6\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.3\n | 3.3\n | 7.6\n | 40.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 69.9\n | 67.3\n | 64.1\n | 59.8\n | 63.4\n | 66.2\n | 68.8\n | 71.2\n | 72.0\n | 68.3\n | 70.2\n | 71.9\n | 67.8\n |\n| Average dew point \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 17.2(\u22128.2)\n | 18.9(\u22127.3)\n | 26.8(\u22122.9)\n | 34.5(1.4)\n | 45.9(7.7)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 60.1(15.6)\n | 59.5(15.3)\n | 53.4(11.9)\n | 40.8(4.9)\n | 32.4(0.2)\n | 23.2(\u22124.9)\n | 39.0(3.9)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 93.9\n | 108.5\n | 155.4\n | 182.8\n | 217.4\n | 242.2\n | 254.9\n | 228.4\n | 196.7\n | 167.3\n | 99.4\n | 74.4\n | 2,021.3\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 31\n | 36\n | 42\n | 46\n | 49\n | 54\n | 56\n | 54\n | 53\n | 48\n | 33\n | 26\n | 45\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (relative humidity, dew point and sun 1961\u20131990)[74][78][73][79] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Pittsburgh (city), Pennsylvania\". *State & County QuickFacts*.

Two years later, in 1843, Northampton Bank failed as a result of the bank's excessive speculation, resulting in financial ruin for many bank customers. Five years later, on June 1, 1848, a large fire burned down most of Allentown's central business district between 7th and 8th Streets on Hamilton Street. During the 1850s, however, the city began recovering. A new bridge was built across the Lehigh River, and brick buildings were constructed to replace wooden ones that were burned in the 1848 fire.

It includes both Lehigh and Northampton counties.\n\n\nThe Lehigh Valley's adjacent counties include Carbon and Monroe counties to its north, Bucks County to its southeast, Montgomery County to its south, Berks and Schuylkill counties to its west, and Warren County, New Jersey to its east.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape and neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Buildings and architecture of Allentown, Pennsylvania; Center City Allentown; and List of Allentown neighborhoods\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe geographic area that includes present-day Center City Allentown was acquired in the 1737 Walking Purchase and initially organized, established, and named in 1762 by William Allen, a wealthy shipping merchant who served as a mayor of Philadelphia and chief justice of the Province of Pennsylvania during the colonial era. It is likely that rivalry among the Penns prompted Allen to decide to start the city in 1762.[14]\n\n\nA decade earlier, in 1752, Northampton and Berks counties were formed; Easton was named the county seat of Northampton County, and Reading the county seat of Berks County. In 1763, a year after Allentown's founding, an effort was made by William Allen and others to move the county seat from Easton to Allentown, but the Penns' influence prevailed and the county seat remained in Easton.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAllentown historically was a hub for the nation's earliest industrialization and its economy was heavily manufacturing-based. Beginning in the late 20th century, the city evolved into a more service-oriented economy due to Rust Belt decline in heavy industry that commenced around 1980 and accelerated through the 20th century's last two decades. Allentown is corporate headquarters for several large companies, including Air Products,[66] PPL Corporation, and others.[67] The largest employer in Allentown, as of 2007, is Lehigh Valley Health Network with over 7,800 employees.[68] Lehigh Valley Health Network's flagship hospital, Lehigh Valley Hospital\u2013Cedar Crest, is Pennsylvania's third-largest hospital with 877 licensed beds and 46 operating rooms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAllentown is legally classified as a Pennsylvania third-class city and has operated with the strong-mayor version of the mayor-council form of government since 1970. The mayor serves as the city's chief executive and administrative officer, and the city council serves as the legislative and oversight body.[82] Elected \"at-large,\" the mayor serves a four-year term under the city's home rule charter.[83] The current city mayor is Democrat Matthew Tuerk. The legislative branch, the Allentown City Council, includes seven council members elected at large for four-year staggered terms.[83] City Council holds regular public meetings in order to enact city legislation, including ordinances and resolutions. The current president of the City Council is Daryl Hendricks.[84] The City Controller, who is responsible for oversight of the city's finances, is elected and serves a four-year term.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAllentown's parks include Bicentennial Park, a 4,600 seat mini-stadium built for sporting events, the 127-acre Cedar Creek Parkway, which includes Lake Muhlenberg, Cedar Beach, and Malcolm W.

In 1736, a large area north of Philadelphia was deeded by 23 chiefs of the Five Civilized Tribes to three sons of William Penn: John Penn, Thomas Penn, and Richard Penn. The price for this tract included shoes and buckles, hats, shirts, knives, scissors, combs, needles, looking glasses, rum, and pipes.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Municipal Band of Allentown\n* Musikfest\n* Saucon Valley Country Club\n* SouthSide Film Festival\n* Trexler Nature Preserve\n* Wind Creek Bethlehem\n |\n| Shopping | * Lehigh Valley Mall\n* Outlets at Wind Creek\n* Palmer Park Mall\n* Promenade Saucon Valley\n* Shoppes at Trexler\n* South Mall\n* Westgate Mall\n* Whitehall Mall\n |\n| Sports | * Allentown baseball history\n* Allentown sports\n* Cycling\n* Gymnastics\n* High school sports\n* IronPigs AAA baseball\n* Lafayette Leopards\n* Lehigh Mountain Hawks\n* Lehigh Valley Roller Derby\n* Phantoms AHL ice hockey\n* Muhlenberg Mules\n* The Rivalry (Lafayette\u2013Lehigh)\n |\n| Transportation | * Allentown Queen City Municipal Airport\n* Braden Airpark\n* LANta\n* Lehigh Valley International Airport\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** \"Red River Campaign (Louisiana, March to June 1864) Archived January 12, 2023, at the Wayback Machine,\" in *47th Pennsylvania Volunteers: One Civil War Regiment's Story*, 2014.\n31. **^** \"About the 47th Pennsylvania Volunteers\". *47th Pennsylvania Volunteers*.

On December 16, 2010, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted to split the area code, which was to take effect February 1, 2012.[92] The North American Numbering Plan decided that northwest Pennsylvania would receive the new code of 582. A local grassroots coalition began organizing an opposition to the plan and generated numerous petitions for reconsideration. The PUC immediately voted to review their decision and ordered additional public-input hearings and technical conferences as a response to the strong public outcry.[93] In January 2011, the PUC announced that it was placing the entire area code split plan on hold as NEUSTAR pushed the projected exhaustion date back two years to 2015.[94]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the Association of Religion Data Archives,[47] Erie County had a total population of 280,843\u00a0people in 2000, of which 103,333 claimed affiliation with the Catholic Church, 40,301 with mainline Protestant houses of worship, and 12,980 with evangelical Protestant churches.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Erie Forge and Steel factory at 16th and Greengarden Streets\nErie is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's primary access point to Lake Erie, the Great Lakes, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

Historically, Erie had numerous ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Italy, which is located on Erie's west side, featuring the West 18th Street commercial corridor. South of 38th Street, the grid gives way to curvilinear roads of post-1970 suburban development. Millcreek Township and upper Peach Street in Summit Township include the Erie metropolitan area's newer developments.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. Andrew Ellicott, who completed Pierre Charles L'Enfant's survey of Washington, D.C., and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey and lay out the plan for the city in June 1795. The initial settlement of the area began that year.[11][12] Lt. Colonel Seth Reed and his family moved to the Erie area from Geneva, New York; they were Yankees from Uxbridge, Massachusetts. They became the first European-American settlers of Erie in present-day Presque Isle.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Battle of Lake Erie and Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the decline of large manufacturers in the later 20th century, a more diverse mix of midsized industries has emerged.

Reflecting this perceived decline, Erie is occasionally referred to by residents as \"The Mistake on the Lake\" or \"Dreary Erie\".[17] Downtown Erie has undergone a resurgence in the early 2020s with the opening of Flagship City Food Hall and Flagship City Public Market.[18] [19]\n\n\nErie won the All-America City Award in 1972 and was a finalist in 1961, 1994, 1995, and 2009.[20][21] In 2012, Erie hosted the Perry 200,[22] a commemoration celebrating 200 years of peace between Britain, America, and Canada following the War of 1812 and Battle of Lake Erie.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n**Erie, Pennsylvania** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Definitions from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Textbooks from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)Resources from Wikiversity\n* ![](image)Travel information from Wikivoyage\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has the text of an 1879 *American Cyclop\u00e6dia* article about ***Erie, Pennsylvania***.\n\n* Official website\n* Erie Area Convention and Visitors Bureau\n\n\n| Places adjacent to Erie, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lake Erie | ![](image) Presque Isle State Park | ![](image) Buffalo, Niagara Falls |\n|  | ![](image) |  |\n| ![](image) Erie International Airport | ![](image)**Erie**![](image)\n | ![](image) Jamestown |\n|  | ![](image) |  |\n| ![](image) Cleveland | ![](image) Millcreek, Edinboro, Pittsburgh | ![](image) Union City |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nErie is located approximately 80 miles (130\u00a0km) from Buffalo, 90 miles (140\u00a0km) from Cleveland, and 120 miles (190\u00a0km) from Pittsburgh.[6] Erie's manufacturing sector remains prominent in the local economy, while insurance, healthcare, higher education, technology, service industries, and tourism are emerging as significant economic drivers. Like the other Great Lakes port cities, Erie is accessible to the oceans via the Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River network in Canada. The local climate is humid, four-seasonal, and snowy, with warm summers and harsh winters, owing to its southern lakeshore location.\n\n\nThe city was named for the Native American Erie people who lived in the area until the mid-17th century. Erie is nicknamed both the \"Gem City\", in reference to it once being known as the \"Gem of the Great Lakes\" due to its fine natural harbor; and more recently, the \"Flagship City\", from a local marketing effort to promote its status as the home port of Oliver Hazard Perry's flagship *Niagara*.[7]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlong West 6th Street is Millionaires Row, a collection of 19th-century Victorian mansions.

When the French abandoned the fort in 1760 during the French and Indian War in the Seven Years' War, it was the last post they held west of Niagara River. The British established a garrison at the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the French and Indian War.[9]\n\n\nErie is in what was the disputed Erie Triangle, a tract of land comprising 202,187 acres in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania fronting Lake Erie that was claimed after the American Revolutionary War by the newly formed states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, as part of its Western Reserve, and Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The last McDonnell Douglas DC-9 to fly for US Air arriving at Erie International Airport\n![](image)Union Station is served by Amtrak's *Lake Shore Limited*\n![](image)A road map of Erie and its major routes\n![](image)Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)State and 9th Streets in downtown Erie during the early 1920s\nOn August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek flooded downtown Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, was blocked by debris and collapsed.[15] A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225\u00a0houses and killed 36\u00a0people.[15] After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another, larger culvert, constructed under more than 2 miles of the city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nErie is home to The Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps, ten-time Drum Corps International World Champion as of 2023. The Cadets entered a long-term partnership with the Erie Sports Center in February 2023, prompting them to move The Cadets all operations of Cadets Arts & Entertainment, Inc. to Erie.[68][69]\n\n\nErie has been the location for many movies, including the hometown for the fictional band The Wonders in *That Thing You Do!* featuring Tom Hanks. It is mentioned in the film *Wall Street* as the location of the fictional company Anacott Steel. Erie is the hometown of Train lead singer, Patrick Monahan.

Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s.\n\n\nThe naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird was born in Reading in 1823.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (P&R) was incorporated in 1833. During the Long Depression following the Panic of 1873, a statewide railroad strike in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed.[18] The Reading Brewing Company was also established around this same time, and was officially chartered in 1886.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the time of the American Revolution, the area's iron industry had a total production exceeding England's. There were several prominent Ironmasters like Samuel Van Leer who helped supply George Washington's troops with cannons, rifles, and ammunition in the Revolutionary War.[16] During the early period of the conflict, Reading was again a depot for military supply. Hessian prisoners from the Battle of Trenton were also detained here.\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the nation's capital at the time of the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic.[17] President George Washington traveled to Reading, and considered making it the emergency national capital, but chose Germantown instead.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\nIn 1809, Susanna Cox was tried and convicted for infanticide in Reading.

Annual snowfall is variable, but averages around 25 inches (64\u00a0cm). Spring temperatures vary widely between freezing temperatures and the 80s or even 90s (around 30\u00a0\u00b0C) later in spring. The last killing frost usually is in early to mid April.

Taking its name from Reading, Berkshire, England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western Germany, who bought land from the Penns. The first Amish community in the New World was established in Greater Reading, Berks County.[15] The Pennsylvanian German dialect was spoken in the area well into the 1950s.\n\n\nDuring the French and Indian War, Reading was a military base for a chain of forts along the Blue Mountain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNortheastern United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * Culture\n* Geography\n* Government\n* History\n |\n| States | * Connecticut\n* Delaware\n* Maryland\n* Massachusetts\n* New Hampshire\n* New Jersey\n* New York\n* Maine\n* Pennsylvania\n* Rhode Island\n* Vermont\n |\n| Federal districts | * District of Columbia\n |\n| Major cities | * Allentown\n* Alexandria\n* Arlington\n* Baltimore\n* Boston\n* Bridgeport\n* Buffalo\n* Burlington\n* Cambridge\n* Elizabeth\n* Erie\n* Hartford\n* Jersey City\n* Lowell\n* Manchester\n* New Haven\n* New York City\n* Newark\n* Paterson\n* Philadelphia\n* Pittsburgh\n* Portland\n* Providence\n* Quincy\n* Reading\n* Rochester\n* Scranton\n* Springfield\n* Stamford\n* Syracuse\n* Washington, D.C.\n* Waterbury\n* Wilmington\n* Worcester\n |\n| State capitals | * Albany\n* Annapolis\n* Augusta\n* Boston\n* Concord\n* Dover\n* Hartford\n* Harrisburg\n* Montpelier\n* Providence\n* Trenton\n |\n| See also | * Northeast megalopolis\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA number of federal and state highways allow entry to and egress from Reading.

Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic U.S. version of the *Monopoly* board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as \"The Pretzel City\" because numerous local pretzel bakeries are based in the city and its suburbs; currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists with more than 125 miles of trails in five major preserves; the region is an International Mountain Bicycling Association ride center.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing more than a century of prosperity, the Reading Company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in 1971. The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail).
