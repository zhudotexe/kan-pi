Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh. The official websites of the Holy See[119] and of Vatican City[120] are primarily in Italian, with versions of their pages in a large number of languages to varying extents.\n\n\n\n### Citizenship[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Constituent countries | * ***London***, England\n* ***Edinburgh***, Scotland\n* ***Cardiff***, Wales\n* ***Belfast***, Northern Ireland\n |\n| Crown Dependencies andOverseas Territories | * ***Douglas***, Isle of Man\n* ***Episkopi Cantonment***, Akrotiri and Dhekelia\n* ***Gibraltar***, Gibraltar\n* ***St Helier***, Jersey\n* ***Saint Peter Port***, Guernsey\n |\n\n |\n| Other | * ***Longyearbyen**, Svalbard (Norway)*\n* ***Tórshavn**, Faroe Islands (Denmark)*\n |\n\n |\n| Federal states | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Austria | * ***Bregenz***, Vorarlberg\n* ***Eisenstadt***, Burgenland\n* ***Graz***, Styria\n* ***Innsbruck***, Tyrol\n* ***Klagenfurt***, Carinthia\n* ***Linz***, Upper Austria\n* ***Salzburg***, Salzburg\n* ***Sankt Pölten***, Lower Austria\n* ***Vienna***, Vienna\n |\n| Belgium | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Sarajevo**, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* **Skopje**, North Macedonia\n* **Sofia**, Bulgaria\n* **Stockholm**, Sweden\n* **Tallinn**, Estonia\n* **Tbilisi**, Georgia3\n* **Tirana**, Albania\n* **Vaduz**, Liechtenstein\n* **Valletta**, Malta\n* **Vatican City**5\n* **Vienna**, Austria\n* **Vilnius**, Lithuania\n* **Warsaw**, Poland\n* **Yerevan**, Armenia3\n* **Zagreb**, Croatia\n |\n| States withlimited recognition | * ***North Nicosia**, Northern Cyprus*3\n* ***Pristina**, Kosovo*\n* ***Stepanakert**, Republic of Artsakh*3\n* ***Sukhumi**, Abkhazia*3\n* ***Tiraspol**, Transnistria*\n* ***Tskhinvali**, South Ossetia*3\n |\n| Dependencies | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| United Kingdom | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCapitals of European states and territories\n |\n| --- |\n| Capitals of dependent territories and states whose sovereignty is disputed shown in *italics*.\n |\n| Sovereign states | * **Amsterdam**, Netherlands1\n* **Andorra la Vella**, Andorra\n* **Ankara**, Turkey3\n* **Astana**, Kazakhstan3\n* **Athens**, Greece\n* **Baku**, Azerbaijan3\n* **Belgrade**, Serbia\n* **Berlin**, Germany\n* **Bern**, Switzerland\n* **Bratislava**, Slovakia\n* **Brussels**, Belgium2\n* **Bucharest**, Romania\n* **Budapest**, Hungary\n* **Chișinău**, Moldova\n* **Copenhagen**, Denmark\n* **Dublin**, Ireland\n* **Helsinki**, Finland\n* **Kyiv**, Ukraine\n* **Lisbon**, Portugal\n* **Ljubljana**, Slovenia\n* **London**, United Kingdom\n* **Luxembourg**, Luxembourg\n* **Madrid**, Spain\n* **Minsk**, Belarus\n* **Monaco**5\n* **Moscow**, Russia\n* **Nicosia**, Cyprus3\n* **Oslo**, Norway\n* **Paris**, France\n* **Podgorica**, Montenegro\n* **Prague**, Czech Republic\n* **Reykjavík**, Iceland\n* **Riga**, Latvia\n* **Rome**, Italy\n* **San Marino**, San Marino\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Communities | * ***Brussels***, Flemish Community and French Community\n* ***Eupen***, German-speaking Community\n |\n| Regions | * ***Brussels***, Brussels-Capital Region and Flanders\n* ***Namur***, Wallonia\n |\n\n |\n| Bosnia and Herzegovina | * ***Banja Luka*** (de facto), Republika Srpska\n* ***Brčko***, Brčko District\n* ***Sarajevo***, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n |\n| Germany | * ***Berlin***, Berlin\n* ***Bremen***, Bremen\n* ***Dresden***, Saxony\n* ***Düsseldorf***, North Rhine-Westphalia\n* ***Erfurt***, Thuringia\n* ***Hamburg***, Hamburg\n* ***Hanover***, Lower Saxony\n* ***Kiel***, Schleswig-Holstein\n* ***Magdeburg***, Saxony-Anhalt\n* ***Mainz***, Rhineland-Palatinate\n* ***Munich***, Bavaria\n* ***Potsdam***, Brandenburg\n* ***Saarbrücken***, Saarland\n* ***Schwerin***, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\n* ***Stuttgart***, Baden-Württemberg\n* ***Wiesbaden***, Hesse\n |\n| Russia | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish.

It has used the euro as its currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European Union (council decision 1999/98/EC). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002—the Vatican does not issue euro banknotes. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.[108] Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.[109] Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own Vatican lira currency, which was on par with the Italian lira.\n\n\nVatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7 million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15 million euros.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCoat of arms\n |\n| **Anthem:** *Inno e Marcia Pontificale* (Italian)\"Pontifical Anthem and March\"noicon |\n| **National Seal*** *Sigillum Stati Civitatis Vaticanae* (Latin)*Sigillo dello Stato della Città del Vaticano* (Italian)\nNational Seal of Vatican City![](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n| Official languages | * Latin\n* Italian[1][2]\n |\n| National language | Italian (*de facto*)[a] |\n| Religion  | Catholicism(state religion) |\n| Demonym(s) | Officially: none[4] Unofficially: Vaticanian or Vaticano |\n| Government | Unitary theocratic Catholic elective absolute monarchy[5][6][7][8] |\n|  |\n| • Sovereign entity\n | Holy See |\n| • Monarch\n | Pope Francis |\n| • Secretary of State\n | Pietro Parolin |\n| • President of the Governorate\n | Fernando Vérgez Alzaga |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Pontifical Commission[b] |\n| Independence |\n|  |\n| • Donation of Pepin\n | 756 (1268 years ago) |\n| • Lateran Treaty\n | 11 February 1929 (95 years ago) |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| • Total\n | 0.49[c] km2 (0.19 sq mi) (195th) |\n| Population |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn statistics comparing countries in various per capita or per area metrics, Vatican City is often an outlier—these can stem from the state's small size and ecclesiastical function.[121] For example, as most of the roles which would confer citizenship are reserved for men, the gender ratio of the citizenship is several men per woman.[122] Further oddities are petty crimes against tourists resulting in a very high per-capita crime rate,[123] and the city-state leading the world in per-capita wine consumption due to its sacramental use.[121] A jocular illustration of these anomalies is sometimes made by calculating a \"Popes per km2\" statistic, which is greater than two because the country is less than half a square kilometre in area.[124]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The *Ingresso di Sant'Anna*, an entrance to Vatican City from Italy\nVatican City State is a recognised national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into international agreements in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.\n\n\nBecause of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City—embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.\n\n\nThe size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The shortest national railway system in the world\nVatican City has a reasonably well-developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). As a state that is 1.05 kilometres (1,150 yards) long and 0.85 km (930 yd) wide,[128] it has a small transportation system with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the Vatican City Heliport. Vatican City is one of the few independent countries without an airport, and is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport and to a lesser extent Ciampino Airport.[129]\n\n\nThere is a standard gauge railway, mainly used to transport freight, connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an 852-metre-long (932 yd) spur, 300 metres (330 yd) of which is within Vatican territory.[129] Pope John XXIII was the first Pope to make use of the railway; Pope John Paul II rarely used it.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Europe portal**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Vatican City(index, outline) | * Enclaved in Rome, Italy\n\t+ Lateran Treaty, 1929\n* along with extraterritorial properties of the Holy See\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** \"Holy See (Vatican City): Economy\". *CIA – The World Factbook*.

It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.[114] Some individuals are also authorized to reside in the city but do not qualify or choose not to request citizenship.[114] Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an Italian citizen as provided in the Lateran Treaty.[55]\n\n\nThe Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.\n\n\n\n### Statistical oddities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** Duursma, Jorri C.

The Pope is the sovereign of the state, while legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the president of that commission, assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the Pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches over Vatican City,[73]\nand is thus the only absolute monarch in Europe.[74]\n\n\nOperationally, there are departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications and other matters.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Sede vacante[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAll recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their basic training with the Swiss Armed Forces with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least 174 cm (5 ft 9 in) in height. Members are equipped with small arms and the traditional halberd (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics. The Palatine Guard and the Noble Guard, the last armed forces of the Vatican City State, were disbanded by Pope Paul VI in 1970.[50] As Vatican City has listed every building in its territory on the International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict theoretically renders it immune to armed attack.[83]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Holy See(List of popes) | * Pope Francis\n* Ecumenical councils\n* College of Cardinals\n\t+ List\n\t+ Advisers\n* Roman Curia\n\t+ Dicasteries\n* Synod of Bishops\n* Properties\n |\n| Vatican City | * Index\n* Outline\n* Apostolic Palace\n* Lateran Treaty\n* Roman Rota\n* St. Peter's Basilica\n* Swiss Guard\n* Vatican Museums\n |\n| Polity (Holy orders) | * Diocese\n\t+ Episcopal conference\n\t+ Eparchy\n* Bishop\n\t+ Patriarch\n\t+ Major\n\t+ Primate\n\t+ Metropolitan\n\t+ Archbishop\n\t+ Diocesan\n\t+ Coadjutor\n\t+ Auxiliary\n\t+ Titular\n\t+ Emeritus\n* Parish\n* Priest\n* Deacon\n |\n| Consecrated life | * Religious:\n* Superior\n\t+ Abbot, Abbess\n\t+ General\n\t+ Provincial\n\t+ Prior, Prioress\n* Grand master\n* Brother\n\t+ Friar\n\t+ Monk\n* Sister\n\t+ Nun\n* Hermit\n* Novice\n\t+ Master\n\t+ Oblate\n\t+ Postulant\n |\n| Particular churchessui iuris | * Latin Church\n* Eastern Catholic Churches\n\t+ Albanian\n\t+ Armenian\n\t+ Belarusian\n\t+ Bulgarian\n\t+ Chaldean\n\t+ Coptic\n\t+ Croatian and Serbian\n\t+ Eritrean\n\t+ Ethiopian\n\t+ Georgian\n\t+ Greek\n\t+ Hungarian\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2012, the US Department of State's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy, and Russia.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Territory of Vatican City State according to the Lateran Treaty\nWhen the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.[54]\n\n\nThe territory includes St. Peter's Square, distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the Via della Conciliazione which runs from close to the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by Benito Mussolini after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs Vatican City is an enclave within Italy, its military defence is provided by the Italian Armed Forces. However, there is no formal defence treaty with Italy, as Vatican City is a neutral state. Vatican City has no armed forces of its own, although the Swiss Guard is a military corps of the Holy See responsible for the personal security of the Pope, and residents in the state. Soldiers of the Swiss Guard are entitled to hold Vatican City State passports and nationality. Swiss mercenaries were historically recruited by Popes as part of an army for the Papal States, and the Pontifical Swiss Guard was founded by Pope Julius II on 22 January 1506 as the Pope's personal bodyguard and continues to fulfill that function. It is listed in the *Annuario Pontificio* under \"Holy See\", not under \"State of Vatican City\". At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and Switzerland. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Officials | * Pope Francis\n* Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin\n* Cardinals\n\t+ List\n\t+ Advisers\n |\n| Governance | * Secretariat of State\n* College of Cardinals\n\t+ Papal conclave\n |\n| Government | * Roman Curia\n\t+ Apostolic Camera\n\t+ Commissions\n\t\t- For Vatican City State\n\t+ Councils\n\t+ Congregations\n\t+ Dicasteries\n |\n| Foreign affairs(Multilateral policy) | * Section for Relations with States\n* To the Holy See\n* Of the Holy See\n\t+ Heads\n* Italy\n* United Nations\n\t+ Permanent Observer\n\t\t- in Geneva\n* European Union\n\t+ Permanent Observer to the Council of Europe\n* Apostolic nunciature\n\t+ Nuncio\n* Treaties\n\t+ Concordats\n |\n\n |\n| Dioceseof Romewith universalfull communion(Papal primacy) | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Synods | * Ordinary general assemblies\n* Extraordinary general assemblies\n* Special assemblies\n |\n| Ecclesiasticalprovince of Rome(Vicariate: Rome,Vatican City) | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the Lateran Treaty, certain properties of the Holy See that are located in Italian territory, most notably the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo and the major basilicas, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign embassies.[55][56] These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.[56]\n\n\nCastel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by police agents of Vatican City State and not by Italian police.

They ruled the Papal States, which covered a large portion of the Italian peninsula, for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the newly created Kingdom of Italy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Headquarters | * Vatican City:\n* Apostolic Palace\n\t+ Papal apartments\n\t+ Sistine Chapel\n* Italy:\n* Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran (cathedra)\n |\n| Major basilicas | * Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran\n* St. Peter's Basilica\n* Basilica of Saint Mary Major\n* Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls\n |\n| TitlesPapal names | * His Holiness\n* Bishop of Rome\n* Vicar of Jesus Christ\n* Successor of the Prince of the Apostles\n* Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church\n* Patriarch of the West\n* Primate of Italy\n* Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province\n* Sovereign of the Vatican City State\n* Servant of the servants of God\n |\n| Symbols | * Coats of arms\n* Coat of arms of the Holy See\n* Cross\n* Keys of Heaven\n* Regalia and insignia\n* Rota\n* Umbraculum\n |\n| Proclamations | * Infallibility\n* Apostolic constitution\n* Bull\n\t+ List\n* Encyclical\n* Apostolic exhortation\n* Ecclesiastical letter\n* Interdict\n |\n| Activities | * Arbitration\n\t+ Deposition\n* Blessing\n\t+ \"Pontifical\"\n\t+ *Urbi et Orbi*\n* Conclave\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVatican City population on 26 June 2023[13]\n| Sex | all\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |\n| Cardinals | 55 | 9 |  |\n| Diplomats | 317 |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 104 |  |\n| Others |  | 132 | 518\n |\n| Total | 618 | 518\n |\n| 372 | 246\n |\n| 764\n |\n| 1,136\n |\n\nVatican City population on 1 March 2011[115]\n| Sex | all | male | female\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other | Vatican | other | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |  | 1 |  |  |  |  |\n| Cardinals | 43 | 30 |  | 43 | 30 |  |  |  |  |\n| Diplomats | 306 |  |  | 306 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 86 |  |  | 86 |  |  |  |  |\n| Other religious |  | 50 | 197 |  | 49 | 102 |  | 1 | 95\n |\n| Other lay |  | 56 | 24 |  | 25 | 3 |  | 31 | 21\n |\n| Total | 572 | 221 | 540 | 105 | 32 | 116\n |\n| 349 | 223 | 349 | 191 |  | 32\n |\n| 444 | 296 | 148\n |\n| 793 | 645 | 148\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Palace of the Governorate of Vatican City State\nLegislative functions are delegated to the unicameral Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, led by the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State.

Acts of the commission must be approved by the Pope, through the Holy See's Secretariat of State, and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe closest metro station is Ottaviano – San Pietro – Musei Vaticani.[130]\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican's post office was established on 11 February 1929.\nThe City is served by an independent, modern telephone system named the Vatican Telephone Service,[131] and a postal system (Poste Vaticane) that started operating on 13 February 1929. On 1 August, the state started to release its own postal stamps, under the authority of the Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State.[132] The city's postal service is sometimes said to be \"the best in the world\",[133] and faster than the postal service in Rome.[133]\n\n\nThe Vatican also controls its own Internet top-level domain, which is registered as (.va). Broadband service is widely provided within Vatican City. Vatican City has also been given a radio ITU prefix, HV, and this is sometimes used by amateur radio operators.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Lateran Palace\n\t+ Lateran University\n\t+ Scala Sancta\n\t+ Sancta Sanctorum\n\t+ Adjoining buildings\n* Palace of Saint Callixtus\n* Gianicolo Hill area\n\t+ Pontifical Urban University\n\t+ Pontifical North American College\n\t+ Bambino Gesù Hospital\n* Palazzo della Cancelleria\n* Palace of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples\n* Palace of the Holy Office\n* Palace of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches\n* Palazzo Pio\n* Palace of the Vicariate\n* Pontifical Minor Roman Seminary\n* Collegio Teutonico\n\t+ Teutonic Cemetery\n* Benedictine monastery\n* Pontifical Oratory of San Paolo\n* Beda College\n* Paul VI Audience Hall\n |\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Non-extraterritorial | * Palace of the Holy Apostles\n* Palace of San Carlo ai Catinari\n* Collegio Bellarmino\n* Archaeological Institute\n* Pontifical Oriental Institute\n* Pontifical Lombard Seminary\n* Russian College\n* Two Palaces of Sant'Apollinare\n* House of Retreat for the Clergy of Saints John and Paul\n\t+ Nympheum of Nero\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"Vatican surpasses all nations... in pickpockets?\" Archived 15 November 2012 at the Wayback Machine.

The corps has 130 personnel and is a part of the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence (which also includes the Vatican Fire Brigade), an organ of the Governorate of Vatican City.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Vatican City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nVatican City contains religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Apostolic Library, and the Vatican Museums. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by donations from the faithful, by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs, fees for admission to museums, and sales of publications. Vatican City has no taxes and items are duty-free.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Vatican City* was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state named after Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state within the city of Rome. \"Vatican\" is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, *Vatica* or *Vaticum*, located in the general area the Romans called *Ager Vaticanus*, \"Vatican territory\".[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2023, Vatican City had a population of 764 residents, regardless of citizenship.[13] There were also 372 Vatican citizens residing elsewhere,[13] consisting of diplomats of the Holy See to other countries and cardinals residing in Rome.[114]\n\n\nThe population is composed of clergy, other religious members, laypeople serving the state (such as the Swiss Guard) and their family members.[115] In 2013 there were 13 families of the employees of the Holy See living in Vatican City,[116] in 2019 there were 20 children of the Swiss Guards living at the Vatican.[117] All citizens, residents and places of worship in the city are Catholic. The city also receives thousands of tourists and workers every day.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConstruction in 1995 of a new guest house, Domus Sanctae Marthae, adjacent to St Peter's Basilica was criticised by Italian environmental groups, backed by Italian politicians. They claimed the new building would block views of the Basilica from nearby Italian apartments.[51] For a short while the plans strained the relations between the Vatican and the Italian government. The head of the Vatican's Department of Technical Services robustly rejected challenges to the Vatican State's right to build within its borders.[51]\n\n\nJohn R. Morss writes in the *European Journal of International Law* that due to the terms of the Lateran Treaty, Vatican City's status as a sovereign state, and the Pope's status as a head of state, are problematic.[*clarification needed*][52]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** \"Raising Children Within the Vatican: Life of a Swiss Guard Familydate =5 August 2019\".

Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state.

Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002—the Vatican does not issue euro banknotes. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.[108] Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.[109] Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own Vatican lira currency, which was on par with the Italian lira.\n\n\nVatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7 million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15 million euros.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCoat of arms\n |\n| **Anthem:** *Inno e Marcia Pontificale* (Italian)\"Pontifical Anthem and March\"noicon |\n| **National Seal*** *Sigillum Stati Civitatis Vaticanae* (Latin)*Sigillo dello Stato della Città del Vaticano* (Italian)\nNational Seal of Vatican City![](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n| Official languages | * Latin\n* Italian[1][2]\n |\n| National language | Italian (*de facto*)[a] |\n| Religion  | Catholicism(state religion) |\n| Demonym(s) | Officially: none[4] Unofficially: Vaticanian or Vaticano |\n| Government | Unitary theocratic Catholic elective absolute monarchy[5][6][7][8] |\n|  |\n| • Sovereign entity\n | Holy See |\n| • Monarch\n | Pope Francis |\n| • Secretary of State\n | Pietro Parolin |\n| • President of the Governorate\n | Fernando Vérgez Alzaga |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Pontifical Commission[b] |\n| Independence |\n|  |\n| • Donation of Pepin\n | 756 (1268 years ago) |\n| • Lateran Treaty\n | 11 February 1929 (95 years ago) |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| • Total\n | 0.49[c] km2 (0.19 sq mi) (195th) |\n| Population |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn statistics comparing countries in various per capita or per area metrics, Vatican City is often an outlier—these can stem from the state's small size and ecclesiastical function.[121] For example, as most of the roles which would confer citizenship are reserved for men, the gender ratio of the citizenship is several men per woman.[122] Further oddities are petty crimes against tourists resulting in a very high per-capita crime rate,[123] and the city-state leading the world in per-capita wine consumption due to its sacramental use.[121] A jocular illustration of these anomalies is sometimes made by calculating a \"Popes per km2\" statistic, which is greater than two because the country is less than half a square kilometre in area.[124]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The *Ingresso di Sant'Anna*, an entrance to Vatican City from Italy\nVatican City State is a recognised national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into international agreements in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.\n\n\nBecause of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City—embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.\n\n\nThe size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The shortest national railway system in the world\nVatican City has a reasonably well-developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). As a state that is 1.05 kilometres (1,150 yards) long and 0.85 km (930 yd) wide,[128] it has a small transportation system with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the Vatican City Heliport. Vatican City is one of the few independent countries without an airport, and is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport and to a lesser extent Ciampino Airport.[129]\n\n\nThere is a standard gauge railway, mainly used to transport freight, connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an 852-metre-long (932 yd) spur, 300 metres (330 yd) of which is within Vatican territory.[129] Pope John XXIII was the first Pope to make use of the railway; Pope John Paul II rarely used it.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Europe portal**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Vatican City(index, outline) | * Enclaved in Rome, Italy\n\t+ Lateran Treaty, 1929\n* along with extraterritorial properties of the Holy See\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** \"Holy See (Vatican City): Economy\". *CIA – The World Factbook*.

Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.[114] Some individuals are also authorized to reside in the city but do not qualify or choose not to request citizenship.[114] Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an Italian citizen as provided in the Lateran Treaty.[55]\n\n\nThe Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.\n\n\n\n### Statistical oddities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** Duursma, Jorri C.

The Pope is the sovereign of the state, while legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the president of that commission, assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the Pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches over Vatican City,[73]\nand is thus the only absolute monarch in Europe.[74]\n\n\nOperationally, there are departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications and other matters.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Sede vacante[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAll recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their basic training with the Swiss Armed Forces with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least 174 cm (5 ft 9 in) in height. Members are equipped with small arms and the traditional halberd (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics. The Palatine Guard and the Noble Guard, the last armed forces of the Vatican City State, were disbanded by Pope Paul VI in 1970.[50] As Vatican City has listed every building in its territory on the International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict theoretically renders it immune to armed attack.[83]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Holy See(List of popes) | * Pope Francis\n* Ecumenical councils\n* College of Cardinals\n\t+ List\n\t+ Advisers\n* Roman Curia\n\t+ Dicasteries\n* Synod of Bishops\n* Properties\n |\n| Vatican City | * Index\n* Outline\n* Apostolic Palace\n* Lateran Treaty\n* Roman Rota\n* St. Peter's Basilica\n* Swiss Guard\n* Vatican Museums\n |\n| Polity (Holy orders) | * Diocese\n\t+ Episcopal conference\n\t+ Eparchy\n* Bishop\n\t+ Patriarch\n\t+ Major\n\t+ Primate\n\t+ Metropolitan\n\t+ Archbishop\n\t+ Diocesan\n\t+ Coadjutor\n\t+ Auxiliary\n\t+ Titular\n\t+ Emeritus\n* Parish\n* Priest\n* Deacon\n |\n| Consecrated life | * Religious:\n* Superior\n\t+ Abbot, Abbess\n\t+ General\n\t+ Provincial\n\t+ Prior, Prioress\n* Grand master\n* Brother\n\t+ Friar\n\t+ Monk\n* Sister\n\t+ Nun\n* Hermit\n* Novice\n\t+ Master\n\t+ Oblate\n\t+ Postulant\n |\n| Particular churchessui iuris | * Latin Church\n* Eastern Catholic Churches\n\t+ Albanian\n\t+ Armenian\n\t+ Belarusian\n\t+ Bulgarian\n\t+ Chaldean\n\t+ Coptic\n\t+ Croatian and Serbian\n\t+ Eritrean\n\t+ Ethiopian\n\t+ Georgian\n\t+ Greek\n\t+ Hungarian\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2012, the US Department of State's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy, and Russia.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Territory of Vatican City State according to the Lateran Treaty\nWhen the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.[54]\n\n\nThe territory includes St. Peter's Square, distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the Via della Conciliazione which runs from close to the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by Benito Mussolini after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs Vatican City is an enclave within Italy, its military defence is provided by the Italian Armed Forces. However, there is no formal defence treaty with Italy, as Vatican City is a neutral state. Vatican City has no armed forces of its own, although the Swiss Guard is a military corps of the Holy See responsible for the personal security of the Pope, and residents in the state. Soldiers of the Swiss Guard are entitled to hold Vatican City State passports and nationality. Swiss mercenaries were historically recruited by Popes as part of an army for the Papal States, and the Pontifical Swiss Guard was founded by Pope Julius II on 22 January 1506 as the Pope's personal bodyguard and continues to fulfill that function. It is listed in the *Annuario Pontificio* under \"Holy See\", not under \"State of Vatican City\". At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and Switzerland. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Officials | * Pope Francis\n* Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Parolin\n* Cardinals\n\t+ List\n\t+ Advisers\n |\n| Governance | * Secretariat of State\n* College of Cardinals\n\t+ Papal conclave\n |\n| Government | * Roman Curia\n\t+ Apostolic Camera\n\t+ Commissions\n\t\t- For Vatican City State\n\t+ Councils\n\t+ Congregations\n\t+ Dicasteries\n |\n| Foreign affairs(Multilateral policy) | * Section for Relations with States\n* To the Holy See\n* Of the Holy See\n\t+ Heads\n* Italy\n* United Nations\n\t+ Permanent Observer\n\t\t- in Geneva\n* European Union\n\t+ Permanent Observer to the Council of Europe\n* Apostolic nunciature\n\t+ Nuncio\n* Treaties\n\t+ Concordats\n |\n\n |\n| Dioceseof Romewith universalfull communion(Papal primacy) | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Synods | * Ordinary general assemblies\n* Extraordinary general assemblies\n* Special assemblies\n |\n| Ecclesiasticalprovince of Rome(Vicariate: Rome,Vatican City) | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the Lateran Treaty, certain properties of the Holy See that are located in Italian territory, most notably the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo and the major basilicas, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign embassies.[55][56] These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.[56]\n\n\nCastel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by police agents of Vatican City State and not by Italian police.

Persons accused of crimes recognised as such both in Italy and in Vatican City that are committed in Italian territory will be handed over to the Italian authorities if they take refuge in Vatican City or in buildings that enjoy immunity under the treaty.[90][91]\n\n\nVatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention.[92] People convicted of committing crimes in the Vatican serve terms in Italian prisons (Polizia Penitenziaria), with costs covered by the Vatican.[93]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of the Holy See and List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Vatican City has also been given a radio ITU prefix, HV, and this is sometimes used by amateur radio operators.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Lateran Palace\n\t+ Lateran University\n\t+ Scala Sancta\n\t+ Sancta Sanctorum\n\t+ Adjoining buildings\n* Palace of Saint Callixtus\n* Gianicolo Hill area\n\t+ Pontifical Urban University\n\t+ Pontifical North American College\n\t+ Bambino Gesù Hospital\n* Palazzo della Cancelleria\n* Palace of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples\n* Palace of the Holy Office\n* Palace of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches\n* Palazzo Pio\n* Palace of the Vicariate\n* Pontifical Minor Roman Seminary\n* Collegio Teutonico\n\t+ Teutonic Cemetery\n* Benedictine monastery\n* Pontifical Oratory of San Paolo\n* Beda College\n* Paul VI Audience Hall\n |\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Non-extraterritorial | * Palace of the Holy Apostles\n* Palace of San Carlo ai Catinari\n* Collegio Bellarmino\n* Archaeological Institute\n* Pontifical Oriental Institute\n* Pontifical Lombard Seminary\n* Russian College\n* Two Palaces of Sant'Apollinare\n* House of Retreat for the Clergy of Saints John and Paul\n\t+ Nympheum of Nero\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"Vatican surpasses all nations... in pickpockets?\" Archived 15 November 2012 at the Wayback Machine.

The corps has 130 personnel and is a part of the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence (which also includes the Vatican Fire Brigade), an organ of the Governorate of Vatican City.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Vatican City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nVatican City contains religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Apostolic Library, and the Vatican Museums. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by donations from the faithful, by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs, fees for admission to museums, and sales of publications. Vatican City has no taxes and items are duty-free.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Vatican City* was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state named after Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state within the city of Rome. \"Vatican\" is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, *Vatica* or *Vaticum*, located in the general area the Romans called *Ager Vaticanus*, \"Vatican territory\".[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs of 2023, Vatican City had a population of 764 residents, regardless of citizenship.[13] There were also 372 Vatican citizens residing elsewhere,[13] consisting of diplomats of the Holy See to other countries and cardinals residing in Rome.[114]\n\n\nThe population is composed of clergy, other religious members, laypeople serving the state (such as the Swiss Guard) and their family members.[115] In 2013 there were 13 families of the employees of the Holy See living in Vatican City,[116] in 2019 there were 20 children of the Swiss Guards living at the Vatican.[117] All citizens, residents and places of worship in the city are Catholic. The city also receives thousands of tourists and workers every day.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConstruction in 1995 of a new guest house, Domus Sanctae Marthae, adjacent to St Peter's Basilica was criticised by Italian environmental groups, backed by Italian politicians. They claimed the new building would block views of the Basilica from nearby Italian apartments.[51] For a short while the plans strained the relations between the Vatican and the Italian government. The head of the Vatican's Department of Technical Services robustly rejected challenges to the Vatican State's right to build within its borders.[51]\n\n\nJohn R. Morss writes in the *European Journal of International Law* that due to the terms of the Lateran Treaty, Vatican City's status as a sovereign state, and the Pope's status as a head of state, are problematic.[*clarification needed*][52]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** \"Raising Children Within the Vatican: Life of a Swiss Guard Familydate =5 August 2019\".

Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy.

A dialect of Ligurian, Monégasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Monégasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is also used.\n\n\nItalian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.[159] This was due to the annexation of the surrounding County of Nice to France following the Treaty of Turin (1860).[159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCouncil of Europe\n |\n| --- |\n| Institutions | * Secretary General\n* Committee of Ministers\n* Parliamentary Assembly\n* Congress\n* Court of Human Rights\n* Commissioner for Human Rights\n* Commission for the Efficiency of Justice\n* Commission against Racism and Intolerance\n* Venice Commission\n* Pompidou Group\n |\n| Members | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* Italy\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* San Marino\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n |\n| Observers | * Canada\n* Holy See\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Mexico\n* United States\n* EU relations\n |\n| Former members | * Czechoslovakia (1991–1992)\n* Russia (1996–2022)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** French: *Principauté de Monaco*; Monégasque: *Prinçipatu de Mùnegu*; Ligurian: *Prinçipato de Mónego*; Occitan: *Principat de Mónegue*; Italian: *Principato di Monaco*.\n2. **^** For further information, see languages of Monaco.\n3. **^** Monetary agreement with the EU to issue euros\n4. **^** Although not a contracting party to the Schengen Agreement, has an open border with France and Schengen laws are administered as if it were a part of France.[224][225]\n5. **^** Through an agreement with France[226]\n6. **^** Through an agreement with France.

Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins.[152] Three different designs were selected for the Monégasque coins.[153] The design was changed in 2006 after Prince Rainier's death to feature the effigy of Prince Albert.[153]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nPopulation of Monaco by nationality\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Satellite view of Monaco, with the France–Monaco border shown in yellow\nMonaco is a sovereign city-state, with five quarters and ten wards,[79] located on the French Riviera in Western Europe.

Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.[131]\n\n\nMonaco is not a member of the European Union, but very closely linked via a customs union with France. As such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc.

In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, or about 100–150 people a year.[216] The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 per cent were native Monegasque[217] (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMonaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency; before, it used the Monegasque franc, which was pegged, and exchangeable with, the French franc until 1 January 2002. Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004 and is a member of the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie* (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race, the Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One. The local motorsports association gives name to the Monte Carlo Rally, hosted in January in the French Alps. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, which competes in the French Ligue 1 and have become French champions on multiple occasions, and a basketball team, which plays in the EuroLeague. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters.[141] Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union.[141] Monaco shares a 6 km (3.7 mi) border with France but also has about 2 km (1.2 mi) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea.[211] Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia).

The prime minister, who is the head of government, can be either a Monégasque or a French citizen; the monarch consults with the Government of France before an appointment. Key members of the judiciary in Monaco are detached French magistrates.[17] The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297.[18] The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France, besides maintenance of two small military units.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n155. **^** \"Monaco Population 2023 (Live)\".

Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it resulted in the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.

The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.[143][144] Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions. In 2009, Monaco went a step further and secured a place on the \"white list\" after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.[88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"2fcc990b-66c3-4aad-a464-095d3138e070","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Monégasque in Monaco-Ville\nThe main and official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Monégasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Monégasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Monégasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is also used.\n\n\nItalian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.[159] This was due to the annexation of the surrounding County of Nice to France following the Treaty of Turin (1860).[159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCouncil of Europe\n |\n| --- |\n| Institutions | * Secretary General\n* Committee of Ministers\n* Parliamentary Assembly\n* Congress\n* Court of Human Rights\n* Commissioner for Human Rights\n* Commission for the Efficiency of Justice\n* Commission against Racism and Intolerance\n* Venice Commission\n* Pompidou Group\n |\n| Members | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* Italy\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* San Marino\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n |\n| Observers | * Canada\n* Holy See\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Mexico\n* United States\n* EU relations\n |\n| Former members | * Czechoslovakia (1991–1992)\n* Russia (1996–2022)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** French: *Principauté de Monaco*; Monégasque: *Prinçipatu de Mùnegu*; Ligurian: *Prinçipato de Mónego*; Occitan: *Principat de Mónegue*; Italian: *Principato di Monaco*.\n2. **^** For further information, see languages of Monaco.\n3. **^** Monetary agreement with the EU to issue euros\n4. **^** Although not a contracting party to the Schengen Agreement, has an open border with France and Schengen laws are administered as if it were a part of France.[224][225]\n5. **^** Through an agreement with France[226]\n6. **^** Through an agreement with France.

Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins.[152] Three different designs were selected for the Monégasque coins.[153] The design was changed in 2006 after Prince Rainier's death to feature the effigy of Prince Albert.[153]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nPopulation of Monaco by nationality\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Satellite view of Monaco, with the France–Monaco border shown in yellow\nMonaco is a sovereign city-state, with five quarters and ten wards,[79] located on the French Riviera in Western Europe.

Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.[131]\n\n\nMonaco is not a member of the European Union, but very closely linked via a customs union with France. As such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc.

In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, or about 100–150 people a year.[216] The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 per cent were native Monegasque[217] (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMonaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency; before, it used the Monegasque franc, which was pegged, and exchangeable with, the French franc until 1 January 2002. Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004 and is a member of the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie* (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race, the Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One. The local motorsports association gives name to the Monte Carlo Rally, hosted in January in the French Alps. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, which competes in the French Ligue 1 and have become French champions on multiple occasions, and a basketball team, which plays in the EuroLeague. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters.[141] Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union.[141] Monaco shares a 6 km (3.7 mi) border with France but also has about 2 km (1.2 mi) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea.[211] Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia).

The prime minister, who is the head of government, can be either a Monégasque or a French citizen; the monarch consults with the Government of France before an appointment. Key members of the judiciary in Monaco are detached French magistrates.[17] The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297.[18] The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France, besides maintenance of two small military units.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n155. **^** \"Monaco Population 2023 (Live)\".

The country imports about 85% of its energy. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union) since May 1995.\n\n\nThe government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008, the unemployment rate was 1.5%. Liechtenstein has only one hospital, the Liechtensteinisches Landesspital in Vaduz. As of 2014 the CIA World Factbook estimated the gross domestic product (GDP) on a purchasing power parity basis to be $4.978 billion. As of 2009 the estimate per capita was $139,100, the highest listed for the world.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiechtenstein is one of only a few countries without an airport. The nearest large airport is Zurich Airport near Zürich, Switzerland (130 km or 80 miles by road). The nearest small airport is St. Gallen Airport (50 km or 30 miles). Friedrichshafen Airport also provides access to Liechtenstein, as it is 85 km (53 miles) away.

The diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial postwar Beneš decrees resulted in Liechtenstein not having international relations with the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Diplomatic relations were established between Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic on 13 July 2009,[36][37][38] and with Slovakia on 9 December 2009.[39]\n\n\nOn 20 September 1990, Liechtenstein was admitted into the United Nations as 160th member state. As a member of the United Nations General Assembly, the microstate is one of the few not to play a prominent role in UN-specialized agencies.\n\n\n\n### Financial centre[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the country's national holiday, all subjects are invited to the castle of the head of state. A significant portion of the population attends the national celebration at the castle where speeches are made and complimentary beer is served.[108]\n\n\nMusic and theatre are important parts of the culture. There are numerous music organizations such as the Liechtenstein Musical Company, the annual Guitar Days, and the International Josef Gabriel Rheinberger Society, which play in two main theatres.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nThe primary internet service provider and mobile network operator of Liechtenstein is Telecom Liechtenstein, located in Schaan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)University of Liechtenstein\nThe literacy rate of Liechtenstein is 100%.[65] In 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment report, coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranked Liechtenstein's education as the 10th-best in the world.[90] In 2012, Liechtenstein had the highest PISA scores of any European country.[91]\n\n\nWithin Liechtenstein, there are four main centres for higher education:\n\n\n\n* University of Liechtenstein\n* Private University in the Principality of Liechtenstein\n* Liechtenstein Institute\n* International Academy of Philosophy, Liechtenstein\n\n\nThere are nine public high schools in the country. These include:\n\n\n\n* Liechtensteinisches Gymnasium in Vaduz.\n* Realschule Vaduz and Oberschule Vaduz, in the Schulzentrum Mühleholz II in Vaduz[92]\n* Realschule Schaan and Sportschule Liechtenstein in Schaan[92]\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Rhine: border between Liechtenstein and Switzerland (view towards the Swiss Alps)\nLiechtenstein is situated in the Upper Rhine valley of the European Alps and is bordered to the east by the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, to the south by the canton of Grisons (Switzerland) and to the west by the canton of St. Gallen (Switzerland). The Rhine forms the entire western border of Liechtenstein. Measured south to north the country is about 24 km (15 mi) long. Its highest point, Grauspitz, is 2,599 m (8,527 ft). Despite its Alpine location, prevailing southerly winds make the climate comparatively mild. In winter, the mountain slopes are well suited to winter sports.\n\n\nNew surveys using more accurate measurements of the country's borders in 2006 have set its area at 160 km2 (62 sq mi), with borders of 77.9 km (48.4 mi).[63] Liechtenstein's borders are 1.9 km (1.2 mi) longer than previously thought.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are two conventional television channels in the country. The private channel 1FLTV was created in 2008 with a goal of joining the European Broadcasting Union, which it has not accomplished yet. The *Landeskanal* (de) is operated by the government's Unit for Information and Communication and carries government proceedings, public affairs programming, and cultural events. Both are seen on local cable providers, along with channels from the other German-speaking countries. The only free television is ORF from Austria, available via terrestrial overspill of its signal from Vorarlberg.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"Navázání diplomatických styků České republiky s Knížectvím Lichtenštejnsko\" [Establishment of diplomatic relations with the Czech Republic and the Principality of Liechtenstein] (in Czech).

From an economic and integration policy perspective, relations within the framework of the EEA and the EU occupy a special position in Liechtenstein's foreign policy. The Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein also participates in the annual meetings of the heads of state of the German-speaking countries (consisting of EU and non-EU members).[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRadio Liechtenstein (de), which was established in 2004 along with the public-service broadcaster *Liechtensteinischer Rundfunk* (LRF) that operates it, is the country's only domestic radio station based in Triesen.

Liechtenstein also has two major newspapers: *Liechtensteiner Volksblatt* and *Liechtensteiner Vaterland*.\n\n\nAmateur radio is a hobby of some nationals and visitors. However, unlike virtually every other sovereign nation, Liechtenstein does not have its own ITU prefix.

It is strongly influenced by the action of foehn (warm and dry autumn wind), so the vegetation period is prolonged in spring and autumn and temperatures around 15 °C (59 °F) due to the strong foehn are not uncommon even in winter. The mountain ranges of Switzerland and the Vorarlberg upstream protect from the cold polar and Atlantic air, creating a typical alpine inland protective layer. The principality has orchards with leafy meadows and a long tradition of viticulture. Liechtenstein's small land area hardly plays a role in climatic differences, but the vertical division into different altitudes is of great importance, so that significant climatic differences arise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn addition to the peaks of the Alpine chain,[69] which belong to the Limestone Alps, two inselbergs, Fläscherberg (1,135 m or 3,724 ft above sea level) in the south and Eschnerberg (698 m or 2,290 ft) in the north, rise from the Rhine Valley and belong to the Helvetic cover or flysch zone of the Alps.[70] Eschnerberg represents an important settlement area in the Liechtenstein Unterland.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Liechtenstein\n\n![](image)Looking southward at Vaduz city centre\n![](image)Silver coin: 5 kronen of Liechtenstein, 1904, the front of the coin is a portrait of Johann II\nDespite its limited natural resources, Liechtenstein is one of the few countries in the world with more registered companies than citizens; it has developed a prosperous, highly industrialized free-enterprise economy and boasts a financial service sector as well as a living standard that compares favourably with those of the urban areas of Liechtenstein's much larger European neighbours.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Balzers Heliport\nThere are about 250 kilometres (155 mi) of paved roadway within Liechtenstein, with 90 km (56 mi) of marked bicycle paths.\n\n\nA 9.5 km (6 mi) railway connects Austria and Switzerland through Liechtenstein. The country's railways are administered by the Austrian Federal Railways as part of the route between Feldkirch, Austria, and Buchs, Switzerland. Liechtenstein is nominally within the Austrian Verkehrsverbund Vorarlberg tariff region.[93]\n\n\nThere are four railway stations in Liechtenstein, namely Schaan-Vaduz, Forst Hilti, Nendeln and Schaanwald, served by an irregularly stopping train service between Feldkirch and Buchs provided by Austrian Federal Railways.[94][95]\n\n\n\nSee also: Rail transport in Liechtenstein\n\nLiechtenstein Bus is a subsidiary of the Swiss Postbus system, but separately run, and connects to the Swiss bus network at Buchs and at Sargans.[96] Holders of a *Swiss Travel Pass* can travel for free on Liechtenstein’s buses.[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJudicial authority is vested in the Regional Court at Vaduz, the Princely High Court of Appeal at Vaduz, the Princely Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the State Court. The State Court rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and has five members elected by parliament[*citation needed*].\n\n\nOn 1 July 1984, Liechtenstein became the last country in Europe to grant women the right to vote. The referendum on women's suffrage, in which only men were allowed to participate, passed with 51.3% in favour.[51]\n\n\n\n### International awards[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Rhine is the longest and largest body of water in Liechtenstein. With a length of approximately 27 kilometres (17 mi), it represents the natural border with Switzerland and is of great importance for Liechtenstein's water supply. Furthermore, the Rhine is an important recreational area for the population. At 10 kilometres (6 mi), the Samina is the second longest river in the Principality. The troubled river begins at Triesenberg and flows into the Ill in Austria (near Feldkirch).\n\n\nThe only naturally formed lake in Liechtenstein is the Gampriner Seelein, which was not formed until 1927 by a flooding of the Rhine with enormous erosion. In addition, there are other artificially created lakes, which are mainly used to generate electricity. One of them is the Steg Reservoir, the largest lake in Liechtenstein.\n\n\n\n### Mountains[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Politics of Liechtenstein\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of Liechtenstein, showing numerous exclaves\n![](image)The centre of government in Vaduz\n![](image)Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein, as pictured by Erling Mandelmann in 1974\nLiechtenstein has a somewhat enigmatic political system, which combines elements of absolute monarchy, representative democracy, and direct democracy. The monarch retains extensive executive and legislative powers, and plays a strong active role in the day to day politics of the country, and over all three branches of government. Representative democracy and direct democracy coexist in that elected parliament enacts legislation, and also voters can propose and enact laws and constitutional amendments independently of the legislature.[45] However, as with laws passed by the legislature, these can be vetoed by the monarch. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Saxon duchies | * Coburg-Saalfeld\n* Gotha-Altenburg\n* Hildburghausen\n* Meiningen\n* Weimar3\n* Eisenach3\n* Weimar-Eisenach4\n |\n| Other duchies | * Anhalt (Bernburg\n* Dessau\n* Köthen)\n* Arenberg\n* Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n* Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n* Oldenburg\n |\n| Principalities | * Hohenzollern\n\t+ Hechingen\n\t+ Sigmaringen\n* Isenburg\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lippe-Detmold\n* Reuss\n\t+ Ebersdorf\n\t+ Greiz\n\t+ Lobenstein\n\t+ Schleiz\n* Salm5\n* Schaumburg-Lippe\n* Schwarzburg\n\t+ Rudolstadt\n\t+ Sondershausen\n* Waldeck\n |\n\n |\n| * 1 from 1810\n* 2 until 1810\n* 3 until 1809\n* 4 from 1809\n* 5 until 1811\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nStates of the German Confederation (1815–66)\n |\n| --- |\n| Empires | * Austria1\n | ![Map of the German Confederation](image)\n |\n| Kingdoms | * Prussia1\n* Bavaria\n* Saxony\n* Hanover\n* Württemberg\n |\n| Electorates | * Hesse-Kassel\n |\n| Grand duchies | * Baden\n* Hesse-Darmstadt\n* Luxembourg\n* Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n* Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n* Oldenburg\n* Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\n |\n| Duchies | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConflicts over the handling of banking and tax data have repeatedly strained relations with Germany. On 2 September 2009, Liechtenstein and Germany signed an agreement on cooperation and the exchange of information in tax matters. The text of the agreement followed the OECD model agreement and provides for an exchange of information on tax matters upon request as of the 2010 tax year. In addition, Liechtenstein regards Germany as an important partner in safeguarding its interests in European integration. At the cultural level, project sponsorship plays a particularly important role. For example, the Hilti Foundation financed the exhibition \"Egypt's Sunken Treasures\" in Berlin, and the state donated 20,000 euros following the fire at the Duchess Anna Amalia Library in Weimar.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Liechtenstein\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs an alpine country, the main sporting opportunity for Liechtensteiners to excel is in winter sports such as downhill skiing: the country's single ski area is Malbun. Hanni Wenzel won two gold medals and one silver medal in the 1980 Winter Olympics (she won bronze in 1976), her brother Andreas won one silver medal in 1980 and one bronze medal in 1984 in the giant slalom event, and her daughter Tina Weirather won a bronze medal in 2018 in the Super-G. With ten medals overall (all in alpine skiing), Liechtenstein has won more Olympic medals per capita than any other nation.[109] It is the smallest nation to win a medal in any Olympics, Winter or Summer, and currently the only nation to win a medal in the Winter Games but not in the Summer Games. Other notable skiers from Liechtenstein are Marco Büchel, Willi Frommelt, Paul Frommelt and Ursula Konzett.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2013, Liechtenstein won for the first time a SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category recognizing the achieved level of the usage of photovoltaics per population within the state territory.[52] The SolarSuperState Association justified this prize with the cumulative installed photovoltaic power of some 290 watts per capita at the end of 2012. This placed Liechtenstein second in the world after Germany. Also in 2014, the SolarSuperState Association awarded the second place SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category to Liechtenstein.[53] In the years 2015 and 2016, Liechtenstein was honoured with the first place SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category because it had the world's biggest cumulative installed photovoltaic power output per capita.[54][55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maltese consulate in Schaan\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Liechtenstein\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website (in German and English)\n* Princely House of Liechtenstein\n* Parliament of Liechtenstein\n* Government of Liechtenstein\n* Official tourism of Liechtenstein\n* Statistics Office of Liechtenstein (in German)\n* Liechtenstein. *The World Factbook*.

It would later be reunified with Middle Francia under the Holy Roman Empire, around 1000.[18] Until about 1100, the predominant language of the area was Romansch, but thereafter German began to gain ground in the territory. In 1300 another Alemannic population—the Walsers, who originated in Valais—entered the region and settled; the mountain village of Triesenberg today preserves features of the Walser dialect.[22]\n\n\n\n### Foundation of a dynasty[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Bevölkerungsstatistik 2017 Llv.li, p. 7\n2. **^** \"Central Intelligence Agency\". *The World Factbook*.

International cooperation and European integration are therefore constants of Liechtenstein's foreign policy, aimed at continuing to safeguard the country's sovereignty as recognized under international law. Decisive for the domestic legitimacy and sustainability of this foreign policy were and are strong direct-democratic and citizen-oriented decision-making mechanisms, which are anchored in Liechtenstein in the Constitution of 1921.\n\n\nImportant historical stages in Liechtenstein's integration and cooperation policy were its accession to the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806,[56] to the German Confederation in 1815,[57] the conclusion of bilateral customs and currency agreements with the Habsburg monarchy in 1852, and finally the Customs Treaty with Switzerland in 1923, which was followed by a range of other important bilateral treaties.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Kunstmuseum (Liechtenstein Art Museum)\n![](image)Liechtenstein National Museum\nAs a result of its small size, Liechtenstein has been strongly affected by external cultural influences, most notably those originating in the southern regions of German-speaking Europe, including Austria, Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Switzerland, and specifically Tirol and Vorarlberg. \n\n\nThe largest museum is the Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, an international museum of modern and contemporary art with an important international art collection. The building by the Swiss architects Morger, Degelo, and Kerez is a landmark in Vaduz. It was completed in November 2000 and forms a \"black box\" of tinted concrete and black basalt stone. The museum collection is also the national art collection of Liechtenstein.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In 1985 the Swiss Army fired off shells during an exercise and mistakenly burned a patch of forest inside Liechtenstein. The incident was said to have been resolved \"over a case of white wine\".[108]\n* In March 2007, a 170-man Swiss infantry unit got lost during a training exercise and inadvertently crossed 1.5 km (0.9 miles) into Liechtenstein. The accidental invasion ended when the unit realized their mistake and turned back.[124] The Swiss Army later informed Liechtenstein of the incursion and offered official apologies,[125] to which an internal ministry spokesperson responded, \"No problem, these things happen.\"[126]\n* On 20 September 2017, Liechtenstein signed the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[127]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Liechtenstein\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAbout half of Liechtenstein's territory is mountainous.[68] Liechtenstein lies entirely in the Rhaetikon and is thus – depending on the classification of the Alps – assigned either to the Eastern Alps (two-part division of the Alps) or to the Central Alps (three-part division of the Alps).\n\n\nThe highest point of Liechtenstein is the Vordere Grauspitz (Vordergrauspitz) with an altitude of 2,599 m (8,527 ft) above sea level, while the lowest point is the Ruggeller Riet with an altitude of 430 metres (1,410 ft) above sea level.\n\n\nIn total, there are 32 mountains in Liechtenstein with an altitude of at least 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). The Falknishorn, at 2,452 metres (8,045 ft) above sea level, is the fifth highest mountain in Liechtenstein and represents the southernmost point of the country. The Liechtenstein-Graubünden-Vorarlberg border triangle is the Naafkopf (2,570 m (8,430 ft) above sea level).[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiechtenstein follows a policy of neutrality and is one of the few countries in the world that maintain no military although its police force maintains a paramilitary force, the Princely Liechtenstein Security Corps, within the organisation that might act as its *de facto* army if an invasion of Liechtenstein ever occurred. The corps provides heavy backup for the National Police as well as Honor Guards at the Royal Palace and official functions. However, Liechtenstein can reinstate its military if deemed necessary, although this is very unlikely.[121]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Liechtenstein\". *The World Factbook*.

Since 2000, Switzerland has appointed an ambassador to Liechtenstein, but he resides in Bern. Liechtenstein's consular representation has been mostly handled by Switzerland since the Customs Treaty with Switzerland of 1923.\n\n\nLiechtenstein maintains direct diplomatic missions in Vienna, Bern, Berlin, Brussels, Strasbourg, and Washington, D.C., as well as Permanent Missions in New York and Geneva to the United Nations.[62] Currently, diplomatic missions from 78 countries are accredited to Liechtenstein, but mostly reside in Bern.

At the close of the conflict, Czechoslovakia and Poland, acting to seize what they considered German possessions, expropriated all of the Liechtenstein dynasty's properties in those three regions.[33] The expropriations (subject to modern legal dispute at the International Court of Justice) included over 1,600 km2 (618 sq mi) of agricultural and forest land (most notably the UNESCO listed Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape), and several family castles and palaces.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe government comprises the head of government (prime minister) and four government councillors (ministers), who are appointed by the Prince upon the proposal of parliament and with its concurrence, and reflect the balance of parties in parliament. The constitution stipulates that at least two government members be chosen from each of the two regions.[49] The members of the government are collectively and individually responsible to parliament; parliament may ask the Prince to remove an individual minister or the entire government, or the Prince may do so unilaterally.\n\n\nParliament elects from among its members a \"Landesausschuss\" (National Committee) made up of the president of the parliament and four additional members. The National Committee is charged with performing functions of parliamentary supervision. Parliament shares the authority to propose new legislation with the Prince, and with the citizenry, as both parliament and the citizenry may initiate referendums.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Historical Society of the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Liechtenstein National Museum (*Liechtensteinisches Landesmuseum*) also play a role in preserving the culture and history of the country.[101][102] The National Museum shows permanent exhibitions on the cultural and natural history of Liechtenstein as well as special exhibitions. There is also a stamp museum, ski museum, and a 500-year-old Rural Lifestyle Museum.[103]\n\n\nThe Liechtenstein State Library is the library that has legal deposit for all books published in the country.[104] Poet Ida Ospelt-Amann published her works exclusively in the Alemannic dialect of Vaduz.[105][106]\n\n\nThe famous historical sites include Vaduz Castle, Gutenberg Castle, and Vaduz Cathedral.[103]\n\n\nThe Private Art Collection of the Prince of Liechtenstein, one of the world's leading private art collections, is shown at the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"Principality of Liechtenstein website – Parliamentary elections\".

The Liechtenstein dynasty often resorted to selling family artistic treasures, [*citation needed*] including the portrait *Ginevra de' Benci* by Leonardo da Vinci, which was purchased by the National Gallery of Art of the United States in 1967 for US$5 million ($46 million in 2023 dollars),[40] then a record price for a painting.[41]\n\n\nBy the late 1970s, Liechtenstein used its low corporate tax rates to draw many companies and became one of the wealthiest countries in the world.\n\n\nLiechtenstein is one of the few countries in Europe (along with Monaco and San Marino) not to have a tax treaty with the United States, and efforts towards one seem to have stalled.[42][43]\n\n\nAs of September 2019[update] the Prince of Liechtenstein is the world's sixth wealthiest monarch, with an estimated wealth of US$3.5 billion.[44] The country's population enjoys one of the world's highest standards of living.\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother discipline unusually popular with Liechtensteiners is motorsport; American-born German-Colombian Rikky von Opel raced under the flag of Liechtenstein in Formula One in 1973 and 1974, and Manfred Schurti competed in 9 editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans as a Porsche factory driver with a best finish of 4th overall in 1976.[110][111] The nation is currently represented internationally by Fabienne Wohlwend and Matthias Kaiser in endurance racing.[112][113]\n\n\nOther sports Liechtenstein athletes have had success in include tennis, with Stephanie Vogt and Kathinka von Deichmann both having varying degrees of success on the women's tour, as well as swimming; both Julia Hassler and Christoph Meier represented the country at the 2016 Summer Olympics with the former the nations' flag bearer.[114][115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Panorama of Vaduz, capital of Liechtenstein\n| Climate data for Vaduz (1991–2020)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 23.2(73.8)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 9.5(49.1)\n | 5.5(41.9)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 1.4(34.5)\n | 2.7(36.9)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 14.7(58.5)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 19.1(66.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −2.0(28.4)\n | −1.1(30.0)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 9.7(49.5)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | −1.1(30.0)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 41(1.6)\n | 34(1.3)\n | 54(2.1)\n | 57(2.2)\n | 90(3.5)\n | 116(4.6)\n | 130(5.1)\n | 144(5.7)\n | 96(3.8)\n | 68(2.7)\n | 56(2.2)\n | 54(2.1)\n | 940(37.0)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor this reason, the family sought to acquire lands that would be classed as *unmittelbar*, or held without any intermediate feudal tenure, directly from the Holy Roman Emperor. During the early 17th century Karl I of Liechtenstein was made a *Fürst* (prince) by the Holy Roman Emperor Matthias after siding with him in a political battle. Hans-Adam I was allowed to purchase the minuscule *Herrschaft* ('Lordship') of Schellenberg and the county of Vaduz (in 1699 and 1712 respectively) from the Hohenems. Tiny Schellenberg and Vaduz had exactly the political status required: no feudal lord other than their comital sovereign and the suzerain Emperor.\n\n\n\n### Principality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Marxer, Roland (31 December 2011). \"Zollanschlussvertrag\". *Historisches Lexikon* (in German).

In 1806 Emperor Francis II abdicated and dissolved the Holy Roman Empire, ending more than 960 years of feudal government. Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the Confederation of the Rhine. This political restructuring had broad consequences for Liechtenstein: the historical imperial, legal, and political institutions had been dissolved. The state ceased to owe an obligation to any feudal lord beyond its borders.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"Prince Franz to Return to Estate\". *Daily News*. 1 April 1938. p. 216.

Since 2002, however, Liechtenstein has had a permanent ambassador in Berlin, while the German embassy in Switzerland is also responsible for the Principality. Liechtenstein's Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers the contacts to be extremely fruitful and important for the country's development, especially on the economic level.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nModern publications generally attribute Liechtenstein's sovereignty to these events. Its prince ceased to owe an obligation to any suzerain. From 25 July 1806, when the Confederation of the Rhine was founded, the Prince of Liechtenstein was a member, in fact, a vassal, of its hegemon, styled *protector*, the French Emperor Napoleon I, until the dissolution of the confederation on 19 October 1813.\n\n\nSoon afterward, Liechtenstein joined the German Confederation (20 June 1815 – 23 August 1866), which was presided over by the Emperor of Austria.\n\n\nIn 1818, Prince Johann I granted the territory a limited constitution. In that same year Prince Aloys became the first member of the House of Liechtenstein to set foot in the principality that bore their name. The next visit would not occur until 1842.\n\n\nDevelopments during the 19th century included:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Hallstatt and La Tène cultures flourished during the late Iron Age, from around 450 BCE—possibly under some influence of both the Greek and Etruscan civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Alpine region were the Helvetii. In 58 BCE, at the Battle of Bibracte, Julius Caesar defeated the Alpine tribes, thereby bringing the region under Roman subjugation. By 15 BCE, Tiberius—later the second Roman emperor—with his brother, Drusus, conquered the entire Alpine area. Liechtenstein then became integrated into the Roman province of Raetia. The area was garrisoned by the Roman army, which maintained large legionary camps at Brigantium (Austria), near Lake Constance, and at Magia (Switzerland). The Romans built and maintained a road which ran through the territory. Around 260 CE Brigantium was destroyed by the Alemanni, a Germanic people who later settled in the area around 450.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe reigning Prince is the Head of State and represents Liechtenstein in its international relations (although Switzerland has taken responsibility for much of Liechtenstein's diplomatic relations).[46]\n\n\nThe current Constitution of Liechtenstein was adopted in March 2003, amending the 1921 constitution, giving the prince extensive veto powers, and the ability to dismiss the government and rule by emergency decree, and maintaining the prince's active role in the legislative process. The BBC characterizes Liechtenstein post-2003 as \"in effect\" an \"absolute monarchy\".[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. **^** Vaduz-Vienna, LIECHTENSTEIN The Princely Collections. \"Garden Palace | permanent presentation |\". *LIECHTENSTEIN.

The country imports about 85% of its energy. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union) since May 1995.\n\n\nThe government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008, the unemployment rate was 1.5%. Liechtenstein has only one hospital, the Liechtensteinisches Landesspital in Vaduz. As of 2014 the CIA World Factbook estimated the gross domestic product (GDP) on a purchasing power parity basis to be $4.978 billion. As of 2009 the estimate per capita was $139,100, the highest listed for the world.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiechtenstein is one of only a few countries without an airport. The nearest large airport is Zurich Airport near Zürich, Switzerland (130 km or 80 miles by road). The nearest small airport is St. Gallen Airport (50 km or 30 miles). Friedrichshafen Airport also provides access to Liechtenstein, as it is 85 km (53 miles) away.

The diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial postwar Beneš decrees resulted in Liechtenstein not having international relations with the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Diplomatic relations were established between Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic on 13 July 2009,[36][37][38] and with Slovakia on 9 December 2009.[39]\n\n\nOn 20 September 1990, Liechtenstein was admitted into the United Nations as 160th member state. As a member of the United Nations General Assembly, the microstate is one of the few not to play a prominent role in UN-specialized agencies.\n\n\n\n### Financial centre[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the country's national holiday, all subjects are invited to the castle of the head of state. A significant portion of the population attends the national celebration at the castle where speeches are made and complimentary beer is served.[108]\n\n\nMusic and theatre are important parts of the culture. There are numerous music organizations such as the Liechtenstein Musical Company, the annual Guitar Days, and the International Josef Gabriel Rheinberger Society, which play in two main theatres.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nThe primary internet service provider and mobile network operator of Liechtenstein is Telecom Liechtenstein, located in Schaan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)University of Liechtenstein\nThe literacy rate of Liechtenstein is 100%.[65] In 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment report, coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranked Liechtenstein's education as the 10th-best in the world.[90] In 2012, Liechtenstein had the highest PISA scores of any European country.[91]\n\n\nWithin Liechtenstein, there are four main centres for higher education:\n\n\n\n* University of Liechtenstein\n* Private University in the Principality of Liechtenstein\n* Liechtenstein Institute\n* International Academy of Philosophy, Liechtenstein\n\n\nThere are nine public high schools in the country. These include:\n\n\n\n* Liechtensteinisches Gymnasium in Vaduz.\n* Realschule Vaduz and Oberschule Vaduz, in the Schulzentrum Mühleholz II in Vaduz[92]\n* Realschule Schaan and Sportschule Liechtenstein in Schaan[92]\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Rhine: border between Liechtenstein and Switzerland (view towards the Swiss Alps)\nLiechtenstein is situated in the Upper Rhine valley of the European Alps and is bordered to the east by the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, to the south by the canton of Grisons (Switzerland) and to the west by the canton of St. Gallen (Switzerland). The Rhine forms the entire western border of Liechtenstein. Measured south to north the country is about 24 km (15 mi) long. Its highest point, Grauspitz, is 2,599 m (8,527 ft). Despite its Alpine location, prevailing southerly winds make the climate comparatively mild. In winter, the mountain slopes are well suited to winter sports.\n\n\nNew surveys using more accurate measurements of the country's borders in 2006 have set its area at 160 km2 (62 sq mi), with borders of 77.9 km (48.4 mi).[63] Liechtenstein's borders are 1.9 km (1.2 mi) longer than previously thought.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are two conventional television channels in the country. The private channel 1FLTV was created in 2008 with a goal of joining the European Broadcasting Union, which it has not accomplished yet. The *Landeskanal* (de) is operated by the government's Unit for Information and Communication and carries government proceedings, public affairs programming, and cultural events. Both are seen on local cable providers, along with channels from the other German-speaking countries. The only free television is ORF from Austria, available via terrestrial overspill of its signal from Vorarlberg.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"Navázání diplomatických styků České republiky s Knížectvím Lichtenštejnsko\" [Establishment of diplomatic relations with the Czech Republic and the Principality of Liechtenstein] (in Czech).

From an economic and integration policy perspective, relations within the framework of the EEA and the EU occupy a special position in Liechtenstein's foreign policy. The Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein also participates in the annual meetings of the heads of state of the German-speaking countries (consisting of EU and non-EU members).[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRadio Liechtenstein (de), which was established in 2004 along with the public-service broadcaster *Liechtensteinischer Rundfunk* (LRF) that operates it, is the country's only domestic radio station based in Triesen. Radio Liechtenstein and several programs of the Swiss SRF are broadcast from the Sender Erbi (de) overlooking Vaduz. Liechtenstein also has two major newspapers: *Liechtensteiner Volksblatt* and *Liechtensteiner Vaterland*.\n\n\nAmateur radio is a hobby of some nationals and visitors. However, unlike virtually every other sovereign nation, Liechtenstein does not have its own ITU prefix. Conventionally, amateurs are issued call signs with the Swiss prefix \"HB\", followed by \"0\" or \"L\".\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe country's climate is relatively mild despite its mountainous location. It is strongly influenced by the action of foehn (warm and dry autumn wind), so the vegetation period is prolonged in spring and autumn and temperatures around 15 °C (59 °F) due to the strong foehn are not uncommon even in winter. The mountain ranges of Switzerland and the Vorarlberg upstream protect from the cold polar and Atlantic air, creating a typical alpine inland protective layer. The principality has orchards with leafy meadows and a long tradition of viticulture. Liechtenstein's small land area hardly plays a role in climatic differences, but the vertical division into different altitudes is of great importance, so that significant climatic differences arise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn addition to the peaks of the Alpine chain,[69] which belong to the Limestone Alps, two inselbergs, Fläscherberg (1,135 m or 3,724 ft above sea level) in the south and Eschnerberg (698 m or 2,290 ft) in the north, rise from the Rhine Valley and belong to the Helvetic cover or flysch zone of the Alps.[70] Eschnerberg represents an important settlement area in the Liechtenstein Unterland.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Liechtenstein\n\n![](image)Looking southward at Vaduz city centre\n![](image)Silver coin: 5 kronen of Liechtenstein, 1904, the front of the coin is a portrait of Johann II\nDespite its limited natural resources, Liechtenstein is one of the few countries in the world with more registered companies than citizens; it has developed a prosperous, highly industrialized free-enterprise economy and boasts a financial service sector as well as a living standard that compares favourably with those of the urban areas of Liechtenstein's much larger European neighbours.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Balzers Heliport\nThere are about 250 kilometres (155 mi) of paved roadway within Liechtenstein, with 90 km (56 mi) of marked bicycle paths.\n\n\nA 9.5 km (6 mi) railway connects Austria and Switzerland through Liechtenstein. The country's railways are administered by the Austrian Federal Railways as part of the route between Feldkirch, Austria, and Buchs, Switzerland. Liechtenstein is nominally within the Austrian Verkehrsverbund Vorarlberg tariff region.[93]\n\n\nThere are four railway stations in Liechtenstein, namely Schaan-Vaduz, Forst Hilti, Nendeln and Schaanwald, served by an irregularly stopping train service between Feldkirch and Buchs provided by Austrian Federal Railways.[94][95]\n\n\n\nSee also: Rail transport in Liechtenstein\n\nLiechtenstein Bus is a subsidiary of the Swiss Postbus system, but separately run, and connects to the Swiss bus network at Buchs and at Sargans.[96] Holders of a *Swiss Travel Pass* can travel for free on Liechtenstein’s buses.[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJudicial authority is vested in the Regional Court at Vaduz, the Princely High Court of Appeal at Vaduz, the Princely Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the State Court. The State Court rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and has five members elected by parliament[*citation needed*].\n\n\nOn 1 July 1984, Liechtenstein became the last country in Europe to grant women the right to vote. The referendum on women's suffrage, in which only men were allowed to participate, passed with 51.3% in favour.[51]\n\n\n\n### International awards[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Rhine is the longest and largest body of water in Liechtenstein. With a length of approximately 27 kilometres (17 mi), it represents the natural border with Switzerland and is of great importance for Liechtenstein's water supply. Furthermore, the Rhine is an important recreational area for the population. At 10 kilometres (6 mi), the Samina is the second longest river in the Principality. The troubled river begins at Triesenberg and flows into the Ill in Austria (near Feldkirch).\n\n\nThe only naturally formed lake in Liechtenstein is the Gampriner Seelein, which was not formed until 1927 by a flooding of the Rhine with enormous erosion. In addition, there are other artificially created lakes, which are mainly used to generate electricity. One of them is the Steg Reservoir, the largest lake in Liechtenstein.\n\n\n\n### Mountains[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Politics of Liechtenstein\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of Liechtenstein, showing numerous exclaves\n![](image)The centre of government in Vaduz\n![](image)Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein, as pictured by Erling Mandelmann in 1974\nLiechtenstein has a somewhat enigmatic political system, which combines elements of absolute monarchy, representative democracy, and direct democracy. The monarch retains extensive executive and legislative powers, and plays a strong active role in the day to day politics of the country, and over all three branches of government. Representative democracy and direct democracy coexist in that elected parliament enacts legislation, and also voters can propose and enact laws and constitutional amendments independently of the legislature.[45] However, as with laws passed by the legislature, these can be vetoed by the monarch. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Saxon duchies | * Coburg-Saalfeld\n* Gotha-Altenburg\n* Hildburghausen\n* Meiningen\n* Weimar3\n* Eisenach3\n* Weimar-Eisenach4\n |\n| Other duchies | * Anhalt (Bernburg\n* Dessau\n* Köthen)\n* Arenberg\n* Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n* Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n* Oldenburg\n |\n| Principalities | * Hohenzollern\n\t+ Hechingen\n\t+ Sigmaringen\n* Isenburg\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lippe-Detmold\n* Reuss\n\t+ Ebersdorf\n\t+ Greiz\n\t+ Lobenstein\n\t+ Schleiz\n* Salm5\n* Schaumburg-Lippe\n* Schwarzburg\n\t+ Rudolstadt\n\t+ Sondershausen\n* Waldeck\n |\n\n |\n| * 1 from 1810\n* 2 until 1810\n* 3 until 1809\n* 4 from 1809\n* 5 until 1811\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nStates of the German Confederation (1815–66)\n |\n| --- |\n| Empires | * Austria1\n | ![Map of the German Confederation](image)\n |\n| Kingdoms | * Prussia1\n* Bavaria\n* Saxony\n* Hanover\n* Württemberg\n |\n| Electorates | * Hesse-Kassel\n |\n| Grand duchies | * Baden\n* Hesse-Darmstadt\n* Luxembourg\n* Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n* Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n* Oldenburg\n* Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\n |\n| Duchies | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConflicts over the handling of banking and tax data have repeatedly strained relations with Germany. On 2 September 2009, Liechtenstein and Germany signed an agreement on cooperation and the exchange of information in tax matters. The text of the agreement followed the OECD model agreement and provides for an exchange of information on tax matters upon request as of the 2010 tax year. In addition, Liechtenstein regards Germany as an important partner in safeguarding its interests in European integration. At the cultural level, project sponsorship plays a particularly important role. For example, the Hilti Foundation financed the exhibition \"Egypt's Sunken Treasures\" in Berlin, and the state donated 20,000 euros following the fire at the Duchess Anna Amalia Library in Weimar.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Liechtenstein\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs an alpine country, the main sporting opportunity for Liechtensteiners to excel is in winter sports such as downhill skiing: the country's single ski area is Malbun. Hanni Wenzel won two gold medals and one silver medal in the 1980 Winter Olympics (she won bronze in 1976), her brother Andreas won one silver medal in 1980 and one bronze medal in 1984 in the giant slalom event, and her daughter Tina Weirather won a bronze medal in 2018 in the Super-G. With ten medals overall (all in alpine skiing), Liechtenstein has won more Olympic medals per capita than any other nation.[109] It is the smallest nation to win a medal in any Olympics, Winter or Summer, and currently the only nation to win a medal in the Winter Games but not in the Summer Games. Other notable skiers from Liechtenstein are Marco Büchel, Willi Frommelt, Paul Frommelt and Ursula Konzett.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2013, Liechtenstein won for the first time a SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category recognizing the achieved level of the usage of photovoltaics per population within the state territory.[52] The SolarSuperState Association justified this prize with the cumulative installed photovoltaic power of some 290 watts per capita at the end of 2012. This placed Liechtenstein second in the world after Germany. Also in 2014, the SolarSuperState Association awarded the second place SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category to Liechtenstein.[53] In the years 2015 and 2016, Liechtenstein was honoured with the first place SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category because it had the world's biggest cumulative installed photovoltaic power output per capita.[54][55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maltese consulate in Schaan\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Liechtenstein\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website (in German and English)\n* Princely House of Liechtenstein\n* Parliament of Liechtenstein\n* Government of Liechtenstein\n* Official tourism of Liechtenstein\n* Statistics Office of Liechtenstein (in German)\n* Liechtenstein. *The World Factbook*.

It would later be reunified with Middle Francia under the Holy Roman Empire, around 1000.[18] Until about 1100, the predominant language of the area was Romansch, but thereafter German began to gain ground in the territory. In 1300 another Alemannic population—the Walsers, who originated in Valais—entered the region and settled; the mountain village of Triesenberg today preserves features of the Walser dialect.[22]\n\n\n\n### Foundation of a dynasty[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Bevölkerungsstatistik 2017 Llv.li, p. 7\n2. **^** \"Central Intelligence Agency\". *The World Factbook*.

International cooperation and European integration are therefore constants of Liechtenstein's foreign policy, aimed at continuing to safeguard the country's sovereignty as recognized under international law. Decisive for the domestic legitimacy and sustainability of this foreign policy were and are strong direct-democratic and citizen-oriented decision-making mechanisms, which are anchored in Liechtenstein in the Constitution of 1921.\n\n\nImportant historical stages in Liechtenstein's integration and cooperation policy were its accession to the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806,[56] to the German Confederation in 1815,[57] the conclusion of bilateral customs and currency agreements with the Habsburg monarchy in 1852, and finally the Customs Treaty with Switzerland in 1923, which was followed by a range of other important bilateral treaties.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Kunstmuseum (Liechtenstein Art Museum)\n![](image)Liechtenstein National Museum\nAs a result of its small size, Liechtenstein has been strongly affected by external cultural influences, most notably those originating in the southern regions of German-speaking Europe, including Austria, Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Switzerland, and specifically Tirol and Vorarlberg. \n\n\nThe largest museum is the Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, an international museum of modern and contemporary art with an important international art collection. The building by the Swiss architects Morger, Degelo, and Kerez is a landmark in Vaduz. It was completed in November 2000 and forms a \"black box\" of tinted concrete and black basalt stone. The museum collection is also the national art collection of Liechtenstein.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In 1985 the Swiss Army fired off shells during an exercise and mistakenly burned a patch of forest inside Liechtenstein. The incident was said to have been resolved \"over a case of white wine\".[108]\n* In March 2007, a 170-man Swiss infantry unit got lost during a training exercise and inadvertently crossed 1.5 km (0.9 miles) into Liechtenstein. The accidental invasion ended when the unit realized their mistake and turned back.[124] The Swiss Army later informed Liechtenstein of the incursion and offered official apologies,[125] to which an internal ministry spokesperson responded, \"No problem, these things happen.\"[126]\n* On 20 September 2017, Liechtenstein signed the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[127]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Liechtenstein\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAbout half of Liechtenstein's territory is mountainous.[68] Liechtenstein lies entirely in the Rhaetikon and is thus – depending on the classification of the Alps – assigned either to the Eastern Alps (two-part division of the Alps) or to the Central Alps (three-part division of the Alps).\n\n\nThe highest point of Liechtenstein is the Vordere Grauspitz (Vordergrauspitz) with an altitude of 2,599 m (8,527 ft) above sea level, while the lowest point is the Ruggeller Riet with an altitude of 430 metres (1,410 ft) above sea level.\n\n\nIn total, there are 32 mountains in Liechtenstein with an altitude of at least 2,000 metres (6,600 ft). The Falknishorn, at 2,452 metres (8,045 ft) above sea level, is the fifth highest mountain in Liechtenstein and represents the southernmost point of the country. The Liechtenstein-Graubünden-Vorarlberg border triangle is the Naafkopf (2,570 m (8,430 ft) above sea level).[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiechtenstein follows a policy of neutrality and is one of the few countries in the world that maintain no military although its police force maintains a paramilitary force, the Princely Liechtenstein Security Corps, within the organisation that might act as its *de facto* army if an invasion of Liechtenstein ever occurred. The corps provides heavy backup for the National Police as well as Honor Guards at the Royal Palace and official functions. However, Liechtenstein can reinstate its military if deemed necessary, although this is very unlikely.[121]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Liechtenstein\". *The World Factbook*.

Since 2000, Switzerland has appointed an ambassador to Liechtenstein, but he resides in Bern. Liechtenstein's consular representation has been mostly handled by Switzerland since the Customs Treaty with Switzerland of 1923.\n\n\nLiechtenstein maintains direct diplomatic missions in Vienna, Bern, Berlin, Brussels, Strasbourg, and Washington, D.C., as well as Permanent Missions in New York and Geneva to the United Nations.[62] Currently, diplomatic missions from 78 countries are accredited to Liechtenstein, but mostly reside in Bern.

At the close of the conflict, Czechoslovakia and Poland, acting to seize what they considered German possessions, expropriated all of the Liechtenstein dynasty's properties in those three regions.[33] The expropriations (subject to modern legal dispute at the International Court of Justice) included over 1,600 km2 (618 sq mi) of agricultural and forest land (most notably the UNESCO listed Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape), and several family castles and palaces.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe government comprises the head of government (prime minister) and four government councillors (ministers), who are appointed by the Prince upon the proposal of parliament and with its concurrence, and reflect the balance of parties in parliament. The constitution stipulates that at least two government members be chosen from each of the two regions.[49] The members of the government are collectively and individually responsible to parliament; parliament may ask the Prince to remove an individual minister or the entire government, or the Prince may do so unilaterally.\n\n\nParliament elects from among its members a \"Landesausschuss\" (National Committee) made up of the president of the parliament and four additional members. The National Committee is charged with performing functions of parliamentary supervision. Parliament shares the authority to propose new legislation with the Prince, and with the citizenry, as both parliament and the citizenry may initiate referendums.[50]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Historical Society of the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Liechtenstein National Museum (*Liechtensteinisches Landesmuseum*) also play a role in preserving the culture and history of the country.[101][102] The National Museum shows permanent exhibitions on the cultural and natural history of Liechtenstein as well as special exhibitions. There is also a stamp museum, ski museum, and a 500-year-old Rural Lifestyle Museum.[103]\n\n\nThe Liechtenstein State Library is the library that has legal deposit for all books published in the country.[104] Poet Ida Ospelt-Amann published her works exclusively in the Alemannic dialect of Vaduz.[105][106]\n\n\nThe famous historical sites include Vaduz Castle, Gutenberg Castle, and Vaduz Cathedral.[103]\n\n\nThe Private Art Collection of the Prince of Liechtenstein, one of the world's leading private art collections, is shown at the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna.[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"Principality of Liechtenstein website – Parliamentary elections\".

Four days later, the Liechtenstein team traveled to Luxembourg, where they defeated the home team 4–0 in a 2006 World Cup qualifying match. In the qualification stage of the European Championship 2008, Liechtenstein beat Latvia 1–0, which prompted the Latvian coach's resignation.

Since 2002, however, Liechtenstein has had a permanent ambassador in Berlin, while the German embassy in Switzerland is also responsible for the Principality. Liechtenstein's Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers the contacts to be extremely fruitful and important for the country's development, especially on the economic level.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nModern publications generally attribute Liechtenstein's sovereignty to these events. Its prince ceased to owe an obligation to any suzerain. From 25 July 1806, when the Confederation of the Rhine was founded, the Prince of Liechtenstein was a member, in fact, a vassal, of its hegemon, styled *protector*, the French Emperor Napoleon I, until the dissolution of the confederation on 19 October 1813.\n\n\nSoon afterward, Liechtenstein joined the German Confederation (20 June 1815 – 23 August 1866), which was presided over by the Emperor of Austria.\n\n\nIn 1818, Prince Johann I granted the territory a limited constitution. In that same year Prince Aloys became the first member of the House of Liechtenstein to set foot in the principality that bore their name. The next visit would not occur until 1842.\n\n\nDevelopments during the 19th century included:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Hallstatt and La Tène cultures flourished during the late Iron Age, from around 450 BCE—possibly under some influence of both the Greek and Etruscan civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Alpine region were the Helvetii. In 58 BCE, at the Battle of Bibracte, Julius Caesar defeated the Alpine tribes, thereby bringing the region under Roman subjugation. By 15 BCE, Tiberius—later the second Roman emperor—with his brother, Drusus, conquered the entire Alpine area. Liechtenstein then became integrated into the Roman province of Raetia. The area was garrisoned by the Roman army, which maintained large legionary camps at Brigantium (Austria), near Lake Constance, and at Magia (Switzerland). The Romans built and maintained a road which ran through the territory. Around 260 CE Brigantium was destroyed by the Alemanni, a Germanic people who later settled in the area around 450.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe reigning Prince is the Head of State and represents Liechtenstein in its international relations (although Switzerland has taken responsibility for much of Liechtenstein's diplomatic relations).[46]\n\n\nThe current Constitution of Liechtenstein was adopted in March 2003, amending the 1921 constitution, giving the prince extensive veto powers, and the ability to dismiss the government and rule by emergency decree, and maintaining the prince's active role in the legislative process. The BBC characterizes Liechtenstein post-2003 as \"in effect\" an \"absolute monarchy\".[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. **^** Vaduz-Vienna, LIECHTENSTEIN The Princely Collections. \"Garden Palace | permanent presentation |\". *LIECHTENSTEIN.

The nearest airport is also in Italy. The country's capital city, the City of San Marino, is located atop Monte Titano, while its largest settlement is Dogana within the largest municipality of Serravalle. San Marino's official language is Italian.\n\n\nThe country derives its name from Saint Marinus, a stonemason from the then-Roman island of Rab in present-day Croatia. Born in AD 275, Marinus participated in the rebuilding of Rimini's city walls after their destruction by Liburnian pirates. Marinus then went on to found an independently ruled monastic community on Monte Titano in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to being the oldest extant sovereign state, as well as the oldest constitutional republic.[12]\n\n\nUniquely, San Marino's constitution dictates that its democratically elected legislature, the Grand and General Council, must elect two heads of state every six months. Known as captains regent, the two heads of state serve concurrently and with equal powers until their term expires after six months.\n\n\nThe country's economy is mainly based on finance, industry, services, retail, and tourism. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in GDP per capita, with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions.[1] Despite this fact, ranking 44th, its Human Development Index score is the lowest in Western Europe.[6] Its health care system ranked 3rd in the first ever World Health Organization analysis of the world's health systems.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of San Marino\n\n![](image)Illustration of Saint Marinus, the founder of the Republic of San Marino and prominent cultural figure\nSaint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\n\n\nThe official founding date is 3 September 301 AD.[14] In 1291 San Marino appealed to the bishop of Arezzo, Ildebrandino Guidi di Romena, against the contribution demands by the Vicario del Montefeltro. Jurist Palamede di Rimini, decided in favour of San Marino and recognised its tax exemption from tributes demands of Montefeltro. In 1296, when Guglielmo Durante was the governor of Romagna, Sammarinesi appealed to Pope Boniface VIII against the further requests by the Montefeltro podestas regarding tributes. Abbot Ranieri di Sant'Anastasio was assigned to judge the dispute. A long process was held using various witnesses and sources to determine San Marino tax's exemption status. The verdict was probably in favour of the autonomy of San Marino, as later the State has never paid taxes to the Montefeltro.[15]\n\n\nIn 1320, the community of Chiesanuova chose to join the country.[16] In 1463, San Marino was enlarged to include the communities of Faetano, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle, since then the country's borders have remained unchanged.[17]\n\n\nIn 1503, Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, occupied the Republic for six months until his father's successor, Pope Julius II, intervened and restored the country's independence.[18]\n\n\nOn 4 June 1543, Fabiano di Monte San Savino, nephew of the later Pope Julius III, attempted to conquer the republic, but his infantry and cavalry failed as they got lost in a dense fog, which the Sammarinese attributed to Saint Quirinus, whose feast day it was.[19]\n\n\nAfter the Duchy of Urbino was annexed by the Papal States in 1625, San Marino became an enclave within the papal states. This led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never amounted to a *de facto* Papal control of the republic.[20]\n\n\nThe country was occupied on 17 October 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of Ravenna, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, but independence was restored by Pope Clement XII on 5 February 1740, the feast day of Saint Agatha, after which she became a patron saint of the republic.[21]\n\n\nThe advance of Napoleon's army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty by one of its regents, Antonio Onofri, who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Due to Onofri's intervention, Napoleon promised, in a letter to Gaspard Monge, scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' revanchism.[22][23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anita and Giuseppe Garibaldi in San Marino, 1849\n![](image)The San Marino constitution, or more precisely statutes, of 1600\nDuring the later phase of the Italian unification process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including Giuseppe Garibaldi and his wife Anita. Garibaldi allowed San Marino to remain independent. San Marino and the Kingdom of Italy signed a Convention of Friendship in 1862.[24]\n\n\nThe government of San Marino made United States President Abraham Lincoln an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that \"government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring\".[25][26]\n\n\n\n### 20th century onwards[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 24 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not acquiesce. Two groups of ten volunteers joined the Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.[27]\n\n\nAfter the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tension between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the Sammarinese Fascist Party (*Partito Fascista Sammarinese*, PFS), founded in 1922 and styled largely on their Italian counterpart. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from Benito Mussolini's fascist government in Italy.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)British troops at Monte Titano during the Battle of San Marino, September 1944\nDuring World War II, San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article in *The New York Times* that it had declared war on the United Kingdom on 17 September 1940.[29] The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.[30]\n\n\nOn 28 July 1943, three days after the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The PFS regained power on 1 April 1944, but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the Royal Air Force, in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter.[31] San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the Gothic Line.[32] In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the Battle of San Marino.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSan Marino had the world's first democratically elected communist government – a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party, which held office between 1945 and 1957.[33][34] The coalition lost power through the fatti di Rovereta.\n\n\nSan Marino became a member of the Council of Europe in 1988 and of the United Nations in 1992. It is not a member of the European Union, although it uses the euro as its currency (despite not legally being part of the Eurozone). Before the introduction of the euro, the country's currency was the Sammarinese lira.\n\n\nAs of June 2020, San Marino had the highest death rate per capita of any country, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[35] In April 2021, it was reported that San Marino was using the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine rather than vaccines approved by the EU, following a slow rollout for the latter vaccines.[36][37]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics, San Marino became the smallest country to earn an Olympic medal when Alessandra Perilli won a bronze medal in the women's trap.[38] They later won another medal, this one silver, with Perilli's and Gian Marco Berti's performance in the mixed trap shooting event.[39]\n\n\nOn 7 March 2022, during the Russia-Ukraine War, the Russian Kremlin released on Twitter a list of countries which it considered \"unfriendly\" to Russia. San Marino was included in the list, alongside numerous well-known Russian adversaries such as the United States and countries in the European Union. The motivation for including San Marino as an \"unfriendly\" nation was unclear, and it gained substantial attention on the Internet.[40]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2022, San Marino officials voted to legalize abortion in the republic, \"one of the last European states to have had the procedure outlawed under all circumstances\".[41] 32 members of the legislature approved the bill while 10 abstained and 7 voted against.[42] The public health system is promised[*clarification needed*] to cover the cost of the abortion procedure.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of San Marino\n\n![](image)Enlargeable, detailed map of San Marino\n![](image)The fortress of *Guaita* on Monte Titano\n![](image)View of the *Guaita* defensive wall\nSan Marino is an enclave surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, on the border between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Marche and about ten kilometres (six miles) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no substantial naturally flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level; the lowest, the Ausa River (ending in the Marecchia),[43] is 55 m (180 ft). San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\n\n\nIt is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country (the others being Vatican City, also enclosed by Italy, and Lesotho, enclosed by South Africa). It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth-smallest country in the world.[11]\n\n\nThe terrestrial ecoregion of Italian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests lies within San Marino's territory.[44] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.01/10, ranking it last globally out of 172 countries.[45]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*), with some continental influences. It has warm to hot summers and cool winters, typical of inland areas of the central Italian Peninsula. Precipitation is scattered throughout the year with no real dry month. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400–500 m (1,300–1,600 feet) of elevation.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for San Marino (2006–2023)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 31.9(89.4)\n | 35.5(95.9)\n | 35.1(95.2)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 30.5(86.9)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 6.4(43.5)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 7.4(45.3)\n | 15.9(60.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 4.8(40.6)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 6.7(44.1)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 10.2(50.3)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n | −5.9(21.4)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 1.3(34.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 0.9(33.6)\n | −2.8(27.0)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 50.2(1.98)\n | 63.9(2.52)\n | 64.5(2.54)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 70.3(2.77)\n | 54.3(2.14)\n | 40.4(1.59)\n | 40.7(1.60)\n | 75.3(2.96)\n | 70.2(2.76)\n | 99.0(3.90)\n | 61.4(2.42)\n | 749.5(29.51)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 7.2\n | 8.4\n | 8.3\n | 7.9\n | 8.6\n | 4.8\n | 4.3\n | 4.5\n | 6.8\n | 7.1\n | 10.2\n | 8.3\n | 86.3\n |\n| Source: Arpae Emilia-Romagna[46] |\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of San Marino\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of San Marino, Constitution of San Marino, Capital punishment in San Marino, San Marino passport, Law enforcement in San Marino, and Elections in San Marino\n\n![](image)The Palazzo Pubblico, seat of the government of San Marino\n![](image)Four former captains regent: from left to right, Mirko Tomassoni, Alessandro Rossi, Alessandro Mancini, and Alberto Selva\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are heads of state,[47] and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Although there is no formal head of government, the secretary for foreign and political affairs is in many ways equal to the prime minister in other countries.[48] Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n\nSan Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect, as the Statutes of 1600 are still at the core of its constitutional framework.[49]\n\n\nSan Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the council. Still today, Captains Regent are elected every six months by the council.\n\n\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (*Consiglio grande e generale*). The council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old parishes of the republic. All citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote.\n\n\nBesides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the judicial branch during the period of legislature of the council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councilors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\n\n\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regent to be the heads of state. The captains are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\n\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the captains regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\n\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing Pact for San Marino, led by the San Marinese Christian Democratic Party; and the left-wing Reforms and Freedom, led by the Party of Socialists and Democrats, a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the former communist Party of Democrats. The 2008 general election was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\n\n\nOn 1 October 2007, Mirko Tomassoni was elected as captain regent, making him the first disabled person elected to that office.[50]\n\n\nSan Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino (*Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino*) exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n\nOn 1 April 2022, 58-year-old Paolo Rondelli was elected as one of the two captains regent, its heads of state. He had previously been the Ambassador to the United States and is the world's first openly gay head of state.[51]\n\n\n\n### Administrative division[edit]\n\n\n#### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of San Marino\nSan Marino is divided into nine municipalities, known locally as **castelli** (meaning \"castles\"):\n\n\n\n* San Marino (City of San Marino, officially **Città di San Marino**) is the capital.\n\n\nAnd eight minor municipalities:\n\n\n\n* Acquaviva\n* Borgo Maggiore\n* Chiesanuova\n* Domagnano\n* Faetano\n* Fiorentino\n* Montegiardino\n* Serravalle\n\n\nThe largest settlement of the Republic is Dogana, which is not an autonomous **castello**, but rather belongs to the Castello of Serravalle.\n\n\nIn a similar way to an Italian **comune**, each **castello** includes a main settlement, called **capoluogo**, which is the seat of the **castello**, and some even smaller localities known as **frazioni**.\n\n\n\n#### Curacies[edit]\n\n\nThe republic is made up of 43 parishes,[52] named *curacies* (Italian: *curazie*): Cà Berlone, Cà Chiavello, Cà Giannino, Cà Melone, Cà Ragni, Cà Rigo, Cailungo, Caladino, Calligaria, Canepa, Capanne, Casole, Castellaro, Cerbaiola, Cinque Vie, Confine, Corianino, Crociale, Dogana, Falciano, Fiorina, Galavotto, Gualdicciolo, La Serra, Lesignano, Molarini, Montalbo, Monte Pulito, Murata, Pianacci, Piandivello, Poggio Casalino, Poggio Chiesanuova, Ponte Mellini, Rovereta, San Giovanni sotto le Penne, Santa Mustiola, Spaccio Giannoni, Teglio, Torraccia, Valdragone, Valgiurata, and Ventoso.\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese Armed Forces\n\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces. Different branches have varied functions, including performing ceremonial duties, patrolling borders, mounting guard at government buildings, and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n\n\n#### Crossbow Corps[edit]\n\n\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Rock[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Guards of the Rock\nThe Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them.[53] In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City, the seat of national government.\n\n\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard.[53] Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Grand and General Council[edit]\n\n\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1741,[53] is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the council are to protect the captains regent, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n\n\n#### Company of Uniformed Militia[edit]\n\n\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\n\n\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n\n\n#### Military Ensemble[edit]\n\n\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia,[53] and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 60 musicians.[54] The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n\n\n#### Gendarmerie[edit]\n\n\nEstablished in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency.[53] Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\n\n\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the *Corpi Militari Volontari*, or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of San Marino, Sammarinese euro coins, Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino, and List of banks in San Marino\n\n![](image)Tourism and banking are the country's main sources of revenue.\nSan Marino is a developed country,[55] and although it is not a European Union member it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins. Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors.\n\n\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking, electronics, and ceramics. The main agricultural products are wine and cheese. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\n\n\nSan Marino's postage stamps, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to philatelists and are a significant source of income.[56] San Marino is no longer a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation.[57]\n\n\nIt has the world's third highest rate of car ownership, being one of only a handful of countries with more vehicles than people.[58] As of October 2023, Gibraltar had the highest rate of car ownership per capita, and Guernsey was in the number two spot.[59]\n\n\n\n### Taxation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"San Marino\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(October 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 8.5%. Capital gains are also subject to an 8.5% tax, and interest from bank deposits is subject to an 11% tax.[60] Several benefits apply to new businesses, which can strongly reduce the amount of taxes to be paid.\n\n\nThe personal income tax (IGR, Italian: *Imposta Generale sui Redditi*) was introduced in 1984 and it was heavily reformed in 2013 with the goal of increasing fiscal revenue. The nominal tax rate ranges from 9% for an annual revenue below €10,000 to 35% for revenues above €80,000.\n\n\nIn 1972, a value-added tax (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and an equivalent tax was introduced also in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. However, this tax is not a standard value-added tax, but rather it is an import tax, thus, it is levied only on imported goods and raw resources. For this reason it is locally best known as single stage tax (Italian: *imposta monofase*), as it is only applied one time during importation, while VAT is applied at every exchange. Furthermore, while VAT also applies to services, the import tax only applies on physical goods. Another important difference is that while VAT is computed on the final price paid by the consumer, the import tax is levied on the importation cost paid by the company, which is generally much lower.\n\n\nUnder the European Union customs agreement, San Marino import tax is considered equivalent to the European VAT system. A separate tax on services, with a rate of 3%, has been introduced in 2011. The introduction of a true VAT system, not dissimilar from the European one, is under development.\n\n\nBecause San Marino's tax rate is lower than surrounding Italy's, many businesses choose to be based in San Marino to avoid the higher rates. San Marino boasts a corporate rate 14.5% lower than Italy (23%) and 12.5% lower than the EU average (21.3%). This has made San Marino the tax haven of choice for many wealthy Italians and businesses.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in San Marino\n\nThe tourism sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's GDP,[61] with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.[62]\n\n\n\n### Conventions with Italy[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862,[63] dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.\n\n\nCultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's government monopoly are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden; all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use Italy's mint; the agreement does not affect the right of the Republic of San Marino to continue to issue gold coins denominated in Scudi[64] (the legal value of 1 gold Scudo is 37.50 euros). Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is one legally operating casino.\n\n\nIn exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, provided at cost, of sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).[65]\n\n\nAt the border there are no formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their passports.\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Over 48.4% of the population profess the Catholic faith, and approximately half of those regularly attend church. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino. The country's high Roman Catholic majority can mainly be traced back to the country's founding, when Saint Marinus set up the first fortress to protect Christians from Roman persecution.[66] The small state's culture has primarily remained Catholic ever since.\n\n\nThere is a provision under the income tax rules that taxpayers have the right to request the allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities.\n\n\nThe Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a suffragan of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.[67] The diocese includes all the parishes of San Marino. The earliest mention of Montefeltro, as *Mona Feretri*, is in the diplomas by which Charlemagne confirmed the donation of Pepin. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at San Leo. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino.[68] Since 1988, there is formally an apostolic nunciature to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.\n\n\nOther faiths include the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThere has been a Jewish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years.[69] The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino.[70] Jews were permitted official protection by the government.\n\n\nDuring World War II, San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Jews and other Italians (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from Nazi persecution. As of 2012[update], few Jews remain.[71]\n\n\nIn 2019, the sculpture \"Dialogue\" by Michele Chiaruzzi was inaugurated at Saint Anne Chapel, the first monument of its kind devoted to interfaith dialogue.[72]\n\n\n\n\n\nReligions in San Marino (2011)[1]\n| Religion | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Roman Catholic | 97.2%\n |\n| Protestant | 1.1%\n |\n| Other Christian | 0.7%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.1%\n |\n| Other | 0.1%\n |\n| Not religious | 0.7%\n |\n| No answer | 0.1%\n |\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive Sammarinese license plates, which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is \"RSM\".\n\n\nThere are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private airstrip located in Torraccia. Most tourists who arrive by air land at Federico Fellini International Airport (close to the Italian city of Rimini), then make the transfer by bus.\n\n\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino public transport comprises eight local bus lines entirely within San Marino. Cross-border connection to Rimini is available across a highway bridge in Rovereta.\n\n\nThere is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station.\n\n\nA limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic,[73] and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial tramway to Monte Titano\nThere is a 1.5-kilometre (1 mi) aerial tramway connecting the City of San Marino on top of Monte Titano with Borgo Maggiore, a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, Dogana, via the local bus service.\n\n\nTwo aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino\n\nToday, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before World War II, it had a single narrow-gauge line called the Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of Valdragone but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.[74]\nAn advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes. Debate continues on whether the line should be restored, as Rimini is the nearest bigger city and has access to the Adriatic sea, the Italian railway network, and the Federico Fellini International Airport.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on the |\n| Culture of San Marino |\n| ![](image) |\n| History |\n| People |\n| Languages |\n| Cuisine |\n| Festivals |\n| Religion |\n| Music |\n| Media\n* Television\n |\n| Sport |\n| Monuments\n* World Heritage Sites\n |\n| Symbols\n* Flag\n* Coat of arms\n* National anthem\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

They are depicted on both the flag of San Marino and its coat of arms. The three towers are: *Guaita*, the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century *Cesta*, located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century *Montale*, on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.\n\n\n\n### University[edit]\n\n\nThe *Università degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino* (University of the Republic of San Marino)[75] is the main university, which includes the *Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino* (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the *Istituto Musicale Sammarinese* (Sammarinese Musical Institute)[76] and the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino or *Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino* (International Academy of Sciences San Marino).[77] The latter is known for adopting Esperanto as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).\n\n\nItalian author Umberto Eco had attempted to create a \"university without physical structures\" in San Marino.[78]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in San Marino\n\nSee also: San Marino at the Olympics and Football in San Marino\n\nIn San Marino football is the most popular sport. Basketball and volleyball are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the San Marino Football Federation, the San Marino Basketball Federation and the San Marino Volleyball Federation.\n\n\nThe San Marino national football team has had little success, being made up of part-timers, such as local plumbers and farmers. Never qualifying for a major tournament, and recording only one win in over 25 years of its history, a 1–0 victory in 2004 against Liechtenstein.[79] They have drawn four more, with their most notable result being a 1993 0–0 draw with Turkey during the European qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[80] In the same qualifying competition Davide Gualtieri scored a goal 8.3 seconds into a match against England; this goal held the record for the fastest in international football until 2016.[81][82] San Marino has a club in the Italian league system called A.S.D.V. San Marino and a domestic amateur league, the Campionato Sammarinese, whose teams also participate in European club competitions. Together with Italy, San Marino held the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with teams playing at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle. With Italy being the sole automatic qualifiers, the Sammarinese team was not participating in the final tournament.\n\n\n\n![](image)2005 San Marino Grand Prix held in Imola, Italy\nA Formula One race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was named after the state, although it did not take place there. Instead, it was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about 100 km (60 mi) northwest of San Marino. Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna suffered fatal accidents a day apart during the 1994 Grand Prix. This international event was removed from the calendar in 2007, although the circuit has since returned to the calendar as the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.\n\n\nThe San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, as does San Marino's round of the World Superbike Championship.\n\n\nSan Marino has a professional baseball team which plays in Italy's top division. It has participated in the European Cup tournament for the continent's top club sides several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2007. It won the championship in 2006, 2011 and 2014.\n\n\nShooting is also very popular in San Marino, with many shooters having taken part in international competitions and the Olympic Games. San Marino is also the smallest country to have ever won an Olympic medal, having won one silver and a bronze in shooting in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Despite their small population, they got their silver in a team event losing the gold medal match to Spain 41–40.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese cuisine\n\n![](image)A *piadina*, a dish characteristic of the Italian region of Romagna and of its enclave of San Marino\nThe cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to Italian, especially that of the adjoining Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products.[83] Its best known is probably the *Torta Tre Monti* (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the Three Towers of San Marino. The country also has a small wine industry.\n\n\n\n### UNESCO[edit]\n\n\nThe site San Marino: Historic Centre and Mount Titano became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2008.[84] The decision was taken during the 32nd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee composed of 21 countries convened in Québec, Canada.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of San Marino and San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The nearest airport is also in Italy. The country's capital city, the City of San Marino, is located atop Monte Titano, while its largest settlement is Dogana within the largest municipality of Serravalle. San Marino's official language is Italian.\n\n\nThe country derives its name from Saint Marinus, a stonemason from the then-Roman island of Rab in present-day Croatia. Born in AD 275, Marinus participated in the rebuilding of Rimini's city walls after their destruction by Liburnian pirates. Marinus then went on to found an independently ruled monastic community on Monte Titano in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to being the oldest extant sovereign state, as well as the oldest constitutional republic.[12]\n\n\nUniquely, San Marino's constitution dictates that its democratically elected legislature, the Grand and General Council, must elect two heads of state every six months. Known as captains regent, the two heads of state serve concurrently and with equal powers until their term expires after six months.\n\n\nThe country's economy is mainly based on finance, industry, services, retail, and tourism. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in GDP per capita, with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions.[1] Despite this fact, ranking 44th, its Human Development Index score is the lowest in Western Europe.[6] Its health care system ranked 3rd in the first ever World Health Organization analysis of the world's health systems.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of San Marino\n\n![](image)Illustration of Saint Marinus, the founder of the Republic of San Marino and prominent cultural figure\nSaint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\n\n\nThe official founding date is 3 September 301 AD.[14] In 1291 San Marino appealed to the bishop of Arezzo, Ildebrandino Guidi di Romena, against the contribution demands by the Vicario del Montefeltro. Jurist Palamede di Rimini, decided in favour of San Marino and recognised its tax exemption from tributes demands of Montefeltro. In 1296, when Guglielmo Durante was the governor of Romagna, Sammarinesi appealed to Pope Boniface VIII against the further requests by the Montefeltro podestas regarding tributes. Abbot Ranieri di Sant'Anastasio was assigned to judge the dispute. A long process was held using various witnesses and sources to determine San Marino tax's exemption status. The verdict was probably in favour of the autonomy of San Marino, as later the State has never paid taxes to the Montefeltro.[15]\n\n\nIn 1320, the community of Chiesanuova chose to join the country.[16] In 1463, San Marino was enlarged to include the communities of Faetano, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle, since then the country's borders have remained unchanged.[17]\n\n\nIn 1503, Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, occupied the Republic for six months until his father's successor, Pope Julius II, intervened and restored the country's independence.[18]\n\n\nOn 4 June 1543, Fabiano di Monte San Savino, nephew of the later Pope Julius III, attempted to conquer the republic, but his infantry and cavalry failed as they got lost in a dense fog, which the Sammarinese attributed to Saint Quirinus, whose feast day it was.[19]\n\n\nAfter the Duchy of Urbino was annexed by the Papal States in 1625, San Marino became an enclave within the papal states. This led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never amounted to a *de facto* Papal control of the republic.[20]\n\n\nThe country was occupied on 17 October 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of Ravenna, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, but independence was restored by Pope Clement XII on 5 February 1740, the feast day of Saint Agatha, after which she became a patron saint of the republic.[21]\n\n\nThe advance of Napoleon's army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty by one of its regents, Antonio Onofri, who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Due to Onofri's intervention, Napoleon promised, in a letter to Gaspard Monge, scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' revanchism.[22][23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anita and Giuseppe Garibaldi in San Marino, 1849\n![](image)The San Marino constitution, or more precisely statutes, of 1600\nDuring the later phase of the Italian unification process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including Giuseppe Garibaldi and his wife Anita. Garibaldi allowed San Marino to remain independent. San Marino and the Kingdom of Italy signed a Convention of Friendship in 1862.[24]\n\n\nThe government of San Marino made United States President Abraham Lincoln an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that \"government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring\".[25][26]\n\n\n\n### 20th century onwards[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 24 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not acquiesce. Two groups of ten volunteers joined the Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.[27]\n\n\nAfter the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tension between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the Sammarinese Fascist Party (*Partito Fascista Sammarinese*, PFS), founded in 1922 and styled largely on their Italian counterpart. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from Benito Mussolini's fascist government in Italy.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)British troops at Monte Titano during the Battle of San Marino, September 1944\nDuring World War II, San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article in *The New York Times* that it had declared war on the United Kingdom on 17 September 1940.[29] The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.[30]\n\n\nOn 28 July 1943, three days after the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The PFS regained power on 1 April 1944, but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the Royal Air Force, in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter.[31] San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the Gothic Line.[32] In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the Battle of San Marino.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSan Marino had the world's first democratically elected communist government – a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party, which held office between 1945 and 1957.[33][34] The coalition lost power through the fatti di Rovereta.\n\n\nSan Marino became a member of the Council of Europe in 1988 and of the United Nations in 1992. It is not a member of the European Union, although it uses the euro as its currency (despite not legally being part of the Eurozone). Before the introduction of the euro, the country's currency was the Sammarinese lira.\n\n\nAs of June 2020, San Marino had the highest death rate per capita of any country, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[35] In April 2021, it was reported that San Marino was using the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine rather than vaccines approved by the EU, following a slow rollout for the latter vaccines.[36][37]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics, San Marino became the smallest country to earn an Olympic medal when Alessandra Perilli won a bronze medal in the women's trap.[38] They later won another medal, this one silver, with Perilli's and Gian Marco Berti's performance in the mixed trap shooting event.[39]\n\n\nOn 7 March 2022, during the Russia-Ukraine War, the Russian Kremlin released on Twitter a list of countries which it considered \"unfriendly\" to Russia. San Marino was included in the list, alongside numerous well-known Russian adversaries such as the United States and countries in the European Union. The motivation for including San Marino as an \"unfriendly\" nation was unclear, and it gained substantial attention on the Internet.[40]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2022, San Marino officials voted to legalize abortion in the republic, \"one of the last European states to have had the procedure outlawed under all circumstances\".[41] 32 members of the legislature approved the bill while 10 abstained and 7 voted against.[42] The public health system is promised[*clarification needed*] to cover the cost of the abortion procedure.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of San Marino\n\n![](image)Enlargeable, detailed map of San Marino\n![](image)The fortress of *Guaita* on Monte Titano\n![](image)View of the *Guaita* defensive wall\nSan Marino is an enclave surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, on the border between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Marche and about ten kilometres (six miles) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no substantial naturally flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level; the lowest, the Ausa River (ending in the Marecchia),[43] is 55 m (180 ft). San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\n\n\nIt is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country (the others being Vatican City, also enclosed by Italy, and Lesotho, enclosed by South Africa). It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth-smallest country in the world.[11]\n\n\nThe terrestrial ecoregion of Italian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests lies within San Marino's territory.[44] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.01/10, ranking it last globally out of 172 countries.[45]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*), with some continental influences. It has warm to hot summers and cool winters, typical of inland areas of the central Italian Peninsula. Precipitation is scattered throughout the year with no real dry month. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400–500 m (1,300–1,600 feet) of elevation.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for San Marino (2006–2023)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 31.9(89.4)\n | 35.5(95.9)\n | 35.1(95.2)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 30.5(86.9)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 6.4(43.5)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 7.4(45.3)\n | 15.9(60.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 4.8(40.6)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 6.7(44.1)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 10.2(50.3)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n | −5.9(21.4)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 1.3(34.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 0.9(33.6)\n | −2.8(27.0)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 50.2(1.98)\n | 63.9(2.52)\n | 64.5(2.54)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 70.3(2.77)\n | 54.3(2.14)\n | 40.4(1.59)\n | 40.7(1.60)\n | 75.3(2.96)\n | 70.2(2.76)\n | 99.0(3.90)\n | 61.4(2.42)\n | 749.5(29.51)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 7.2\n | 8.4\n | 8.3\n | 7.9\n | 8.6\n | 4.8\n | 4.3\n | 4.5\n | 6.8\n | 7.1\n | 10.2\n | 8.3\n | 86.3\n |\n| Source: Arpae Emilia-Romagna[46] |\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of San Marino\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of San Marino, Constitution of San Marino, Capital punishment in San Marino, San Marino passport, Law enforcement in San Marino, and Elections in San Marino\n\n![](image)The Palazzo Pubblico, seat of the government of San Marino\n![](image)Four former captains regent: from left to right, Mirko Tomassoni, Alessandro Rossi, Alessandro Mancini, and Alberto Selva\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are heads of state,[47] and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Although there is no formal head of government, the secretary for foreign and political affairs is in many ways equal to the prime minister in other countries.[48] Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n\nSan Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect, as the Statutes of 1600 are still at the core of its constitutional framework.[49]\n\n\nSan Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the council. Still today, Captains Regent are elected every six months by the council.\n\n\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (*Consiglio grande e generale*). The council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old parishes of the republic. All citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote.\n\n\nBesides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the judicial branch during the period of legislature of the council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councilors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\n\n\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regent to be the heads of state. The captains are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\n\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the captains regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\n\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing Pact for San Marino, led by the San Marinese Christian Democratic Party; and the left-wing Reforms and Freedom, led by the Party of Socialists and Democrats, a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the former communist Party of Democrats. The 2008 general election was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\n\n\nOn 1 October 2007, Mirko Tomassoni was elected as captain regent, making him the first disabled person elected to that office.[50]\n\n\nSan Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino (*Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino*) exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n\nOn 1 April 2022, 58-year-old Paolo Rondelli was elected as one of the two captains regent, its heads of state. He had previously been the Ambassador to the United States and is the world's first openly gay head of state.[51]\n\n\n\n### Administrative division[edit]\n\n\n#### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of San Marino\nSan Marino is divided into nine municipalities, known locally as **castelli** (meaning \"castles\"):\n\n\n\n* San Marino (City of San Marino, officially **Città di San Marino**) is the capital.\n\n\nAnd eight minor municipalities:\n\n\n\n* Acquaviva\n* Borgo Maggiore\n* Chiesanuova\n* Domagnano\n* Faetano\n* Fiorentino\n* Montegiardino\n* Serravalle\n\n\nThe largest settlement of the Republic is Dogana, which is not an autonomous **castello**, but rather belongs to the Castello of Serravalle.\n\n\nIn a similar way to an Italian **comune**, each **castello** includes a main settlement, called **capoluogo**, which is the seat of the **castello**, and some even smaller localities known as **frazioni**.\n\n\n\n#### Curacies[edit]\n\n\nThe republic is made up of 43 parishes,[52] named *curacies* (Italian: *curazie*): Cà Berlone, Cà Chiavello, Cà Giannino, Cà Melone, Cà Ragni, Cà Rigo, Cailungo, Caladino, Calligaria, Canepa, Capanne, Casole, Castellaro, Cerbaiola, Cinque Vie, Confine, Corianino, Crociale, Dogana, Falciano, Fiorina, Galavotto, Gualdicciolo, La Serra, Lesignano, Molarini, Montalbo, Monte Pulito, Murata, Pianacci, Piandivello, Poggio Casalino, Poggio Chiesanuova, Ponte Mellini, Rovereta, San Giovanni sotto le Penne, Santa Mustiola, Spaccio Giannoni, Teglio, Torraccia, Valdragone, Valgiurata, and Ventoso.\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese Armed Forces\n\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces. Different branches have varied functions, including performing ceremonial duties, patrolling borders, mounting guard at government buildings, and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n\n\n#### Crossbow Corps[edit]\n\n\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Rock[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Guards of the Rock\nThe Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them.[53] In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City, the seat of national government.\n\n\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard.[53] Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Grand and General Council[edit]\n\n\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1741,[53] is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the council are to protect the captains regent, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n\n\n#### Company of Uniformed Militia[edit]\n\n\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\n\n\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n\n\n#### Military Ensemble[edit]\n\n\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia,[53] and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 60 musicians.[54] The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n\n\n#### Gendarmerie[edit]\n\n\nEstablished in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency.[53] Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\n\n\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the *Corpi Militari Volontari*, or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of San Marino, Sammarinese euro coins, Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino, and List of banks in San Marino\n\n![](image)Tourism and banking are the country's main sources of revenue.\nSan Marino is a developed country,[55] and although it is not a European Union member it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins. Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors.\n\n\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking, electronics, and ceramics. The main agricultural products are wine and cheese. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\n\n\nSan Marino's postage stamps, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to philatelists and are a significant source of income.[56] San Marino is no longer a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation.[57]\n\n\nIt has the world's third highest rate of car ownership, being one of only a handful of countries with more vehicles than people.[58] As of October 2023, Gibraltar had the highest rate of car ownership per capita, and Guernsey was in the number two spot.[59]\n\n\n\n### Taxation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"San Marino\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(October 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 8.5%. Capital gains are also subject to an 8.5% tax, and interest from bank deposits is subject to an 11% tax.[60] Several benefits apply to new businesses, which can strongly reduce the amount of taxes to be paid.\n\n\nThe personal income tax (IGR, Italian: *Imposta Generale sui Redditi*) was introduced in 1984 and it was heavily reformed in 2013 with the goal of increasing fiscal revenue. The nominal tax rate ranges from 9% for an annual revenue below €10,000 to 35% for revenues above €80,000.\n\n\nIn 1972, a value-added tax (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and an equivalent tax was introduced also in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. However, this tax is not a standard value-added tax, but rather it is an import tax, thus, it is levied only on imported goods and raw resources. For this reason it is locally best known as single stage tax (Italian: *imposta monofase*), as it is only applied one time during importation, while VAT is applied at every exchange. Furthermore, while VAT also applies to services, the import tax only applies on physical goods. Another important difference is that while VAT is computed on the final price paid by the consumer, the import tax is levied on the importation cost paid by the company, which is generally much lower.\n\n\nUnder the European Union customs agreement, San Marino import tax is considered equivalent to the European VAT system. A separate tax on services, with a rate of 3%, has been introduced in 2011. The introduction of a true VAT system, not dissimilar from the European one, is under development.\n\n\nBecause San Marino's tax rate is lower than surrounding Italy's, many businesses choose to be based in San Marino to avoid the higher rates. San Marino boasts a corporate rate 14.5% lower than Italy (23%) and 12.5% lower than the EU average (21.3%). This has made San Marino the tax haven of choice for many wealthy Italians and businesses.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in San Marino\n\nThe tourism sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's GDP,[61] with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.[62]\n\n\n\n### Conventions with Italy[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862,[63] dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.\n\n\nCultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's government monopoly are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden; all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use Italy's mint; the agreement does not affect the right of the Republic of San Marino to continue to issue gold coins denominated in Scudi[64] (the legal value of 1 gold Scudo is 37.50 euros). Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is one legally operating casino.\n\n\nIn exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, provided at cost, of sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).[65]\n\n\nAt the border there are no formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their passports.\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Over 48.4% of the population profess the Catholic faith, and approximately half of those regularly attend church. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino. The country's high Roman Catholic majority can mainly be traced back to the country's founding, when Saint Marinus set up the first fortress to protect Christians from Roman persecution.[66] The small state's culture has primarily remained Catholic ever since.\n\n\nThere is a provision under the income tax rules that taxpayers have the right to request the allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities.\n\n\nThe Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a suffragan of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.[67] The diocese includes all the parishes of San Marino. The earliest mention of Montefeltro, as *Mona Feretri*, is in the diplomas by which Charlemagne confirmed the donation of Pepin. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at San Leo. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino.[68] Since 1988, there is formally an apostolic nunciature to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.\n\n\nOther faiths include the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThere has been a Jewish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years.[69] The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino.[70] Jews were permitted official protection by the government.\n\n\nDuring World War II, San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Jews and other Italians (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from Nazi persecution. As of 2012[update], few Jews remain.[71]\n\n\nIn 2019, the sculpture \"Dialogue\" by Michele Chiaruzzi was inaugurated at Saint Anne Chapel, the first monument of its kind devoted to interfaith dialogue.[72]\n\n\n\n\n\nReligions in San Marino (2011)[1]\n| Religion | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Roman Catholic | 97.2%\n |\n| Protestant | 1.1%\n |\n| Other Christian | 0.7%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.1%\n |\n| Other | 0.1%\n |\n| Not religious | 0.7%\n |\n| No answer | 0.1%\n |\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive Sammarinese license plates, which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is \"RSM\".\n\n\nThere are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private airstrip located in Torraccia. Most tourists who arrive by air land at Federico Fellini International Airport (close to the Italian city of Rimini), then make the transfer by bus.\n\n\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino public transport comprises eight local bus lines entirely within San Marino. Cross-border connection to Rimini is available across a highway bridge in Rovereta.\n\n\nThere is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station.\n\n\nA limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic,[73] and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial tramway to Monte Titano\nThere is a 1.5-kilometre (1 mi) aerial tramway connecting the City of San Marino on top of Monte Titano with Borgo Maggiore, a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, Dogana, via the local bus service.\n\n\nTwo aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino\n\nToday, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before World War II, it had a single narrow-gauge line called the Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of Valdragone but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.[74]\nAn advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes. Debate continues on whether the line should be restored, as Rimini is the nearest bigger city and has access to the Adriatic sea, the Italian railway network, and the Federico Fellini International Airport.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on the |\n| Culture of San Marino |\n| ![](image) |\n| History |\n| People |\n| Languages |\n| Cuisine |\n| Festivals |\n| Religion |\n| Music |\n| Media\n* Television\n |\n| Sport |\n| Monuments\n* World Heritage Sites\n |\n| Symbols\n* Flag\n* Coat of arms\n* National anthem\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

They are depicted on both the flag of San Marino and its coat of arms. The three towers are: *Guaita*, the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century *Cesta*, located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century *Montale*, on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.\n\n\n\n### University[edit]\n\n\nThe *Università degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino* (University of the Republic of San Marino)[75] is the main university, which includes the *Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino* (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the *Istituto Musicale Sammarinese* (Sammarinese Musical Institute)[76] and the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino or *Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino* (International Academy of Sciences San Marino).[77] The latter is known for adopting Esperanto as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).\n\n\nItalian author Umberto Eco had attempted to create a \"university without physical structures\" in San Marino.[78]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in San Marino\n\nSee also: San Marino at the Olympics and Football in San Marino\n\nIn San Marino football is the most popular sport. Basketball and volleyball are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the San Marino Football Federation, the San Marino Basketball Federation and the San Marino Volleyball Federation.\n\n\nThe San Marino national football team has had little success, being made up of part-timers, such as local plumbers and farmers. Never qualifying for a major tournament, and recording only one win in over 25 years of its history, a 1–0 victory in 2004 against Liechtenstein.[79] They have drawn four more, with their most notable result being a 1993 0–0 draw with Turkey during the European qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[80] In the same qualifying competition Davide Gualtieri scored a goal 8.3 seconds into a match against England; this goal held the record for the fastest in international football until 2016.[81][82] San Marino has a club in the Italian league system called A.S.D.V. San Marino and a domestic amateur league, the Campionato Sammarinese, whose teams also participate in European club competitions. Together with Italy, San Marino held the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with teams playing at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle. With Italy being the sole automatic qualifiers, the Sammarinese team was not participating in the final tournament.\n\n\n\n![](image)2005 San Marino Grand Prix held in Imola, Italy\nA Formula One race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was named after the state, although it did not take place there. Instead, it was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about 100 km (60 mi) northwest of San Marino. Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna suffered fatal accidents a day apart during the 1994 Grand Prix. This international event was removed from the calendar in 2007, although the circuit has since returned to the calendar as the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.\n\n\nThe San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, as does San Marino's round of the World Superbike Championship.\n\n\nSan Marino has a professional baseball team which plays in Italy's top division. It has participated in the European Cup tournament for the continent's top club sides several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2007. It won the championship in 2006, 2011 and 2014.\n\n\nShooting is also very popular in San Marino, with many shooters having taken part in international competitions and the Olympic Games. San Marino is also the smallest country to have ever won an Olympic medal, having won one silver and a bronze in shooting in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Despite their small population, they got their silver in a team event losing the gold medal match to Spain 41–40.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese cuisine\n\n![](image)A *piadina*, a dish characteristic of the Italian region of Romagna and of its enclave of San Marino\nThe cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to Italian, especially that of the adjoining Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products.[83] Its best known is probably the *Torta Tre Monti* (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the Three Towers of San Marino. The country also has a small wine industry.\n\n\n\n### UNESCO[edit]\n\n\nThe site San Marino: Historic Centre and Mount Titano became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2008.[84] The decision was taken during the 32nd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee composed of 21 countries convened in Québec, Canada.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of San Marino and San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

A well-known 17th-century composer is Francesco Maria Marini. The pop singer Little Tony achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom and Italy in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\nSan Marino has taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest eleven times, achieving three final qualifications to date (with then-three, eventually four-time contestant and San Marino native Valentina Monetta with \"Maybe\" in 2014, Turkish singer Serhat with \"Say Na Na Na\" who achieved 19th place in the final in 2019 and Italian singer Senhit along with American rapper Flo Rida who qualified for the 2021 final with the song \"Adrenalina\").\n\n\n\n### Public holidays and festivals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in San Marino\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Name\n | Explanation\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 January\n | New Year's Day | Festival marking the beginning of the new year\n |\n| 6 January\n | Epiphany | Commemorates the visit of the three wise men or magi to the infant Jesus\n |\n| 5 February\n | Feast of Saint Agatha | Commemoration of Saint Agatha, co-patroness of the Republic after the country was liberated from foreign rule on her feast day in 1740[21] |\n| Variable, the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox | Easter | Resurrection of Jesus |\n| Variable, the Monday after Easter Sunday\n | Easter Monday | Monday after Easter day\n |\n| 25 March\n | Anniversary of the Arengo | Anniversary of the 1906 Arengo and the Festa delle Milizie (Feast of the Militants)\n |\n| 1 May\n | Labour Day | Celebration of workers and employees\n |\n| *Variable*, the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday | Corpus Christi | Commemoration of the body and blood of Jesus Christ\n |\n| 28 July\n | Liberation from Fascism\n | Commemoration of the fall of the Sammarinese Fascist Party |\n| 15 August\n | Ferragosto (Assumption)\n | Commemoration of the Virgin Mary's assumption into heaven\n |\n| 3 September\n | The Feast of Saint Marinus and the Republic\n | National feast of Saint Marinus (San Marino), celebrating the origin of the Republic in 301\n |\n| 1 November\n | All Saints' Day | Feast dedicated to all saints\n |\n| 2 November\n | All Souls'Day | Remembrance of all those who gave their lives for San Marino in war\n |\n| 8 December\n | Immaculate Conception | Remembrance of the Virgin Mary's conception without original sin\n |\n| 24 December\n | Christmas Eve | Day before the commemoration of the birth of Jesus |\n| 25 December\n | Christmas | Birth of Jesus |\n| 26 December\n | Saint Stephen's Day | Commemoration of the death of Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr\n |\n| 31 December\n | New Year's Eve | Celebration which closes and marks the end of the year\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The Catholic Guide and Scout Association of San Marino\n* City-state\n* Index of San Marino–related articles\n* Outline of San Marino\n* Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino\n* Telecommunications in San Marino\n* Order of San Marino and Order of Saint Agatha\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** San Marino. *The World Factbook*.

Its capital is Valletta, the smallest national capital in the European Union by area and population. According to 2020 data by Eurostat, the Functional Urban Area and metropolitan region covered the whole island and has a population of 480,134.[17][18] According to the United Nations, ESPON and EU Commission, \"the whole territory of Malta constitutes a single urban region\".[19][20] Malta increasingly is referred to as a city-state.[21][22][23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2022, Malta National Statistics Office states that 90 percent of the Maltese population has at least a basic knowledge of Maltese, 96 percent of English, 62 percent of Italian, and 20 percent of French.[201] This widespread knowledge of second languages makes Malta one of the most multilingual countries in the European Union. A study collecting public opinion on what language was \"preferred\" discovered that 86 percent of the population preferred Maltese, 12 percent English, and 2 percent Italian.[202] Italian television channels from Italy-based broadcasters, such as Mediaset and RAI, reach Malta and remain popular.[202][203][204]\n\n\nMaltese Sign Language is used by signers in Malta.[205]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Malta\n\nFurther information: History of the Jews in Malta, Christianity in Malta, and Islam in Malta\n\nReligion in Malta (2021 census)[4][5][206]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCouncil of Europe\n |\n| --- |\n| Institutions | * Secretary General\n* Committee of Ministers\n* Parliamentary Assembly\n* Congress\n* Court of Human Rights\n* Commissioner for Human Rights\n* Commission for the Efficiency of Justice\n* Commission against Racism and Intolerance\n* Venice Commission\n* Pompidou Group\n |\n| Members | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* Italy\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* San Marino\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n |\n| Observers | * Canada\n* Holy See\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Mexico\n* United States\n* EU relations\n |\n| Former members | * Czechoslovakia (1991–1992)\n* Russia (1996–2022)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n200. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Joseph M.

The highest point in Malta is Ta' Dmejrek, at 253 m (830 ft), near Dingli. Although there are some small rivers at times of high rainfall, there are no permanent rivers or lakes on Malta. However, some watercourses have fresh water running all year round at Baħrija near Ras ir-Raħeb, at l-Imtaħleb and San Martin, and at Lunzjata Valley in Gozo.\n\n\nPhytogeographically, Malta belongs to the Liguro-Tyrrhenian province of the Mediterranean Region within the Boreal Kingdom.

Under its 1964 constitution, Malta initially retained Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Malta and thus head of state, with a governor-general exercising executive authority on her behalf. In 1971, the Malta Labour Party led by Dom Mintoff won the general elections, resulting in Malta declaring itself a republic on 13 December 1974 (Republic Day) within the Commonwealth. A defence agreement was signed soon after independence, and after being re-negotiated in 1972, expired on 31 March 1979 (Freedom Day).[120] Upon its expiry, the British base closed and lands formerly controlled by the British were given to the Maltese government.[121]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n174. **^** Lin, David; Hanscom, Laurel; Murthy, Adeline; Galli, Alessandro; Evans, Mikel; Neill, Evan; Mancini, MariaSerena; Martindill, Jon; Medouar, FatimeZahra; Huang, Shiyu; Wackernagel, Mathis (2018). \"Ecological Footprint Accounting for Countries: Updates and Results of the National Footprint Accounts, 2012–2018\". *Resources*. **7** (3): 58. doi:10.3390/resources7030058.\n175. **^** \"Malta Post\". *privatisation.gov.mt*.

Subsequent writers like Ruzar Briffa and Karmenu Vassallo tried to estrange themselves from the rigidity of formal themes and versification.[249]\n\n\nThe next generation of writers, including Karl Schembri and Immanuel Mifsud, widened the tracks further, especially in prose and poetry.[250]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Community Security Initiative in Kyrgyzstan\n* Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMembers of the Commonwealth of Nations\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states(members) | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Australia\n* Bahamas\n* Bangladesh\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Botswana\n* Brunei\n* Cameroon\n* Canada\n* Cyprus\n* Dominica\n* Eswatini (Swaziland)\n* Fiji\n* Gabon\n* Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Grenada\n* Guyana\n* India\n* Jamaica\n* Kenya\n* Kiribati\n* Lesotho\n* Malawi\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Malta\n* Mauritius\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Nigeria\n* Pakistan\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Rwanda\n* Saint Kitts and Nevis\n* Saint Lucia\n* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n* Samoa\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Singapore\n* Solomon Islands\n* South Africa\n* Sri Lanka\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tonga\n* Trinidad and Tobago\n* Tuvalu\n* Uganda\n* United Kingdom\n* Vanuatu\n* Zambia\n |\n| Associated states | * Cook Islands\n* Niue\n |\n| Dependent territories | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n144. **^** Mannion, A.M.; Vogiatzakis, I.N.

Tourism generates a significant part of the GDP of Malta.\nMalta is classified as an advanced economy according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[170] Malta's major resources are limestone, a favourable geographic location and a productive labour force. Malta produces only about 20 percent of its food needs, has limited fresh water supplies because of the drought in the summer, and has no domestic energy sources, aside from the potential for solar energy from its plentiful sunlight. The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism.[171] Film production has contributed to the Maltese economy.[172]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe most widely read and financially the strongest newspapers are published by Allied Newspapers Ltd., mainly *The Times of Malta* (27 percent) and its Sunday edition *The Sunday Times of Malta* (51.6 percent).[*citation needed*] Due to bilingualism half of the newspapers are published in English and the other half in Maltese. The Sunday newspaper *It-Torċa* (\"The Torch\") published by a subsidiary of the General Workers' Union, is the widest Maltese language paper. Its sister paper, *L-Orizzont* (\"The Horizon\"), is the Maltese daily with the biggest circulation. There is a high number of daily or weekly newspapers—one for every 28,000 people. Advertising, sales, and subsidies are the three main methods of financing.[269]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n168. **^** Mifsud, Stephen (23 September 2002). \"Wild Plants of Malta and Gozo – Main Page\". *Maltawildplants.com*.

Subsequent writers like Ruzar Briffa and Karmenu Vassallo tried to estrange themselves from the rigidity of formal themes and versification.[249]\n\n\nThe next generation of writers, including Karl Schembri and Immanuel Mifsud, widened the tracks further, especially in prose and poetry.[250]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Community Security Initiative in Kyrgyzstan\n* Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMembers of the Commonwealth of Nations\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states(members) | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Australia\n* Bahamas\n* Bangladesh\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Botswana\n* Brunei\n* Cameroon\n* Canada\n* Cyprus\n* Dominica\n* Eswatini (Swaziland)\n* Fiji\n* Gabon\n* Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Grenada\n* Guyana\n* India\n* Jamaica\n* Kenya\n* Kiribati\n* Lesotho\n* Malawi\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Malta\n* Mauritius\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Nigeria\n* Pakistan\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Rwanda\n* Saint Kitts and Nevis\n* Saint Lucia\n* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n* Samoa\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Singapore\n* Solomon Islands\n* South Africa\n* Sri Lanka\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tonga\n* Trinidad and Tobago\n* Tuvalu\n* Uganda\n* United Kingdom\n* Vanuatu\n* Zambia\n |\n| Associated states | * Cook Islands\n* Niue\n |\n| Dependent territories | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n144. **^** Mannion, A.M.; Vogiatzakis, I.N.

Tourism generates a significant part of the GDP of Malta.\nMalta is classified as an advanced economy according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[170] Malta's major resources are limestone, a favourable geographic location and a productive labour force. Malta produces only about 20 percent of its food needs, has limited fresh water supplies because of the drought in the summer, and has no domestic energy sources, aside from the potential for solar energy from its plentiful sunlight. The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism.[171] Film production has contributed to the Maltese economy.[172]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe most widely read and financially the strongest newspapers are published by Allied Newspapers Ltd., mainly *The Times of Malta* (27 percent) and its Sunday edition *The Sunday Times of Malta* (51.6 percent).[*citation needed*] Due to bilingualism half of the newspapers are published in English and the other half in Maltese. The Sunday newspaper *It-Torċa* (\"The Torch\") published by a subsidiary of the General Workers' Union, is the widest Maltese language paper. Its sister paper, *L-Orizzont* (\"The Horizon\"), is the Maltese daily with the biggest circulation. There is a high number of daily or weekly newspapers—one for every 28,000 people. Advertising, sales, and subsidies are the three main methods of financing.[269]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n168. **^** Mifsud, Stephen (23 September 2002). \"Wild Plants of Malta and Gozo – Main Page\". *Maltawildplants.com*.

It is built on the land formerly occupied by the RAF Luqa air base. A heliport is also located there. The heliport in Gozo is at Xewkija. A former airfield at Ta' Qali houses a national park, stadium, the Crafts Village visitor attraction and the Malta Aviation Museum.\n\n\n\n![](image)An Air Malta Airbus A320\nThe national airline is Air Malta, which is based at Malta International Airport and operates services to 36 destinations in Europe and North Africa. The owners of Air Malta are the Government of Malta (98 percent) and private investors (2 percent). In June 2019, Ryanair has invested into a fully-fledged airline subsidiary, called Malta Air, operating a low-cost model. The Government of Malta holds one share in the airline.[241]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTraffic in Malta drives on the left. Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high, considering the very small size of the islands; it is the fourth-highest in the European Union. There were 182,254 registered cars in 1990, giving an automobile density of 577/km2 (1,494/sq mi).[231] Malta has 2,254 kilometres (1,401 miles) of road, 1,972 km (1,225 mi) (87.5 per cent) of which are paved (as of December 2003).[232]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maltese *Otokar* and *King Long* buses\nBuses (*xarabank* or *karozza tal-linja*) are the primary method of public transport, established in 1905.
