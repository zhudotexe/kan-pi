The rugged Karakoram, Kunlun and Tian Shan mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, as well as its western and southern regions. The Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract regions, both administered by China, are claimed by India.

Thus, the major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity and religious doctrinal differences that differentiate them politically from other Muslim minorities elsewhere in the country.[161]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP in billions of Yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 82\n |\n| 2000\n | 136\n |\n| 2005\n | 260\n |\n| 2010\n | 544\n |\n| 2015\n | 932\n |\n| 2020\n | 1,380\n |\n| Source:[163] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n☐ **Disputed areas claimed by Indiaand administered by China(see Sino-Indian border dispute)**\n |\n| Division code[132] | Division\n | Area in km2[133] | Population 2020 (XPCC data from 2010)[134][135] | Seat\n | Divisions[136] |\n| Districts | Counties | Aut. counties | CL cities |\n| 650000 | Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\n | 1,664,900.00 | 25,852,345 | Ürümqi city | 13 | 61 | 6 | 27\n |\n| 650100 | Ürümqi city\n | 13,787.90 | 4,054,369 | Tianshan District | 7 | 1 |  |  |\n| 650200 | Karamay city\n | 8,654.08 | 490,348 | Karamay District | 4 |  |  |  |\n| 650400 | Turpan city\n | 67,562.91 | 693,988 | Gaochang District | 1 | 2 |  |  |\n| 650500 | Hami city\n | 142,094.88 | 673,383 | Yizhou District | 1 |  | 1 | 1\n |\n| 652300 | Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture | 73,139.75 | 1,613,585 | Changji city |  | 4 | 1 | 2\n |\n| 652700 | Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture | 24,934.33 | 488,198 | Bole city |  | 2 |  | 2\n |\n| 652800 | Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture | 470,954.25 | 1,613,979 | Korla city |  | 7 | 1 | 1\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| – *Tacheng Prefecture* | 4.25 | **54.66** | 26.66 | 14.43\n |\n| – *Altay Prefecture* | 1.42 | 39.85 | **52.76** | 5.97\n |\n| Shihezi DACLC | 1.09 | **94.13** | 0.63 | 4.15\n |\n| Aral DACLC | 3.66 | **91.96** | < 0.005 | 4.38\n |\n| Tumushuke DACLC | **67.49** | 31.73 | < 0.005 | 0.78\n |\n| Wujiaqu DACLC | 0.05 | **96.29** | 0.10 | 3.55\n |\n| Tiemenguan DACLC | 0.07 | **95.96** | 0.00 | 3.97\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Does not include members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\n\n### Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 2,003.00 | 174,465 | *Jinxiu Subdistrict* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659004 | Wujiaqu city   (6th Division)\n | 742.00 | 90,205 | *Renmin Road Subdistrict* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659005 | Beitun city   (10th Division)\n | 910.50 | 86,300 | *Beitun Town* (Altay) |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659006 | Tiemenguan city   (2nd Division)\n | 590.27 | 50,000 | Xingjiang Road, 29th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659007 | Shuanghe city   (5th Division)\n | 742.18 | 53,800 | Hongxing No.2 Road, 89th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659008 | Kokdala city   (4th Division)\n | 979.71 | 75,000 | Xinfu Road, 66th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659009 | Kunyu city   (14th Division)\n | 687.13 | 45,200 | *Yuyuan Town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659010 | Huyanghe city   (7th Division)\n | 677.94 | 80,000 | *Gongqing town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659011 | Xinxing city   (13rd Division)\n |  |  | *Huangtian Town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659012 | Baiyang city   (9th Division)\n |  |  | *163rd Regiment of the 9th Division* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| Sub-provincial prefecture\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| #

Xinjiang borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and India's Leh district in Ladakh to the south, Qinghai and Gansu provinces to the east, Mongolia (Bayan-Ölgii, Govi-Altai and Khovd Provinces) to the east, Russia's Altai Republic to the north and Kazakhstan (Almaty and East Kazakhstan Regions), Kyrgyzstan (Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Osh Regions), Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, Afghanistan's Badakhshan Province and Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan to the west.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n136. **^** Ministry of Civil Affairs (August 2014). 中国民政统计年鉴2014 [*China Civil Affairs Statistics Yearbook 2014*] (in Simplified Chinese).

The territory came under the rule of the Qing dynasty in the 18th century, which was later replaced by the Republic of China. Since 1949 and the Chinese Civil War, it has been part of the People's Republic of China. In 1954, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) established the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) to strengthen border defense against the Soviet Union and promote the local economy by settling soldiers into the region.[20] In 1955, Xinjiang was administratively changed from a province into an autonomous region. In recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China's largest natural-gas-producing region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTarim basin is the largest oil and gas bearing area in the country with about 16 billion tonnes of oil and gas reserves discovered.[188] The area is still actively explored and in 2021, China National Petroleum Corporation found a new oil field reserve of 1 billion tons (about 907 million tonnes). That find is regarded as being the largest one in recent decades. As of 2021, the basin produces hydrocarbons at an annual rate of 2 million tons, up from 1.52 million tons from 2020.[189]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Dabei gas field and Dina-2 gas field\n\n### Foreign trade[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2000, Uyghurs were 45 percent of Xinjiang's population and 13 percent of Ürümqi's population. With nine percent of Xinjiang's population, Ürümqi accounts for 25 percent of the region's GDP; many rural Uyghurs have migrated to the city for work in its light, heavy and petrochemical industries.[100] Han in Xinjiang are older, better-educated and work in higher-paying professions than their Uyghur counterparts. Han are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to Ürümqi, while some Uyghurs cite legal trouble at home and family reasons for moving to the city.[101] Han and Uyghurs are equally represented in Ürümqi's floating population, which works primarily in commerce. Auto-segregation in the city is widespread in residential concentration, employment relationships and endogamy.[102] In 2010, Uyghurs were a majority in the Tarim Basin and a plurality in Xinjiang as a whole.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 12 | Hotan | 119,804 | 322,300 | *part of Hotan Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 13 | Altay | 112,711 | 190,064 | *part of Altay Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 14 | Turpan[ii] | 89,719 | 273,385 | 622,903 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 15 | Tacheng | 75,122 | 161,037 | *part of Tacheng Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 16 | Wujiaqu | 75,088 | 96,436 | 96,436 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 17 | Fukang | 67,598 | 165,006 | *part of Changji Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 18 | Aral | 65,175 | 158,593 | 158,593 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 19 | Artux | 58,427 | 240,368 | *part of Kizilsu Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Beitun[iii] | 57,889 | 57,889 | 57,889 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Kokdala[iv] | 57,537 | 57,537 | 57,537 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Shuanghe[v] | 53,565 | 53,565 | 53,565 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Korgas[vi] | 51,462 | 51,462 | *part of Ili Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Kunyu[vii] | 36,399 | 36,399 | 36,399 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 20 | Tumxuk | 34,808 | 135,727 | 135,727 | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Human Development Indices (5.0)- China\".

China's first border free trade zone (Horgos Free Trade Zone) was located at the Xinjiang-Kazakhstan border city of Horgos.[191] Horgos is the largest \"land port\" in China's western region and it has easy access to the Central Asian market.

Uyghur independence activists express concern over the Han population changing the Uyghur character of the region though the Han and Hui Chinese mostly live in Northern Xinjiang Dzungaria and are separated from areas of historic Uyghur dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (Southwestern Xinjiang), where Uyghurs account for about 90 percent of the population.[234]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Gao, Erqiang (高尔锵) (1996). 塔吉克汉词典 [*Tajik-Chinese Dictionary*] (in Simplified Chinese).

Being the largest province-level division of China by area and the 8th-largest country subdivision in the world, Xinjiang spans over 1.6 million square kilometres (620,000 sq mi) and has about 25 million inhabitants.[1][12] Xinjiang borders the countries of Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. The rugged Karakoram, Kunlun and Tian Shan mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, as well as its western and southern regions. The Aksai Chin and Trans-Karakoram Tract regions, both administered by China, are claimed by India. Xinjiang also borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and the provinces of Gansu and Qinghai. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Major ethnic groups in Xinjiang by region (2018 data)[I]P = Prefecture; AP = Autonomous prefecture; PLC = Prefecture-level city; DACLC = Directly administered county-level city.[236] |\n| --- |\n|  | Uyghurs (%) | Han (%) | Kazakhs (%) | others (%) |\n| **Xinjiang** | **51.14** | **34.41** | **6.90** | **7.55** |\n| Ürümqi PLC | 12.85 | **71.21** | 2.77 | 13.16\n |\n| Karamay PLC | 15.59 | **74.67** | 4.05 | 5.69\n |\n| Turpan Prefecture | **76.96** | 16.84 | 0.05 | 6.15\n |\n| Kumul Prefecture | 20.01 | **65.49** | 10.04 | 4.46\n |\n| Changji AP | 4.89 | **72.28** | 10.34 | 12.49\n |\n| Bortala AP | 14.76 | **63.27** | 10.41 | 11.56\n |\n| Bayin'gholin AP | 36.38 | **53.31** | 0.11 | 10.20\n |\n| Aksu Prefecture | **80.08** | 18.56 | 0.01 | 1.36\n |\n| Kizilsu AP | **66.24** | 6.29 | 0.03 | 27.44\n |\n| Kashgar Prefecture | **92.56** | 6.01 | < 0.005 | 1.42\n |\n| Khotan Prefecture | **96.96** | 2.85 | < 0.005 | 0.19\n |\n| Ili AP[n 3] | 17.95 | 40.09 | 27.16 | 14.80\n |\n| – *former Ili Prefecture* | 26.30 | 35.21 | 21.57 | 16.91\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n132. **^** Ministry of Civil Affairs. 2014年12月中华人民共和国县以上行政区划代码 [Administrative code of the county or above in the People's Republic of China in December 2014] (in Simplified Chinese).

Religiously, the most Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow Islam; in the rest of China, many are Buddhist, Taoist and Confucian, although many follow Islam as well, such as the Hui ethnic subgroup of the Han ethnicity, comprising some 10 million people. Thus, the major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity and religious doctrinal differences that differentiate them politically from other Muslim minorities elsewhere in the country.[161]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Development of GDP\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | GDP in billions of Yuan\n |\n| 1995\n | 82\n |\n| 2000\n | 136\n |\n| 2005\n | 260\n |\n| 2010\n | 544\n |\n| 2015\n | 932\n |\n| 2020\n | 1,380\n |\n| Source:[163] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n☐ **Disputed areas claimed by Indiaand administered by China(see Sino-Indian border dispute)**\n |\n| Division code[132] | Division\n | Area in km2[133] | Population 2020 (XPCC data from 2010)[134][135] | Seat\n | Divisions[136] |\n| Districts | Counties | Aut. counties | CL cities |\n| 650000 | Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region\n | 1,664,900.00 | 25,852,345 | Ürümqi city | 13 | 61 | 6 | 27\n |\n| 650100 | Ürümqi city\n | 13,787.90 | 4,054,369 | Tianshan District | 7 | 1 |  |  |\n| 650200 | Karamay city\n | 8,654.08 | 490,348 | Karamay District | 4 |  |  |  |\n| 650400 | Turpan city\n | 67,562.91 | 693,988 | Gaochang District | 1 | 2 |  |  |\n| 650500 | Hami city\n | 142,094.88 | 673,383 | Yizhou District | 1 |  | 1 | 1\n |\n| 652300 | Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture | 73,139.75 | 1,613,585 | Changji city |  | 4 | 1 | 2\n |\n| 652700 | Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture | 24,934.33 | 488,198 | Bole city |  | 2 |  | 2\n |\n| 652800 | Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture | 470,954.25 | 1,613,979 | Korla city |  | 7 | 1 | 1\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| – *Tacheng Prefecture* | 4.25 | **54.66** | 26.66 | 14.43\n |\n| – *Altay Prefecture* | 1.42 | 39.85 | **52.76** | 5.97\n |\n| Shihezi DACLC | 1.09 | **94.13** | 0.63 | 4.15\n |\n| Aral DACLC | 3.66 | **91.96** | < 0.005 | 4.38\n |\n| Tumushuke DACLC | **67.49** | 31.73 | < 0.005 | 0.78\n |\n| Wujiaqu DACLC | 0.05 | **96.29** | 0.10 | 3.55\n |\n| Tiemenguan DACLC | 0.07 | **95.96** | 0.00 | 3.97\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Does not include members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\n\n### Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 2,003.00 | 174,465 | *Jinxiu Subdistrict* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659004 | Wujiaqu city   (6th Division)\n | 742.00 | 90,205 | *Renmin Road Subdistrict* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659005 | Beitun city   (10th Division)\n | 910.50 | 86,300 | *Beitun Town* (Altay) |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659006 | Tiemenguan city   (2nd Division)\n | 590.27 | 50,000 | Xingjiang Road, 29th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659007 | Shuanghe city   (5th Division)\n | 742.18 | 53,800 | Hongxing No.2 Road, 89th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659008 | Kokdala city   (4th Division)\n | 979.71 | 75,000 | Xinfu Road, 66th Regiment |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659009 | Kunyu city   (14th Division)\n | 687.13 | 45,200 | *Yuyuan Town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659010 | Huyanghe city   (7th Division)\n | 677.94 | 80,000 | *Gongqing town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659011 | Xinxing city   (13rd Division)\n |  |  | *Huangtian Town* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| 659012 | Baiyang city   (9th Division)\n |  |  | *163rd Regiment of the 9th Division* |  |  |  | 1\n |\n| Sub-provincial prefecture\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| #

Xinjiang borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and India's Leh district in Ladakh to the south, Qinghai and Gansu provinces to the east, Mongolia (Bayan-Ölgii, Govi-Altai and Khovd Provinces) to the east, Russia's Altai Republic to the north and Kazakhstan (Almaty and East Kazakhstan Regions), Kyrgyzstan (Issyk-Kul, Naryn and Osh Regions), Tajikistan's Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region, Afghanistan's Badakhshan Province and Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan to the west.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n136. **^** Ministry of Civil Affairs (August 2014). 中国民政统计年鉴2014 [*China Civil Affairs Statistics Yearbook 2014*] (in Simplified Chinese).

The territory came under the rule of the Qing dynasty in the 18th century, which was later replaced by the Republic of China. Since 1949 and the Chinese Civil War, it has been part of the People's Republic of China. In 1954, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) established the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) to strengthen border defense against the Soviet Union and promote the local economy by settling soldiers into the region.[20] In 1955, Xinjiang was administratively changed from a province into an autonomous region. In recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China's largest natural-gas-producing region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTarim basin is the largest oil and gas bearing area in the country with about 16 billion tonnes of oil and gas reserves discovered.[188] The area is still actively explored and in 2021, China National Petroleum Corporation found a new oil field reserve of 1 billion tons (about 907 million tonnes). That find is regarded as being the largest one in recent decades. As of 2021, the basin produces hydrocarbons at an annual rate of 2 million tons, up from 1.52 million tons from 2020.[189]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Dabei gas field and Dina-2 gas field\n\n### Foreign trade[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2000, Uyghurs were 45 percent of Xinjiang's population and 13 percent of Ürümqi's population. With nine percent of Xinjiang's population, Ürümqi accounts for 25 percent of the region's GDP; many rural Uyghurs have migrated to the city for work in its light, heavy and petrochemical industries.[100] Han in Xinjiang are older, better-educated and work in higher-paying professions than their Uyghur counterparts. Han are more likely to cite business reasons for moving to Ürümqi, while some Uyghurs cite legal trouble at home and family reasons for moving to the city.[101] Han and Uyghurs are equally represented in Ürümqi's floating population, which works primarily in commerce. Auto-segregation in the city is widespread in residential concentration, employment relationships and endogamy.[102] In 2010, Uyghurs were a majority in the Tarim Basin and a plurality in Xinjiang as a whole.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 12 | Hotan | 119,804 | 322,300 | *part of Hotan Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 13 | Altay | 112,711 | 190,064 | *part of Altay Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 14 | Turpan[ii] | 89,719 | 273,385 | 622,903 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 15 | Tacheng | 75,122 | 161,037 | *part of Tacheng Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 16 | Wujiaqu | 75,088 | 96,436 | 96,436 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 17 | Fukang | 67,598 | 165,006 | *part of Changji Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 18 | Aral | 65,175 | 158,593 | 158,593 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 19 | Artux | 58,427 | 240,368 | *part of Kizilsu Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Beitun[iii] | 57,889 | 57,889 | 57,889 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Kokdala[iv] | 57,537 | 57,537 | 57,537 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Shuanghe[v] | 53,565 | 53,565 | 53,565 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Korgas[vi] | 51,462 | 51,462 | *part of Ili Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (–) | Kunyu[vii] | 36,399 | 36,399 | 36,399 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 20 | Tumxuk | 34,808 | 135,727 | 135,727 | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Human Development Indices (5.0)- China\".

Ten of the county-level cities do not belong to any prefecture and are *de facto* administered by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC).

China's first border free trade zone (Horgos Free Trade Zone) was located at the Xinjiang-Kazakhstan border city of Horgos.[191] Horgos is the largest \"land port\" in China's western region and it has easy access to the Central Asian market. Xinjiang also opened its second border trade market to Kazakhstan in March 2006, the Jeminay Border Trade Zone.[192]\n\n\n\n### Economic and Technological Development Zones[edit]\n\n\n* Bole Border Economic Cooperation Area[193]\n* Shihezi Border Economic Cooperation Area[194]\n* Tacheng Border Economic Cooperation Area[195]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe oil and gas extraction industry in Aksu and Karamay is growing, with the West–East Gas Pipeline linking to Shanghai. The oil and petrochemical sector get up to 60 percent of Xinjiang's economy.[184] The region contains over a fifth of China's hydrocarbon resources and has the highest concentration of fossil fuel reserves of any region in the country.[185] The region is rich in coal and contains 40 percent of the country's coal reserves or around 2.2 trillion tonnes, which is enough to supply China's thermal coal demand for more than 100 years even if only 15 percent of the estimated coal reserve prove recoverable.[186][187]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Administrative divisions in Uyghur, Chinese and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English | Uyghur | SASM/GNC Uyghur Pinyin | Chinese | Pinyin\n |\n| **Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region** | شىنجاڭ ئۇيغۇر ئاپتونوم رايونى‎ | **Xinjang Uyĝur Aptonom Rayoni** | 新疆维吾尔自治区 | **Xīnjiāng Wéiwú'ěr Zìzhìqū** |\n| Ürümqi city | ئۈرۈمچى شەھىرى‎ | Ürümqi Xäĥiri | 乌鲁木齐市 | Wūlǔmùqí Shì\n |\n| Karamay city | قاراماي شەھىرى‎ | K̂aramay Xäĥiri | 克拉玛依市 | Kèlāmǎyī Shì\n |\n| Turpan city | تۇرپان شەھىرى‎ | Turpan Xäĥiri | 吐鲁番市 | Tǔlǔfān Shì\n |\n| Hami city | قۇمۇل شەھىرى‎ | K̂umul Xäĥiri | 哈密市 | Hāmì Shì\n |\n| Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture | سانجى خۇيزۇ ئاپتونوم ئوبلاستى‎ | Sanji Huyzu Aptonom Oblasti | 昌吉回族自治州 | Chāngjí Huízú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture | بۆرتالا موڭغۇل ئاپتونوم ئوبلاستى‎ | Börtala Mongĝul Aptonom Oblasti | 博尔塔拉蒙古自治州 | Bó'ěrtǎlā Měnggǔ Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ili Kazakh | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Yining city\n* Korgas city\n* Kuytun city\n* Yining County\n* Huocheng County\n* Gongliu County\n* Xinyuan County\n* Zhaosu County\n* Tekes County\n* Nilka County\n* Qapqal Xibe County\n |\n| Tacheng1 | * Tacheng city\n* Usu city\n* Shawan city\n* Emin County\n* Yumin County\n* Toli County\n* Hoboksar Mongol County\n |\n| Altay1 | * Altay city\n* Qinghe County\n* Jeminay County\n* Fuyun County\n* Burqin County\n* Fuhai County\n* Habahe County\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Prefectures | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain area is of irrigated agriculture. By 2015, the agricultural land area of the region is 631 thousand km2 or 63.1 million ha, of which 6.1 million ha is arable land.[172] In 2016, the total cultivated land rose to 6.2 million ha, with the crop production reaching 15.1 million tons.[173] Agriculture in Xinjiang is dominated by the XPCC, which employs a majority of the organization's workforce.[174] Wheat was the main staple crop of the region, maize grown as well, millet found in the south, while only a few areas (in particular, Aksu) grew rice.[175]\n\n\nCotton became an important crop in several oases, notably Hotan, Yarkand and Turpan by the late 19th century.[175] Sericulture is also practiced.[176] The Xinjiang cotton industry is the world's largest cotton exporter, producing 84 percent of Chinese cotton while the country provides 26 percent of global cotton export.[177] Xinjiang also produces peppers and pepper pigments used in cosmetics such lipstick for export.[178]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n158. **^** Zhu, Yuchao; Blachford, Dongyan (31 August 2006). \"China's Fate as a Multinational State: a preliminary assessment\". *Journal of Contemporary China*. **15** (47): 329–348. doi:10.1080/10670560500535043.

Uyghur independence activists express concern over the Han population changing the Uyghur character of the region though the Han and Hui Chinese mostly live in Northern Xinjiang Dzungaria and are separated from areas of historic Uyghur dominance south of the Tian Shan mountains (Southwestern Xinjiang), where Uyghurs account for about 90 percent of the population.[234]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Gao, Erqiang (高尔锵) (1996). 塔吉克汉词典 [*Tajik-Chinese Dictionary*] (in Simplified Chinese).

Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping made a nine-day visit to Xinjiang in 1981 and described the region as \"unsteady\".[97] The Deng era reforms encouraged China's ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs, to establish small private companies for commodity transit, retail, and restaurants.[98] A brisk cross-border shuttle trade by Uyghurs further developed following the Soviet Union's perestroika.[98]\n\n\nIncreased ethnic contact and labor competition coincided with Uyghur terrorism since the 1990s, such as the 1997 Ürümqi bus bombings.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n190. **^** Zhao, Huasheng (2016). \"Central Asia in Chinese Strategic Thinking\". *The new great game : China and South and Central Asia in the era of reform*.

Tibet is ranked the lowest among China's 31 provinces[80] on the Human Development Index according to UN Development Programme data.[81] In recent years, due to increased interest in Tibetan Buddhism, tourism has become an increasingly important sector, and is actively promoted by the authorities.[82] Tourism brings in the most income from the sale of handicrafts. These include Tibetan hats, jewelry (silver and gold), wooden items, clothing, quilts, fabrics, Tibetan rugs and carpets. The Central People's Government exempts Tibet from all taxation and provides 90% of Tibet's government expenditures.[83][84][85][86] However, most of this investment goes to pay migrant workers who do not settle in Tibet and send much of their income home to other provinces.[87]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom January 18–20, 2010, a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a plan to improve development of the areas was announced. The conference was attended by General secretary Hu Jintao, Wu Bangguo, Wen Jiabao, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang, all members of Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The plan called for improvement of rural Tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural Tibetan children. China has invested 310 billion yuan (about 45.6 billion U.S. dollars) in Tibet since 2001.[95][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Development zone\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the growth of tourism in recent years, the service sector has become the largest sector in Tibet, accounting for 50.1% of the local GDP in 2020.[11] The dominant religion in Tibet is Tibetan Buddhism; other religions include Bön, an indigenous religion similar to Tibetan Buddhism,[12] Islam, and Christianity. Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the art, music, and festivals of the region. Tibetan architecture reflects Chinese and Indian influences. Staple foods in Tibet are roasted barley, yak meat, and butter tea.\n\n\n\n\n## Names\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Map of the approximate extent of the three provinces, Ü-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham, of the Tibetan Empire (8th century) overlaid on a map of modern borders\nMain article: Definitions of Tibet\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Pastoral nomads constitute about 40% of the ethnic Tibetan population.[88]\nForty percent of the rural cash income in the Tibet Autonomous Region is derived from the harvesting of the fungus *Ophiocordyceps sinensis* (formerly *Cordyceps sinensis*); contributing at least 1.8 billion yuan, (US$225 million) to the region's GDP.[89]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tromzikhang market in Lhasa\nThe Qingzang railway linking the Tibet Autonomous Region to Qinghai Province was opened in 2006, but it was controversial.[90][91][92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2007, the Chinese government issued a report outlining the discovery of a large mineral deposit under the Tibetan Plateau.[93] The deposit has an estimated value of $128 billion and may double Chinese reserves of zinc, copper, and lead. The Chinese government sees this as a way to alleviate the nation's dependence on foreign mineral imports for its growing economy. However, critics worry that mining these vast resources will harm Tibet's fragile ecosystem and undermine Tibetan culture.[93]\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, China announced the construction of Tibet's first expressway, the Lhasa Airport Expressway, a 37.9 km (23.5 mi) stretch of controlled-access highway in southwestern Lhasa. The project will cost 1.55 billion yuan (US$227 million).[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe central region of Tibet is now an autonomous region within China, the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People's Republic of China. It is governed by a People's Government, led by a chairman. In practice, however, the chairman is subordinate to the branch secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In 2010 it was reported that, as a matter of convention, the chairman had almost always been an ethnic Tibetan, while the party secretary had always been ethnically non-Tibetan.[65]\n\n\n\n## Geography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Geography of Tibet\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n82. **^** \"China TIBET Tourism Bureau\".

Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as *Zang* (Chinese: 藏; pinyin: *Zàng*), although the geographical term *Xīzàng* is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region. The term *Xīzàng* was coined during the Qing dynasty in the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor (1796–1820) through the addition of the prefix *xī* (西, 'west') to *Zang*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the Xinhai Revolution against the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qing soldiers were disarmed and escorted out of the Tibet Area (Ü-Tsang). The region subsequently declared its independence in 1913, although this was not recognised by the subsequent Chinese Republican government.[5] Later, Lhasa took control of the western part of Xikang. The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following the Battle of Chamdo, Tibet was occupied and annexed by the People's Republic of China. The Tibetan government was abolished after the failure of the 1959 Tibetan uprising.[6] Today, China governs western and central Tibet as the Tibet Autonomous Region while the eastern areas are now mostly autonomous prefectures within Sichuan, Qinghai and other neighbouring provinces. The Tibetan independence movement[7] is principally led by the Tibetan diaspora.[8]\nHuman rights groups have accused the Chinese government of abuses of human rights in Tibet, including torture.[9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Tibet** (/tɪˈbɛt/ ⓘ; Tibetan: བོད་, Lhasa dialect: [pʰøː˨˧˩] *Böd*; Chinese: 西藏; pinyin: *Xīzàng*) is a region in the central part of East Asia, covering much of the Tibetan Plateau and spanning about 2,500,000 km2 (970,000 sq mi).

Mongol rule of Tibet remained separate from the main provinces of China, but the region existed under the administration of the Yuan dynasty.

The government halted reforms and started an anti-separatist campaign.[64] Human rights organisations have been critical of the Beijing and Lhasa governments' approach to human rights in the region when cracking down on separatist convulsions that have occurred around monasteries and cities, most recently in the 2008 Tibetan unrest.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen in the 1930s and 1940s the regents displayed negligence in affairs, the Kuomintang Government of the Republic of China took advantage of this to expand its reach into the territory.[55] On December 20, 1941, Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-Shek noted in his diary that Tibet would be among the territories which he would demand as restitution for China following the conclusion of World War II.[56]\n\n\n\n### From 1950 to present\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Tibet (1950–present)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Sus scrofa* expanded from its origin in southeast Asia into the Plateau, acquiring and fixing adaptive alleles for the high-altitude environment.[77] The forests of Tibet are home to black bears, red pandas, musk deer, barking deer, and squirrels.

This existed as a \"diarchic structure\" under the Yuan emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols.[32] Mongolian prince Khuden gained temporal power in Tibet in the 1240s and sponsored Sakya Pandita, whose seat became the capital of Tibet. Drogön Chögyal Phagpa, Sakya Pandita's nephew became Imperial Preceptor of Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty.\n\n\nYuan control over the region ended with the Ming overthrow of the Yuan and Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen's revolt against the Mongols.[34] Following the uprising, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen founded the Phagmodrupa dynasty, and sought to reduce Yuan influences over Tibetan culture and politics.[35]\n\n\n\n### Phagmodrupa, Rinpungpa and Tsangpa dynasties\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Phagmodrupa dynasty, Rinpungpa, and Tsangpa\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1877, the Protestant James Cameron from the China Inland Mission walked from Chongqing to Batang in Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan province, and \"brought the Gospel to the Tibetan people.\" Beginning in the 20th century, in Dêqên Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, a large number of Lisu people and some Yi and Nu people converted to Christianity. Famous earlier missionaries include James O. Fraser, Alfred James Broomhall and Isobel Kuhn of the China Inland Mission, among others who were active in this area.[124][125]\n\n\nProselytising has been illegal in China since 1949. But as of 2013[update], many Christian missionaries were reported to be active in Tibet with the tacit approval of Chinese authorities, who view the missionaries as a counterforce to Tibetan Buddhism or as a boon to the local economy.[126]\n\n\n\n#### Islam\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Islam in Tibet\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1834, the Sikh Empire invaded and annexed Ladakh, a culturally Tibetan region that was an independent kingdom at the time.

At its height in the 9th century, the Tibetan Empire extended far beyond the Tibetan Plateau, from the Tarim Basin and Pamirs in the west, to Yunnan and Bengal in the southeast. It then divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations. The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling under Chinese rule; most of this area was eventually annexed into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general Gao Xianzhi, who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir. By 750, the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the Chinese. However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the Arabs and Qarluqs at the Battle of Talas (751) and the subsequent civil war known as the An Lushan Rebellion (755), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence resumed.\n\n\nAt its height in the 780s to 790s, the Tibetan Empire reached its highest glory when it ruled and controlled a territory stretching from modern-day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, China, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe most important crop in Tibet is barley, and dough made from barley flour—called tsampa—is the staple food of Tibet. This is either rolled into noodles or made into steamed dumplings called momos. Meat dishes are likely to be yak, goat, or mutton, often dried, or cooked into a spicy stew with potatoes. Mustard seed is cultivated in Tibet, and therefore features heavily in its cuisine. Yak yogurt, butter and cheese are frequently eaten, and well-prepared yogurt is considered something of a prestige item. Butter tea is a very popular drink.\n\n\n\n![](image)Thukpa with Momo – Tibetan Style\n### Sports\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Traditional games of Tibet\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n\n\n* Index of Tibet-related articles\n* List of Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Tibet\n* Outline of Tibet\n* Sinicization of Tibet\n* Chinese Settlements in Tibet\n* Free Tibet\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n### Citations\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Zhao, M; Kong, QP; Wang, HW; Peng, MS; Xie, XD; Wang, WZ; Jiayang, Duan JG; Cai, MC; Zhao, SN; Cidanpingcuo, Tu YQ; Wu, SF; Yao, YG; Bandelt, HJ; Zhang, YP (2009). \"Mitochondrial genome evidence reveals successful Late Paleolithic settlement on the Tibetan Plateau\". *Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A*. **106** (50): 21230–21235.

In general, the dialects of central Tibet (including Lhasa), Kham, Amdo and some smaller nearby areas are considered Tibetan dialects. Other forms, particularly Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Sherpa, and Ladakhi, are considered by their speakers, largely for political reasons, to be separate languages. However, if the latter group of Tibetan-type languages are included in the calculation, then 'greater Tibetan' is spoken by approximately 6 million people across the Tibetan Plateau.

He also brought in many reforms, and Tibetan power spread rapidly, creating a large and powerful empire. It is traditionally considered that his first wife was the Princess of Nepal, Bhrikuti, and that she played a great role in the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet.

Amdo came under Qing control in 1724, and eastern Kham was incorporated into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728.[37] Meanwhile, the Qing government sent resident commissioners called *Ambans* to Lhasa. In 1750, the Ambans and the majority of the Han Chinese and Manchus living in Lhasa were killed in a riot, and Qing troops arrived quickly and suppressed the rebels in the next year. Like the preceding Yuan dynasty, the Manchus of the Qing dynasty exerted military and administrative control of the region, while granting it a degree of political autonomy. The Qing commander publicly executed a number of supporters of the rebels and, as in 1723 and 1728, made changes in the political structure and drew up a formal organization plan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Beckwith, Christopher I. *The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia: A History of the Struggle for Great Power among Tibetans, Turks, Arabs, and Chinese during the Early Middle Ages'* (1987) Princeton University Press.

Although the expedition initially set out with the stated purpose of resolving border disputes between Tibet and Sikkim, it quickly turned into a military invasion. The British expeditionary force, consisting of mostly Indian troops, quickly invaded and captured Lhasa, with the Dalai Lama fleeing to the countryside.[49] Afterwards, the leader of the expedition, Sir Francis Younghusband, negotiated the Convention Between Great Britain and Tibet with the Tibetans, which guaranteed the British great economic influence but ensured the region remained under Chinese control. The Qing imperial resident, known as the Amban, publicly repudiated the treaty, while the British government, eager for friendly relations with China, negotiated a new treaty two years later known as the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** Lettera del P.

However, internal strife within the dynasty and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435.

Tibet is ranked the lowest among China's 31 provinces[80] on the Human Development Index according to UN Development Programme data.[81] In recent years, due to increased interest in Tibetan Buddhism, tourism has become an increasingly important sector, and is actively promoted by the authorities.[82] Tourism brings in the most income from the sale of handicrafts. These include Tibetan hats, jewelry (silver and gold), wooden items, clothing, quilts, fabrics, Tibetan rugs and carpets. The Central People's Government exempts Tibet from all taxation and provides 90% of Tibet's government expenditures.[83][84][85][86] However, most of this investment goes to pay migrant workers who do not settle in Tibet and send much of their income home to other provinces.[87]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom January 18–20, 2010, a national conference on Tibet and areas inhabited by Tibetans in Sichuan, Yunnan, Gansu and Qinghai was held in China and a plan to improve development of the areas was announced. The conference was attended by General secretary Hu Jintao, Wu Bangguo, Wen Jiabao, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang, all members of Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The plan called for improvement of rural Tibetan income to national standards by 2020 and free education for all rural Tibetan children.

Tibetan Buddhism is a primary influence on the art, music, and festivals of the region. Tibetan architecture reflects Chinese and Indian influences. Staple foods in Tibet are roasted barley, yak meat, and butter tea.\n\n\n\n\n## Names\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Map of the approximate extent of the three provinces, Ü-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham, of the Tibetan Empire (8th century) overlaid on a map of modern borders\nMain article: Definitions of Tibet\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Pastoral nomads constitute about 40% of the ethnic Tibetan population.[88]\nForty percent of the rural cash income in the Tibet Autonomous Region is derived from the harvesting of the fungus *Ophiocordyceps sinensis* (formerly *Cordyceps sinensis*); contributing at least 1.8 billion yuan, (US$225 million) to the region's GDP.[89]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tromzikhang market in Lhasa\nThe Qingzang railway linking the Tibet Autonomous Region to Qinghai Province was opened in 2006, but it was controversial.[90][91][92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2007, the Chinese government issued a report outlining the discovery of a large mineral deposit under the Tibetan Plateau.[93] The deposit has an estimated value of $128 billion and may double Chinese reserves of zinc, copper, and lead. The Chinese government sees this as a way to alleviate the nation's dependence on foreign mineral imports for its growing economy. However, critics worry that mining these vast resources will harm Tibet's fragile ecosystem and undermine Tibetan culture.[93]\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, China announced the construction of Tibet's first expressway, the Lhasa Airport Expressway, a 37.9 km (23.5 mi) stretch of controlled-access highway in southwestern Lhasa. The project will cost 1.55 billion yuan (US$227 million).[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe central region of Tibet is now an autonomous region within China, the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People's Republic of China. It is governed by a People's Government, led by a chairman. In practice, however, the chairman is subordinate to the branch secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In 2010 it was reported that, as a matter of convention, the chairman had almost always been an ethnic Tibetan, while the party secretary had always been ethnically non-Tibetan.[65]\n\n\n\n## Geography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Geography of Tibet\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n82. **^** \"China TIBET Tourism Bureau\".

Tibetan people, language, and culture, regardless of where they are from, are referred to as *Zang* (Chinese: 藏; pinyin: *Zàng*), although the geographical term *Xīzàng* is often limited to the Tibet Autonomous Region.

The region maintained its autonomy until 1951 when, following the Battle of Chamdo, Tibet was occupied and annexed by the People's Republic of China. The Tibetan government was abolished after the failure of the 1959 Tibetan uprising.[6] Today, China governs western and central Tibet as the Tibet Autonomous Region while the eastern areas are now mostly autonomous prefectures within Sichuan, Qinghai and other neighbouring provinces.

Mongol rule of Tibet remained separate from the main provinces of China, but the region existed under the administration of the Yuan dynasty.

The government halted reforms and started an anti-separatist campaign.[64] Human rights organisations have been critical of the Beijing and Lhasa governments' approach to human rights in the region when cracking down on separatist convulsions that have occurred around monasteries and cities, most recently in the 2008 Tibetan unrest.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen in the 1930s and 1940s the regents displayed negligence in affairs, the Kuomintang Government of the Republic of China took advantage of this to expand its reach into the territory.[55] On December 20, 1941, Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-Shek noted in his diary that Tibet would be among the territories which he would demand as restitution for China following the conclusion of World War II.[56]\n\n\n\n### From 1950 to present\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Tibet (1950–present)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Sus scrofa* expanded from its origin in southeast Asia into the Plateau, acquiring and fixing adaptive alleles for the high-altitude environment.[77] The forests of Tibet are home to black bears, red pandas, musk deer, barking deer, and squirrels. Monkeys such as rhesus macaques and langurs live in the warmer forest zones. Tibetan antelopes, gazelles, and kiangs gaze on the grasslands of the Tibetan plateau. There are more than 500 bird species in Tibet. Because of the high altitude and harsh climate, there are few insects in Tibet.[78]\n\n\nSnow leopards are hunted for their fur and the eggs of black-necked cranes have been collected as a delicacy food.\n\n\n\n### Regions\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTibet retained nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative[33] rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. This existed as a \"diarchic structure\" under the Yuan emperor, with power primarily in favor of the Mongols.[32] Mongolian prince Khuden gained temporal power in Tibet in the 1240s and sponsored Sakya Pandita, whose seat became the capital of Tibet. Drogön Chögyal Phagpa, Sakya Pandita's nephew became Imperial Preceptor of Kublai Khan, founder of the Yuan dynasty.\n\n\nYuan control over the region ended with the Ming overthrow of the Yuan and Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen's revolt against the Mongols.[34] Following the uprising, Tai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen founded the Phagmodrupa dynasty, and sought to reduce Yuan influences over Tibetan culture and politics.[35]\n\n\n\n### Phagmodrupa, Rinpungpa and Tsangpa dynasties\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Phagmodrupa dynasty, Rinpungpa, and Tsangpa\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1877, the Protestant James Cameron from the China Inland Mission walked from Chongqing to Batang in Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan province, and \"brought the Gospel to the Tibetan people.\" Beginning in the 20th century, in Dêqên Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan, a large number of Lisu people and some Yi and Nu people converted to Christianity. Famous earlier missionaries include James O. Fraser, Alfred James Broomhall and Isobel Kuhn of the China Inland Mission, among others who were active in this area.[124][125]\n\n\nProselytising has been illegal in China since 1949. But as of 2013[update], many Christian missionaries were reported to be active in Tibet with the tacit approval of Chinese authorities, who view the missionaries as a counterforce to Tibetan Buddhism or as a boon to the local economy.[126]\n\n\n\n#### Islam\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Islam in Tibet\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1834, the Sikh Empire invaded and annexed Ladakh, a culturally Tibetan region that was an independent kingdom at the time. Seven years later, a Sikh army led by General Zorawar Singh invaded western Tibet from Ladakh, starting the Sino-Sikh War. A Qing-Tibetan army repelled the invaders but was in turn defeated when it chased the Sikhs into Ladakh. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Chushul between the Chinese and Sikh empires.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Putuo Zongcheng Temple, a Buddhist temple complex in Chengde, Hebei, built between 1767 and 1771.

Qing authority over Tibet had become more symbolic than real by the late 19th century,[43][44][45][46] although in the 1860s, the Tibetans still chose for reasons of their own to emphasize the empire's symbolic authority and make it seem substantial.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** Haarh, Erik: *Extract from \"The Yar Lun Dynasty\"*, in: *The History of Tibet*, ed.

At its height in the 9th century, the Tibetan Empire extended far beyond the Tibetan Plateau, from the Tarim Basin and Pamirs in the west, to Yunnan and Bengal in the southeast. It then divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations. The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling under Chinese rule; most of this area was eventually annexed into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai. The current borders of Tibet were generally established in the 18th century.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 747, the hold of Tibet was loosened by the campaign of general Gao Xianzhi, who tried to re-open the direct communications between Central Asia and Kashmir. By 750, the Tibetans had lost almost all of their central Asian possessions to the Chinese. However, after Gao Xianzhi's defeat by the Arabs and Qarluqs at the Battle of Talas (751) and the subsequent civil war known as the An Lushan Rebellion (755), Chinese influence decreased rapidly and Tibetan influence resumed.\n\n\nAt its height in the 780s to 790s, the Tibetan Empire reached its highest glory when it ruled and controlled a territory stretching from modern-day Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burma, China, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe most important crop in Tibet is barley, and dough made from barley flour—called tsampa—is the staple food of Tibet. This is either rolled into noodles or made into steamed dumplings called momos. Meat dishes are likely to be yak, goat, or mutton, often dried, or cooked into a spicy stew with potatoes.

It is employed throughout the Tibetan plateau and Bhutan and is also spoken in parts of Nepal and northern India, such as Sikkim. In general, the dialects of central Tibet (including Lhasa), Kham, Amdo and some smaller nearby areas are considered Tibetan dialects. Other forms, particularly Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Sherpa, and Ladakhi, are considered by their speakers, largely for political reasons, to be separate languages. However, if the latter group of Tibetan-type languages are included in the calculation, then 'greater Tibetan' is spoken by approximately 6 million people across the Tibetan Plateau. Tibetan is also spoken by approximately 150,000 exile speakers who have fled from modern-day Tibet to India and other countries.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Zenz, Adrian (2014). *Tibetanness under Threat?

He also brought in many reforms, and Tibetan power spread rapidly, creating a large and powerful empire. It is traditionally considered that his first wife was the Princess of Nepal, Bhrikuti, and that she played a great role in the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet. In 640, he married Princess Wencheng, the niece of the Chinese emperor Taizong of Tang China.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe climate is severely dry nine months of the year, and average annual snowfall is only 46 cm (18 inches), due to the rain shadow effect.

During this time, Tibet fought Chinese warlords for control of the ethnically Tibetan areas in Xikang and Qinghai (parts of Kham and Amdo) along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.[53] In 1914, the Tibetan government signed the Simla Convention with Britain, which recognized Chinese suzerainty over Tibet in return for a border settlement.

Amdo came under Qing control in 1724, and eastern Kham was incorporated into neighbouring Chinese provinces in 1728.[37] Meanwhile, the Qing government sent resident commissioners called *Ambans* to Lhasa. In 1750, the Ambans and the majority of the Han Chinese and Manchus living in Lhasa were killed in a riot, and Qing troops arrived quickly and suppressed the rebels in the next year. Like the preceding Yuan dynasty, the Manchus of the Qing dynasty exerted military and administrative control of the region, while granting it a degree of political autonomy. The Qing commander publicly executed a number of supporters of the rebels and, as in 1723 and 1728, made changes in the political structure and drew up a formal organization plan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Beckwith, Christopher I. *The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia: A History of the Struggle for Great Power among Tibetans, Turks, Arabs, and Chinese during the Early Middle Ages'* (1987) Princeton University Press.

Although the expedition initially set out with the stated purpose of resolving border disputes between Tibet and Sikkim, it quickly turned into a military invasion. The British expeditionary force, consisting of mostly Indian troops, quickly invaded and captured Lhasa, with the Dalai Lama fleeing to the countryside.[49] Afterwards, the leader of the expedition, Sir Francis Younghusband, negotiated the Convention Between Great Britain and Tibet with the Tibetans, which guaranteed the British great economic influence but ensured the region remained under Chinese control. The Qing imperial resident, known as the Amban, publicly repudiated the treaty, while the British government, eager for friendly relations with China, negotiated a new treaty two years later known as the Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** Lettera del P.

Grouping these two together with other apparently related languages spoken in the Himalayan lands, as well as in the highlands of Southeast Asia and the Sino-Tibetan frontier regions, linguists have generally concluded that there exists a Tibeto-Burman family of languages.

However, internal strife within the dynasty and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435.

Prior to Songtsen Gampo, the kings of Tibet were more mythological than factual, and there is insufficient evidence of their existence.[27]\n\n\n\n### Tibetan Empire\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tibetan Empire\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Tibetan Resources on the Web from Columbia University Libraries\n* British photographs of Tibet 1920–1950\n* The Language of Tibet\n* White Paper on Tibetan Culture released by the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China June 22\n* Historical maps and images of Tibet presented by University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Libraries Digital Collections\n* The Tibetan & Himalayan Library (THL)\n* \"Tibet\" . *Encyclopædia Britannica*.

This name first appears in Chinese characters as 土番 in the 7th century (Li Tai) and as 吐蕃 in the 10th century (*Old Book of Tang*, describing 608–609 emissaries from Tibetan King Namri Songtsen to Emperor Yang of Sui). In the Middle Chinese language spoken during that period, as reconstructed by William H. Baxter, 土番 was pronounced *thux-phjon*, and 吐蕃 was pronounced *thux-pjon* (with the *x* representing a *shang* tone).[15]\n\n\nOther pre-modern Chinese names for Tibet include:\n\n\n\n* *Wusiguo* (Chinese: 烏斯國; pinyin: *Wūsīguó*; cf.

His efforts, while largely unsuccessful, established permanent contact between Tibet and the Western world.[48] However, in the 19th century, tensions between foreign powers and Tibet increased. The British Empire was expanding its territories in India into the Himalayas, while the Emirate of Afghanistan and the Russian Empire were both doing likewise in Central Asia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Van Walt van Praag, Michael C.

It is the largest province of China by area and has the third smallest population. Its capital and largest city is Xining.\n\n\nQinghai borders Gansu on the northeast, Xinjiang on the northwest, Sichuan on the southeast and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the southwest. Qinghai province was established in 1928 during the period of the Republic of China, and until 1949 was ruled by Chinese Muslim warlords known as the Ma clique. The Chinese name \"Qinghai\" is after Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in China. The lake is known as Tso ngon in Tibetan, and as Kokonor Lake in English, derived from the Mongol Oirat name for Qinghai Lake. Both Tso ngon and Kokonor are names found in historic documents to describe the region.[7]\n\n\nLocated mostly on the Tibetan Plateau, the province is inhabited by a number of peoples including the Tibetans, Mongols, Han (concentrated in the provincial capital of Xining and nearby Haidong), Hui, Monguors, and Salars. According to the 2021 census reports, Tibetans constitute a fifth of the population of Qinghai and the Hui compose roughly a sixth of the population. There are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with national minorities making up a total of 49.5% of the population.\n\n\nThe area of Qinghai came under the control of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty around 1724, after their defeat of Khoshut Mongols who previously controlled most of the area. After the Xinhai Revolution and the ensuing fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qinghai came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi's control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928. In the same year, the province of Qinghai was established by the Nationalist Government, with Xining as its capital.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Bronze Age, Qinghai was home to a diverse group of nomadic tribes closely related to other Central Asians who traditionally made a living in agriculture and husbandry, the Kayue culture. The eastern part of the area of Qinghai was under the control of the Han dynasty about 2,000 years ago. It was a battleground during the Tang and subsequent Central Plain dynasties when they fought against successive Tibetan tribes.[11]\n\n\nIn the middle of 3rd century CE, nomadic people related to the Mongolic Xianbei migrated to pasture lands around the Qinghai Lake (Koko Nur) and established the Tuyuhun Kingdom.\n\n\nIn the 7th century, the Tuyuhun Kingdom was attacked by both the Tibetan Empire and the Tang dynasty as both sought control over the Silk Road trade routes. Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo was victorious, and settled the area around Tso ngon (Lake Go, or Kokonor Lake).[12] Military conflicts had severely weakened the Tuyuhun kingdom and it was incorporated into the Tibetan Empire. The Tibetan Empire continued expanding beyond Tso ngon during Trisong Detsen's and Ralpacan's reigns, and the empire controlled vast areas north and east of Tso ngon until 848,[13] which included Xi'an.\n\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Tibetan Empire,[*clarification needed*] small local factions emerged, some under the titular authority of Central Plain polities. The Song dynasty defeated the Kokonor Kingdom in the 1070s.[14] During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty's administrative rule of Tibet, the region comprised the headwaters of the Ma chu (Machu River, Yellow River) and the Yalong (Yangtze) rivers and was known as Amdo, but apportioned to different administrative divisions than Tibet proper.[15]\n\n\nMost of Qinghai was, for a short time in the aftermath of the Yuan dynasty’s overthrow, under the control of early Ming dynasty, but later gradually lost to the Khoshut Khanate founded by the Oirats. The Xunhua Salar Autonomous County is where most Salar people live in Qinghai. The Salars migrated to Qinghai from Samarkand in 1370.[16] The chief of the four upper clans around this time was Han Pao-yuan and Ming granted him office of centurion, it was at this time the people of his four clans took Han as their surname.[17] The other chief Han Shan-pa of the four lower Salar clans got the same office from Ming, and his clans were the ones who took Ma as their surname.[18]\n\n\nFrom 1640 to 1724, a big part of the area that is now Qinghai was under Khoshut Mongol control, but in 1724 it was conquered by the armies of the Qing dynasty.[19] Xining, the capital of modern Qinghai province, began to function as the administrative center, although the city itself was then part of Gansu province within the \"Tibetan frontier district\".[20][21] In 1724, 13-Article for the Effective Governing of Qinghai (Chinese:青海善后事宜十三条) was proposed by Nian Gengyao and adopted by the Central Government to gain full control of Qinghai.\n\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty, the governor was a viceroy of the Emperor, but local ethnic groups enjoyed significant autonomy. Many chiefs retained their traditional authority, participating in local administrations.[22] The Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) devastated the Hui Muslim population of Shaanxi, shifting the Hui center of population to Gansu and Qinghai.[23]: 405 Another Dungan Revolt broke out in Qinghai in 1895 when various Muslim ethnic groups in Qinghai and Gansu rebelled against the Qing. Following the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the region came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928.\n\n\nIn July–August 1912, General Ma Fuxiang was \"Acting Chief Executive Officer of Kokonur\" (de facto Governor of the region that later became Qinghai).[24] In 1928, Qinghai province was created. The Muslim warlord and General Ma Qi became military governor of Qinghai, followed by his brother Ma Lin (warlord) and then Ma Qi's son Ma Bufang. In 1932 Tibet invaded Qinghai, attempting to capture southern parts of Qinghai province, following contention in Yushu, Qinghai, over a monastery in 1932. The army of Ma Bufang defeated the Tibetan armies. Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang was described as a socialist by American journalist John Roderick and friendly compared to the other Ma Clique warlords.[25] Ma Bufang was reported to be good humoured and jovial in contrast to the brutal reign of Ma Hongkui.[26] Most of eastern China was ravaged by the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, by contrast, Qinghai was relatively untouched.\n\n\nMa Bufang increased the prominence of the Hui and Salar people in Qinghai's politics by heavily recruiting to his army from the counties in which those ethnic groups predominated.[27] General Ma started a state run and controlled industrialization project, directly creating educational, medical, agricultural, and sanitation projects, run or assisted by the state. The state provided money for food and uniforms in all schools, state run or private. Roads and a theater were constructed. The state controlled all the press, no freedom was allowed for independent journalists.[28]\n\n\nAs the 1949 Chinese revolution approached Qinghai, Ma Bufang abandoned his post and flew to Hong Kong, traveling abroad but never returning to China. On January 1, 1950, the Qinghai Province People's Government was declared, owing its allegiance to the new People's Republic of China. Aside from some minor adjustments to suit the geography, the PRC maintained the province's territorial integrity.[29] Resistance to Communist rule continued in the form of the Huis' Kuomintang Islamic insurgency (1950–58), spreading past traditionally Hui areas to the ethnic-Tibetan south.[23]: 408 Although the Hui composed 15.6% of Qinghai's population in 1949, making the province the second-largest concentration of Hui after Ningxia, the state denied the Hui ethnic autonomous townships and counties that their numbers warranted under Chinese law until the 1980s.[23]: 411\n\n\n\n* ![The Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau](image)\n\nThe Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau\n* ![Chiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942](image)\n\nChiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nQinghai is located on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. By area, it is the largest province in the People's Republic of China (excluding the autonomous regions).\n\n\nThe Yellow River originates in the southern part of the province, while the Yangtze and Mekong have their sources in the southwestern part. Qinghai is separated by the Riyue Mountain into pastoral and agricultural zones in the west and east.[30]\n\n\nThe Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve is located in Qinghai and contains the headwaters of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Mekong River. The reserve was established to protect the headwaters of these three rivers and consists of 18 subareas, each containing three zones which are managed with differing degrees of strictness.\n\n\nQinghai Lake is the largest salt water lake in China, and the second largest in the world. Other large lakes are Lake Hala in the Qilian mountains, lakes Gyaring and Ngoring in the headwater region of the Yellow River, Lake Donggi Cona, and many saline and salt lakes in the western part of the province. \n\n\nThe Qaidam basin lies in the northwest part of the province at an altitude between 3000 and 5000 meters above sea level. About a third of this resource rich basin is desert. \n\n\n\n* ![Nyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai](image)\n\nNyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai\n* ![Riyue Mountain in Qinghai](image)\n\nRiyue Mountain in Qinghai\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies largely or entirely on a single source**.

Please help improve this article by introducing citations to additional sources.*Find sources:* \"Qinghai\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(December 2022)*\n |\n\n\nThe average elevation of Qinghai is approximately 3000 m.[31] Mountain ranges include the Tanggula Mountains and Kunlun Mountains, with the highest point being Bukadaban Feng at 6860 m.[32] Due to the high altitude, Qinghai has quite cold winters (harsh in the highest elevations), mild summers, and a large diurnal temperature variation.[*citation needed*] Its mean annual temperature is approximately −5 to 8 °C (23 to 46 °F), with January temperatures ranging from −18 to −7 °C (0 to 19 °F) and July temperatures ranging from 15 to 21 °C (59 to 70 °F).[*citation needed*] It is also prone to heavy winds as well as sandstorms from February to April. Significant rainfall occurs mainly in summer, while precipitation is very low in winter and spring, and is generally low enough to keep much of the province semi-arid or arid.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Qinghai\n\nThe Politics of Qinghai Province in the People's Republic of China are structured in a one party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.\n\n\nThe Governor of Qinghai (青海省省长) is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Qinghai. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Qinghai Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary (青海省委书记), colloquially termed the \"Qinghai Party Chief\".\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Qinghai and List of township-level divisions of Qinghai.\n\nBecause the Han form Qinghai's ethnic majority[30] and because none of its many ethnic minorities have clear dominance over the rest, the province is not administered as an autonomous region. Instead, the province has many ethnic autonomous areas at the district and county levels.[27] Qinghai is administratively divided into eight prefecture-level divisions: two prefecture-level cities and six autonomous prefectures:\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Administrative divisions of Qinghai** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Xining**\n\n**Haidong**\n\n**HaibeiTibetan AP**\n\n**HuangnanTibetan AP**\n\n**HainanTibetan AP**\n\n**Guoluo (Golog)Tibetan AP**\n\n**YushuTibetan AP**\n\n**HaixiMongol and Tibetan AP**\n\n**(Haixi)**\n |\n| Division code[33] | Division\n | Area in km2[34] | Population 2010[35] | Seat\n | Divisions[36] |\n| Districts | Counties | Aut. counties | CL cities |\n| 630000 | Qinghai Province\n | 720,000.00 | 5,626,723 | Xining city | 7 | 25 | 7 | 5\n |\n| 630100 | Xining city\n | 7,424.11 | 2,208,708 | Chengzhong District | 5 | 1 | 1 |  |\n| 630200 | Haidong city\n | 13,043.99 | 1,396,845 | Ledu District | 2 |  | 4 |  |\n| 632200 | Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 33,349.99 | 273,304 | Haiyan County |  | 3 | 1 |  |\n| 632300 | Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 17,908.89 | 256,716 | Tongren city |  | 2 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 632500 | Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 43,377.11 | 441,691 | Gonghe County |  | 5 |  |  |\n| 632600 | Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 76,442.38 | 181,682 | Maqên County |  | 6 |  |  |\n| 632700 | Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 197,953.70 | 378,439 | Yushu city |  | 5 |  | 1\n |\n| 632800 | Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 300,854.48 | 489,338 | Delingha city |  | 3 |  | 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions in Chinese and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English | Chinese | Pinyin\n |\n| **Qinghai Province** | 青海省 | **Qīnghǎi Shěng** |\n| Xining city | 西宁市 | Xīníng Shì\n |\n| Haidong city | 海东市 | Hǎidōng Shì\n |\n| Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海北藏族自治州 | Hǎiběi Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 黄南藏族自治州 | Huángnán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海南藏族自治州 | Hǎinán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 果洛藏族自治州 | Guǒluò Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 玉树藏族自治州 | Yùshù Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海西蒙古族藏族自治州 | Hǎixī Měnggǔzú Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n\n\nThe eight prefecture-level divisions of Qinghai are subdivided into 44 county-level divisions (6 districts, 4 county-level cities, 27 counties and 7 autonomous counties).\n\n\n\n### Urban areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| # | City | Urban area[37] | District area[37] | City proper[37] | Census date\n |\n| 1 | **Xining** | 1,153,417 | 1,198,304 | 2,208,708 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 2 | Golmud | 156,779 | 186,341 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (3) | Haidong[a] | 120,433 | 363,159 | 1,396,845 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (4) | Yushu[b] | 56,802 | 120,447 | *part of Yushu Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 5 | Delingha | 54,844 | 78,184 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (6) | Mangnai[c] | 33,440 | 33,451 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Haidong Prefecture is currently known as Haidong PLC after census; Ledu County & Ping'an County is currently known as Ledu & Ping'an (core districts of Haidong) after census.\n2. **^** Yushu County is currently known as Yushu CLC after census.\n3. **^** Mangnai Administrative Zone & Lenghu Administrative Zone County is currently known as Mangnai CLC after census.\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1912[38] | 368,000 | —     |\n| 1928[39] | 619,000 | +68.2% |\n| 1936–37[40] | 1,196,000 | +93.2% |\n| 1947[41] | 1,308,000 | +9.4% |\n| 1954[42] | 1,676,534 | +28.2% |\n| 1964[43] | 2,145,604 | +28.0% |\n| 1982[44] | 3,895,706 | +81.6% |\n| 1990[45] | 4,456,946 | +14.4% |\n| 2000[46] | 4,822,963 | +8.2% |\n| 2010[47] | 5,626,722 | +16.7% |\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nThere are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with Han population standing at 50.5% of the total population and national minorities making up 49.5% of the population.[48] In 2010, Tibetan population stood at 20.7%, Hui 16%, Tu (Monguor) 4%, with also some groups of Mongol, and Salar, all of those groups being the most populous in the province. Han Chinese predominate in the cities of Xining, Haidong, Delingha and Golmud, and elsewhere in the northeast. The Hui are concentrated in Xining, Haidong, Minhe County, Hualong County, and Datong County. The Tu people predominate in Huzhu County and the Salars in Xunhua County; Tibetans and Mongols are sparsely distributed across the rural western part of the province.[27] Of the Muslim ethnic groups in China, Qinghai has communities of Hui, Salar, Dongxiang, and Bao'an.[16] The Hui dominate the wholesale business in Qinghai.[49]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Qinghai (2000s)\n\n\n\nBuddhism, Chinese folk religions (including Taoism), Bön and non-religious population (81.73%)\nIslam[50] (17.51%)\nChristianity[51] (0.76%)\n\n![](image)The Dongguan Mosque in Qinghai\nThe predominant religions in Qinghai are Chinese folk religions (including Taoist traditions and Confucianism) and Chinese Buddhism among the Han Chinese. The large Tibetan population practices Tibetan schools of Buddhism or traditional Tibetan Bön religion, while the Hui Chinese practice Islam. Christianity is the religion of 0.76% of the province's population according to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2004.[51] According to a survey of 2010, 17.51% of the population of Qinghai follow Islam.[50]\n\n\nFrom September 1848, the city was the seat of a short-lived Latin Catholic Apostolic Vicariate (pre-diocesan missionary jurisdiction) of Kokonur (alias Khouhkou-noor, Kokonoor), but it was suppressed in 1861. No incumbent(s) recorded.[52]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![A Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nA Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining\n* ![A Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining](image)\n\nA Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining\n* ![Mosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County](image)\n\nMosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County\n* ![Rongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County](image)\n\nRongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County\n* ![Great Mosque of Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nGreat Mosque of Duoba, Xining\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nQinghai has been influenced by interactions \"between Mongol and Tibetan culture, north to south, and Han Chinese and Inner Asia Muslim culture, east to west\".[27] The languages of Qinghai have for centuries formed a Sprachbund, with Zhongyuan Mandarin, Amdo Tibetan, Salar, Yugur, and Monguor borrowing from and influencing one another.[53] In mainstream Chinese culture, Qinghai is most associated with the *Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven*.[*citation needed*] According to this legend, King Mu of Zhou (r. 976–922 BCE) pursued hostile Quanrong nomads to eastern Qinghai, where the goddess Xi Wangmu threw the king a banquet in the Kunlun Mountains.[54]\n\n\nThe main religions in Qinghai are Tibetan Buddhism, Islam and Chinese Folk Religions. The Dongguan Mosque has been continuously operating since 1380.[23]: 402 Measures of education in Qinghai are low, particularly among the ethnic minorities.[27] The yak, which is native to Qinghai, is widely used in the province for transportation and its meat.[30] The Mongols of Qinghai celebrate the Naadam festival on the Qaidam Basin every year.[55]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oil well in Tsaidam (Qaidam), Qinghai\nQinghai's economy is amongst the smallest in China. Its nominal GDP in 2022 was just RMB 361 billion (USD 50 billion) and contributes to about 0.30% of the entire country's economy. Per capita GDP was RMB 60,724 (USD 9,028) in nominal), the 24th in China.[3]\n\n\nIts heavy industry includes iron and steel production, located near its capital city of Xining. Oil and natural gas from the Qaidam Basin have also been an important contributor to the economy.[56] Salt works operate at many of the province's numerous salt lakes.\n\n\nOutside of the provincial capital, Xining, most of Qinghai remains underdeveloped. Qinghai ranks second lowest in China in terms of highway length, and will require a significant expansion of its infrastructure to capitalize on the economic potential of its rich natural resources.[56]\n\n\n\n### Economic and technological development zone[edit]\n\n\nXining Economic & Technological Development Zone (XETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone in July 2000. It has a planned area of 4.4 km2. XETDZ lies in the east of Xining, 5 km from the city centre. In the east of the province, Xining stands at the upper reaches of the Huangshui River—one of the Yellow River's branches. The city is surrounded by the mountains with an average elevation of 2261 m and the highest at 4393 m. XETDZ is the first of its kind at the national level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is established to fulfill the nation's strategy of developing the west.\n\n\nXETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining-Lanzhou expressway and running through by two main roads, the broadest in the city. It is 4 km from the railway station, 15 km from Xi'ning Airport — a grade 4D airport with 14 airlines to cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xi'an. Xining is Qinghai province's passage to the outside world, a transportation hub with more than ten highways, over 100 roads and two railways, Lanzhou-Qinghai and Qinghai-Tibet Railways in and out of the city.\n\n\nIt focuses on the development of following industries: chemicals based on salt lake resources, nonferrous metals, and petroleum and natural gas processing; special medicine, foods and bio-chemicals using local plateau animals and plants; new products involving ecological and environmental protection, high technology, new materials as well as information technology; and services such as logistics, banking, real estate, tourism, hotel, catering, agency and international trade.[57]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qinghai Lake.\nMany tourist attractions center on Xining, the provincial seat of Qinghai.\n\n\nDuring the hot summer months, many tourists from the hot southern and eastern parts of China travel to Xining, as the climate of Xining in July and August is quite mild and comfortable, making the city an ideal summer retreat.\n\n\nQinghai Lake (青海湖; *qīnghǎi hú*) is another tourist attraction, albeit further from Xining than Kumbum Monastery (Ta'er Si). The lake is the largest saltwater lake in China, and is also located on the \"Roof of the World\", the Tibetan Plateau. The lake itself lies at 3,600 m elevation. The surrounding area is made up of rolling grasslands and populated by ethnic Tibetans. Most pre-arranged tours stop at Bird Island (鸟岛; *niǎo dǎo*). An international bicycle race takes place annually from Xining to Qinghai Lake.\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in the People's Republic of China\n\n![](image)China National Highway 109 in Qinghai\nThe Lanqing Railway, running between Lanzhou, Gansu and Xining, the province's capital, was completed in 1959 and is the major transportation route in and out of the province. A continuation of the line, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway via Golmud and western Qinghai, has become one of the most ambitious projects in PRC history. It was completed in October 2005 and now links Tibet with the rest of China through Qinghai.\n\n\nConstruction on the Golmud–Dunhuang Railway, in the province's northwestern part, started in 2012.\n\n\nSix National Highways run through the province.\n\n\nXining Caojiabao International Airport provides service to Beijing, Lanzhou, Golmud and Delingha. Smaller regional airports, Delingha Airport, Golog Maqin Airport, Huatugou Airport, Qilian Airport and Yushu Batang Airport, serve the province’s smaller communities; plans exist for the construction of three more by 2020.[58]\n\n\n\n## Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications industry in China\n\nSince the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology began its \"Access to Telephones Project\", Qinghai has invested 640 million yuan to provide telephone access to 3860 out its 4133 administrative villages. At the end of 2006, 299 towns had received Internet access. However, 6.6 percent of villages in the region still have no access to the telephone. These villages are mainly scattered in Qingnan Area, with 90 percent of them located in Yushu and Guoluo. The average altitude of these areas exceeds 3600 meters, and the poor natural conditions hamper the establishment of telecommunication facilities in the region.\n\n\nSatellite phones have been provided to 186 remote villages in Qinghai Province as of September 14, 2007.[*citation needed*] The areas benefited were Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Qinghai has recently been provided with satellite telephone access. In June 2007, China Satcom carried out an in-depth survey in Yushu and Guoluo, and made a special satellite phones for these areas. Two phones were provided to each village for free, and calls were charged at the rate of 0.2 RMB (about a quarter of a US cent at that time) per minute for both local and national calls, with the extra charges assumed by China Satcom. No monthly rent was charged on the satellite phone. International calls were also available.\n\n\n\n## Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of universities and colleges in Qinghai.\n\n* Qinghai University (青海大学)\n* Qinghai Normal University (青海师范大学)\n* Qinghai University for Nationalities (青海民族大学)\n* Qinghai Medical College (青海医学院)\n* Qinghai Radio & Television University (青海广播电视大学)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2010 Yushu earthquake\n* Amdo\n* Geladandong\n* Haplogroup D-M15 (Y-DNA)\n* Haplogroup O3 (Y-DNA)\n* *Iris qinghainica* (native plant of Qinghai)\n* Major national historical and cultural sites in Qinghai\n* Tectonic summary of Qinghai\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Qinghai Province\".

It is the largest province of China by area and has the third smallest population. Its capital and largest city is Xining.\n\n\nQinghai borders Gansu on the northeast, Xinjiang on the northwest, Sichuan on the southeast and the Tibet Autonomous Region on the southwest. Qinghai province was established in 1928 during the period of the Republic of China, and until 1949 was ruled by Chinese Muslim warlords known as the Ma clique. The Chinese name \"Qinghai\" is after Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in China. The lake is known as Tso ngon in Tibetan, and as Kokonor Lake in English, derived from the Mongol Oirat name for Qinghai Lake. Both Tso ngon and Kokonor are names found in historic documents to describe the region.[7]\n\n\nLocated mostly on the Tibetan Plateau, the province is inhabited by a number of peoples including the Tibetans, Mongols, Han (concentrated in the provincial capital of Xining and nearby Haidong), Hui, Monguors, and Salars. According to the 2021 census reports, Tibetans constitute a fifth of the population of Qinghai and the Hui compose roughly a sixth of the population. There are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with national minorities making up a total of 49.5% of the population.\n\n\nThe area of Qinghai came under the control of the Manchu-led Qing Dynasty around 1724, after their defeat of Khoshut Mongols who previously controlled most of the area. After the Xinhai Revolution and the ensuing fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qinghai came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi's control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928. In the same year, the province of Qinghai was established by the Nationalist Government, with Xining as its capital.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Bronze Age, Qinghai was home to a diverse group of nomadic tribes closely related to other Central Asians who traditionally made a living in agriculture and husbandry, the Kayue culture. The eastern part of the area of Qinghai was under the control of the Han dynasty about 2,000 years ago. It was a battleground during the Tang and subsequent Central Plain dynasties when they fought against successive Tibetan tribes.[11]\n\n\nIn the middle of 3rd century CE, nomadic people related to the Mongolic Xianbei migrated to pasture lands around the Qinghai Lake (Koko Nur) and established the Tuyuhun Kingdom.\n\n\nIn the 7th century, the Tuyuhun Kingdom was attacked by both the Tibetan Empire and the Tang dynasty as both sought control over the Silk Road trade routes. Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo was victorious, and settled the area around Tso ngon (Lake Go, or Kokonor Lake).[12] Military conflicts had severely weakened the Tuyuhun kingdom and it was incorporated into the Tibetan Empire. The Tibetan Empire continued expanding beyond Tso ngon during Trisong Detsen's and Ralpacan's reigns, and the empire controlled vast areas north and east of Tso ngon until 848,[13] which included Xi'an.\n\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Tibetan Empire,[*clarification needed*] small local factions emerged, some under the titular authority of Central Plain polities. The Song dynasty defeated the Kokonor Kingdom in the 1070s.[14] During the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty's administrative rule of Tibet, the region comprised the headwaters of the Ma chu (Machu River, Yellow River) and the Yalong (Yangtze) rivers and was known as Amdo, but apportioned to different administrative divisions than Tibet proper.[15]\n\n\nMost of Qinghai was, for a short time in the aftermath of the Yuan dynasty’s overthrow, under the control of early Ming dynasty, but later gradually lost to the Khoshut Khanate founded by the Oirats. The Xunhua Salar Autonomous County is where most Salar people live in Qinghai. The Salars migrated to Qinghai from Samarkand in 1370.[16] The chief of the four upper clans around this time was Han Pao-yuan and Ming granted him office of centurion, it was at this time the people of his four clans took Han as their surname.[17] The other chief Han Shan-pa of the four lower Salar clans got the same office from Ming, and his clans were the ones who took Ma as their surname.[18]\n\n\nFrom 1640 to 1724, a big part of the area that is now Qinghai was under Khoshut Mongol control, but in 1724 it was conquered by the armies of the Qing dynasty.[19] Xining, the capital of modern Qinghai province, began to function as the administrative center, although the city itself was then part of Gansu province within the \"Tibetan frontier district\".[20][21] In 1724, 13-Article for the Effective Governing of Qinghai (Chinese:青海善后事宜十三条) was proposed by Nian Gengyao and adopted by the Central Government to gain full control of Qinghai.\n\n\nUnder the Qing dynasty, the governor was a viceroy of the Emperor, but local ethnic groups enjoyed significant autonomy. Many chiefs retained their traditional authority, participating in local administrations.[22] The Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) devastated the Hui Muslim population of Shaanxi, shifting the Hui center of population to Gansu and Qinghai.[23]: 405 Another Dungan Revolt broke out in Qinghai in 1895 when various Muslim ethnic groups in Qinghai and Gansu rebelled against the Qing. Following the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the region came under Chinese Muslim warlord Ma Qi control until the Northern Expedition by the Republic of China consolidated central control in 1928.\n\n\nIn July–August 1912, General Ma Fuxiang was \"Acting Chief Executive Officer of Kokonur\" (de facto Governor of the region that later became Qinghai).[24] In 1928, Qinghai province was created. The Muslim warlord and General Ma Qi became military governor of Qinghai, followed by his brother Ma Lin (warlord) and then Ma Qi's son Ma Bufang. In 1932 Tibet invaded Qinghai, attempting to capture southern parts of Qinghai province, following contention in Yushu, Qinghai, over a monastery in 1932. The army of Ma Bufang defeated the Tibetan armies. Governor of Qinghai Ma Bufang was described as a socialist by American journalist John Roderick and friendly compared to the other Ma Clique warlords.[25] Ma Bufang was reported to be good humoured and jovial in contrast to the brutal reign of Ma Hongkui.[26] Most of eastern China was ravaged by the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War, by contrast, Qinghai was relatively untouched.\n\n\nMa Bufang increased the prominence of the Hui and Salar people in Qinghai's politics by heavily recruiting to his army from the counties in which those ethnic groups predominated.[27] General Ma started a state run and controlled industrialization project, directly creating educational, medical, agricultural, and sanitation projects, run or assisted by the state. The state provided money for food and uniforms in all schools, state run or private. Roads and a theater were constructed. The state controlled all the press, no freedom was allowed for independent journalists.[28]\n\n\nAs the 1949 Chinese revolution approached Qinghai, Ma Bufang abandoned his post and flew to Hong Kong, traveling abroad but never returning to China. On January 1, 1950, the Qinghai Province People's Government was declared, owing its allegiance to the new People's Republic of China. Aside from some minor adjustments to suit the geography, the PRC maintained the province's territorial integrity.[29] Resistance to Communist rule continued in the form of the Huis' Kuomintang Islamic insurgency (1950–58), spreading past traditionally Hui areas to the ethnic-Tibetan south.[23]: 408 Although the Hui composed 15.6% of Qinghai's population in 1949, making the province the second-largest concentration of Hui after Ningxia, the state denied the Hui ethnic autonomous townships and counties that their numbers warranted under Chinese law until the 1980s.[23]: 411\n\n\n\n* ![The Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau](image)\n\nThe Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717) based in the Tibetan Plateau\n* ![Chiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942](image)\n\nChiang Kai-shek, leader of Nationalist China (right), meets with the Muslim generals Ma Bufang (second from left), and Ma Buqing (first from left) in Xining, Qinghai, in August 1942\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nQinghai is located on the northeastern part of the Tibetan Plateau. By area, it is the largest province in the People's Republic of China (excluding the autonomous regions).\n\n\nThe Yellow River originates in the southern part of the province, while the Yangtze and Mekong have their sources in the southwestern part. Qinghai is separated by the Riyue Mountain into pastoral and agricultural zones in the west and east.[30]\n\n\nThe Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve is located in Qinghai and contains the headwaters of the Yellow River, Yangtze River, and Mekong River. The reserve was established to protect the headwaters of these three rivers and consists of 18 subareas, each containing three zones which are managed with differing degrees of strictness.\n\n\nQinghai Lake is the largest salt water lake in China, and the second largest in the world. Other large lakes are Lake Hala in the Qilian mountains, lakes Gyaring and Ngoring in the headwater region of the Yellow River, Lake Donggi Cona, and many saline and salt lakes in the western part of the province. \n\n\nThe Qaidam basin lies in the northwest part of the province at an altitude between 3000 and 5000 meters above sea level. About a third of this resource rich basin is desert. \n\n\n\n* ![Nyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai](image)\n\nNyenpo Yurtse, Jigzhi County, Qinghai\n* ![Riyue Mountain in Qinghai](image)\n\nRiyue Mountain in Qinghai\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies largely or entirely on a single source**.

Significant rainfall occurs mainly in summer, while precipitation is very low in winter and spring, and is generally low enough to keep much of the province semi-arid or arid.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Qinghai\n\nThe Politics of Qinghai Province in the People's Republic of China are structured in a one party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.\n\n\nThe Governor of Qinghai (青海省省长) is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Qinghai. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Qinghai Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary (青海省委书记), colloquially termed the \"Qinghai Party Chief\".\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Qinghai and List of township-level divisions of Qinghai.\n\nBecause the Han form Qinghai's ethnic majority[30] and because none of its many ethnic minorities have clear dominance over the rest, the province is not administered as an autonomous region. Instead, the province has many ethnic autonomous areas at the district and county levels.[27] Qinghai is administratively divided into eight prefecture-level divisions: two prefecture-level cities and six autonomous prefectures:\n\n\n\n\n\n| **Administrative divisions of Qinghai** |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Xining**\n\n**Haidong**\n\n**HaibeiTibetan AP**\n\n**HuangnanTibetan AP**\n\n**HainanTibetan AP**\n\n**Guoluo (Golog)Tibetan AP**\n\n**YushuTibetan AP**\n\n**HaixiMongol and Tibetan AP**\n\n**(Haixi)**\n |\n| Division code[33] | Division\n | Area in km2[34] | Population 2010[35] | Seat\n | Divisions[36] |\n| Districts | Counties | Aut. counties | CL cities |\n| 630000 | Qinghai Province\n | 720,000.00 | 5,626,723 | Xining city | 7 | 25 | 7 | 5\n |\n| 630100 | Xining city\n | 7,424.11 | 2,208,708 | Chengzhong District | 5 | 1 | 1 |  |\n| 630200 | Haidong city\n | 13,043.99 | 1,396,845 | Ledu District | 2 |  | 4 |  |\n| 632200 | Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 33,349.99 | 273,304 | Haiyan County |  | 3 | 1 |  |\n| 632300 | Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 17,908.89 | 256,716 | Tongren city |  | 2 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 632500 | Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 43,377.11 | 441,691 | Gonghe County |  | 5 |  |  |\n| 632600 | Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 76,442.38 | 181,682 | Maqên County |  | 6 |  |  |\n| 632700 | Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 197,953.70 | 378,439 | Yushu city |  | 5 |  | 1\n |\n| 632800 | Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 300,854.48 | 489,338 | Delingha city |  | 3 |  | 3\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions in Chinese and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English | Chinese | Pinyin\n |\n| **Qinghai Province** | 青海省 | **Qīnghǎi Shěng** |\n| Xining city | 西宁市 | Xīníng Shì\n |\n| Haidong city | 海东市 | Hǎidōng Shì\n |\n| Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海北藏族自治州 | Hǎiběi Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 黄南藏族自治州 | Huángnán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海南藏族自治州 | Hǎinán Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 果洛藏族自治州 | Guǒluò Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 玉树藏族自治州 | Yùshù Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n| Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture | 海西蒙古族藏族自治州 | Hǎixī Měnggǔzú Zàngzú Zìzhìzhōu\n |\n\n\nThe eight prefecture-level divisions of Qinghai are subdivided into 44 county-level divisions (6 districts, 4 county-level cities, 27 counties and 7 autonomous counties).\n\n\n\n### Urban areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| # | City | Urban area[37] | District area[37] | City proper[37] | Census date\n |\n| 1 | **Xining** | 1,153,417 | 1,198,304 | 2,208,708 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 2 | Golmud | 156,779 | 186,341 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (3) | Haidong[a] | 120,433 | 363,159 | 1,396,845 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (4) | Yushu[b] | 56,802 | 120,447 | *part of Yushu Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 5 | Delingha | 54,844 | 78,184 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (6) | Mangnai[c] | 33,440 | 33,451 | *part of Haixi Prefecture* | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Haidong Prefecture is currently known as Haidong PLC after census; Ledu County & Ping'an County is currently known as Ledu & Ping'an (core districts of Haidong) after census.\n2. **^** Yushu County is currently known as Yushu CLC after census.\n3. **^** Mangnai Administrative Zone & Lenghu Administrative Zone County is currently known as Mangnai CLC after census.\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1912[38] | 368,000 | —     |\n| 1928[39] | 619,000 | +68.2% |\n| 1936–37[40] | 1,196,000 | +93.2% |\n| 1947[41] | 1,308,000 | +9.4% |\n| 1954[42] | 1,676,534 | +28.2% |\n| 1964[43] | 2,145,604 | +28.0% |\n| 1982[44] | 3,895,706 | +81.6% |\n| 1990[45] | 4,456,946 | +14.4% |\n| 2000[46] | 4,822,963 | +8.2% |\n| 2010[47] | 5,626,722 | +16.7% |\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nThere are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with Han population standing at 50.5% of the total population and national minorities making up 49.5% of the population.[48] In 2010, Tibetan population stood at 20.7%, Hui 16%, Tu (Monguor) 4%, with also some groups of Mongol, and Salar, all of those groups being the most populous in the province. Han Chinese predominate in the cities of Xining, Haidong, Delingha and Golmud, and elsewhere in the northeast. The Hui are concentrated in Xining, Haidong, Minhe County, Hualong County, and Datong County. The Tu people predominate in Huzhu County and the Salars in Xunhua County; Tibetans and Mongols are sparsely distributed across the rural western part of the province.[27] Of the Muslim ethnic groups in China, Qinghai has communities of Hui, Salar, Dongxiang, and Bao'an.[16] The Hui dominate the wholesale business in Qinghai.[49]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Qinghai (2000s)\n\n\n\nBuddhism, Chinese folk religions (including Taoism), Bön and non-religious population (81.73%)\nIslam[50] (17.51%)\nChristianity[51] (0.76%)\n\n![](image)The Dongguan Mosque in Qinghai\nThe predominant religions in Qinghai are Chinese folk religions (including Taoist traditions and Confucianism) and Chinese Buddhism among the Han Chinese. The large Tibetan population practices Tibetan schools of Buddhism or traditional Tibetan Bön religion, while the Hui Chinese practice Islam. Christianity is the religion of 0.76% of the province's population according to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2004.[51] According to a survey of 2010, 17.51% of the population of Qinghai follow Islam.[50]\n\n\nFrom September 1848, the city was the seat of a short-lived Latin Catholic Apostolic Vicariate (pre-diocesan missionary jurisdiction) of Kokonur (alias Khouhkou-noor, Kokonoor), but it was suppressed in 1861. No incumbent(s) recorded.[52]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![A Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nA Taoist temple dedicated to Jiutian Xuannü on Mount Fenghuang, in Lunmalong village, Duoba, Xining\n* ![A Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining](image)\n\nA Buddhist temple on Riyue Mountain, in Huangyuan County, Xining\n* ![Mosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County](image)\n\nMosques and Chinese folk temples characterising the skyline of Huangyuan County\n* ![Rongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County](image)\n\nRongwo Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Tongren County\n* ![Great Mosque of Duoba, Xining](image)\n\nGreat Mosque of Duoba, Xining\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nQinghai has been influenced by interactions \"between Mongol and Tibetan culture, north to south, and Han Chinese and Inner Asia Muslim culture, east to west\".[27] The languages of Qinghai have for centuries formed a Sprachbund, with Zhongyuan Mandarin, Amdo Tibetan, Salar, Yugur, and Monguor borrowing from and influencing one another.[53] In mainstream Chinese culture, Qinghai is most associated with the *Tale of King Mu, Son of Heaven*.[*citation needed*] According to this legend, King Mu of Zhou (r. 976–922 BCE) pursued hostile Quanrong nomads to eastern Qinghai, where the goddess Xi Wangmu threw the king a banquet in the Kunlun Mountains.[54]\n\n\nThe main religions in Qinghai are Tibetan Buddhism, Islam and Chinese Folk Religions. The Dongguan Mosque has been continuously operating since 1380.[23]: 402 Measures of education in Qinghai are low, particularly among the ethnic minorities.[27] The yak, which is native to Qinghai, is widely used in the province for transportation and its meat.[30] The Mongols of Qinghai celebrate the Naadam festival on the Qaidam Basin every year.[55]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oil well in Tsaidam (Qaidam), Qinghai\nQinghai's economy is amongst the smallest in China. Its nominal GDP in 2022 was just RMB 361 billion (USD 50 billion) and contributes to about 0.30% of the entire country's economy. Per capita GDP was RMB 60,724 (USD 9,028) in nominal), the 24th in China.[3]\n\n\nIts heavy industry includes iron and steel production, located near its capital city of Xining. Oil and natural gas from the Qaidam Basin have also been an important contributor to the economy.[56] Salt works operate at many of the province's numerous salt lakes.\n\n\nOutside of the provincial capital, Xining, most of Qinghai remains underdeveloped. Qinghai ranks second lowest in China in terms of highway length, and will require a significant expansion of its infrastructure to capitalize on the economic potential of its rich natural resources.[56]\n\n\n\n### Economic and technological development zone[edit]\n\n\nXining Economic & Technological Development Zone (XETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone in July 2000. It has a planned area of 4.4 km2. XETDZ lies in the east of Xining, 5 km from the city centre. In the east of the province, Xining stands at the upper reaches of the Huangshui River—one of the Yellow River's branches. The city is surrounded by the mountains with an average elevation of 2261 m and the highest at 4393 m. XETDZ is the first of its kind at the national level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is established to fulfill the nation's strategy of developing the west.\n\n\nXETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining-Lanzhou expressway and running through by two main roads, the broadest in the city. It is 4 km from the railway station, 15 km from Xi'ning Airport — a grade 4D airport with 14 airlines to cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xi'an. Xining is Qinghai province's passage to the outside world, a transportation hub with more than ten highways, over 100 roads and two railways, Lanzhou-Qinghai and Qinghai-Tibet Railways in and out of the city.\n\n\nIt focuses on the development of following industries: chemicals based on salt lake resources, nonferrous metals, and petroleum and natural gas processing; special medicine, foods and bio-chemicals using local plateau animals and plants; new products involving ecological and environmental protection, high technology, new materials as well as information technology; and services such as logistics, banking, real estate, tourism, hotel, catering, agency and international trade.[57]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qinghai Lake.\nMany tourist attractions center on Xining, the provincial seat of Qinghai.\n\n\nDuring the hot summer months, many tourists from the hot southern and eastern parts of China travel to Xining, as the climate of Xining in July and August is quite mild and comfortable, making the city an ideal summer retreat.\n\n\nQinghai Lake (青海湖; *qīnghǎi hú*) is another tourist attraction, albeit further from Xining than Kumbum Monastery (Ta'er Si). The lake is the largest saltwater lake in China, and is also located on the \"Roof of the World\", the Tibetan Plateau. The lake itself lies at 3,600 m elevation. The surrounding area is made up of rolling grasslands and populated by ethnic Tibetans. Most pre-arranged tours stop at Bird Island (鸟岛; *niǎo dǎo*). An international bicycle race takes place annually from Xining to Qinghai Lake.\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in the People's Republic of China\n\n![](image)China National Highway 109 in Qinghai\nThe Lanqing Railway, running between Lanzhou, Gansu and Xining, the province's capital, was completed in 1959 and is the major transportation route in and out of the province. A continuation of the line, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway via Golmud and western Qinghai, has become one of the most ambitious projects in PRC history. It was completed in October 2005 and now links Tibet with the rest of China through Qinghai.\n\n\nConstruction on the Golmud–Dunhuang Railway, in the province's northwestern part, started in 2012.\n\n\nSix National Highways run through the province.\n\n\nXining Caojiabao International Airport provides service to Beijing, Lanzhou, Golmud and Delingha. Smaller regional airports, Delingha Airport, Golog Maqin Airport, Huatugou Airport, Qilian Airport and Yushu Batang Airport, serve the province’s smaller communities; plans exist for the construction of three more by 2020.[58]\n\n\n\n## Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications industry in China\n\nSince the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology began its \"Access to Telephones Project\", Qinghai has invested 640 million yuan to provide telephone access to 3860 out its 4133 administrative villages. At the end of 2006, 299 towns had received Internet access. However, 6.6 percent of villages in the region still have no access to the telephone. These villages are mainly scattered in Qingnan Area, with 90 percent of them located in Yushu and Guoluo. The average altitude of these areas exceeds 3600 meters, and the poor natural conditions hamper the establishment of telecommunication facilities in the region.\n\n\nSatellite phones have been provided to 186 remote villages in Qinghai Province as of September 14, 2007.[*citation needed*] The areas benefited were Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Qinghai has recently been provided with satellite telephone access. In June 2007, China Satcom carried out an in-depth survey in Yushu and Guoluo, and made a special satellite phones for these areas. Two phones were provided to each village for free, and calls were charged at the rate of 0.2 RMB (about a quarter of a US cent at that time) per minute for both local and national calls, with the extra charges assumed by China Satcom. No monthly rent was charged on the satellite phone. International calls were also available.\n\n\n\n## Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of universities and colleges in Qinghai.\n\n* Qinghai University (青海大学)\n* Qinghai Normal University (青海师范大学)\n* Qinghai University for Nationalities (青海民族大学)\n* Qinghai Medical College (青海医学院)\n* Qinghai Radio & Television University (青海广播电视大学)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2010 Yushu earthquake\n* Amdo\n* Geladandong\n* Haplogroup D-M15 (Y-DNA)\n* Haplogroup O3 (Y-DNA)\n* *Iris qinghainica* (native plant of Qinghai)\n* Major national historical and cultural sites in Qinghai\n* Tectonic summary of Qinghai\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Qinghai Province\".

The PRC cemented the [historical] status quo by keeping Amdo/Qinghai as a separate, multinational province... China does not reverse perceived territorial acquisitions. Hence, all territories that escaped the domination of Lhasa in recent history remained attached to the neighboring Chinese constituencies they tended to be under the influence of.\n30. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Lahtinen, Anja (2009). \"Maximising Opportunities for the Tibetans of Qinghai Province, China\".

For about ten years since 2000, Inner Mongolia's GDP growth has been the highest in the country, (along with Guangdong) largely owing to the success of natural resource industries in the region. GDP growth has continually been over 10%, even 15% and connections with the Wolf Economy to the north has helped development. However, growth has come at a cost with huge amounts of pollution and degradation to the grasslands.[30] Attempts to attract ethnic Chinese to migrate from other regions, as well as urbanise those rural nomads and peasants has led to huge amounts of corruption and waste in public spending, such as Ordos City.[31][32] Acute uneven wealth distribution has further exacerbated ethnic tensions, many indigenous Mongolians feeling they are increasingly marginalised in their own homeland, leading to riots in 2011 and 2013.[33][34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| # | City | Urban area[44] | District area[44] | City proper[44] | Census date\n |\n| 1 | Baotou | 1,900,373 | 2,096,851 | 2,650,364 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 2 | **Hohhot** | 1,497,110 | 1,980,774 | 2,866,615 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 3 | Chifeng | 902,285 | 1,333,526 | 4,341,245 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 4 | Tongliao | 540,338 | 898,895 | 3,139,153 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 5 | Ordos[i] | 510,242 | 582,544 | 1,940,653 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 6 | Wuhai | 502,704 | 532,902 | 532,902 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 7 | Bayannur | 354,507 | 541,721 | 1,669,915 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 8 | Yakeshi | 338,275 | 352,173 | *see Hulunbuir* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 9 | Hulunbuir[ii] | 327,384 | 344,934 | 2,549,252 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (9) | Hulunbuir (new district)[ii] | 99,960 | 99,960 | *see Hulunbuir* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 10 | Ulanqab | 319,723 | 356,135 | 2,143,590 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 11 | Ulanhot | 276,406 | 327,081 | *part of Hinggan League* | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** Amy Qin (31 August 2020). \"Curbs on Mongolian Language Teaching Prompt Large Protests in China\". *The New York Times*.

Due to its long span from east to west, Inner Mongolia is geographically divided into eastern and western divisions. The eastern division is often included in Northeastern China (Dongbei), with major cities including Tongliao, Chifeng, Hailar, and Ulanhot. The western division is included in North China, with major cities including Baotou and Hohhot. It recorded a population of 24,706,321 in the 2010 census, accounting for 1.84% of Mainland China's total population. Inner Mongolia is the country's 23rd most populous province-level division.[8] The majority of the population in the region are Han Chinese, with a sizeable Mongol minority close to 5,000,000 (2019) which is the largest Mongolian population in the world (bigger than that of the country Mongolia). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**█** **Jiagedaqi Dist. & Songling Dist.is de jure part of Oroqen Aut.

The region is also a source of crude oil, with sites such as the Xifeng oil field producing tens of thousands of barrels per day.[46] However, in the past, the exploitation and utilisation of resources were rather inefficient, which resulted in poor returns from rich resources. Inner Mongolia is also an important coal production base, with more than a quarter of the world's coal reserves located in the province.[47] It plans to double annual coal output by 2010 (from the 2005 volume of 260 million tons) to 500 million tons of coal a year.[48]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Republic of China reorganised Inner Mongolia into provinces:\n\n\n\n* Rehe province was created to include the Juuuda and Josutu leagues, plus the Chengde area in what is now northern Hebei.\n* Chahar province was created to include Xilingol league as well as much of the former territory of the Eight Banners.\n* Suiyuan province was created to include Ulanqab league, Yekejuu league, and the Hetao region (former Guihua Tümed territory).\n* Hulunbuir stayed within Heilongjiang in Manchuria, which had become a province.\n* Most of Jirim league came under the new province of Fengtian in southern Manchuria.\n* Taoxi Mongolia, i.e., Alashan and Ejine leagues, was incorporated into neighbouring Gansu province. Later on Ningxia province was split out of northern Gansu, and Taoxi Mongolia became part of Ningxia.\n\n\nSome Republic of China maps still show this structure.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** National Bureau of Population and Social Science and Technology Statistics Division of China (国家统计局人口和社会科技统计司); Department of Economic Development of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission of China (国家民族事务委员会经济发展司) (2003). 《2000年人口普查中国民族人口资料》 (in Chinese (China)).

Its border includes two-thirds of the length of China's border with the country of Mongolia. Inner Mongolia also accounts for a small section of China's border with Russia (Zabaykalsky Krai). Its capital is Hohhot; other major cities include Baotou, Chifeng, Tongliao, and Ordos.\n\n\nThe autonomous region was established in 1947, incorporating the areas of the former Republic of China provinces of Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Liaobei, and Xing'an, along with the northern parts of Gansu and Ningxia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hohhot Economic and Technological Development Zone\n* Hohhot Export Processing Zone\n* Manzhouli Border Economic Cooperation Area\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nLines wholly or partly in Inner Mongolia include:\n\n\n\n* Beijing–Baotou railway (Jingbao railway)\n* Baotou–Lanzhou railway\n* Beijing–Tongliao railway\n* Harbin–Manzhouli railway\n* Jiayuguan–Ceke railway\n* Jining–Tongliao railway\n* Linhe–Ceke railway\n* Nenjiang–Greater Khingan Forest railway\n* Tongliao–Ranghulu railway\n\n\nRailway stations in Inner Mongolia include:\n\n\n\n* List of stations on Jingbao railway\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Inner Mongolia\n\nSee also: List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, articles 112–122, autonomous regions have limited autonomy in both the political and economic arena. Autonomous regions have more discretion in administering economic policy in the region in accordance with national guidelines. Structurally, the Chairman—who legally must be an ethnic minority and is usually ethnic Mongolian—is always kept in check by the Communist Party Regional Committee Secretary, who is usually from a different part of China (to reduce corruption) and Han Chinese. As of May 2023[update], the current party secretary is Sun Shaocheng. The Inner Mongolian government and its subsidiaries follow roughly the same structure as that of a Chinese province. With regards to economic policy, as a part of increased federalism characteristics in China, Inner Mongolia has become more independent in implementing its own economic roadmap.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese prefecture-level divisions are in turn subdivided into 102 county-level divisions, including 22 districts, 11 county-level cities, 17 counties, 49 banners, and 3 autonomous banners.

Well-known Inner Mongolian enterprises include companies such as ERDOS, Yili, and Mengniu. As with much of China, economic growth has led to a boom in construction, including new commercial development and large apartment complexes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the administration of Ulanhu was purged, and a wave of repressions was initiated against the Mongol population of the autonomous region.[28] Among the victims in Inner Mongolia, 75 per cent were Mongols, even though they only constituted 10 per cent of the population.[29] In 1969, much of Inner Mongolia was distributed among surrounding provinces, with Hulunbuir divided between Heilongjiang and Jilin, Jirim going to Jilin, Juu Uda to Liaoning, and the Alashan and Ejine region divided among Gansu and Ningxia. This decision was reversed in 1979.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInner Mongolia is divided into twelve prefecture-level divisions. Until the late 1990s, most of Inner Mongolia's prefectural regions were known as *Leagues* (Chinese: 盟), a usage retained from Mongol divisions of the Qing dynasty. Similarly, county-level divisions are often known as *Banners* (Chinese: 旗). Since the 1990s, numerous Leagues have converted into prefecture-level cities, although Banners remain. The restructuring led to the conversion of primate cities in most leagues to convert to districts administratively (i.e.: Hailar, Jining and Dongsheng). Some newly founded prefecture-level cities have chosen to retain the original name of League (i.e.: Hulunbuir, Bayannur and Ulanqab), some have adopted the Chinese name of their primate city (Chifeng, Tongliao), and one League (Yekejuu) simply renamed itself Ordos. Despite these recent administrative changes, there is no indication that the Alxa, Hinggan, and Xilingol Leagues will convert to prefecture-level cities in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nInner Mongolia topics\n |\n| --- |\n| Hohhot (capital)\n |\n| General | * History\n* Politics\n* Independence movement\n* Economy\n* Administrative divisions\n |\n| Geography | * Cities\n* Gobi Desert\n* Tengger Desert\n* Climate\n |\n| Education | * Inner Mongolia University\n* Inner Mongolia Normal University\n* Chifeng University\n |\n| Culture | * Music of Inner Mongolia\n* Mongolian language (in Inner Mongolia)\n* Mongolian script\n* Northeastern Mandarin\n* Plain Blue Banner\n |\n| Cuisine | * Hot pot\n |\n| Visitor attractions | * Shiretu Juu\n* Zhaojun Tomb\n* Mausoleum of Genghis Khan\n* Hexigten Global Geopark\n* Wanbu Huayanjing Pagoda\n |\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Commons**\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCounty-level divisions of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region\n |\n| --- |\n| Hohhot (capital)\n |\n| Prefecture-level  cities | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMongols are the second largest ethnic group, comprising 17.7% of the population as of the 2020 census.[60] They include many diverse Mongolian-speaking groups; groups such as the Buryats and the Oirats are also officially considered to be Mongols in China. In addition to the Manchus, other Tungusic ethnic groups, the Oroqen, and the Evenks also populate parts of northeastern Inner Mongolia. There is also a significant number of Hui and Koreans.\n\n\nMany of the traditionally nomadic Mongols have settled in permanent homes as their pastoral economy was collectivised during the Mao era, and some have taken jobs in cities as migrant labourers; however, some Mongols continue in their nomadic tradition. In practice, highly educated Mongols tend to migrate to big urban centers after which they become essentially indistinct with ethnic Han Chinese populations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** Min Junqing. *The Present Situation and Characteristics of Contemporary Islam in China*.

While the Hetao region along the Yellow River has always alternated between farmers from the south and nomads from the north, the most recent wave of Han Chinese migration began in the early 18th century with encouragement from the Qing dynasty, and continued into the 20th century. Han Chinese live mostly in the Hetao region as well as various population centres in central and eastern Inner Mongolia.

During the Warring States period, King Wuling (340–295 BC) of the state of Zhao based in what is now Hebei and Shanxi Provinces pursued an expansionist policy towards the region. After destroying the Dí state of Zhongshan in what is now Hebei province, he defeated the Linhu and Loufan and created the Yunzhong Commandery near modern Hohhot. King Wuling of Zhao also built a long wall stretching through the Hetao region. After Qin Shi Huang created the first unified Chinese empire in 221 BC, he sent the general Meng Tian to drive the Xiongnu from the region and incorporated the old Zhao wall into the Qin dynasty Great Wall of China. He also maintained two commanderies in the region: Jiuyuan and Yunzhong and moved 30,000 households there to solidify the region. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia speak a variety of dialects, depending on the region.

In the extreme southwest is the edge of the Tibetan Plateau where the autonomous region's highest peak, Main Peak in the Helan Mountains reaches 3,556 metres (11,670 ft), and is still being pushed up today in short bursts.[2] Most of Inner Mongolia is a plateau averaging around 1,200 metres (3,940 ft) in altitude and covered by extensive loess and sand deposits. The northern part consists of the Mesozoic era Khingan Mountains, and is owing to the cooler climate more forested, chiefly with Manchurian elm, ash, birch, Mongolian oak and a number of pine and spruce species. Where discontinuous permafrost is present north of Hailar District, forests are almost exclusively coniferous. In the south, the natural vegetation is grassland in the east and very sparse in the arid west, and grazing is the dominant economic activity.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Taoxi Mongolia\": The Alashan Öölüd and Ejine Torghuud banners were separate from the aimags of Outer Mongolia and the chuulghans of Inner Mongolia.

The standard pronunciation of Mongolian in China is based on the Chakhar dialect of the Plain Blue Banner, located in central Inner Mongolia, while the grammar is based on all Inner Mongolian dialects.[79] This is different from the Mongolian state, where the standard pronunciation is based on the closely related Khalkha dialect. There are a number of independent languages spoken in Hulunbuir such as the somewhat more distant Mongolic language Dagur and the Tungusic language Evenki. Officially, even the Evenki dialect Oroqin is considered a language.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** Iredale, Robyn; Bilik, Naran; Fei, Guo (2 August 2003). \"4\". *China's Minorities on the Move: Selected Case Studies*. p. 84.\n73. **^** Janhunen, Juha (29 November 2012). \"1\". *Mongolian*.

During that time Ongud and Khunggirad peoples dominated the area of what is now Inner Mongolia. After the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Han-led Ming dynasty in 1368, the Ming captured parts of Inner Mongolia including Shangdu and Yingchang.

For about ten years since 2000, Inner Mongolia's GDP growth has been the highest in the country, (along with Guangdong) largely owing to the success of natural resource industries in the region. GDP growth has continually been over 10%, even 15% and connections with the Wolf Economy to the north has helped development. However, growth has come at a cost with huge amounts of pollution and degradation to the grasslands.[30] Attempts to attract ethnic Chinese to migrate from other regions, as well as urbanise those rural nomads and peasants has led to huge amounts of corruption and waste in public spending, such as Ordos City.[31][32] Acute uneven wealth distribution has further exacerbated ethnic tensions, many indigenous Mongolians feeling they are increasingly marginalised in their own homeland, leading to riots in 2011 and 2013.[33][34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Population by urban areas of prefecture & county cities\n |\n| --- |\n| # | City | Urban area[44] | District area[44] | City proper[44] | Census date\n |\n| 1 | Baotou | 1,900,373 | 2,096,851 | 2,650,364 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 2 | **Hohhot** | 1,497,110 | 1,980,774 | 2,866,615 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 3 | Chifeng | 902,285 | 1,333,526 | 4,341,245 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 4 | Tongliao | 540,338 | 898,895 | 3,139,153 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 5 | Ordos[i] | 510,242 | 582,544 | 1,940,653 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 6 | Wuhai | 502,704 | 532,902 | 532,902 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 7 | Bayannur | 354,507 | 541,721 | 1,669,915 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 8 | Yakeshi | 338,275 | 352,173 | *see Hulunbuir* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 9 | Hulunbuir[ii] | 327,384 | 344,934 | 2,549,252 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| (9) | Hulunbuir (new district)[ii] | 99,960 | 99,960 | *see Hulunbuir* | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 10 | Ulanqab | 319,723 | 356,135 | 2,143,590 | 2010-11-01\n |\n| 11 | Ulanhot | 276,406 | 327,081 | *part of Hinggan League* | 2010-11-01\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** Amy Qin (31 August 2020). \"Curbs on Mongolian Language Teaching Prompt Large Protests in China\". *The New York Times*.

Due to its long span from east to west, Inner Mongolia is geographically divided into eastern and western divisions. The eastern division is often included in Northeastern China (Dongbei), with major cities including Tongliao, Chifeng, Hailar, and Ulanhot. The western division is included in North China, with major cities including Baotou and Hohhot. It recorded a population of 24,706,321 in the 2010 census, accounting for 1.84% of Mainland China's total population. Inner Mongolia is the country's 23rd most populous province-level division.[8] The majority of the population in the region are Han Chinese, with a sizeable Mongol minority close to 5,000,000 (2019) which is the largest Mongolian population in the world (bigger than that of the country Mongolia). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**█** **Jiagedaqi Dist. & Songling Dist.is de jure part of Oroqen Aut.

The region is also a source of crude oil, with sites such as the Xifeng oil field producing tens of thousands of barrels per day.[46] However, in the past, the exploitation and utilisation of resources were rather inefficient, which resulted in poor returns from rich resources. Inner Mongolia is also an important coal production base, with more than a quarter of the world's coal reserves located in the province.[47] It plans to double annual coal output by 2010 (from the 2005 volume of 260 million tons) to 500 million tons of coal a year.[48]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Republic of China reorganised Inner Mongolia into provinces:\n\n\n\n* Rehe province was created to include the Juuuda and Josutu leagues, plus the Chengde area in what is now northern Hebei.\n* Chahar province was created to include Xilingol league as well as much of the former territory of the Eight Banners.\n* Suiyuan province was created to include Ulanqab league, Yekejuu league, and the Hetao region (former Guihua Tümed territory).\n* Hulunbuir stayed within Heilongjiang in Manchuria, which had become a province.\n* Most of Jirim league came under the new province of Fengtian in southern Manchuria.\n* Taoxi Mongolia, i.e., Alashan and Ejine leagues, was incorporated into neighbouring Gansu province. Later on Ningxia province was split out of northern Gansu, and Taoxi Mongolia became part of Ningxia.\n\n\nSome Republic of China maps still show this structure.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** National Bureau of Population and Social Science and Technology Statistics Division of China (国家统计局人口和社会科技统计司); Department of Economic Development of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission of China (国家民族事务委员会经济发展司) (2003). 《2000年人口普查中国民族人口资料》 (in Chinese (China)).

Its border includes two-thirds of the length of China's border with the country of Mongolia. Inner Mongolia also accounts for a small section of China's border with Russia (Zabaykalsky Krai). Its capital is Hohhot; other major cities include Baotou, Chifeng, Tongliao, and Ordos.\n\n\nThe autonomous region was established in 1947, incorporating the areas of the former Republic of China provinces of Suiyuan, Chahar, Rehe, Liaobei, and Xing'an, along with the northern parts of Gansu and Ningxia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hohhot Economic and Technological Development Zone\n* Hohhot Export Processing Zone\n* Manzhouli Border Economic Cooperation Area\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nLines wholly or partly in Inner Mongolia include:\n\n\n\n* Beijing–Baotou railway (Jingbao railway)\n* Baotou–Lanzhou railway\n* Beijing–Tongliao railway\n* Harbin–Manzhouli railway\n* Jiayuguan–Ceke railway\n* Jining–Tongliao railway\n* Linhe–Ceke railway\n* Nenjiang–Greater Khingan Forest railway\n* Tongliao–Ranghulu railway\n\n\nRailway stations in Inner Mongolia include:\n\n\n\n* List of stations on Jingbao railway\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Inner Mongolia\n\nSee also: List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, articles 112–122, autonomous regions have limited autonomy in both the political and economic arena. Autonomous regions have more discretion in administering economic policy in the region in accordance with national guidelines. Structurally, the Chairman—who legally must be an ethnic minority and is usually ethnic Mongolian—is always kept in check by the Communist Party Regional Committee Secretary, who is usually from a different part of China (to reduce corruption) and Han Chinese. As of May 2023[update], the current party secretary is Sun Shaocheng. The Inner Mongolian government and its subsidiaries follow roughly the same structure as that of a Chinese province. With regards to economic policy, as a part of increased federalism characteristics in China, Inner Mongolia has become more independent in implementing its own economic roadmap.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese prefecture-level divisions are in turn subdivided into 102 county-level divisions, including 22 districts, 11 county-level cities, 17 counties, 49 banners, and 3 autonomous banners.

Well-known Inner Mongolian enterprises include companies such as ERDOS, Yili, and Mengniu. As with much of China, economic growth has led to a boom in construction, including new commercial development and large apartment complexes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the administration of Ulanhu was purged, and a wave of repressions was initiated against the Mongol population of the autonomous region.[28] Among the victims in Inner Mongolia, 75 per cent were Mongols, even though they only constituted 10 per cent of the population.[29] In 1969, much of Inner Mongolia was distributed among surrounding provinces, with Hulunbuir divided between Heilongjiang and Jilin, Jirim going to Jilin, Juu Uda to Liaoning, and the Alashan and Ejine region divided among Gansu and Ningxia. This decision was reversed in 1979.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInner Mongolia is divided into twelve prefecture-level divisions. Until the late 1990s, most of Inner Mongolia's prefectural regions were known as *Leagues* (Chinese: 盟), a usage retained from Mongol divisions of the Qing dynasty. Similarly, county-level divisions are often known as *Banners* (Chinese: 旗). Since the 1990s, numerous Leagues have converted into prefecture-level cities, although Banners remain. The restructuring led to the conversion of primate cities in most leagues to convert to districts administratively (i.e.: Hailar, Jining and Dongsheng). Some newly founded prefecture-level cities have chosen to retain the original name of League (i.e.: Hulunbuir, Bayannur and Ulanqab), some have adopted the Chinese name of their primate city (Chifeng, Tongliao), and one League (Yekejuu) simply renamed itself Ordos. Despite these recent administrative changes, there is no indication that the Alxa, Hinggan, and Xilingol Leagues will convert to prefecture-level cities in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nInner Mongolia topics\n |\n| --- |\n| Hohhot (capital)\n |\n| General | * History\n* Politics\n* Independence movement\n* Economy\n* Administrative divisions\n |\n| Geography | * Cities\n* Gobi Desert\n* Tengger Desert\n* Climate\n |\n| Education | * Inner Mongolia University\n* Inner Mongolia Normal University\n* Chifeng University\n |\n| Culture | * Music of Inner Mongolia\n* Mongolian language (in Inner Mongolia)\n* Mongolian script\n* Northeastern Mandarin\n* Plain Blue Banner\n |\n| Cuisine | * Hot pot\n |\n| Visitor attractions | * Shiretu Juu\n* Zhaojun Tomb\n* Mausoleum of Genghis Khan\n* Hexigten Global Geopark\n* Wanbu Huayanjing Pagoda\n |\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Commons**\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCounty-level divisions of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region\n |\n| --- |\n| Hohhot (capital)\n |\n| Prefecture-level  cities | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMongols are the second largest ethnic group, comprising 17.7% of the population as of the 2020 census.[60] They include many diverse Mongolian-speaking groups; groups such as the Buryats and the Oirats are also officially considered to be Mongols in China. In addition to the Manchus, other Tungusic ethnic groups, the Oroqen, and the Evenks also populate parts of northeastern Inner Mongolia. There is also a significant number of Hui and Koreans.\n\n\nMany of the traditionally nomadic Mongols have settled in permanent homes as their pastoral economy was collectivised during the Mao era, and some have taken jobs in cities as migrant labourers; however, some Mongols continue in their nomadic tradition. In practice, highly educated Mongols tend to migrate to big urban centers after which they become essentially indistinct with ethnic Han Chinese populations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** Min Junqing. *The Present Situation and Characteristics of Contemporary Islam in China*.

While the Hetao region along the Yellow River has always alternated between farmers from the south and nomads from the north, the most recent wave of Han Chinese migration began in the early 18th century with encouragement from the Qing dynasty, and continued into the 20th century. Han Chinese live mostly in the Hetao region as well as various population centres in central and eastern Inner Mongolia.

During the Warring States period, King Wuling (340–295 BC) of the state of Zhao based in what is now Hebei and Shanxi Provinces pursued an expansionist policy towards the region. After destroying the Dí state of Zhongshan in what is now Hebei province, he defeated the Linhu and Loufan and created the Yunzhong Commandery near modern Hohhot. King Wuling of Zhao also built a long wall stretching through the Hetao region. After Qin Shi Huang created the first unified Chinese empire in 221 BC, he sent the general Meng Tian to drive the Xiongnu from the region and incorporated the old Zhao wall into the Qin dynasty Great Wall of China. He also maintained two commanderies in the region: Jiuyuan and Yunzhong and moved 30,000 households there to solidify the region. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Han Chinese of Inner Mongolia speak a variety of dialects, depending on the region.

In the extreme southwest is the edge of the Tibetan Plateau where the autonomous region's highest peak, Main Peak in the Helan Mountains reaches 3,556 metres (11,670 ft), and is still being pushed up today in short bursts.[2] Most of Inner Mongolia is a plateau averaging around 1,200 metres (3,940 ft) in altitude and covered by extensive loess and sand deposits. The northern part consists of the Mesozoic era Khingan Mountains, and is owing to the cooler climate more forested, chiefly with Manchurian elm, ash, birch, Mongolian oak and a number of pine and spruce species. Where discontinuous permafrost is present north of Hailar District, forests are almost exclusively coniferous. In the south, the natural vegetation is grassland in the east and very sparse in the arid west, and grazing is the dominant economic activity.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Taoxi Mongolia\": The Alashan Öölüd and Ejine Torghuud banners were separate from the aimags of Outer Mongolia and the chuulghans of Inner Mongolia.

The standard pronunciation of Mongolian in China is based on the Chakhar dialect of the Plain Blue Banner, located in central Inner Mongolia, while the grammar is based on all Inner Mongolian dialects.[79] This is different from the Mongolian state, where the standard pronunciation is based on the closely related Khalkha dialect. There are a number of independent languages spoken in Hulunbuir such as the somewhat more distant Mongolic language Dagur and the Tungusic language Evenki. Officially, even the Evenki dialect Oroqin is considered a language.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** Iredale, Robyn; Bilik, Naran; Fei, Guo (2 August 2003). \"4\". *China's Minorities on the Move: Selected Case Studies*. p. 84.\n73. **^** Janhunen, Juha (29 November 2012). \"1\". *Mongolian*.

During that time Ongud and Khunggirad peoples dominated the area of what is now Inner Mongolia. After the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Han-led Ming dynasty in 1368, the Ming captured parts of Inner Mongolia including Shangdu and Yingchang.
