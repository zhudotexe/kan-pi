Accessible worldwide,[7] it was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. It is owned by Google and is the second most visited website in the world, after Google Search. YouTube has more than 2.5 billion monthly users,[8] who collectively watch more than one billion hours of videos every day.[9] As of May 2019[update], videos were being uploaded to the platform at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYouTube began as a venture capital–funded technology startup. Between November 2005 and April 2006, the company raised money from various investors, with Sequoia Capital and Artis Capital Management being the largest two.[14][21] YouTube's early headquarters were situated above a pizzeria and a Japanese restaurant in San Mateo, California.[22] In February 2005, the company activated `www.youtube.com`.[23] The first video was uploaded on April 23, 2005. Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[24][25] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[26][27] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day.[28][29] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** Higgens, Bill (October 5, 2017). \"Hollywood Flashback: 'SNL's' 'Lazy Sunday' Put YouTube on the Map in 2005\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of $9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** \"Hurley stepping down as YouTube chief executive\".

Despite its growth and success, it has been widely criticized for allegedly facilitating the spread of misinformation and the sharing of copyrighted content, routinely violating its users' privacy, enabling censorship, endangering child safety and wellbeing, and for its inconsistent or incorrect implementation of platform guidelines.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of YouTube\n\n### Founding and initial growth (2005–2006)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)YouTube logo since 2017\nSusan Wojcicki was appointed CEO of YouTube in February 2014.[59] In January 2016, YouTube expanded its headquarters in San Bruno by purchasing an office park for $215 million. The complex has 51,468 square metres (554,000 square feet) of space and can house up to 2,800 employees.[60] YouTube officially launched the \"polymer\" redesign of its user interfaces based on Material Design language as its default, as well a redesigned logo that is built around the service's play button emblem in August 2017.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince its purchase by Google, YouTube has expanded beyond the core website into mobile apps, network television, and the ability to link with other platforms. Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros.

When a video is uploaded, it is checked against the database, and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is found.[304] When this occurs, the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable, tracking the viewing statistics of the video, or adding advertisements to the video.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n119. **^** \"Saying Goodbye to YouTube's Community Contributions feature after September 28, 2020\".

It was distinct from the company's main Android app and allowed videos to be downloaded and shared with other users. It also allowed users to preview videos, share downloaded videos through Bluetooth, and offered more options for mobile data control and video resolution.[454]\n\n\nIn February 2017, *YouTube Go* was launched in India, and expanded in November 2017 to 14 other countries, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Kenya, and South Africa.[455][456] On February 1, 2018, it was rolled out in 130 countries worldwide, including Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and Iraq. Before it shut down, the app was available to around 60% of the world's population.[457][458] In May 2022, Google announced that they would be shutting down *YouTube Go* in August 2022.[459]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe choice of the name `www.youtube.com` led to problems for a similarly named website, `www.utube.com`.

The trio were early employees of PayPal, which had been bought by eBay. YouTube was launched on February 14, 2005. The idea for YouTube initially came from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, where Karim couldn't easily find video clips of the incident online.\n\nGoogle acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in November 2006, turning it into a subsidiary. The acquisition led to the slogan \"Broadcast Yourself.\" YouTube's headquarters are in San Bruno, California, and the platform is available worldwide, with localized versions in 104 countries.\n\nYouTube has grown to become one of Google's most successful ventures, with over 2.5 billion monthly users and over 1 billion hours of videos watched every day. It has expanded from just video sharing to include services like YouTube Kids, YouTube Music, YouTube Premium, YouTube TV, and YouTube Shorts. YouTube has also faced various controversies, including copyright issues, inappropriate content, and allegations of censorship.\n\n### YouTube Shorts\n\nYouTube Shorts is a short-form video platform introduced to compete with TikTok. It allows users to create and share short videos, typically 15 to 60 seconds long. The feature is integrated into the main YouTube app and is available in various countries.\n\n### List of YouTubers\n\nA YouTuber is a content creator who produces videos for the YouTube platform. Notable YouTubers include individuals and groups that have gained significant followings and influence. The list of YouTubers is extensive and includes a variety of genres such as vlogging, gaming, comedy, education, and more.\n\n### YouTube Premium\n\nYouTube Premium is a subscription service that offers ad-free streaming, access to original content, and features like background play and offline downloads. It was initially launched as YouTube Red and later rebranded as YouTube Premium.\n\n### Me at the zoo\n\n\"Me at the zoo\" is the first video uploaded to YouTube. It features co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and was uploaded on April 23, 2005.\n\n### YouTube Rewind\n\nYouTube Rewind was an annual video series that recapped the year's most popular content and trends on the platform.
