Seoul proper comprises 605.25\u00a0km2 (233.69\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[3] with a radius of approximately 15\u00a0km (9\u00a0mi), roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Seoul\n\n\n\n|  Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 17\n\n\n\n2\n\n\u22126\n | 28\n\n\n\n5\n\n\u22123\n | 37\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 73\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeoul is geographically set in a mountainous and hilly terrain, with Bukhan Mountain positioned on its northern edge. Within the Seoul Capital Area lie five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong, and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon dynasty.[12] Furthermore, Seoul has witnessed a surge in modern architectural development, with iconic landmarks including the N Seoul Tower, the 63 Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World, the Trade Tower, COEX, IFC Seoul, and Parc1. Seoul was named the World Design Capital in 2010 and has served as the national hub for the music, entertainment, and cultural industries that have propelled K-pop and the Korean Wave to international prominence.\n\n\n\n\n## Toponomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Seoul\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The National Museum of Korea\n![](image)The War Memorial of Korea\nSeoul is home to 115 museums,[123] including four national and nine official municipal museums. The National Museum of Korea has a collection of 220,000 artifacts.[124] The National Folk Museum is located on the grounds of Gyeongbokgung and focuses on the daily life of historical Koreans.[125] Bukchon Hanok Village and Namsangol Hanok Village are old residential districts consisting of *hanok* (traditional Korean houses).[126][127]\n\n\nThe War Memorial covers the history of wars that Korea has been involved with, especially the Korean War.[128][129] Seodaemun Prison is a former prison built during the Japanese occupation, and is used as a historic museum.[130]\n\n\nThe Seoul Museum of Art, Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, and Ilmin Museum of Art are art museums in the city.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Religious monuments[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. **^** \"\uc11c\uc6b8\ud2b9\ubcc4\uc2dc\uccad Seoul Metropolitan Government\" (in Korean).

One of the most famous parks is Namsan Park, which offers recreational hiking and views of the downtown Seoul skyline, especially via its N Seoul Tower. Seoul Olympic Park, located in Songpa District and built to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, is the largest park. The areas near the stream Tancheon are popular for exercise. Cheonggyecheon also has spaces for recreation. In 2017 the Seoullo 7017 Skypark opened, spanning diagonally overtop Seoul Station.\n\n\nThere are also many parks along the Han River, such as Ichon Hangang Park, Yeouido Hangang Park, Mangwon Hangang Park, Nanji Hangang Park, Banpo Hangang Park, Ttukseom Hangang Park and Jamsil Hangang Park. The Seoul National Capital Area also contains a green belt aimed at preventing the city from sprawling out into neighboring Gyeonggi Province. These areas are frequently sought after by people looking to escape from urban life on weekends and during vacations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter World War II and the liberation of Korea, the city took its present name, which originated from the Korean word meaning \"capital city\", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, *Seorabeol* (\uc11c\ub77c\ubc8c; \u5f90\u7f85\u4f10), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.[16] Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Chinese-style name *Geumseong* (\u91d1\u57ce, literally \"Gold Castle or City\" or \"Metal Castle or City\"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name *Seorabeol* had the same meaning as *Geumseong*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnlike most place names in Korea, \"Seoul\" has no corresponding Hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language). On 18 January 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic *Hancheng* (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u57ce; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u57ce; pinyin: *H\u00e0nch\u00e9ng*) to *Shou'er* (\u9996\u5c14; \u9996\u723e; *Sh\u01d2u'\u011br*).[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Seoul\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Stephen Hamnett, Dean Forbes, ed.

Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.[116] Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,[117][118] on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of Gangnam District, Seocho District and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n### Historical architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCapital of South Korea\n\nThis article is about the capital city of South Korea.

As South Korea's economy started to grow rapidly from the 1960s, urbanization also accelerated and workers began to move to Seoul and other larger cities.[46] From the 1970s, the size of Seoul administrative area greatly expanded as it annexed a number of towns and villages from several surrounding counties.[47]\n\n\nUntil 1972, Seoul was claimed by North Korea as its *de jure* capital, being specified as such in Article 103 of the 1948 North Korean constitution.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe city has been known in the past by the names Wiryeseong (\uc704\ub840\uc131; \u6170\u79ae\u57ce, during the Baekje era), Bukhansangun (\ubd81\ud55c\uc0b0\uad70; \u5317\u6f22\u5c71\u90e1 during the Goguryeo era), Namcheon (\ub0a8\ucc9c; \u5357\u5ddd,[13] during the Silla era), Hanyang (\ud55c\uc591; \u6f22\u967d, during the Northern and Southern States period), Namgyeong(\ub0a8\uacbd; \u5357\u4eac, during Goryeo era), Hanseong (\ud55c\uc131; \u6f22\u57ce, during the Joseon era), and Keij\u014d (\u4eac\u57ce) or Gyeongseong (\uacbd\uc131; \u4eac\u57ce) during Japanese rule.[14]\n\n\nDuring Japan's annexation of Korea, *Hanseong* (\u6f22\u57ce) was renamed *Keij\u014d* (\u4eac\u57ce) by the Imperial authorities to prevent confusion with the Hanja '\u6f22' (a transliteration of an ancient Korean word *Han* (\ud55c) meaning \"great\"), which also refers to Han people or the Han dynasty in Chinese and in Japanese is a term for \"China\".[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe World Trade Center Seoul, located in Gangnam District, hosts various expositions and conferences.

The city has grown beyond those walls and although the wall no longer stands (except along Bugaksan Mountain (\ubd81\uc545\uc0b0; \u5317\u5cb3\u5c71), north of the downtown area[37]), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, including most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as Dongdaemun).[38] During the Joseon dynasty, the gates were opened and closed each day, accompanied by the ringing of large bells at the Bosingak belfry.[39] In the late 19th century, after hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its gates to foreigners and began to modernize. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to introduce electricity in the royal palace, built by the Edison Illuminating Company[40] and a decade later Seoul also implemented electrical street lights.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeoul proper is noted for its population density, which is almost twice that of New York City and eight times greater than Rome.

As of 2021, the population is 9.59 million.[81][82] As of the end of June 2011, 10.29\u00a0million Republic of Korea citizens lived in the city. This was a 0.24% decrease from the end of 2010. The population of Seoul has been dropping since the early 1990s, the reasons being the high costs of living, urban sprawling to Gyeonggi region's satellite bed cities and an aging population.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeoul is among the world leaders in Internet connectivity, being the capital of South Korea, which has the world's highest fiber-optic broadband penetration and highest global average internet speeds of 26.1 Mbit/s.[112][113] Since 2015, Seoul has provided free Wi-Fi access in outdoor spaces through a 47.7\u00a0billion won ($44\u00a0million) project with Internet access at 10,430 parks, streets and other public places.[114] Internet speeds in some apartment buildings reach up to 52.5Gbit/s with assistance from Nokia, and though the average standard consists of 100 Mbit/s services, providers nationwide are rapidly rolling out 1Gbit/s connections at the equivalent of US$20 per month.[115] In addition, the city is served by the KTX high-speed rail and the Seoul Subway, which provides 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, and DMB inside subway cars. 5G will be introduced commercially in March 2019 in Seoul.\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of South Korea\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Yeouido, the main financial district of Seoul\nSeoul hosts large concentration of headquarters of International companies and banks, including 15 companies on Fortune 500 list such as Samsung, LG and Hyundai.[97] Most bank headquarters and the Korea Exchange are located in Yeouido (Yeoui island),[93] which is often called \"South Korea's Wall Street\" and has been serving as the financial center of the city since the 1980s.[98] The Seoul international finance center & SIFC MALL, Hanhwa 63 building, the Hanhwa insurance company head office.

Palgong, Mt. Biseul, and Mt. Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, Buddhist temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens. Mt. Palgong has a cable car to the summit.[40] There are also hiking trails in the direction of the Donghwasa Temple and Sutaegol Valley.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeginning in the late 1890s, increasing numbers of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed Gyeongbu Line main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.\n\n\nIn 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. As a tribute to the wall, streets that now run where the wall once stood have been named Bukseongno, Namseongno, Dongseongno and Seoseongno, which translates as \"north fortress street\", \"south fortress street\", \"east fortress street\" and \"west fortress street\" respectively.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n{| style=\"width:.5ex;margin:2px;padding:1px;border:1px solid #000000;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n|\u5927\u00a0\u00b7\u90b1\n|\n\n\n\n|} Emblem of Taikyu-fu (Daegu Prefecture), when Daegu was under Japanese rule\n![](image)\nDaegu Metropolitan City Characters\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* You may also add the template `{{Translated|ko|\ub300\uad6c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc}}` to the talk page.\n* For more guidance, see Wikipedia:Translation.\n |\n\n\nMetropolitan city in Yeongnam, South Korea\n\n\n| Daegu\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The sign of the Seomun Market\nSub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in Dalseo-gu is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around Kyungpook National University in Buk-gu. *Deuran-gil* (means the street inside the field) in Suseong-gu is known for many restaurants.\n\n\nThe city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as Seomun Market and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.\n\n\n\n### Festivals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1st view Palgongsan\n* ![2nd view of Biseulsan](image)\n\n2nd view of Biseulsan\n* ![3rd view Gangjeong Goryeong Weir (The Arc)](image)\n\n3rd view Gangjeong Goryeong Weir (The Ark)\n* ![4 Scenic Sincheon](image)\n\n4th Scenic Sincheon\n* ![5 Scenic Spots Suseongmot Lake](image)\n\n5th Scenic Spots Suseongmot Lake\n* ![6 Scenic Dalseongtoseong Fortress](image)\n\n6th Dalseongtoseong Fortress\n* ![7 Scenic Gyeongsang Gamyeong Park](image)\n\n7th Gyeongsang Gamyeong Park\n* ![8th National Debt Compensation Memorial Park](image)\n\n8th Scenic Spots: National Debt Compensation Memorial Park\n* ![9th view Dongseongro](image)\n\n9th view Dongseongro\n* ![10th Seomun Market](image)\n\n10th Seomun Market\n* ![11th Scenery 83 Tower](image)\n\n11th Scenery 83 Tower\n* ![12th view Daegu Stadium](image)\n\n12th view Daegu Stadium\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nDaegu cuisine is similar to that consumed in the Yeongnam region.

The provincial government will be relocated to Andong in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. As a result, the provincial government office was relocated to Andong in January 2023. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced four Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Park Chung Hee, Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo-hwan were born in other cities but they moved to Daegu and spent childhood in Daegu. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"2021\ub144 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc18c\ub4dd(\uc7a0\uc815)\".\n2. **^** *EB* (1878), p.\u00a0390.\n3. **^** \"Photographic image of map\".

Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2\u00b728 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (\ub2ec\uad6c\ubc8c\ub300\uc885, \u9054\u53e5\u4f10\u5927\u9418), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called *Seokjeondaeje* is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\n\n\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\n\n\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYangnyeongsi (\uc57d\ub839\uc2dc, \u85e5\u4ee4\u5e02) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\n\n\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa\u2014a Buddhist temple that houses the *Tripitaka Koreana* (a woodblock edition of the *Tripitaka* and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n\n### Mountains and parks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of parks in Daegu\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the *Tripitaka Koreana* was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.[12] However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.[13]\n\n\n\n### Joseon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daegu in the 18th century\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty, being located in the middle of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan, at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\n\n\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Daegu skyline as seen from KNU's Technopark\nGenerally, Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city.

The main railroad of the country, Gyeongbu Line passes through the city. The largest railroad station in the city, Dongdaegu Station, has the second largest passenger traffic in Korea after Seoul Station, it is the number one station in Korea for train stops, and the largest train traffic.[54] All trains passing through Dongdaegu Station make a mandatory stop. The station re-opened in 2004 after extensive renovations serving the KTX highspeed train, Saemaul and Mugunghwa trains. All kinds of trains except KTX depart from Daegu Station, an all-new building with cinemas, restaurants and a department store, located near the city centre. It has the tenth largest passenger traffic in Korea.[54] Daegu Line branches off from Gacheon station of Gyeongbu Line.\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daegu Metro\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (*Gyeongju Choi* clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (*Nampyeong Mun'*s). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (\uacbd\uc0c1\uac10\uc601, \u6176\u5c19\u76e3\u71df) and Daegu-hyanggyo (\ub300\uad6c\ud5a5\uad50, \u5927\u90b1\u9115\u6821) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (\uc601\ub0a8\uc81c\uc77c\ubb38, \u5dba\u5357\u7b2c\u4e00\u9580, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea[39] and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\n\n\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n\n![](image)Daegu International Future Auto EXPO 2017\n![](image)Korean ICT Convergence Expo\n![](image)Korean Brain Research Center - Advanced Equipment Center\n![](image)2017 Green Energy Expo\n### Fashion industry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions\nMain article: List of districts and county of Daegu\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (*Gu*) and 2 counties (*Gun*)\n\n\n\n* Jung District (\uc911\uad6c, \u4e2d\u5340) \u2013 *means the central district.*\n* Dong District (\ub3d9\uad6c, \u6771\u5340) \u2013 *means the east district.*\n* Seo District (\uc11c\uad6c, \u897f\u5340) \u2013 *means the west district.*\n* Nam District (\ub0a8\uad6c, \u5357\u5340) \u2013 *means the south district.*\n* Buk District (\ubd81\uad6c, \u5317\u5340) \u2013 *means the north district.*\n* Suseong District (\uc218\uc131\uad6c, \u58fd\u57ce\u5340)\n* Dalseo District (\ub2ec\uc11c\uad6c, \u9054\u897f\u5340)\n* Dalseong County (\ub2ec\uc131\uad70, \u9054\u57ce\u90e1)\n* Gunwi County (\uad70\uc704\uad70, \u8ecd\u5a01\u90e1)\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (*Jikhalsi*), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (*Gwangyeoksi*) in 1995.

World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\n\n\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location.

Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5\u00a0million.\n\n\nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula.

It remains the deadliest deliberate loss of life in a single incident in South Korean peacetime history.\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Leaders[edit]\n\n\n* Roh Tae-woo \u2013 army general and thirteenth president of South Korea\n* Park Geun-hye \u2013 former president of South Korea, from 2013 to 2017, daughter of former president Park Chung Hee\n\n\n### Industrialists[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGlobal schools:\n\n\n\n* Daegu Sindang Elementary School\n\n\nDaegu Sindang Elementary School is a public elementary school located in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The school's motto is \"To raise children who are upright, wise, and strong\", and its emblem and flower are the magnolia and pine tree, respectively. Daegu Sindang Elementary School has a history of excellence in sports, music and academics, and has won numerous awards in these fields. It is also a designated school for creative education and a leading school for after-school programmes. In 2020, a group of students from Daegu Sindang Elementary School won first place in the Korean National Championship of the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) robotics competition.[53]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892\u2013936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However, the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\n\n\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Cumings, Bruce (1998). *Korea's place in the sun: A modern history* (updated\u00a0ed.).

The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n\n### Korean Empire and colonial rule[edit]\n\n\nJapanese imperialism forcibly opened up Korea's markets beginning in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese war.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome large university hospitals make the city the medical hub of south-eastern Korea. The Kyungpook National University Hospital, founded as *Daegu-dongin-uiwon* in 1907 by the Japanese, is the best-known hospital in the city. The Dongsan Hospital (attached to Keimyung University), founded as *Jejungwon* in 1899, is one of the oldest western style medical clinics in Korea. The Yeungnam University Medical Center has the largest number of beds in the city. The yearly treatment amount of these tertiary hospitals is the second largest in South Korea after that of Seoul.[50] The Daegu Catholic University Medical Center is also included in them.\n\n\n\n### Primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\n* Hamji High School\n* Kangbuk High School\n* Maecheon High School\n* Seongsan High School\n\n\nInternational schools in Daegu include:\n\n\n\n* Daegu International School[51]\n* Daegu Chinese Elementary School or Korea Daeguhwagyo Elementary School (\ud55c\uad6d\ub300\uad6c\ud654\uad50\ucd08\ub4f1\ud559\uad50)[52]\n* Overseas Chinese High School, Daegu\n\n\n### Elementary schools[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)DGB Daegu Bank Park\nDaegu Football Club was founded as a community club at the end of 2002, and made their K League debut in 2003. Historically, Daegu have often placed in the lower reaches of the K League. Their best season to date has been 2021, when they finished third out of twelve teams. They were also the winners of the Korean FA Cup in 2018, which qualified the club for their first appearance in the AFC Champions League the following year. The club has since played in the 2021 and 2022 editions of AFC Champions League.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nThere are three terrestrial TV broadcasting stations in the city: KBS Daegu Broadcast Station, Daegu MBC, and TBC. These are affiliated companies of central broadcasting stations in Seoul just like other local broadcasting companies in South Korea. TBC (Taegu Broadcasting Corporation) depends on SBS. They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city. Each television broadcasting company has its own radio station as well.\n\n\n\n### International Daegu[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | You can help **expand this article with text translated from the corresponding article in Korean**. *(October 2023)* Click [show] for important translation instructions.\n* \n* Machine translation, like DeepL or Google Translate, is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the English Wikipedia.\n* Do not translate text that appears unreliable or low-quality.

It has the Jung-angno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (\ub300\uad6c\uc74d\uc131, \u5927\u90b1\u9091\u57ce, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.

The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.[37]\n\n\n\n## Culture and sightseeing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Like other metropolitan cities, incheon has a strong urban heat island effect.[17] Incheon's climate is about average compared to the rest of Korea, with 8 locations being cooler and 10 locations being warmer, and with 9 locations being wetter and 9 locations being drier.[18]\n\n\nIncheon experiences each of its four seasons, distinctly feeling the rise and fall of temperature and humidity. The temperature however, never rises to an extreme, and the climate of the city is essentially mild. Incheon is swept by the seasonal winds as the northwesterly winds strike the city in the winter and the summer in Incheon is affected by gusts of the warm southwesterly winds.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Percent possible sunshine | 43.3\n | 54.3\n | 53.9\n | 53.0\n | 51.4\n | 38.6\n | 28.6\n | 40.8\n | 54.5\n | 60.6\n | 49.3\n | 37.9\n | 46.8\n |\n| Source: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981\u20132010)[20][21][22] |\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nIncheon forms the heart of Capital Industrial Region. During the industrialization of South Korea, several industrial complexes were built throughout the city, and as a result, the city was largely dependent on manufacturing industry. But with the designation of Incheon Free Economic Zone in 2003, the city is now making an effort to foster new growth industries. Major industrial parks include Bupyeong industrial complex, which hosts GM Incheon plant(formerly a GM Daewoo Incheon plant), Juan industrial complex, and Namdong Industrial complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Kottek, M.; J.

The area underwent several name changes with successive kingdoms and dynasties. In Goryeo era, Incheon was called **Gyeongwon** (\uacbd\uc6d0) or **Inju** (\uc778\uc8fc). The current name was turned to Incheon in 1413. [*citation needed*] Later, Incheon County became Incheon Metropolitan Prefecture (dohobu, \ub3c4\ud638\ubd80). Old Incheon consisted of today's southern Incheon (i.e. Jung-gu, Dong-gu, Nam-gu, Yeonsu-gu, and Namdong-gu) and the northern part of Siheung City. The city center was Gwangyo-dong, where the prefecture office (\ub3c4\ud638\ubd80\uccad\uc0ac) and the local academy (hyanggyo, \ud5a5\uad50) were located.

The city is home to 23 universities and colleges, including Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Chungnam National University, as well as government research institutes, and research and development centers for global companies such as Samsung, LG, mostly located in the city's Daedeok Science Town.[6][7]\n\n\nOccupied by humans since the Stone Age, Daejeon was historically a collection of small riverside villages.[8] Though the area had varying degrees of strategic importance depending on the period in history, it was largely undeveloped until its use as a rail hub from the early 1900s, during the period of Japanese occupation.[9] From the 1980s, multiple national administrative functions were moved from Seoul to Daejeon, most of which are now located in the Daejeon Government Complex, resulting in another population increase.[10] The city hosted the 1986 Asian Games, the Taejon Expo '93, the International Mathematical Olympiads in 2000, and was elevated to the status of Metropolitan City in 2005.[11][12]\n\n\nDaejeon is situated in a lowland valley with three major rivers, all of them eventually flowing into the Yellow Sea by way of the Geum river. The city is surrounded by several small mountains, and is located approximately 170\u00a0km (105.6\u00a0mi) south of Seoul and 290\u00a0km (180\u00a0mi) north of Busan, and 70\u00a0km (43\u00a0mi) east of the Yellow Sea.[13] Daejeon experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season climate with wet, hot summers and drier, cold winters.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nHuman beings first settled in the Daejeon region during the Stone Age. It was occupied and in use as strategic military ground in various times by people such as the *Usul-gun* of Baekje, *Bipung-gun* of Silla, and the *Hoideok-hyeon*, *Yuseong-hyeon*, *Deokjin-hyeon*, and *Jinjam-hyeon*. During the Joseon Kingdom period, it remained occupied by the *Hoideok-hyeon* and *Jinjam-hyeon* of Gongju Mokha. In 1895, most of the area was made part of Hoideok-gun and Jinjam-gun, excluding some parts that belonged to Gongju-gun.\n\n\nThe Daejeon area was historically known as *Hanbat* (\ud55c\ubc2d),[14] a native Korean term for \"large field\", during the Joseon Dynasty. \"Daejeon\" simply means the same thing in Hanja. In the 19th century, Daejeon was also known in English as Kung-tsiou.[15]\n\n\nHistorically, Daejeon was a small village without many residents. However, in 1905, the Gyeongbu Railway began operations from Seoul to Busan, opening a station at Daejeon. In 1926 under the rule of the Japanese government, the Honam Railway was built between Mokpo and Daejeon, transforming the latter into a major transportation hub. Because of its location and proximity to means of transportation, Daejeon grew quickly.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eunhaeng-Sunhwa neighborhood (Kasuga-Cho), c. 1920\nAs railroads were laid under Japanese rule, an environment friendly to the Japanese was created, and many Japanese began to settle in Daejeon taking advantage of the opportunity. According to 1910 census data, 58%, or more than half of the 4,350 Daejeon population at the time, were Japanese. In 1925, 56% of the 8,861 people in Daejeon were Japanese. Therefore, Daejeon was one of the cities with great cultural influence of Japanese residents. For example, elderly people who experienced Japanese colonial era pronounce '\ub2e8\ubb34\uc9c0' (Pickled radish, danmuji) as '\ub2e5\uad11/\ub2e8\uad11'(dakgwang/dangwang), '\ucef5' (cup, keob) as '\uace0\ubfcc' (goffu) and '\ube44\ub2d0' (vinyl, binil) as '\ube44\ub2c8\ub8e8' (binilu). In addition, '\uc6b0\uc5d0\uc2dc\ub2e4\ub9ac' (Uesidari), a representative team division game in Daejeon, was also created at this time and is believed to have been derived from the Japanese word '\u4e0a(\u3046\u3048, Ue)' meaning 'up' and the Japanese word '\u4e0b(\u3057\u305f, sita)' meaning 'down'.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Emblem of Taidenfu (Daejeonbu), the administrative division that existed during Japanese rule of Daejeon\nIn 1932, the capital of South Chungcheong Province was moved from Gongju to Daejeon. During the Korean War, the city was the site of an early major conflict: the Battle of Taejon. Also during the war, the mass graves of civilians killed by South Korean police were discovered near Taejon and reported on by Alan Winnington in his famous anti-war leaflet \"I Saw Truth in Korea\".[17][18] Embarrassed by the contents of the leaflet, the British government considered having him executed for treason, though instead decided to make him stateless.[19][20]\n\n\nSince then, changes have been made to the city's boundaries. Its official names have evolved, as well. Among the boundary modifications include one that effectively made the nearby town of Daedeok a part of the city in 1983. Then, in the late 1980s, Daejeon was elevated to the status of Special City (*Jikhalsi*), thus became a separate administrative region from South Chungcheong Province. In 1995, all South Korean Special Cities were again renamed as Metropolitan Cities, which is reflected in the current official name of Daejeon, Daejeon Metropolitan City (\ub300\uc804\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc).[12]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the Korean administration began moving various national government operations from Seoul to Daejeon, eventually opening the Daejeon Government Complex in 1997. Today, the national government offices in Daejeon include Korea Customs Service, Small and Medium Business Administration, Public Procurement Service, National Statistical Office, Military Manpower Administration, Korea Forest Service, Cultural Heritage Administration, Korean Intellectual Property Office, Korail, Korea Water Resources Corporation, Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation and Patent Court of Korea.\n\n\nThe population of Daejeon increased dramatically as a result of the government center.[21] However, with the construction of Sejong Special Self-Governing City in 2013 for the division of capital functions and balanced local development, many of the public institutions that had previously headed to Daejeon were moved to Sejong, and many public institutions in Seoul were also moved to Sejong. With the launch of Sejong City, large-scale development began, resulting in infrastructure construction and large-scale apartment complexes. Sejong is located immediately north of Daejeon, and Daejeon citizens began to outflow to Sejong. As of July 2020, there was net outflow of more than 100,000 people from Daejeon to Sejong.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walking path along the Gap River\nDaejeon lies between latitudes N36\u00b010'59\" and N36\u00b030'1\" and longitudes E127\u00b014'48\" and E127\u00b033'35\" near the middle of South Korea. It is 167.3\u00a0km (104.0\u00a0mi) from Seoul, 294\u00a0km (183\u00a0mi) from Busan and 169\u00a0km (105\u00a0mi) from Gwangju.\n\n\nKnown historically as 'big field,' the city lies inside a great circle surrounded by several mountains, with Gyeryongsan National Park straddling the city border on the west, and the foot of the Sobaek Mountain range just beyond the city to the south and east. Three rivers run through the center of the city: Gapcheon (\uac11\ucc9c), Yudeungcheon (\uc720\ub4f1\ucc9c), and Daejeoncheon (\ub300\uc804\ucc9c). These flow roughly from south to north, eventually joining the Geum River which borders the city on the northeast. The river changes direction after leaving Daejeon, turning to the southwest and eventually emptying into the Yellow Sea near Gunsan.[22]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Daejeon\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 26\n\n\n\n4\n\n\u22126\n | 37\n\n\n\n7\n\n\u22124\n | 52\n\n\n\n13\n\n1\n | 82\n\n\n\n19\n\n7\n | 92\n\n\n\n25\n\n13\n | 167\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 307\n\n\n\n30\n\n22\n | 300\n\n\n\n30\n\n23\n | 153\n\n\n\n26\n\n17\n | 59\n\n\n\n21\n\n9\n | 48\n\n\n\n14\n\n3\n | 30\n\n\n\n6\n\n\u22123\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0C |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 1\n\n\n\n39\n\n22\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n45\n\n26\n | 2\n\n\n\n55\n\n34\n | 3.2\n\n\n\n67\n\n44\n | 3.6\n\n\n\n76\n\n55\n | 6.6\n\n\n\n82\n\n65\n | 12\n\n\n\n85\n\n72\n | 12\n\n\n\n87\n\n73\n | 6\n\n\n\n79\n\n63\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n69\n\n49\n | 1.9\n\n\n\n56\n\n37\n | 1.2\n\n\n\n43\n\n26\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0F |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nDaejeon has a monsoon-influenced, four-season climate that lies between the humid subtropical and humid continental climatic classifications (K\u00f6ppen *Cwa*/*Dwa*, respectively), with slightly more mild temperature extremes compared with Seoul.

Travel time between Daejeon and Seoul using the KTX high-speed rail system is about 50 minutes. The nearest airport to Daejeon is Cheongju Airport, about a thirty-minute drive north of Daejeon. However, there are also direct bus connections to Incheon International Airport.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Subway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daejeon Metro\n\n![](image)Tashu, the public bicycle of Daejeon\nOne line, Daejeon Subway Line 1, of a planned five-line subway system has been operating since 17 April 2007 (partial operations on this line began on 16 March 2006). This subway line connects Daejeon Station, located in the original city center, with the more modern and more recently developed sections of this city, including Dunsan, where the city hall and a number of national government buildings are located.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNotable differences between the Daejeon subway and the Seoul subway include narrower cars, no doors connecting cars, four cars per train rather than ten, and storage space under the seats for use by passengers.[59] Originally, plastic tokens for toll were read by a proximity sensor when entering the turnstiles, and then inserted into a slot when exiting. The design of the tokens allowed them to be used for advertising.[60] The system now employs the T-money system, a rechargeable series of Smart cards and other \"smart\" devices used for paying transportation fares. Platform screen doors are installed in the subway stations.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the public bicycle in Korea is different for each region, and the name of the public bicycle in Daejeon is **'\ud0c0\uc288(Tashu)'[61]**. '\ud0c0\uc288(Tashu) is a name created using the Chungcheong dialect, and if changed to standard Korean, it becomes '\ud0c0\uc138\uc694(Taseyo)'. Tashu is an unmanned rental public bicycle service operated in Daejeon Metropolitan City since 2008, and the basic rental fee is 500 won, and if one purchases a daily ticket, the bicycle can be used unlimitedly within an hour on that day. In other words, if you return it within an hour of rental, you can re-rent it for free immediately after returning it and use it for another hour. However, if it exceeds one hour, an extra fee will be automatically charged. The rental time is from 5 a.m. to 0 a.m., and rental is not possible from 0 a.m. to 5 a.m., and only return is possible.

The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million.[8] The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong River is Korea's longest river and Busan's Haeundae Beach is also the country's largest.\n\n\nBusan is a center for international conventions, hosting an APEC summit in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the 2002 Asian Games and FIFA World Cup. It is home to the world's largest department store, the Shinsegae Centum City.[9] Busan was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a \"City of Film\" in December 2014.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Busan** (Korean:\u00a0\ubd80\uc0b0; Korean pronunciation: [pusan]), officially known as **Busan Metropolitan City**, is South Korea's second most populous city after Seoul, with a population of over 3.4 million inhabitants as of 2017.[5] Formerly romanized as **Pusan** (and **Fuzan** under Japanese rule), it is the economic, cultural and educational center of southeastern South Korea, with its port being South Korea's busiest and the sixth-busiest in the world.[a] The surrounding \"Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region\" (including Ulsan, South Gyeongsang, Daegu, and some of North Gyeongsang and South Jeolla) is South Korea's largest industrial area. The large volumes of port traffic and urban population in excess of 1 million make Busan a Large-Port metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This subsection **needs additional citations for verification**.

As a result, the cities became refugee camp sites for Koreans during the war. According to the *Korea Times*, around 500,000 refugees were located in Busan in early 1951.[18]\n\n\nAs Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the Korean War, for some time it served as a *de facto* capital of the Republic of Korea.[*citation needed*] UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the Pusan Perimeter in the summer and fall of 1950. Since then, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character. \n\n\nIn 1963, Busan separated from Gyeongsangnam-do to become a Directly Governed City (\uc9c1\ud560\uc2dc). In 1983, the provincial capital of Gyeongsangnam-do was moved from Busan to Changwon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Station or Newspaper\n | Types\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Busan KBS\n | TV, Radio\n |\n| Busan MBC\n | TV, Radio\n |\n| KNN | TV, Radio\n |\n| Busan CBS\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan BBS\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan eFM\n | Radio (English, Chinese)\n |\n| Busan PBC\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan Ilbo\n | Daily Newspaper\n |\n| Kookje Shinmun\n | Daily Newspaper\n |\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Seoul remains the de facto film and television capital of South Korea, Busan shares more in common with Cannes, France than just its reputation as seaside resort town.[53]\n\n\nThe Busan International Film Festival is often referred to as the \"Cannes of Asia\", attracting thousands of entertainment personalities from both Eastern and Western cinema every year, honoring and recognizing international luminaries such as Mike Leigh, Sh\u014dhei Imamura, Wong Kar-wai, and Kim Ki-duk.[54][55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city also hosts the One Asia Festival, the largest K-pop festival in Korea beginning in 2016, positioning itself as the center of K-pop culture.[43]\n\n\nIn 2012, German artist Hendrik Beikirch painted Asia's tallest mural entitled \"Fisherman Portrait\" on a building near Millak Raw Fish Town.[44]\n\n\nBusan is home to 80 performance facilities consisting of 30 public ones, including the Busan Cultural Center, Busan Citizens'Hall, Busan Cinema Center, and Busan National Gugak Center.

Busan's Oncheon is the oldest hot spring spa in Korea. It even has its unique history, where long ago an old man with aching legs was said to have seen an injured crane come to the hot spring and bath in it. After bathing in its waters, the crane became completely cured and happily flew away. Upon seeing this, the old man also bathed his aching legs in the water and was cured. Among the hot spas, 'Dongnae Oncheon' and 'Haeundae Oncheon' are the most famous ones. Today, the spas have an outdoor bath and sauna.\n\n\n\n* Spa Land (Haeundae-Gu)\n* HurShimChung Hot Spring Resorts and Spa Town (Dongnae-Gu)\n* Haeundae Hot Spring Resorts and Spa Towns (Haeundae-Gu)\n* Dongnae Hot Spring Resorts and Spa Towns (Dongnae-Gu)\n* Gwangalli Spa Towns (Suyeong-Gu)\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe name \"Busan\" is the Revised Romanization of the city's Korean name since the late 15th century.[11] It officially replaced the earlier McCune-Reischauer romanization *Pusan* in 2000.[12][b] During the Japanese occupation it was spelled \"Fuzan\".\n\n\nThe name \u91dc\u5c71 (now written \ubd80\uc0b0 using the Korean alphabet) is Sino-Korean for \"Cauldron Mountain\", believed to be a former name of Mt Hwangryeong (\ud669\ub839\uc0b0, \u8352\u5dba\u5c71, *Hwangryeong-san*) west of the city center.

It is located on the coast, which determined the development of the whole city itself. The distance from Busan to Seoul is about 314\u00a0km (195\u00a0mi). Busan borders low mountains on the north and west, and the seas on the south and east. The Nakdong River Delta is located on the west side of the city, and Geumjeongsan, the highest mountain in the city, is on the north. The Nakdong River, South Korea's longest river, flows through the west and empties into the Korea Strait. The southeastern region, called Yeongnam in Korea, encompasses both Gyeongsang Provinces and 3 metropolitan cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. Ulsan lies northeast of Busan. The combined population exceeds 13 million.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"Kiswire Museum and Training Center\". *Architizer*. 5 May 2015.

The city was also the capital of South Jeolla Province until the provincial office moved to the southern village of Namak in Muan County in 2005 because Gwangju was promoted to a metropolitan city and was independent of South Jeolla province.\n\n\nIts name is composed of the words *Gwang* (Korean:\u00a0\uad11; Hanja:\u00a0\u5149) meaning \"light\" and *Ju* (\uc8fc; \u5dde) meaning \"province\". Gwangju was historically recorded as *Muju* (\ubb34\uc8fc; \u6b66\u5dde), in which \"Silla merged all of the land to establish the provinces of Gwangju, Ungju, Jeonju, Muju and various counties, plus the southern boundary of Goguryeo and the ancient territories of Silla\" in the *Samguk Sagi.*[3] In the heart of the agricultural Jeolla region, the city is also famous for its rich and diverse cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A memorial to commemorate the lives lost in the 1980 Gwangju uprising.\nThe city was established in 57 BC. It was one of the administrative centers of Baekje during the Three Kingdoms Period.[4]\n\n\nIn 1929, during the period of Imperial Japanese rule, a confrontation between Korean and Japanese students in the city turned into Gwangju Student Independence Movement, a regional demonstration, which culminated in one of the major nationwide uprisings against Imperial Japanese cruelty during the colonial period.\n\n\nThe modern industry was established in Gwangju with the construction of a railway to Seoul. Some of the industries that took hold include cotton textiles, rice mills and breweries. Construction of a designated industrial zone in 1967 encouraged growth in industry, especially in the sectors linked to the automobile industry.\n\n\nIn May 1980, peaceful demonstrations took place in Gwangju against Chun Doo-hwan, leader of the military coup d'\u00e9tat of 12 December 1979. The demonstrations were suppressed by military forces, including elite units of the Special Operations Command. The situation escalated after a violent crackdown, resulting in the Gwangju Uprising, where civilians raided armories and armed themselves. By the time the uprising was suppressed 9 days later, many hundreds of civilians and several police forces / soldiers were dead. After civilian rule was reinstated in 1987, a national cemetery was established to honor the victims of the incident.[5]\n\n\nIn 1986, Gwangju separated from Jeollanam-do to become a Directly Governed City (Jikhalsi), and then became a Metropolitan City (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995.[4]\n\n\nDue to a variety of factors, including the ancient rivalry between Baekje and Silla, as well as the biased priority given to the Gyeongsang region by political leaders in the 2nd half of the 20th century, Gwangju has a long history of voting for left-leaning politicians and is the main stronghold for the liberal Democratic Party of Korea along with its predecessors, as well as the progressive Justice Party.\n\n\nGwangju held many sports events such as 2002 FIFA World Cup, 2015 Summer Universiade, 2019 World Aquatics Championships.\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Gwangju\n\nGwangju is divided into 5 districts (\"Gu\").\n\n\n\n\n\n| Map\n | Name\n | Korean | Hanja |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n |\n| Districts\n |\n| Buk District | \ubd81\uad6c | \u5317\u5340 |\n| Dong District | \ub3d9\uad6c | \u6771\u5340 |\n| Gwangsan District | \uad11\uc0b0\uad6c | \u5149\u5c71\u5340 |\n| Nam District | \ub0a8\uad6c | \u5357\u5340 |\n| Seo District | \uc11c\uad6c | \u897f\u5340 |\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Gwangju (2015)[6]\n\n\n\nNot religious (61%)\nProtestantism (20%)\nBuddhism (9.5%)\nCatholicism (8.7%)\nOther (0.8%)\n\nAccording to the census of 2015, 9.5% of the population followed Buddhism and 28.7% followed Christianity (20% Protestantism and 8.7% Catholicism) 61% of the population are irreligious.[6]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe population model of Gwangju is as follows;[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1960 | \u00a0\u00a0409,283\n |\n| 1966 | \u00a0\u00a0532,235\n |\n| 1970 | \u00a0\u00a0622,755\n |\n| 1975 | \u00a0\u00a0737,283\n |\n| 1980 | \u00a0\u00a0856,545\n |\n| 1985 | 1,042,508\n |\n| 1990 | 1,139,003\n |\n| 1995 | 1,257,636\n |\n| 2000 | 1,352,797\n |\n| 2005 | 1,417,716\n |\n| 2010 | 1,475,745\n |\n| 2016 | 1,500,621\n |\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nGwangju has a cooler version of the humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: *Cfa/Cwa*) with four distinct seasons and rainfall year-round but particularly during the East Asian Monsoon Season in the summer months.\n\n\nWinters, while still somewhat cold, are milder than in Seoul and cities further north due to the city's southwesterly position in the Korean peninsula. \nSummers are hot and humid with abundant precipitation, particularly in the form of thunderstorms.
