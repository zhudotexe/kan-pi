Seoul proper comprises 605.25 km2 (233.69 sq mi),[3] with a radius of approximately 15 km (9 mi), roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Seoul\n\n\n\n|  Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 17\n\n\n\n2\n\n−6\n | 28\n\n\n\n5\n\n−3\n | 37\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 73\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeoul is geographically set in a mountainous and hilly terrain, with Bukhan Mountain positioned on its northern edge.

One of the most famous parks is Namsan Park, which offers recreational hiking and views of the downtown Seoul skyline, especially via its N Seoul Tower. Seoul Olympic Park, located in Songpa District and built to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, is the largest park. The areas near the stream Tancheon are popular for exercise. Cheonggyecheon also has spaces for recreation. In 2017 the Seoullo 7017 Skypark opened, spanning diagonally overtop Seoul Station.\n\n\nThere are also many parks along the Han River, such as Ichon Hangang Park, Yeouido Hangang Park, Mangwon Hangang Park, Nanji Hangang Park, Banpo Hangang Park, Ttukseom Hangang Park and Jamsil Hangang Park. The Seoul National Capital Area also contains a green belt aimed at preventing the city from sprawling out into neighboring Gyeonggi Province. These areas are frequently sought after by people looking to escape from urban life on weekends and during vacations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter World War II and the liberation of Korea, the city took its present name, which originated from the Korean word meaning \"capital city\", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, *Seorabeol* (서라벌; 徐羅伐), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.[16] Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Chinese-style name *Geumseong* (金城, literally \"Gold Castle or City\" or \"Metal Castle or City\"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name *Seorabeol* had the same meaning as *Geumseong*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnlike most place names in Korea, \"Seoul\" has no corresponding Hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language). On 18 January 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic *Hancheng* (simplified Chinese: 汉城; traditional Chinese: 漢城; pinyin: *Hànchéng*) to *Shou'er* (首尔; 首爾; *Shǒu'ěr*).[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Seoul\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Stephen Hamnett, Dean Forbes, ed.

Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.[116] Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,[117][118] on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District.

Downstream from Gangnam District is Yeouido, an island that is home to the National Assembly, major broadcasting studios, and a number of large office buildings, as well as the Korea Finance Building and the Yoido Full Gospel Church. The Olympic Stadium, Olympic Park, and Lotte World are located in Songpa District, on the south side of the Han River, upstream from Gangnam District. Three new modern landmarks of Seoul are Dongdaemun Design Plaza & Park, designed by Zaha Hadid, the new wave-shaped Seoul City Hall, by Yoo Kerl of iArc, and the Lotte World Tower, the 6th tallest building in the world designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox.\n\n\nIn 2010 Seoul was designated the World Design Capital for the year.[122]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Seoul\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"2015 Census – Religion Results\" (in Korean).

The city has grown beyond those walls and although the wall no longer stands (except along Bugaksan Mountain (북악산; 北岳山), north of the downtown area[37]), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, including most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as Dongdaemun).[38] During the Joseon dynasty, the gates were opened and closed each day, accompanied by the ringing of large bells at the Bosingak belfry.[39] In the late 19th century, after hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its gates to foreigners and began to modernize. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to introduce electricity in the royal palace, built by the Edison Illuminating Company[40] and a decade later Seoul also implemented electrical street lights.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeoul proper is noted for its population density, which is almost twice that of New York City and eight times greater than Rome. Its metropolitan area was the most densely populated among OECD countries in Asia in 2012, and second worldwide after that of Paris.[79] As of 2015, the population was 9.86 million,[80] in 2012, it was 10.44 million. As of 2021, the population is 9.59 million.[81][82] As of the end of June 2011, 10.29 million Republic of Korea citizens lived in the city. This was a 0.24% decrease from the end of 2010. The population of Seoul has been dropping since the early 1990s, the reasons being the high costs of living, urban sprawling to Gyeonggi region's satellite bed cities and an aging population.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeoul is among the world leaders in Internet connectivity, being the capital of South Korea, which has the world's highest fiber-optic broadband penetration and highest global average internet speeds of 26.1 Mbit/s.[112][113] Since 2015, Seoul has provided free Wi-Fi access in outdoor spaces through a 47.7 billion won ($44 million) project with Internet access at 10,430 parks, streets and other public places.[114] Internet speeds in some apartment buildings reach up to 52.5Gbit/s with assistance from Nokia, and though the average standard consists of 100 Mbit/s services, providers nationwide are rapidly rolling out 1Gbit/s connections at the equivalent of US$20 per month.[115] In addition, the city is served by the KTX high-speed rail and the Seoul Subway, which provides 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, and DMB inside subway cars. 5G will be introduced commercially in March 2019 in Seoul.\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of South Korea\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Yeouido, the main financial district of Seoul\nSeoul hosts large concentration of headquarters of International companies and banks, including 15 companies on Fortune 500 list such as Samsung, LG and Hyundai.[97] Most bank headquarters and the Korea Exchange are located in Yeouido (Yeoui island),[93] which is often called \"South Korea's Wall Street\" and has been serving as the financial center of the city since the 1980s.[98] The Seoul international finance center & SIFC MALL, Hanhwa 63 building, the Hanhwa insurance company head office.

August, the hottest month, has average high and low temperatures of 30.0 and 22.9 °C (86 and 73 °F) with higher temperatures possible. Heat index values can surpass 40 °C (104.0 °F) at the height of summer. \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"South Korea | Environmental Performance Index – Development\". epi.yale.edu.

The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains.

Seoul Olympic Park, located in Songpa District and built to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, is the largest park. The areas near the stream Tancheon are popular for exercise. Cheonggyecheon also has spaces for recreation. In 2017 the Seoullo 7017 Skypark opened, spanning diagonally overtop Seoul Station.\n\n\nThere are also many parks along the Han River, such as Ichon Hangang Park, Yeouido Hangang Park, Mangwon Hangang Park, Nanji Hangang Park, Banpo Hangang Park, Ttukseom Hangang Park and Jamsil Hangang Park. The Seoul National Capital Area also contains a green belt aimed at preventing the city from sprawling out into neighboring Gyeonggi Province. These areas are frequently sought after by people looking to escape from urban life on weekends and during vacations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter World War II and the liberation of Korea, the city took its present name, which originated from the Korean word meaning \"capital city\", which is believed to have descended from an ancient word, *Seorabeol* (서라벌; 徐羅伐), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.[16] Ancient Gyeongju was also known in documents by the Chinese-style name *Geumseong* (金城, literally \"Gold Castle or City\" or \"Metal Castle or City\"), but it is unclear whether the native Korean-style name *Seorabeol* had the same meaning as *Geumseong*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUnlike most place names in Korea, \"Seoul\" has no corresponding Hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language). On 18 January 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic *Hancheng* (simplified Chinese: 汉城; traditional Chinese: 漢城; pinyin: *Hànchéng*) to *Shou'er* (首尔; 首爾; *Shǒu'ěr*).[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Seoul\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Stephen Hamnett, Dean Forbes, ed.

Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.[116] Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,[117][118] on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of Gangnam District, Seocho District and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n### Historical architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCapital of South Korea\n\nThis article is about the capital city of South Korea.

The other large palace, Changdeokgung, constructed in 1405, served as the main royal palace from 1611 to 1872.[19] After Joseon changed its name to the Korean Empire in 1897, Hwangseong also designated Seoul.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Seoul** (/soʊl/; Korean: 서울; IPA: [sʌul] ⓘ; lit. 'Capital'), officially **Seoul Special City**, serves as the capital and South Korea's most extensive urban center.

The city was liberated by U.S. forces at the end of World War II.[19]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\nIn 1945, the city was officially named Seoul, and was designated as a special city in 1949.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSeoul has a comprehensive urban railway network of 21 rapid transit, light metro and commuter lines that interconnects every district of the city and the surrounding areas of Incheon, Gyeonggi province, western Gangwon province, and northern Chungnam province. With more than 8 million passengers per day, the subway is one of the busiest subway systems in the world and the largest in the world, with a total track length of 940 km (580 mi). In addition, in order to cope with the various modes of transport, Seoul's metropolitan government employs several mathematicians to coordinate the subway, bus, and traffic schedules into one timetable. The various lines are run by Korail, Seoul Metro, NeoTrans Co. Ltd., AREX, and Seoul Metro Line 9 Corporation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Train[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n130. **^** \"Seodaemun Prison History Museum\". Korea Tourism Organization.

The city has grown beyond those walls and although the wall no longer stands (except along Bugaksan Mountain (북악산; 北岳山), north of the downtown area[37]), the gates remain near the downtown district of Seoul, including most notably Sungnyemun (commonly known as Namdaemun) and Heunginjimun (commonly known as Dongdaemun).[38] During the Joseon dynasty, the gates were opened and closed each day, accompanied by the ringing of large bells at the Bosingak belfry.[39] In the late 19th century, after hundreds of years of isolation, Seoul opened its gates to foreigners and began to modernize. Seoul became the first city in East Asia to introduce electricity in the royal palace, built by the Edison Illuminating Company[40] and a decade later Seoul also implemented electrical street lights.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeoul proper is noted for its population density, which is almost twice that of New York City and eight times greater than Rome. Its metropolitan area was the most densely populated among OECD countries in Asia in 2012, and second worldwide after that of Paris.[79] As of 2015, the population was 9.86 million,[80] in 2012, it was 10.44 million. As of 2021, the population is 9.59 million.[81][82] As of the end of June 2011, 10.29 million Republic of Korea citizens lived in the city. This was a 0.24% decrease from the end of 2010. The population of Seoul has been dropping since the early 1990s, the reasons being the high costs of living, urban sprawling to Gyeonggi region's satellite bed cities and an aging population.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeoul is among the world leaders in Internet connectivity, being the capital of South Korea, which has the world's highest fiber-optic broadband penetration and highest global average internet speeds of 26.1 Mbit/s.[112][113] Since 2015, Seoul has provided free Wi-Fi access in outdoor spaces through a 47.7 billion won ($44 million) project with Internet access at 10,430 parks, streets and other public places.[114] Internet speeds in some apartment buildings reach up to 52.5Gbit/s with assistance from Nokia, and though the average standard consists of 100 Mbit/s services, providers nationwide are rapidly rolling out 1Gbit/s connections at the equivalent of US$20 per month.[115] In addition, the city is served by the KTX high-speed rail and the Seoul Subway, which provides 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, and DMB inside subway cars. 5G will be introduced commercially in March 2019 in Seoul.\n\n\n\n## Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of South Korea\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Yeouido, the main financial district of Seoul\nSeoul hosts large concentration of headquarters of International companies and banks, including 15 companies on Fortune 500 list such as Samsung, LG and Hyundai.[97] Most bank headquarters and the Korea Exchange are located in Yeouido (Yeoui island),[93] which is often called \"South Korea's Wall Street\" and has been serving as the financial center of the city since the 1980s.[98] The Seoul international finance center & SIFC MALL, Hanhwa 63 building, the Hanhwa insurance company head office.

August, the hottest month, has average high and low temperatures of 30.0 and 22.9 °C (86 and 73 °F) with higher temperatures possible. Heat index values can surpass 40 °C (104.0 °F) at the height of summer. \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** \"South Korea | Environmental Performance Index – Development\". epi.yale.edu.

The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced four Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Park Chung Hee, Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye.

Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2·28 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (달구벌대종, 達句伐大鐘), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called *Seokjeondaeje* is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\n\n\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\n\n\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYangnyeongsi (약령시, 藥令市) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\n\n\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa—a Buddhist temple that houses the *Tripitaka Koreana* (a woodblock edition of the *Tripitaka* and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam.

At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Daegu skyline as seen from KNU's Technopark\nGenerally, Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n\n### Sights[edit]\n\n\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire.[38] Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 2.9\n | 3.5\n | 5.8\n | 6.8\n | 6.9\n | 8.3\n | 12.3\n | 12.1\n | 8.0\n | 4.9\n | 4.8\n | 2.9\n | 79.2\n |\n| Source: Korea Meteorological Administration[32] |\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daegu Metro Line 3.\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city.

The main railroad of the country, Gyeongbu Line passes through the city. The largest railroad station in the city, Dongdaegu Station, has the second largest passenger traffic in Korea after Seoul Station, it is the number one station in Korea for train stops, and the largest train traffic.[54] All trains passing through Dongdaegu Station make a mandatory stop. The station re-opened in 2004 after extensive renovations serving the KTX highspeed train, Saemaul and Mugunghwa trains. All kinds of trains except KTX depart from Daegu Station, an all-new building with cinemas, restaurants and a department store, located near the city centre. It has the tenth largest passenger traffic in Korea.[54] Daegu Line branches off from Gacheon station of Gyeongbu Line.\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daegu Metro\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (*Gyeongju Choi* clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (*Nampyeong Mun'*s). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (경상감영, 慶尙監營) and Daegu-hyanggyo (대구향교, 大邱鄕校) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (영남제일문, 嶺南第一門, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea[39] and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\n\n\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n\n![](image)Daegu International Future Auto EXPO 2017\n![](image)Korean ICT Convergence Expo\n![](image)Korean Brain Research Center - Advanced Equipment Center\n![](image)2017 Green Energy Expo\n### Fashion industry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions\nMain article: List of districts and county of Daegu\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (*Gu*) and 2 counties (*Gun*)\n\n\n\n* Jung District (중구, 中區) – *means the central district.*\n* Dong District (동구, 東區) – *means the east district.*\n* Seo District (서구, 西區) – *means the west district.*\n* Nam District (남구, 南區) – *means the south district.*\n* Buk District (북구, 北區) – *means the north district.*\n* Suseong District (수성구, 壽城區)\n* Dalseo District (달서구, 達西區)\n* Dalseong County (달성군, 達城郡)\n* Gunwi County (군위군, 軍威郡)\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (*Jikhalsi*), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (*Gwangyeoksi*) in 1995.

With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\n\n\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics and the 2003 Summer Universiade.[6] It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Daegu\n\n### Prehistory and early history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is the third-largest urban agglomeration in South Korea after Seoul and Busan; it is the fourth-largest official metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.3 million residents; and the second-largest city after Busan in the Yeongnam region in southeastern Korean Peninsula. Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million.\n\n\nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Lee (1984) and Shin (1999) both make this assumption\n11. **^** FPCP (Foundation for the Preservation of Cultural Properties). *Daegu Chilgok Sam Taekji Munhwayejeok Balguljosa Bogoseo* [Excavation Report of the Cultural Site at Localities 2 and 3, Building Area 3, Chilgok, Daegu]. 3 vols.

They are based in the southeastern city of Daegu and are members of the KBO League. Their home stadium is Daegu Samsung Lions Park. They have won the Korean Series eight times. The Samsung Lions are the first team to win four consecutive Korean Series titles (2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014). They are also the first Korean team to win a regular league title for five consecutive years (2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015).\n\n\n\n##### Daegu FC[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt started a full-fledged health-sharing stairway project by installing \"Seven-color melody health donation stairs\" at Shinmae Station and Imdang Station on Daegu Subway Line 2. Using these stairs, LED lights turn on with the sound of the keyboard. And a donation of ₩10(won) per session goes to those in need (such as pediatric cancer centers and low-income families).[55]\n\n\n\n### Road[edit]\n\n\nThere are two types of buses which are local and limited express. Limited express buses have more seats, but often passengers are required to stand. As of 2020[update], Local bus fare costs around 1,400 won with cash, Limited express bus fare would set you back 1,800 won. Discounted fare is available with a prepaid card.[56]\n\n\nBus route numbers are made up with 3 digits, each number indicates the area that bus serves. For example, number 407 bus runs from zone four, to zone zero, and then to zone seven. Other routes, usually circular, are named for the districts they serve and numbered 1 through 3.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* The Frog Boys, this incident is an unsolved case. 5 boys were killed by the criminal in 1991. Boys failed to return after going out to pick up the salamander eggs, and people often call the case \"The frog boys case\".\n* The 1995 Daegu gas explosions killed 101 and injured 202. A pagoda for consolation of the dead was erected in Haksan park.\n* The Daegu subway fire occurred on February 18, 2003, when an arsonist, \"Kim Dae-Han\" set fire to a train at the Jungangno Station of the Daegu Metropolitan Subway in Daegu, South Korea. The fire spread across two trains within minutes, killing 192 people and injuring 151 others. It remains the deadliest deliberate loss of life in a single incident in South Korean peacetime history.\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Leaders[edit]\n\n\n* Roh Tae-woo – army general and thirteenth president of South Korea\n* Park Geun-hye – former president of South Korea, from 2013 to 2017, daughter of former president Park Chung Hee\n\n\n### Industrialists[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGlobal schools:\n\n\n\n* Daegu Sindang Elementary School\n\n\nDaegu Sindang Elementary School is a public elementary school located in Dalseo-gu, Daegu. The school's motto is \"To raise children who are upright, wise, and strong\", and its emblem and flower are the magnolia and pine tree, respectively. Daegu Sindang Elementary School has a history of excellence in sports, music and academics, and has won numerous awards in these fields. It is also a designated school for creative education and a leading school for after-school programmes. In 2020, a group of students from Daegu Sindang Elementary School won first place in the Korean National Championship of the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) robotics competition.[53]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892–936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However, the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\n\n\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Cumings, Bruce (1998). *Korea's place in the sun: A modern history* (updated ed.).

The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n\n### Korean Empire and colonial rule[edit]\n\n\nJapanese imperialism forcibly opened up Korea's markets beginning in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese war.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome large university hospitals make the city the medical hub of south-eastern Korea. The Kyungpook National University Hospital, founded as *Daegu-dongin-uiwon* in 1907 by the Japanese, is the best-known hospital in the city. The Dongsan Hospital (attached to Keimyung University), founded as *Jejungwon* in 1899, is one of the oldest western style medical clinics in Korea. The Yeungnam University Medical Center has the largest number of beds in the city. The yearly treatment amount of these tertiary hospitals is the second largest in South Korea after that of Seoul.[50] The Daegu Catholic University Medical Center is also included in them.\n\n\n\n### Primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\n* Hamji High School\n* Kangbuk High School\n* Maecheon High School\n* Seongsan High School\n\n\nInternational schools in Daegu include:\n\n\n\n* Daegu International School[51]\n* Daegu Chinese Elementary School or Korea Daeguhwagyo Elementary School (한국대구화교초등학교)[52]\n* Overseas Chinese High School, Daegu\n\n\n### Elementary schools[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)DGB Daegu Bank Park\nDaegu Football Club was founded as a community club at the end of 2002, and made their K League debut in 2003. Historically, Daegu have often placed in the lower reaches of the K League. Their best season to date has been 2021, when they finished third out of twelve teams. They were also the winners of the Korean FA Cup in 2018, which qualified the club for their first appearance in the AFC Champions League the following year. The club has since played in the 2021 and 2022 editions of AFC Champions League.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nThere are three terrestrial TV broadcasting stations in the city: KBS Daegu Broadcast Station, Daegu MBC, and TBC. These are affiliated companies of central broadcasting stations in Seoul just like other local broadcasting companies in South Korea. TBC (Taegu Broadcasting Corporation) depends on SBS. They cover to Gyeongsangbuk-do out of the city. Each television broadcasting company has its own radio station as well.\n\n\n\n### International Daegu[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | You can help **expand this article with text translated from the corresponding article in Korean**. *(October 2023)* Click [show] for important translation instructions.\n* \n* Machine translation, like DeepL or Google Translate, is a useful starting point for translations, but translators must revise errors as necessary and confirm that the translation is accurate, rather than simply copy-pasting machine-translated text into the English Wikipedia.\n* Do not translate text that appears unreliable or low-quality.

Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of Daegu-eupseong (대구읍성, 大邱邑城, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, Seoul.

Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local Daegu Department Store also operates two branches, while another local chain, Donga Department Store operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown.

The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has 29 members which consist of 26 from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the Liberty Korea Party, the main conservative political party in South Korea. Daegu is a stronghold for the party and has produced four Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: Park Chung Hee, Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo and Park Geun-hye. Park Chung Hee and Chun Doo-hwan were born in other cities but they moved to Daegu and spent childhood in Daegu. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"2021년 지역소득(잠정)\".\n2. **^** *EB* (1878), p. 390.\n3. **^** \"Photographic image of map\".

Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only zoo and some monuments as well as the wall. Duryu Park or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has Daegu Tower, Woobang Land, Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2·28 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (달구벌대종, 達句伐大鐘), which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called *Seokjeondaeje* is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.\n\n\nLately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. Daegu International Opera Festival (DIOF) in October since 2003, Daegu International Musical Festival (DIMF), and Daegu International Bodypainting Festival (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.\n\n\nVarious festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, Dongseongno festival, Palgongsan maple festival, Biseulsan azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYangnyeongsi (약령시, 藥令市) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.\n\n\nNearby tourist attractions include Haeinsa—a Buddhist temple that houses the *Tripitaka Koreana* (a woodblock edition of the *Tripitaka* and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of Hapcheon, Gyeongnam. The historic city of Gyeongju, Gyeongbuk, the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla is located east of Daegu.\n\n\n\n### Mountains and parks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of parks in Daegu\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the Goryeo period, the first edition of the *Tripitaka Koreana* was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.[12] However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the Mongol invasions of Korea.[13]\n\n\n\n### Joseon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daegu in the 18th century\nDaegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty, being located in the middle of the Great Yeongnam Road which ran between Seoul and Busan, at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and Jinju.\n\n\nIn 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the Gyeongsang-do, which is current Daegu, Busan, Ulsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Gyeongsangnam-do. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly 300 years, and the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Daegu skyline as seen from KNU's Technopark\nGenerally, Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, Buddhism has been strong; today there are still many temples. Confucianism is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.\n\n\n\n### Sights[edit]\n\n\nThe most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called Gatbawi on the top of Gwanbong, Palgongsan. It is famous for its stone gat (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire.[38] Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, Gyeongsan, Gyeongbuk.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 2.9\n | 3.5\n | 5.8\n | 6.8\n | 6.9\n | 8.3\n | 12.3\n | 12.1\n | 8.0\n | 4.9\n | 4.8\n | 2.9\n | 79.2\n |\n| Source: Korea Meteorological Administration[32] |\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Daegu Metro Line 3.\nDaegu is a manufacturing industry city.

The main railroad of the country, Gyeongbu Line passes through the city. The largest railroad station in the city, Dongdaegu Station, has the second largest passenger traffic in Korea after Seoul Station, it is the number one station in Korea for train stops, and the largest train traffic.[54] All trains passing through Dongdaegu Station make a mandatory stop. The station re-opened in 2004 after extensive renovations serving the KTX highspeed train, Saemaul and Mugunghwa trains. All kinds of trains except KTX depart from Daegu Station, an all-new building with cinemas, restaurants and a department store, located near the city centre. It has the tenth largest passenger traffic in Korea.[54] Daegu Line branches off from Gacheon station of Gyeongbu Line.\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daegu Metro\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOld villages have been preserved, such as the Otgol village (*Gyeongju Choi* clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (*Nampyeong Mun'*s). In the urban area, the Joseon Dynasty's administrative or educational buildings including Gyeongsang-gamyeong (경상감영, 慶尙監營) and Daegu-hyanggyo (대구향교, 大邱鄕校) also remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called Yeongnam-jeilmun (영남제일문, 嶺南第一門, meaning the first gateway in Yeongnam), has been restored in Mangudang Park. Western style modern architecture like Gyesan Cathedral and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved across the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea[39] and the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu which is one of three archdioceses in South Korea. Several buildings, in the present Keisung Academy and the KNU middle/high school, are famous too.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdditionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.\n\n\nAlso, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu's population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city's fashion industry.\n\n\n\n![](image)Daegu International Future Auto EXPO 2017\n![](image)Korean ICT Convergence Expo\n![](image)Korean Brain Research Center - Advanced Equipment Center\n![](image)2017 Green Energy Expo\n### Fashion industry[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in elections.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions\nMain article: List of districts and county of Daegu\n\nDaegu is divided into 7 districts (*Gu*) and 2 counties (*Gun*)\n\n\n\n* Jung District (중구, 中區) – *means the central district.*\n* Dong District (동구, 東區) – *means the east district.*\n* Seo District (서구, 西區) – *means the west district.*\n* Nam District (남구, 南區) – *means the south district.*\n* Buk District (북구, 北區) – *means the north district.*\n* Suseong District (수성구, 壽城區)\n* Dalseo District (달서구, 達西區)\n* Dalseong County (달성군, 達城郡)\n* Gunwi County (군위군, 軍威郡)\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level directly governed city (*Jikhalsi*), and was redesignated as a metropolitan city (*Gwangyeoksi*) in 1995.

It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006.[36] The electronics industries in Gumi and the steel industries in Pohang provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for Anycall (Samsung Mobile) and POSCO's main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.\n\n\nHistorically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul in the center and Pyongyang in the north (currently North Korea), because of its advantageous location.

It was also the third worldwide sports event held in Korea after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and 2002 FIFA World Cup in Korea and Japan, in which Daegu hosted four matches. It also hosted the 2003 Summer Universiade.[6] The city hosts the Colorful Daegu Pre-Championships Meeting every year since 2005.\n\n\nDaegu Stadium is the second largest sports complex in South Korea with a seating capacity of 66,422. Daegu Civic Stadium hosted some football matches at the 1988 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nThe Daegu Marathon is held here every year in April.

The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high-quality apples, thus the nickname, \"Apple City\".[4] Daegu is also known as \"Textile City\".[5] Textiles used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone, Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.\n\n\nDaegu was the host city of the 22nd World Energy Congress, the 2011 World Championships in Athletics and the 2003 Summer Universiade.[6] It also hosted four matches in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Daegu\n\n### Prehistory and early history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is the third-largest urban agglomeration in South Korea after Seoul and Busan; it is the fourth-largest official metropolitan area in the nation with over 2.3 million residents; and the second-largest city after Busan in the Yeongnam region in southeastern Korean Peninsula. Daegu and surrounding North Gyeongsang Province are often referred to as Daegu-Gyeongbuk, with a total population over 5 million.\n\n\nDaegu is located in south-eastern Korea about 80 km (50 mi) from the seacoast, near the Geumho River and its mainstream, Nakdong River in Gyeongsang-do. The Daegu basin is the central plain of the Yeongnam region. In ancient times, the Daegu area was part of the proto-kingdom Jinhan. Subsequently, Daegu came under the control of the Silla Kingdom, which unified the Korean Peninsula. During the Joseon Dynasty period, the city was the capital of Gyeongsang-do, one of the traditional eight provinces of the country.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** Lee (1984) and Shin (1999) both make this assumption\n11. **^** FPCP (Foundation for the Preservation of Cultural Properties). *Daegu Chilgok Sam Taekji Munhwayejeok Balguljosa Bogoseo* [Excavation Report of the Cultural Site at Localities 2 and 3, Building Area 3, Chilgok, Daegu]. 3 vols.

Using these stairs, LED lights turn on with the sound of the keyboard. And a donation of ₩10(won) per session goes to those in need (such as pediatric cancer centers and low-income families).[55]\n\n\n\n### Road[edit]\n\n\nThere are two types of buses which are local and limited express. Limited express buses have more seats, but often passengers are required to stand. As of 2020[update], Local bus fare costs around 1,400 won with cash, Limited express bus fare would set you back 1,800 won. Discounted fare is available with a prepaid card.[56]\n\n\nBus route numbers are made up with 3 digits, each number indicates the area that bus serves. For example, number 407 bus runs from zone four, to zone zero, and then to zone seven. Other routes, usually circular, are named for the districts they serve and numbered 1 through 3.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* The Frog Boys, this incident is an unsolved case. 5 boys were killed by the criminal in 1991.

Daegu Sindang Elementary School has a history of excellence in sports, music and academics, and has won numerous awards in these fields. It is also a designated school for creative education and a leading school for after-school programmes. In 2020, a group of students from Daegu Sindang Elementary School won first place in the Korean National Championship of the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) robotics competition.[53]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Later Three Kingdoms period, 892–936, Daegu was initially aligned with Hubaekje. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of Goryeo under Wang Geon and those of Hubaekje under Gyeon Hwon. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general Shin Sung-gyeom. However, the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time apparently changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of Goryeo.\n\n\nNumerous place names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are \"Ansim\", which literally means \"peace of mind\", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and \"Banwol\", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Cumings, Bruce (1998). *Korea's place in the sun: A modern history* (updated ed.).

The most famous of these is the Yangnyeongsi herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the Nakdong River valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. Seomun Market, which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top-three markets in the Joseon period.\n\n\n\n### Korean Empire and colonial rule[edit]\n\n\nJapanese imperialism forcibly opened up Korea's markets beginning in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern post offices, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the First Sino-Japanese war.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome large university hospitals make the city the medical hub of south-eastern Korea. The Kyungpook National University Hospital, founded as *Daegu-dongin-uiwon* in 1907 by the Japanese, is the best-known hospital in the city. The Dongsan Hospital (attached to Keimyung University), founded as *Jejungwon* in 1899, is one of the oldest western style medical clinics in Korea. The Yeungnam University Medical Center has the largest number of beds in the city.

The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the Daegu Fashion Fair and Preview in Daegu annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.[37]\n\n\n\n## Culture and sightseeing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"c8ce69fa-f91b-417e-9e02-cef046484d06","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Today, about 3 million people live in the city, making it South Korea's third-most-populous city after Seoul and Busan.[3]\n\n\nThe city's growth has been assured in modern times with the development of its port due to its natural advantages as a coastal city and its proximity to the South Korean capital.

Like other metropolitan cities, incheon has a strong urban heat island effect.[17] Incheon's climate is about average compared to the rest of Korea, with 8 locations being cooler and 10 locations being warmer, and with 9 locations being wetter and 9 locations being drier.[18]\n\n\nIncheon experiences each of its four seasons, distinctly feeling the rise and fall of temperature and humidity. The temperature however, never rises to an extreme, and the climate of the city is essentially mild. Incheon is swept by the seasonal winds as the northwesterly winds strike the city in the winter and the summer in Incheon is affected by gusts of the warm southwesterly winds.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Percent possible sunshine | 43.3\n | 54.3\n | 53.9\n | 53.0\n | 51.4\n | 38.6\n | 28.6\n | 40.8\n | 54.5\n | 60.6\n | 49.3\n | 37.9\n | 46.8\n |\n| Source: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981–2010)[20][21][22] |\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nIncheon forms the heart of Capital Industrial Region. During the industrialization of South Korea, several industrial complexes were built throughout the city, and as a result, the city was largely dependent on manufacturing industry. But with the designation of Incheon Free Economic Zone in 2003, the city is now making an effort to foster new growth industries. Major industrial parks include Bupyeong industrial complex, which hosts GM Incheon plant(formerly a GM Daewoo Incheon plant), Juan industrial complex, and Namdong Industrial complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Kottek, M.; J.

Yeongjong, and has a total area of 51,739 acres (20,938 ha). The goal of IFEZ is to transform these three areas into hubs for logistics, international business, leisure, and tourism for the Northeast Asian region. The term 'Free Economic Zone' applies to the development in these three areas with the aim of improving the business environment for foreign-invested enterprises and the living conditions for foreigners. The zone is a specially designated area to create the most favorable business and living environment where foreign nationals can live and invest freely and conveniently. Incheon's Free Economic Zone, the first in Korea, was officially designated by the Korean government in August 2003. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"9229a67a-119d-4481-a2ac-15186948b19e","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Today, about 3 million people live in the city, making it South Korea's third-most-populous city after Seoul and Busan.[3]\n\n\nThe city's growth has been assured in modern times with the development of its port due to its natural advantages as a coastal city and its proximity to the South Korean capital.

Like other metropolitan cities, incheon has a strong urban heat island effect.[17] Incheon's climate is about average compared to the rest of Korea, with 8 locations being cooler and 10 locations being warmer, and with 9 locations being wetter and 9 locations being drier.[18]\n\n\nIncheon experiences each of its four seasons, distinctly feeling the rise and fall of temperature and humidity. The temperature however, never rises to an extreme, and the climate of the city is essentially mild. Incheon is swept by the seasonal winds as the northwesterly winds strike the city in the winter and the summer in Incheon is affected by gusts of the warm southwesterly winds.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Percent possible sunshine | 43.3\n | 54.3\n | 53.9\n | 53.0\n | 51.4\n | 38.6\n | 28.6\n | 40.8\n | 54.5\n | 60.6\n | 49.3\n | 37.9\n | 46.8\n |\n| Source: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981–2010)[20][21][22] |\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nIncheon forms the heart of Capital Industrial Region. During the industrialization of South Korea, several industrial complexes were built throughout the city, and as a result, the city was largely dependent on manufacturing industry. But with the designation of Incheon Free Economic Zone in 2003, the city is now making an effort to foster new growth industries. Major industrial parks include Bupyeong industrial complex, which hosts GM Incheon plant(formerly a GM Daewoo Incheon plant), Juan industrial complex, and Namdong Industrial complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** Kottek, M.; J.

In 1989, neighboring islands and Gyeyang township of Gimpo County[a] were ceded to Incheon and in 1995 Geomdan township of Gimpo County and two counties of Ganghwa and Onjin were annexed to Incheon Metropolitan City.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIncheon was known as **Inchon** prior to South Korea's adoption of a new Romanization system in 2000.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Juan-dong, Incheon attacked with tear gas in May 1987\n### Major events[edit]\n\n\nThe city was the site of the Battle of Chemulpo Bay, where the first shots of the Russo-Japanese War were fired.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Airport Express (AREX) line runs from Incheon International Airport to Seoul Station via Gimpo International Airport. The Incheon-Gimpo section was opened in March 2007 and was extended to Seoul station in December 2010. Passengers can choose a high-speed service stopping only at Incheon airport and Seoul, which takes 43 minutes but departs only every half-hour; or the all-station service which takes 53 minutes but leaves every six minutes.\n\n\nKTX service was introduced on the AREX line on 30 June 2014, with stops at Incheon International Airport station and Geomam station. There are additional plans to use the newly built Suin Line to bring KTX service to Incheon station by 2021.[27]\n\n\n\n### Subway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Incheon Subway\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIFEZ is planned to be a self-contained living and business district featuring air and sea transportation, a logistics complex, an international business center, financial services, residences, schools and hospitals, and shopping and entertainment centres.[*promotion?*]\n\n\n\n### New Songdo City[edit]\n\n\nSongdo International City began development in 1994 and is being built on reclaimed land.

The city is home to 23 universities and colleges, including Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Chungnam National University, as well as government research institutes, and research and development centers for global companies such as Samsung, LG, mostly located in the city's Daedeok Science Town.[6][7]\n\n\nOccupied by humans since the Stone Age, Daejeon was historically a collection of small riverside villages.[8] Though the area had varying degrees of strategic importance depending on the period in history, it was largely undeveloped until its use as a rail hub from the early 1900s, during the period of Japanese occupation.[9] From the 1980s, multiple national administrative functions were moved from Seoul to Daejeon, most of which are now located in the Daejeon Government Complex, resulting in another population increase.[10] The city hosted the 1986 Asian Games, the Taejon Expo '93, the International Mathematical Olympiads in 2000, and was elevated to the status of Metropolitan City in 2005.[11][12]\n\n\nDaejeon is situated in a lowland valley with three major rivers, all of them eventually flowing into the Yellow Sea by way of the Geum river. The city is surrounded by several small mountains, and is located approximately 170 km (105.6 mi) south of Seoul and 290 km (180 mi) north of Busan, and 70 km (43 mi) east of the Yellow Sea.[13] Daejeon experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season climate with wet, hot summers and drier, cold winters.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nHuman beings first settled in the Daejeon region during the Stone Age. It was occupied and in use as strategic military ground in various times by people such as the *Usul-gun* of Baekje, *Bipung-gun* of Silla, and the *Hoideok-hyeon*, *Yuseong-hyeon*, *Deokjin-hyeon*, and *Jinjam-hyeon*. During the Joseon Kingdom period, it remained occupied by the *Hoideok-hyeon* and *Jinjam-hyeon* of Gongju Mokha. In 1895, most of the area was made part of Hoideok-gun and Jinjam-gun, excluding some parts that belonged to Gongju-gun.\n\n\nThe Daejeon area was historically known as *Hanbat* (한밭),[14] a native Korean term for \"large field\", during the Joseon Dynasty. \"Daejeon\" simply means the same thing in Hanja. In the 19th century, Daejeon was also known in English as Kung-tsiou.[15]\n\n\nHistorically, Daejeon was a small village without many residents. However, in 1905, the Gyeongbu Railway began operations from Seoul to Busan, opening a station at Daejeon. In 1926 under the rule of the Japanese government, the Honam Railway was built between Mokpo and Daejeon, transforming the latter into a major transportation hub. Because of its location and proximity to means of transportation, Daejeon grew quickly.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eunhaeng-Sunhwa neighborhood (Kasuga-Cho), c. 1920\nAs railroads were laid under Japanese rule, an environment friendly to the Japanese was created, and many Japanese began to settle in Daejeon taking advantage of the opportunity. According to 1910 census data, 58%, or more than half of the 4,350 Daejeon population at the time, were Japanese. In 1925, 56% of the 8,861 people in Daejeon were Japanese. Therefore, Daejeon was one of the cities with great cultural influence of Japanese residents. For example, elderly people who experienced Japanese colonial era pronounce '단무지' (Pickled radish, danmuji) as '닥광/단광'(dakgwang/dangwang), '컵' (cup, keob) as '고뿌' (goffu) and '비닐' (vinyl, binil) as '비니루' (binilu). In addition, '우에시다리' (Uesidari), a representative team division game in Daejeon, was also created at this time and is believed to have been derived from the Japanese word '上(うえ, Ue)' meaning 'up' and the Japanese word '下(した, sita)' meaning 'down'.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Emblem of Taidenfu (Daejeonbu), the administrative division that existed during Japanese rule of Daejeon\nIn 1932, the capital of South Chungcheong Province was moved from Gongju to Daejeon. During the Korean War, the city was the site of an early major conflict: the Battle of Taejon. Also during the war, the mass graves of civilians killed by South Korean police were discovered near Taejon and reported on by Alan Winnington in his famous anti-war leaflet \"I Saw Truth in Korea\".[17][18] Embarrassed by the contents of the leaflet, the British government considered having him executed for treason, though instead decided to make him stateless.[19][20]\n\n\nSince then, changes have been made to the city's boundaries. Its official names have evolved, as well. Among the boundary modifications include one that effectively made the nearby town of Daedeok a part of the city in 1983. Then, in the late 1980s, Daejeon was elevated to the status of Special City (*Jikhalsi*), thus became a separate administrative region from South Chungcheong Province. In 1995, all South Korean Special Cities were again renamed as Metropolitan Cities, which is reflected in the current official name of Daejeon, Daejeon Metropolitan City (대전광역시).[12]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the Korean administration began moving various national government operations from Seoul to Daejeon, eventually opening the Daejeon Government Complex in 1997. Today, the national government offices in Daejeon include Korea Customs Service, Small and Medium Business Administration, Public Procurement Service, National Statistical Office, Military Manpower Administration, Korea Forest Service, Cultural Heritage Administration, Korean Intellectual Property Office, Korail, Korea Water Resources Corporation, Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation and Patent Court of Korea.\n\n\nThe population of Daejeon increased dramatically as a result of the government center.[21] However, with the construction of Sejong Special Self-Governing City in 2013 for the division of capital functions and balanced local development, many of the public institutions that had previously headed to Daejeon were moved to Sejong, and many public institutions in Seoul were also moved to Sejong. With the launch of Sejong City, large-scale development began, resulting in infrastructure construction and large-scale apartment complexes. Sejong is located immediately north of Daejeon, and Daejeon citizens began to outflow to Sejong. As of July 2020, there was net outflow of more than 100,000 people from Daejeon to Sejong.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walking path along the Gap River\nDaejeon lies between latitudes N36°10'59\" and N36°30'1\" and longitudes E127°14'48\" and E127°33'35\" near the middle of South Korea. It is 167.3 km (104.0 mi) from Seoul, 294 km (183 mi) from Busan and 169 km (105 mi) from Gwangju.\n\n\nKnown historically as 'big field,' the city lies inside a great circle surrounded by several mountains, with Gyeryongsan National Park straddling the city border on the west, and the foot of the Sobaek Mountain range just beyond the city to the south and east. Three rivers run through the center of the city: Gapcheon (갑천), Yudeungcheon (유등천), and Daejeoncheon (대전천). These flow roughly from south to north, eventually joining the Geum River which borders the city on the northeast. The river changes direction after leaving Daejeon, turning to the southwest and eventually emptying into the Yellow Sea near Gunsan.[22]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Daejeon\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 26\n\n\n\n4\n\n−6\n | 37\n\n\n\n7\n\n−4\n | 52\n\n\n\n13\n\n1\n | 82\n\n\n\n19\n\n7\n | 92\n\n\n\n25\n\n13\n | 167\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 307\n\n\n\n30\n\n22\n | 300\n\n\n\n30\n\n23\n | 153\n\n\n\n26\n\n17\n | 59\n\n\n\n21\n\n9\n | 48\n\n\n\n14\n\n3\n | 30\n\n\n\n6\n\n−3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 1\n\n\n\n39\n\n22\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n45\n\n26\n | 2\n\n\n\n55\n\n34\n | 3.2\n\n\n\n67\n\n44\n | 3.6\n\n\n\n76\n\n55\n | 6.6\n\n\n\n82\n\n65\n | 12\n\n\n\n85\n\n72\n | 12\n\n\n\n87\n\n73\n | 6\n\n\n\n79\n\n63\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n69\n\n49\n | 1.9\n\n\n\n56\n\n37\n | 1.2\n\n\n\n43\n\n26\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nDaejeon has a monsoon-influenced, four-season climate that lies between the humid subtropical and humid continental climatic classifications (Köppen *Cwa*/*Dwa*, respectively), with slightly more mild temperature extremes compared with Seoul.

Travel time between Daejeon and Seoul using the KTX high-speed rail system is about 50 minutes. The nearest airport to Daejeon is Cheongju Airport, about a thirty-minute drive north of Daejeon. However, there are also direct bus connections to Incheon International Airport.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Subway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daejeon Metro\n\n![](image)Tashu, the public bicycle of Daejeon\nOne line, Daejeon Subway Line 1, of a planned five-line subway system has been operating since 17 April 2007 (partial operations on this line began on 16 March 2006). This subway line connects Daejeon Station, located in the original city center, with the more modern and more recently developed sections of this city, including Dunsan, where the city hall and a number of national government buildings are located.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNotable differences between the Daejeon subway and the Seoul subway include narrower cars, no doors connecting cars, four cars per train rather than ten, and storage space under the seats for use by passengers.[59] Originally, plastic tokens for toll were read by a proximity sensor when entering the turnstiles, and then inserted into a slot when exiting. The design of the tokens allowed them to be used for advertising.[60] The system now employs the T-money system, a rechargeable series of Smart cards and other \"smart\" devices used for paying transportation fares. Platform screen doors are installed in the subway stations.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the public bicycle in Korea is different for each region, and the name of the public bicycle in Daejeon is **'타슈(Tashu)'[61]**. '타슈(Tashu) is a name created using the Chungcheong dialect, and if changed to standard Korean, it becomes '타세요(Taseyo)'. Tashu is an unmanned rental public bicycle service operated in Daejeon Metropolitan City since 2008, and the basic rental fee is 500 won, and if one purchases a daily ticket, the bicycle can be used unlimitedly within an hour on that day.

The city is home to 23 universities and colleges, including Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Chungnam National University, as well as government research institutes, and research and development centers for global companies such as Samsung, LG, mostly located in the city's Daedeok Science Town.[6][7]\n\n\nOccupied by humans since the Stone Age, Daejeon was historically a collection of small riverside villages.[8] Though the area had varying degrees of strategic importance depending on the period in history, it was largely undeveloped until its use as a rail hub from the early 1900s, during the period of Japanese occupation.[9] From the 1980s, multiple national administrative functions were moved from Seoul to Daejeon, most of which are now located in the Daejeon Government Complex, resulting in another population increase.[10] The city hosted the 1986 Asian Games, the Taejon Expo '93, the International Mathematical Olympiads in 2000, and was elevated to the status of Metropolitan City in 2005.[11][12]\n\n\nDaejeon is situated in a lowland valley with three major rivers, all of them eventually flowing into the Yellow Sea by way of the Geum river. The city is surrounded by several small mountains, and is located approximately 170 km (105.6 mi) south of Seoul and 290 km (180 mi) north of Busan, and 70 km (43 mi) east of the Yellow Sea.[13] Daejeon experiences a monsoon-influenced, four-season climate with wet, hot summers and drier, cold winters.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nHuman beings first settled in the Daejeon region during the Stone Age. It was occupied and in use as strategic military ground in various times by people such as the *Usul-gun* of Baekje, *Bipung-gun* of Silla, and the *Hoideok-hyeon*, *Yuseong-hyeon*, *Deokjin-hyeon*, and *Jinjam-hyeon*. During the Joseon Kingdom period, it remained occupied by the *Hoideok-hyeon* and *Jinjam-hyeon* of Gongju Mokha. In 1895, most of the area was made part of Hoideok-gun and Jinjam-gun, excluding some parts that belonged to Gongju-gun.\n\n\nThe Daejeon area was historically known as *Hanbat* (한밭),[14] a native Korean term for \"large field\", during the Joseon Dynasty. \"Daejeon\" simply means the same thing in Hanja. In the 19th century, Daejeon was also known in English as Kung-tsiou.[15]\n\n\nHistorically, Daejeon was a small village without many residents. However, in 1905, the Gyeongbu Railway began operations from Seoul to Busan, opening a station at Daejeon. In 1926 under the rule of the Japanese government, the Honam Railway was built between Mokpo and Daejeon, transforming the latter into a major transportation hub. Because of its location and proximity to means of transportation, Daejeon grew quickly.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eunhaeng-Sunhwa neighborhood (Kasuga-Cho), c. 1920\nAs railroads were laid under Japanese rule, an environment friendly to the Japanese was created, and many Japanese began to settle in Daejeon taking advantage of the opportunity. According to 1910 census data, 58%, or more than half of the 4,350 Daejeon population at the time, were Japanese. In 1925, 56% of the 8,861 people in Daejeon were Japanese. Therefore, Daejeon was one of the cities with great cultural influence of Japanese residents. For example, elderly people who experienced Japanese colonial era pronounce '단무지' (Pickled radish, danmuji) as '닥광/단광'(dakgwang/dangwang), '컵' (cup, keob) as '고뿌' (goffu) and '비닐' (vinyl, binil) as '비니루' (binilu). In addition, '우에시다리' (Uesidari), a representative team division game in Daejeon, was also created at this time and is believed to have been derived from the Japanese word '上(うえ, Ue)' meaning 'up' and the Japanese word '下(した, sita)' meaning 'down'.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Emblem of Taidenfu (Daejeonbu), the administrative division that existed during Japanese rule of Daejeon\nIn 1932, the capital of South Chungcheong Province was moved from Gongju to Daejeon. During the Korean War, the city was the site of an early major conflict: the Battle of Taejon. Also during the war, the mass graves of civilians killed by South Korean police were discovered near Taejon and reported on by Alan Winnington in his famous anti-war leaflet \"I Saw Truth in Korea\".[17][18] Embarrassed by the contents of the leaflet, the British government considered having him executed for treason, though instead decided to make him stateless.[19][20]\n\n\nSince then, changes have been made to the city's boundaries. Its official names have evolved, as well. Among the boundary modifications include one that effectively made the nearby town of Daedeok a part of the city in 1983. Then, in the late 1980s, Daejeon was elevated to the status of Special City (*Jikhalsi*), thus became a separate administrative region from South Chungcheong Province. In 1995, all South Korean Special Cities were again renamed as Metropolitan Cities, which is reflected in the current official name of Daejeon, Daejeon Metropolitan City (대전광역시).[12]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, the Korean administration began moving various national government operations from Seoul to Daejeon, eventually opening the Daejeon Government Complex in 1997. Today, the national government offices in Daejeon include Korea Customs Service, Small and Medium Business Administration, Public Procurement Service, National Statistical Office, Military Manpower Administration, Korea Forest Service, Cultural Heritage Administration, Korean Intellectual Property Office, Korail, Korea Water Resources Corporation, Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation and Patent Court of Korea.\n\n\nThe population of Daejeon increased dramatically as a result of the government center.[21] However, with the construction of Sejong Special Self-Governing City in 2013 for the division of capital functions and balanced local development, many of the public institutions that had previously headed to Daejeon were moved to Sejong, and many public institutions in Seoul were also moved to Sejong. With the launch of Sejong City, large-scale development began, resulting in infrastructure construction and large-scale apartment complexes. Sejong is located immediately north of Daejeon, and Daejeon citizens began to outflow to Sejong. As of July 2020, there was net outflow of more than 100,000 people from Daejeon to Sejong.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walking path along the Gap River\nDaejeon lies between latitudes N36°10'59\" and N36°30'1\" and longitudes E127°14'48\" and E127°33'35\" near the middle of South Korea. It is 167.3 km (104.0 mi) from Seoul, 294 km (183 mi) from Busan and 169 km (105 mi) from Gwangju.\n\n\nKnown historically as 'big field,' the city lies inside a great circle surrounded by several mountains, with Gyeryongsan National Park straddling the city border on the west, and the foot of the Sobaek Mountain range just beyond the city to the south and east. Three rivers run through the center of the city: Gapcheon (갑천), Yudeungcheon (유등천), and Daejeoncheon (대전천). These flow roughly from south to north, eventually joining the Geum River which borders the city on the northeast. The river changes direction after leaving Daejeon, turning to the southwest and eventually emptying into the Yellow Sea near Gunsan.[22]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Daejeon\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 26\n\n\n\n4\n\n−6\n | 37\n\n\n\n7\n\n−4\n | 52\n\n\n\n13\n\n1\n | 82\n\n\n\n19\n\n7\n | 92\n\n\n\n25\n\n13\n | 167\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 307\n\n\n\n30\n\n22\n | 300\n\n\n\n30\n\n23\n | 153\n\n\n\n26\n\n17\n | 59\n\n\n\n21\n\n9\n | 48\n\n\n\n14\n\n3\n | 30\n\n\n\n6\n\n−3\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 1\n\n\n\n39\n\n22\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n45\n\n26\n | 2\n\n\n\n55\n\n34\n | 3.2\n\n\n\n67\n\n44\n | 3.6\n\n\n\n76\n\n55\n | 6.6\n\n\n\n82\n\n65\n | 12\n\n\n\n85\n\n72\n | 12\n\n\n\n87\n\n73\n | 6\n\n\n\n79\n\n63\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n69\n\n49\n | 1.9\n\n\n\n56\n\n37\n | 1.2\n\n\n\n43\n\n26\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nDaejeon has a monsoon-influenced, four-season climate that lies between the humid subtropical and humid continental climatic classifications (Köppen *Cwa*/*Dwa*, respectively), with slightly more mild temperature extremes compared with Seoul.

The Daejeon World Cup Stadium was constructed for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, hosting several games including the South Korea vs. Italy match in the round of 16.[57] The facility is now the home of the city's football club. The Daejeon Hanbat Sports Complex was built in 1964, and was one of the host sites of the 1986 Asian Games, and also hosted preliminaries during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Today, with several of the facilities renovated, it hosts the city's professional baseball, K3 League football, and volleyball teams.

Travel time between Daejeon and Seoul using the KTX high-speed rail system is about 50 minutes. The nearest airport to Daejeon is Cheongju Airport, about a thirty-minute drive north of Daejeon. However, there are also direct bus connections to Incheon International Airport.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Subway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daejeon Metro\n\n![](image)Tashu, the public bicycle of Daejeon\nOne line, Daejeon Subway Line 1, of a planned five-line subway system has been operating since 17 April 2007 (partial operations on this line began on 16 March 2006). This subway line connects Daejeon Station, located in the original city center, with the more modern and more recently developed sections of this city, including Dunsan, where the city hall and a number of national government buildings are located.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNotable differences between the Daejeon subway and the Seoul subway include narrower cars, no doors connecting cars, four cars per train rather than ten, and storage space under the seats for use by passengers.[59] Originally, plastic tokens for toll were read by a proximity sensor when entering the turnstiles, and then inserted into a slot when exiting. The design of the tokens allowed them to be used for advertising.[60] The system now employs the T-money system, a rechargeable series of Smart cards and other \"smart\" devices used for paying transportation fares. Platform screen doors are installed in the subway stations.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nThe name of the public bicycle in Korea is different for each region, and the name of the public bicycle in Daejeon is **'타슈(Tashu)'[61]**. '타슈(Tashu) is a name created using the Chungcheong dialect, and if changed to standard Korean, it becomes '타세요(Taseyo)'. Tashu is an unmanned rental public bicycle service operated in Daejeon Metropolitan City since 2008, and the basic rental fee is 500 won, and if one purchases a daily ticket, the bicycle can be used unlimitedly within an hour on that day. In other words, if you return it within an hour of rental, you can re-rent it for free immediately after returning it and use it for another hour. However, if it exceeds one hour, an extra fee will be automatically charged. The rental time is from 5 a.m. to 0 a.m., and rental is not possible from 0 a.m. to 5 a.m., and only return is possible. The name '타슈(Tashu)' is considered a good example of branding because it is a good name for anyone in the world to pronounce while maintaining their local identity.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![South Chuncheong Provincial Office in 1920s](image)\n\nSouth Chuncheong Provincial Office in 1920s\n* ![Government offices for the South Chungcheong province in 2007](image)\n\nGovernment offices for the South Chungcheong province in 2007\n* ![Daejeon Station in 1920s](image)\n\nDaejeon Station in 1920s\n* ![Daejeon train station in 2007](image)\n\nDaejeon train station in 2007\n* ![Daejeon O-World [ko]](image)\n\nDaejeon O-World [ko]\n* ![Uam Historic Park](image)\n\nUam Historic Park\n* ![Pyeongsong Youth Cultural Center and blocks of flats of Dunsan-dong district from Lotte City Hotel Daejeon in 2020](image)\n\nPyeongsong Youth Cultural Center and blocks of flats of Dunsan-dong district from Lotte City Hotel Daejeon in 2020\n* ![Mokcheok Bridge](image)\n\nMokcheok Bridge\n* ![Immigration office](image)\n\nImmigration office\n* ![View of Daejeon from Sikjang Mountain, with Dong-gu in the foreground](image)\n\nView of Daejeon from Sikjang Mountain, with Dong-gu in the foreground\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million.[8] The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong River is Korea's longest river and Busan's Haeundae Beach is also the country's largest.\n\n\nBusan is a center for international conventions, hosting an APEC summit in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the 2002 Asian Games and FIFA World Cup. It is home to the world's largest department store, the Shinsegae Centum City.[9] Busan was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a \"City of Film\" in December 2014.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Busan** (Korean: 부산; Korean pronunciation: [pusan]), officially known as **Busan Metropolitan City**, is South Korea's second most populous city after Seoul, with a population of over 3.4 million inhabitants as of 2017.[5] Formerly romanized as **Pusan** (and **Fuzan** under Japanese rule), it is the economic, cultural and educational center of southeastern South Korea, with its port being South Korea's busiest and the sixth-busiest in the world.[a] The surrounding \"Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region\" (including Ulsan, South Gyeongsang, Daegu, and some of North Gyeongsang and South Jeolla) is South Korea's largest industrial area.

Today, Busan has divided into fifteen *gu* and one *gun* (county).\n\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Korean War, Busan was one of only two cities in South Korea not captured by the North Korean army within the first three months of the war, the other being Daegu. As a result, the cities became refugee camp sites for Koreans during the war. According to the *Korea Times*, around 500,000 refugees were located in Busan in early 1951.[18]\n\n\nAs Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the Korean War, for some time it served as a *de facto* capital of the Republic of Korea.[*citation needed*] UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the Pusan Perimeter in the summer and fall of 1950. Since then, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character. \n\n\nIn 1963, Busan separated from Gyeongsangnam-do to become a Directly Governed City (직할시). In 1983, the provincial capital of Gyeongsangnam-do was moved from Busan to Changwon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Station or Newspaper\n | Types\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Busan KBS\n | TV, Radio\n |\n| Busan MBC\n | TV, Radio\n |\n| KNN | TV, Radio\n |\n| Busan CBS\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan BBS\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan eFM\n | Radio (English, Chinese)\n |\n| Busan PBC\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan Ilbo\n | Daily Newspaper\n |\n| Kookje Shinmun\n | Daily Newspaper\n |\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Seoul remains the de facto film and television capital of South Korea, Busan shares more in common with Cannes, France than just its reputation as seaside resort town.[53]\n\n\nThe Busan International Film Festival is often referred to as the \"Cannes of Asia\", attracting thousands of entertainment personalities from both Eastern and Western cinema every year, honoring and recognizing international luminaries such as Mike Leigh, Shōhei Imamura, Wong Kar-wai, and Kim Ki-duk.[54][55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city also hosts the One Asia Festival, the largest K-pop festival in Korea beginning in 2016, positioning itself as the center of K-pop culture.[43]\n\n\nIn 2012, German artist Hendrik Beikirch painted Asia's tallest mural entitled \"Fisherman Portrait\" on a building near Millak Raw Fish Town.[44]\n\n\nBusan is home to 80 performance facilities consisting of 30 public ones, including the Busan Cultural Center, Busan Citizens'Hall, Busan Cinema Center, and Busan National Gugak Center.

Busan's Oncheon is the oldest hot spring spa in Korea. It even has its unique history, where long ago an old man with aching legs was said to have seen an injured crane come to the hot spring and bath in it. After bathing in its waters, the crane became completely cured and happily flew away. Upon seeing this, the old man also bathed his aching legs in the water and was cured. Among the hot spas, 'Dongnae Oncheon' and 'Haeundae Oncheon' are the most famous ones. Today, the spas have an outdoor bath and sauna.\n\n\n\n* Spa Land (Haeundae-Gu)\n* HurShimChung Hot Spring Resorts and Spa Town (Dongnae-Gu)\n* Haeundae Hot Spring Resorts and Spa Towns (Haeundae-Gu)\n* Dongnae Hot Spring Resorts and Spa Towns (Dongnae-Gu)\n* Gwangalli Spa Towns (Suyeong-Gu)\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe name \"Busan\" is the Revised Romanization of the city's Korean name since the late 15th century.[11] It officially replaced the earlier McCune-Reischauer romanization *Pusan* in 2000.[12][b] During the Japanese occupation it was spelled \"Fuzan\".\n\n\nThe name 釜山 (now written 부산 using the Korean alphabet) is Sino-Korean for \"Cauldron Mountain\", believed to be a former name of Mt Hwangryeong (황령산, 荒嶺山, *Hwangryeong-san*) west of the city center. The area's ancient state Mt Geochil (거칠산국, 居柒山國, *Geochilsan-guk*, \"Rough-Mountain Land\") is similarly thought to refer to the same mountain, which towers over the town's harbor on the Suyeong. (The later Silla district of Geochilsan-gun was renamed Dongnae in 757.)[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Busan International Film Festival, Busan International Fireworks Festival, Busan Jagalchi Festival, Asia Song Festival,[75] Busan One-Asia Festival, The Dongnae-eupseong History Festival\n |\n| November\n | G-Star-Global Game Exhibition, Busan Choral Festival & Competition\n |\n| December\n | Busan Christmas Tree Festival\n |\n\n\n## Medical facilities[edit]\n\n\nBusan has many hospitals and clinics.\nMany cosmetic surgery, dermatological, ophthalmic, and dental clinics are concentrated in *Seomyeon medical street*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBusan is located on the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula. It is located on the coast, which determined the development of the whole city itself. The distance from Busan to Seoul is about 314 km (195 mi). Busan borders low mountains on the north and west, and the seas on the south and east. The Nakdong River Delta is located on the west side of the city, and Geumjeongsan, the highest mountain in the city, is on the north. The Nakdong River, South Korea's longest river, flows through the west and empties into the Korea Strait. The southeastern region, called Yeongnam in Korea, encompasses both Gyeongsang Provinces and 3 metropolitan cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. Ulsan lies northeast of Busan. The combined population exceeds 13 million.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"Kiswire Museum and Training Center\". *Architizer*. 5 May 2015.

Some of these refugees stayed and adapted and adjusted the recipes of their local specialties. One of these foods is *milmyeon* (밀면) (lit. 'wheat noodle') a version of *naengmyeon*, cold buckwheat noodle soup, but using wheat flour instead. (Naengmyeon is originally a specialty food of Hamhung and Pyongyang, now part of North Korea.[49][50]) *Dwaeji gukbap* (돼지국밥) (lit. 'pork/pig soup rice') is also a result of Korean War. It is a hearty pork soup and is becoming more popular nationwide.[51] Pork trotters served with vegetables such as cucumbers, onions, and mustard sauce is popular and is called Nangchae-Jokbal.[52]\n\n\n\n### Hot spring resorts and spas[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Gwangbok-dong, Nampo-dong, and Jungang-dong areas form the old central business district.

Jungang-dong is the home of many international law offices, the old Immigration Office, and the international ferry terminal serving Japanese routes. Lotte World II is currently under construction along the water between Jungang-dong 7-Ga and 8-Ga.[33]\n\n\nCentum City, an industrial complex, contains luxury department stores.

The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million.[8] The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong River is Korea's longest river and Busan's Haeundae Beach is also the country's largest.\n\n\nBusan is a center for international conventions, hosting an APEC summit in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the 2002 Asian Games and FIFA World Cup. It is home to the world's largest department store, the Shinsegae Centum City.[9] Busan was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a \"City of Film\" in December 2014.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Busan** (Korean: 부산; Korean pronunciation: [pusan]), officially known as **Busan Metropolitan City**, is South Korea's second most populous city after Seoul, with a population of over 3.4 million inhabitants as of 2017.[5] Formerly romanized as **Pusan** (and **Fuzan** under Japanese rule), it is the economic, cultural and educational center of southeastern South Korea, with its port being South Korea's busiest and the sixth-busiest in the world.[a] The surrounding \"Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region\" (including Ulsan, South Gyeongsang, Daegu, and some of North Gyeongsang and South Jeolla) is South Korea's largest industrial area. The large volumes of port traffic and urban population in excess of 1 million make Busan a Large-Port metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This subsection **needs additional citations for verification**.

Today, Busan has divided into fifteen *gu* and one *gun* (county).\n\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Korean War, Busan was one of only two cities in South Korea not captured by the North Korean army within the first three months of the war, the other being Daegu. As a result, the cities became refugee camp sites for Koreans during the war. According to the *Korea Times*, around 500,000 refugees were located in Busan in early 1951.[18]\n\n\nAs Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the Korean War, for some time it served as a *de facto* capital of the Republic of Korea.[*citation needed*] UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the Pusan Perimeter in the summer and fall of 1950. Since then, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character. \n\n\nIn 1963, Busan separated from Gyeongsangnam-do to become a Directly Governed City (직할시). In 1983, the provincial capital of Gyeongsangnam-do was moved from Busan to Changwon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Station or Newspaper\n | Types\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Busan KBS\n | TV, Radio\n |\n| Busan MBC\n | TV, Radio\n |\n| KNN | TV, Radio\n |\n| Busan CBS\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan BBS\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan eFM\n | Radio (English, Chinese)\n |\n| Busan PBC\n | Radio\n |\n| Busan Ilbo\n | Daily Newspaper\n |\n| Kookje Shinmun\n | Daily Newspaper\n |\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Seoul remains the de facto film and television capital of South Korea, Busan shares more in common with Cannes, France than just its reputation as seaside resort town.[53]\n\n\nThe Busan International Film Festival is often referred to as the \"Cannes of Asia\", attracting thousands of entertainment personalities from both Eastern and Western cinema every year, honoring and recognizing international luminaries such as Mike Leigh, Shōhei Imamura, Wong Kar-wai, and Kim Ki-duk.[54][55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city also hosts the One Asia Festival, the largest K-pop festival in Korea beginning in 2016, positioning itself as the center of K-pop culture.[43]\n\n\nIn 2012, German artist Hendrik Beikirch painted Asia's tallest mural entitled \"Fisherman Portrait\" on a building near Millak Raw Fish Town.[44]\n\n\nBusan is home to 80 performance facilities consisting of 30 public ones, including the Busan Cultural Center, Busan Citizens'Hall, Busan Cinema Center, and Busan National Gugak Center.

Busan's Oncheon is the oldest hot spring spa in Korea. It even has its unique history, where long ago an old man with aching legs was said to have seen an injured crane come to the hot spring and bath in it. After bathing in its waters, the crane became completely cured and happily flew away. Upon seeing this, the old man also bathed his aching legs in the water and was cured. Among the hot spas, 'Dongnae Oncheon' and 'Haeundae Oncheon' are the most famous ones.

The Nakdong River Delta is located on the west side of the city, and Geumjeongsan, the highest mountain in the city, is on the north. The Nakdong River, South Korea's longest river, flows through the west and empties into the Korea Strait. The southeastern region, called Yeongnam in Korea, encompasses both Gyeongsang Provinces and 3 metropolitan cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. Ulsan lies northeast of Busan.

Gwangju was historically recorded as *Muju* (무주; 武州), in which \"Silla merged all of the land to establish the provinces of Gwangju, Ungju, Jeonju, Muju and various counties, plus the southern boundary of Goguryeo and the ancient territories of Silla\" in the *Samguk Sagi.*[3] In the heart of the agricultural Jeolla region, the city is also famous for its rich and diverse cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A memorial to commemorate the lives lost in the 1980 Gwangju uprising.\nThe city was established in 57 BC. It was one of the administrative centers of Baekje during the Three Kingdoms Period.[4]\n\n\nIn 1929, during the period of Imperial Japanese rule, a confrontation between Korean and Japanese students in the city turned into Gwangju Student Independence Movement, a regional demonstration, which culminated in one of the major nationwide uprisings against Imperial Japanese cruelty during the colonial period.\n\n\nThe modern industry was established in Gwangju with the construction of a railway to Seoul. Some of the industries that took hold include cotton textiles, rice mills and breweries. Construction of a designated industrial zone in 1967 encouraged growth in industry, especially in the sectors linked to the automobile industry.\n\n\nIn May 1980, peaceful demonstrations took place in Gwangju against Chun Doo-hwan, leader of the military coup d'état of 12 December 1979. The demonstrations were suppressed by military forces, including elite units of the Special Operations Command. The situation escalated after a violent crackdown, resulting in the Gwangju Uprising, where civilians raided armories and armed themselves. By the time the uprising was suppressed 9 days later, many hundreds of civilians and several police forces / soldiers were dead. After civilian rule was reinstated in 1987, a national cemetery was established to honor the victims of the incident.[5]\n\n\nIn 1986, Gwangju separated from Jeollanam-do to become a Directly Governed City (Jikhalsi), and then became a Metropolitan City (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995.[4]\n\n\nDue to a variety of factors, including the ancient rivalry between Baekje and Silla, as well as the biased priority given to the Gyeongsang region by political leaders in the 2nd half of the 20th century, Gwangju has a long history of voting for left-leaning politicians and is the main stronghold for the liberal Democratic Party of Korea along with its predecessors, as well as the progressive Justice Party.\n\n\nGwangju held many sports events such as 2002 FIFA World Cup, 2015 Summer Universiade, 2019 World Aquatics Championships.\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Gwangju\n\nGwangju is divided into 5 districts (\"Gu\").\n\n\n\n\n\n| Map\n | Name\n | Korean | Hanja |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n |\n| Districts\n |\n| Buk District | 북구 | 北區 |\n| Dong District | 동구 | 東區 |\n| Gwangsan District | 광산구 | 光山區 |\n| Nam District | 남구 | 南區 |\n| Seo District | 서구 | 西區 |\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Gwangju (2015)[6]\n\n\n\nNot religious (61%)\nProtestantism (20%)\nBuddhism (9.5%)\nCatholicism (8.7%)\nOther (0.8%)\n\nAccording to the census of 2015, 9.5% of the population followed Buddhism and 28.7% followed Christianity (20% Protestantism and 8.7% Catholicism) 61% of the population are irreligious.[6]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe population model of Gwangju is as follows;[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1960 |   409,283\n |\n| 1966 |   532,235\n |\n| 1970 |   622,755\n |\n| 1975 |   737,283\n |\n| 1980 |   856,545\n |\n| 1985 | 1,042,508\n |\n| 1990 | 1,139,003\n |\n| 1995 | 1,257,636\n |\n| 2000 | 1,352,797\n |\n| 2005 | 1,417,716\n |\n| 2010 | 1,475,745\n |\n| 2016 | 1,500,621\n |\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nGwangju has a cooler version of the humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cfa/Cwa*) with four distinct seasons and rainfall year-round but particularly during the East Asian Monsoon Season in the summer months.\n\n\nWinters, while still somewhat cold, are milder than in Seoul and cities further north due to the city's southwesterly position in the Korean peninsula. \nSummers are hot and humid with abundant precipitation, particularly in the form of thunderstorms.

It is a designated metropolitan city under the direct control of the central government's Home Minister. The city was also the capital of South Jeolla Province until the provincial office moved to the southern village of Namak in Muan County in 2005 because Gwangju was promoted to a metropolitan city and was independent of South Jeolla province.\n\n\nIts name is composed of the words *Gwang* (Korean: 광; Hanja: 光) meaning \"light\" and *Ju* (주; 州) meaning \"province\". Gwangju was historically recorded as *Muju* (무주; 武州), in which \"Silla merged all of the land to establish the provinces of Gwangju, Ungju, Jeonju, Muju and various counties, plus the southern boundary of Goguryeo and the ancient territories of Silla\" in the *Samguk Sagi.*[3] In the heart of the agricultural Jeolla region, the city is also famous for its rich and diverse cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A memorial to commemorate the lives lost in the 1980 Gwangju uprising.\nThe city was established in 57 BC. It was one of the administrative centers of Baekje during the Three Kingdoms Period.[4]\n\n\nIn 1929, during the period of Imperial Japanese rule, a confrontation between Korean and Japanese students in the city turned into Gwangju Student Independence Movement, a regional demonstration, which culminated in one of the major nationwide uprisings against Imperial Japanese cruelty during the colonial period.\n\n\nThe modern industry was established in Gwangju with the construction of a railway to Seoul. Some of the industries that took hold include cotton textiles, rice mills and breweries. Construction of a designated industrial zone in 1967 encouraged growth in industry, especially in the sectors linked to the automobile industry.\n\n\nIn May 1980, peaceful demonstrations took place in Gwangju against Chun Doo-hwan, leader of the military coup d'état of 12 December 1979. The demonstrations were suppressed by military forces, including elite units of the Special Operations Command. The situation escalated after a violent crackdown, resulting in the Gwangju Uprising, where civilians raided armories and armed themselves. By the time the uprising was suppressed 9 days later, many hundreds of civilians and several police forces / soldiers were dead. After civilian rule was reinstated in 1987, a national cemetery was established to honor the victims of the incident.[5]\n\n\nIn 1986, Gwangju separated from Jeollanam-do to become a Directly Governed City (Jikhalsi), and then became a Metropolitan City (Gwangyeoksi) in 1995.[4]\n\n\nDue to a variety of factors, including the ancient rivalry between Baekje and Silla, as well as the biased priority given to the Gyeongsang region by political leaders in the 2nd half of the 20th century, Gwangju has a long history of voting for left-leaning politicians and is the main stronghold for the liberal Democratic Party of Korea along with its predecessors, as well as the progressive Justice Party.\n\n\nGwangju held many sports events such as 2002 FIFA World Cup, 2015 Summer Universiade, 2019 World Aquatics Championships.\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Gwangju\n\nGwangju is divided into 5 districts (\"Gu\").\n\n\n\n\n\n| Map\n | Name\n | Korean | Hanja |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n |\n| Districts\n |\n| Buk District | 북구 | 北區 |\n| Dong District | 동구 | 東區 |\n| Gwangsan District | 광산구 | 光山區 |\n| Nam District | 남구 | 南區 |\n| Seo District | 서구 | 西區 |\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Gwangju (2015)[6]\n\n\n\nNot religious (61%)\nProtestantism (20%)\nBuddhism (9.5%)\nCatholicism (8.7%)\nOther (0.8%)\n\nAccording to the census of 2015, 9.5% of the population followed Buddhism and 28.7% followed Christianity (20% Protestantism and 8.7% Catholicism) 61% of the population are irreligious.[6]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe population model of Gwangju is as follows;[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1960 |   409,283\n |\n| 1966 |   532,235\n |\n| 1970 |   622,755\n |\n| 1975 |   737,283\n |\n| 1980 |   856,545\n |\n| 1985 | 1,042,508\n |\n| 1990 | 1,139,003\n |\n| 1995 | 1,257,636\n |\n| 2000 | 1,352,797\n |\n| 2005 | 1,417,716\n |\n| 2010 | 1,475,745\n |\n| 2016 | 1,500,621\n |\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nGwangju has a cooler version of the humid subtropical climate (Köppen: *Cfa/Cwa*) with four distinct seasons and rainfall year-round but particularly during the East Asian Monsoon Season in the summer months.\n\n\nWinters, while still somewhat cold, are milder than in Seoul and cities further north due to the city's southwesterly position in the Korean peninsula. \nSummers are hot and humid with abundant precipitation, particularly in the form of thunderstorms. Gwangju is one of the warmest cities in Korea in the summer due to its geographic location.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Gwangju (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1939–present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 36.7(98.1)\n | 38.5(101.3)\n | 38.5(101.3)\n | 34.5(94.1)\n | 31.1(88.0)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 38.5(101.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 19.9(67.8)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 27.9(82.2)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 30.9(87.6)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 8.0(46.4)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | 2.9(37.2)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 13.4(56.1)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 25.9(78.6)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | −2.7(27.1)\n | −1.5(29.3)\n | 2.4(36.3)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 13.4(56.1)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 23.2(73.8)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 11.2(52.2)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | −0.8(30.6)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −19.4(−2.9)\n | −17.7(0.1)\n | −10.7(12.7)\n | −4.5(23.9)\n | 1.4(34.5)\n | 7.2(45.0)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | −2.7(27.1)\n | −7.2(19.0)\n | −13.7(7.3)\n | −19.4(−2.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 32.6(1.28)\n | 43.6(1.72)\n | 61.9(2.44)\n | 86.6(3.41)\n | 91.4(3.60)\n | 152.6(6.01)\n | 294.2(11.58)\n | 326.4(12.85)\n | 145.0(5.71)\n | 59.0(2.32)\n | 50.2(1.98)\n | 37.1(1.46)\n | 1,380.6(54.35)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.1 mm) | 10.1\n | 8.2\n | 8.8\n | 8.9\n | 9.0\n | 10.2\n | 15.1\n | 15.0\n | 9.6\n | 6.8\n | 8.8\n | 10.2\n | 120.7\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 9.9\n | 6.3\n | 2.4\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 1.1\n | 8.4\n | 28.4\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 65.7\n | 61.6\n | 60.3\n | 60.2\n | 64.5\n | 72.0\n | 79.8\n | 78.0\n | 73.6\n | 67.6\n | 66.9\n | 66.9\n | 68.1\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 161.4\n | 170.5\n | 201.0\n | 214.1\n | 227.9\n | 169.9\n | 143.1\n | 169.0\n | 174.4\n | 208.5\n | 167.4\n | 156.9\n | 2,164.1\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 51.1\n | 53.4\n | 51.8\n | 54.3\n | 51.3\n | 39.0\n | 32.9\n | 41.4\n | 46.3\n | 58.5\n | 52.7\n | 51.1\n | 48.0\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 5\n | 5\n | 7\n | 6\n | 5\n | 3\n | 3\n | 2\n | 4\n |\n| Source 1: Korea Meteorological Administration (percent sunshine 1981–2010)[8][9][10] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[11] |\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nChonnam National University, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, and Gwangju Education University are public universities in Gwangju.\n\n\nHonam University, Gwangju University, Gwangshin University, Gwangju Women's University, Nambu University, Chosun University, and Honam Christian University are private universities.\n\n\nGwangju Health University is a private community college offering associate degrees in humanities and social sciences, healthcare sciences, and a bachelor's degree in nursing.\n\n\nGwangju has 593 schools, consisting of 234 kindergartens, 145 elementary schools, 84 middle schools, 65 high schools, 1 science high school,[12] 7 junior colleges, 9 universities, 38 graduate schools, and 11 others (as of 1 May 2009) with a total of 406,669 students, or 28.5% of the total city population.
