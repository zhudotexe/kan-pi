{"id": "4172435efe8bdd8b", "answer": "```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Boston Celtics\",\n  \"content\": \"The Boston Celtics are a professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden, which is also the home of the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins. The Celtics are one of the most successful teams in NBA history. The franchise's 17 NBA championships are the joint most of any team, alongside their historical rival Los Angeles Lakers. The Celtics currently hold the record for the most recorded wins of any NBA team.\\n\\nThe Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, which was heavily highlighted throughout the 1960s and 1980s. During the two teams' many match-ups in the 1980s, the Celtics' star, Larry Bird, and the Lakers' star, Magic Johnson, had an ongoing feud. The franchise has played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals (including recent appearances in 2008 and 2010), of which the Celtics have won nine.\\n\\nFour Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for an NBA record total of 10 MVP awards. Both the nickname \\\"Celtics\\\" and their mascot \\\"Lucky the Leprechaun\\\" are a nod to Boston's historically large Irish population, and also to the Original Celtics, a marquee team prior to the NBA.\\n\\nThe Celtics' rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after the team, led by coach Red Auerbach, acquired center Bill Russell, who would become the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty, in a draft-day trade in 1956. Led by Russell and point guard Bob Cousy, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, K. C. Jones, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966.\\n\\nAfter Russell retired in 1969, the team entered a period of rebuilding. In the mid-1970s, the Celtics became contenders once again, winning two championships in 1974 and 1976 under the leadership of center Dave Cowens, forward John Havlicek, and point guard Jo Jo White. In the 1980s, the Celtics returned to dominance, as well as renewed competition with the \\\"Showtime\\\" Lakers, who were led by Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Anchored by the \\\"Big Three\\\" of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the Celtics won championships in 1981, 1984, and 1986.\\n\\nThe team struggled through the 1990s and much of the early 2000s. It was not until the Celtics assembled a new \\\"Big Three\\\" of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen that they found success once again. Under the leadership of head coach Doc Rivers, the team beat the Lakers to win a championship in 2008, but lost to Los Angeles in a seven-game series in 2010.\\n\\nThe Celtics have had several notable rivalries, including with the Atlanta Hawks, Brooklyn Nets, Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks, Philadelphia 76ers, and Washington Wizards. The team has also had many memorable players and coaches, including Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Doc Rivers, and Brad Stevens.\"\n}\n```", "question": "What is the total point differential in points scored between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers in series-deciding playoff games since 2012?", "log_dir": "/mnt/nlpgpu-io1/data/andrz/redel/experiments/fanoutqa/mistral/root-fc/4172435efe8bdd8b"}

(2015)[2] |\\n\\n\\nThe **president of the People's Republic of China**, commonly called the **president of China**, is the ceremonial head of state of the People's Republic of China. The presidency is a part of the system of people's congress based on the principle of unified power in which the National People's Congress (NPC) functions as the only branch of government and as the highest state organ of power. The presidency is a state organ of the NPC and equivalent to, for instance, the State Council and the National Supervisory Commission, rather than a political office, unlike the premier of the State Council. Together with the NPC Standing Committee, the presidency performs certain heads of state functions. The president can engage in state activities with the consent of the NPC Standing Committee. While the presidency is not a powerful organ in itself, since 27 March 1993, the president has concurrently served as general secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and chairman of the Central Military Commission, making the incumbent China's paramount leader and commander-in-chief.\\n\\n\\nThe first state representative of the People's Republic of China was the chairman of the Central People's Government, which was established on 1 October 1949 by a decision of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. It was replaced in Constitution in 1954 with the office of state chairman. It was successively held by Mao Zedong and Liu Shaoqi. Liu fell into political disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, after which the presidency became vacant. The post of chairman was abolished under the Constitution of 1975, and the function of state representative was bestowed on the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee. The office was reinstated in the Constitution of 1982 but with reduced powers. Since 1982, the title's official English-language translation has been \\\"president\\\", although the Chinese title remains unchanged.[note 1]\\n\\n\\nDuring the Mao era, there were no term limits for the presidency. Between 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms. In 2018, term limits were abolished in order to align the presidency with the position of CCP general secretary, which does not have term limits. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## History[edit]\\n\\n\\n\\n### Establishment in 1954[edit]\\n\\n\\nThe office of state chairman (the original English translation) was first established under the 1954 Constitution.[2] Though the ceremonial powers of the office were largely identical to those in the current Constitution, the powers of the 1954 office differed from those of the current office in two areas: military and governmental.[2] The state chairman's military powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \\\"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China commands the armed forces of the state, and is chairman of the National Defence Council (Chinese: \\u56fd\\u9632\\u59d4\\u5458\\u4f1a).\\\"[2] The National Defence Council was unique to the 1954 Constitution, and was mandated as the civil command for the People's Liberation Army. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution.\\n\\n\\nThe state chairman's governmental powers were defined in the 1954 Constitution as follows: \\\"The Chairman of the People's Republic of China, whenever necessary, convenes a Supreme State Conference (Chinese: \\u6700\\u9ad8\\u56fd\\u4f1a\\u8bae) and acts as its chairman.\\\"[2] The members of the Supreme State Conference included the main officers of state, and its views were to be presented to the main organs of state and government, including the National People's Congress and the State and National Defense Councils.[2] The Supreme State Conference was also unique to the 1954 Constitution. It was abolished under the 1975 Constitution and later Constitutions have not included a similar body.\\n\\n\\n\\n### History up to 1974[edit]\\n\\n\\n\\nCCP Chairman Mao Zedong was the first to hold the office of state chairman. He was elected at the founding session of the National People's Congress in 1954. At the 2nd NPC in 1959, Mao was succeeded by Liu Shaoqi, first-ranked Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Liu was reelected as state chairman at the 3rd NPC in Jan 1965. However, in 1966, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution and by August 1966 Mao and his supporters succeeding in removing Liu from his position as party vice chairman. A few months later Liu was apparently placed under house arrest, and after a prolonged power struggle the 12th Plenum of the 8th Communist Party Congress stripped Liu Shaoqi of all his party and non-party positions on 31 October 1968, including the post of state chairman.
