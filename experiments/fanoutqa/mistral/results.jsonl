{"id": "2b19d0853e149804", "answer": "### Lung Cancer\n\nLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for 1.8 million deaths annually as of 2018. It is the most common cancer in men and the third most common cancer in women. The main types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC accounts for about 85% of all lung cancer cases and SCLC for about 15%. The most common risk factors for lung cancer are smoking, exposure to radon, asbestos, and air pollution.\n\n#### Signs and Symptoms\n\nTypical signs and symptoms of lung cancer include:\n\n- Persistent cough\n- Chest pain\n- Shortness of breath\n- Coughing up blood\n\nOther symptoms may include weight loss, bone pain, and headache. If lung cancer spreads to other parts of the body, symptoms may include pain in other areas, fatigue, and weight loss. Lung cancer can also cause symptoms that are not specific to cancer, such as infections like pneumonia. Early detection and treatment can improve outcomes.\n\n#### Causes\n\nSmoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, accounting for about 80% of lung cancer deaths. Exposure to radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas, is the second leading cause of lung cancer. Radon is a colorless, odorless gas that comes from the natural breakdown of uranium. Exposure to asbestos, a group of carcinogens found in some foods, can also increase the risk of lung cancer. Air pollution, particularly from particulate matter, can also contribute to lung cancer risk.\n\n#### Diagnosis\n\nDiagnosing lung cancer typically involves imaging tests such as chest X-rays, CT scans, MRI, or PET scans. These tests can help determine the presence, location, and extent of the cancer. A biopsy may also be performed to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n#### Treatment\n\nTreatment for lung cancer depends on the type, stage, and spread of the cancer. Options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Early-stage lung cancer may be treated with surgery alone, while advanced stages often require a combination of treatments. Lung cancer is one of the most difficult cancers to treat, and the prognosis is generally poor.\n\n#### Prevention\n\nPreventing lung cancer involves avoiding exposure to risk factors such as smoking, radon, and air pollution. Early detection through screening programs can also improve outcomes.", "question": "What are the symptoms of the top 5 mortality cancers in the world amongst females?", "log_dir": "/mnt/nlpgpu-io1/data/andrz/redel/experiments/fanoutqa/mistral/2b19d0853e149804"}
