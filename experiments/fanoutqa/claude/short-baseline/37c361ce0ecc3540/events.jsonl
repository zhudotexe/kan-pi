It is the world's second-most-populous country, with a population exceeding 1.4 billion. China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land,[l] tied with Russia as having the most of any country in the world. With an area of nearly 9.6 million square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the world's third-largest country by total land area.[m] The country is divided into 22 provinces,[n] five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two semi-autonomous special administrative regions. The national capital is Beijing, and the most populous city and largest financial center is Shanghai.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Map showing the territorial claims of the PRC\nThe People's Republic of China is the second-largest country in the world by land area after Russia,[u] and the third or fourth largest country in the world by total area.[v] China's total area is generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000 km2 (3,700,000 sq mi).[197] Specific area figures range from 9,572,900 km2 (3,696,100 sq mi) according to the *Encyclopædia Britannica*,[198] to 9,596,961 km2 (3,705,407 sq mi) according to the *UN Demographic Yearbook*,[3] and *The World Factbook*.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn other words, *no* coastal or territorial water area was added to China's total area figure. The United States has a coastal water area of 109,362 km2 (42,225 sq mi), and a territorial water area of 195,213 km2 (75,372 sq mi), for a total of 304,575 km2 (117,597 sq mi) of additional water space. This is larger than entire countries like Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Adding this figure to the U.S. will boost it over China in ranking since China's coastal and territorial water figures are currently unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure.\n14. **^** The PRC claims the territories controlled by the ROC (Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu), which it does not control, as its disputed 23rd province, Taiwan Province.

These closely match the CIA *World Factbook* figures and similarly *include* coastal and territorial waters for the United States, but *exclude* coastal and territorial waters for China.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFurther explanation of disputed ranking: The dispute about which is the world's third-largest country arose from the inclusion of coastal and territorial waters for the United States. This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA *World Factbook* and its previous iterations against the information for United States in *Encyclopædia Britannica*, particularly its footnote section.[13] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA *World Factbook* (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610 km2 (3,618,780 sq mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517 km2 (3,796,742 sq mi)). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)China topographic map with East Asian countries\nChina's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south.

The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 km (9,000 mi) long and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas.

China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Administrative divisions of China, Districts of Hong Kong, and Municipalities and parishes of Macau\n\nThe PRC is constitutionally a unitary state officially divided into 23 provinces,[x] five autonomous regions (each with a designated minority group), and four directly administered municipalities—collectively referred to as \"mainland China\"—as well as the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau.[219] The PRC considers Taiwan to be its 23rd province,[220] although it is governed by the Republic of China (ROC), which claims to be the legitimate representative of China and its territory, though it has downplayed this claim since its democratization.[221] Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: North China, Northeast China, East China, South Central China, Southwest China, and Northwest China.[222]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Australia | * Christmas Island\n* Cocos (Keeling) Islands\n |\n| Greece | * Kastellorizo\n |\n| United Kingdom | * Akrotiri and Dhekelia2 (Sovereign Base Areas)\n* British Indian Ocean Territory (British Overseas Territory)\n |\n\n |\n| Special administrativeregions of China\n | * Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n| * 1 Spans the conventional boundary between Asia and another continent.\n* 2 Considered European for cultural, political and historical reasons but is geographically in West Asia.\n\n* ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Asia portal**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChina is also the world's leading investor in renewable energy and its commercialization, with $546 billion invested in 2022;[192] it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects.[193][192] In 2022, 61.2% of China's electricity came from coal (largest producer in the world), 14.9% from hydroelectric power (largest), 9.3% from wind (largest), 4.7% from solar energy (largest), 4.7% from nuclear energy (second-largest), 3.1% from natural gas (fifth-largest), and 1.9% from bioenergy (largest); in total, 30.8% of China's energy came from renewable energy sources.[194] Despite its emphasis on renewables, China remains deeply connected to global oil markets and next to India, has been the largest importer of Russian crude oil in 2022.[195][196]\n\n\n\n### Political geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Borders of China, Coastline of China, and Territorial changes of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n239. **^** \"Energy to dominate Russia President Putin's China visit\".

This is larger than entire countries like Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Adding this figure to the U.S. will boost it over China in ranking since China's coastal and territorial water figures are currently unknown (no official publication) and thus cannot be added into China's total area figure.\n14. **^** The PRC claims the territories controlled by the ROC (Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu), which it does not control, as its disputed 23rd province, Taiwan Province.

These closely match the CIA *World Factbook* figures and similarly *include* coastal and territorial waters for the United States, but *exclude* coastal and territorial waters for China.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFurther explanation of disputed ranking: The dispute about which is the world's third-largest country arose from the inclusion of coastal and territorial waters for the United States. This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA *World Factbook* and its previous iterations against the information for United States in *Encyclopædia Britannica*, particularly its footnote section.[13] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA *World Factbook* (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610 km2 (3,618,780 sq mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517 km2 (3,796,742 sq mi)). During this time, China's total area remained unchanged. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)China topographic map with East Asian countries\nChina's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south.

Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[263]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Regions**(west to east) | * Western Canada\n\t+ Pacific Northwest\n\t+ Great Plains\n\t\t- Canadian Prairies\n* Northern Canada\n* Canadian Shield\n* Central Canada\n\t+ Great Lakes\n* Eastern Canada\n\t+ Atlantic Canada\n\t\t- The Maritimes\n |\n| **Topics** | * Cities\n* Earthquakes\n* Islands\n* Mountains\n* National Parks\n* Great Lakes\n* Rivers\n* Wildlife\n* Volcanism\n |\n\n |\n| Government | * Law\n* Constitution\n* Monarch\n\t+ Governor General\n* Parliament (Senate\n* House of Commons)\n* Prime Minister\n\t+ list\n* Courts\n\t+ Supreme Court\n* Military\n* Local government\n* Foreign relations\n\t+ Peacekeeping\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Politics** | * Elections\n* Political parties\n* Human rights\n\t+ Intersex\n\t+ LGBT\n\t+ Transgender\n* Multiculturalism\n* Cannabis\n* Firearms regulation\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force.
