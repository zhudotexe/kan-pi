The most recent to join the list were Leicester City (2015–16 champions) and before that, Nottingham Forest (1977–78) and Derby County (1971–72).\n\n\nFive teams have won the league title three seasons in a row: Huddersfield Town (1924–1926), Arsenal (1933–1935), Liverpool (1982–1984), Manchester United twice (1999–2001 & 2007–2009) and Manchester City (2021–2023).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeven teams have at some point held first or joint first place in the number of titles won: Preston North End (1889–1895), Sunderland (1893–1899 and 1936–1953), Aston Villa (1897–1953), Arsenal (1948–1976), Liverpool (1966–1971 and 1973–2011), Manchester United (1967–1971 and 2009–) and Everton (1970–1971).\n\n\nEight teams have finished as runners up without ever finishing top: Bristol City (1906–07), Oldham Athletic (1914–15), Cardiff City (1923–24), Charlton Athletic (1936–37), Blackpool (1955–56), Queens Park Rangers (1975–76), Watford (1982–83) and Southampton (1983–84). Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference.\n\n\nTeams in **bold** compete in the Premier League as of the 2023–24 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nManchester United have won twenty titles,[11] the most of any club.[12] United's rivals Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Sir Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993\nand 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Everton and Manchester City are joint-fourth with nine titles, of which seven of City's have been won in the 2010s and 2020s. Aston Villa (seven) and Sunderland (six) secured the majority of their titles before the 1920s. Chelsea (six) won the majority of their titles in the 21st century (between 2005 and 2017).\n\n\nHuddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are the only sides to have won the league title in three consecutive seasons; no team has been crowned champion four seasons in a row.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about men's English football league champions.

Since the creation of the Premier League, the winners of The Football League were no longer English champions as the Premier League is a separate league.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRules stipulating a maximum wage for players were abolished in 1961. This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs.[7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England,[8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs.[9] The first five champions in the Premier League era – Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United – had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of

The most recent to join the list were Leicester City (2015–16 champions) and before that, Nottingham Forest (1977–78) and Derby County (1971–72).\n\n\nFive teams have won the league title three seasons in a row: Huddersfield Town (1924–1926), Arsenal (1933–1935), Liverpool (1982–1984), Manchester United twice (1999–2001 & 2007–2009) and Manchester City (2021–2023).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeven teams have at some point held first or joint first place in the number of titles won: Preston North End (1889–1895), Sunderland (1893–1899 and 1936–1953), Aston Villa (1897–1953), Arsenal (1948–1976), Liverpool (1966–1971 and 1973–2011), Manchester United (1967–1971 and 2009–) and Everton (1970–1971).\n\n\nEight teams have finished as runners up without ever finishing top: Bristol City (1906–07), Oldham Athletic (1914–15), Cardiff City (1923–24), Charlton Athletic (1936–37), Blackpool (1955–56), Queens Park Rangers (1975–76), Watford (1982–83) and Southampton (1983–84). Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference.\n\n\nTeams in **bold** compete in the Premier League as of the 2023–24 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nManchester United have won twenty titles,[11] the most of any club.[12] United's rivals Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Sir Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993\nand 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Everton and Manchester City are joint-fourth with nine titles, of which seven of City's have been won in the 2010s and 2020s. Aston Villa (seven) and Sunderland (six) secured the majority of their titles before the 1920s. Chelsea (six) won the majority of their titles in the 21st century (between 2005 and 2017).\n\n\nHuddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are the only sides to have won the league title in three consecutive seasons; no team has been crowned champion four seasons in a row.[13]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about men's English football league champions.

Since the creation of the Premier League, the winners of The Football League were no longer English champions as the Premier League is a separate league.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRules stipulating a maximum wage for players were abolished in 1961. This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs.[7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England,[8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs.[9] The first five champions in the Premier League era – Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United – had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of

Didier Drogba was the first African player to reach the hundred goal milestone on 10 March 2012 and Sergio Agüero was the first South American to reach a century of goals on 19 April 2016. On 8 April 2023, Son Heung-min became the most recent player to reach 100 goals, as well as the first Asian player.[8]\n\n\nSix of the 34 players accomplished the feat without scoring a penalty – Sadio Mané, Peter Crouch, Emile Heskey, Les Ferdinand, Andy Cole,[9] and Ryan Giggs.[10][11][a] Emmanuel Adebayor departed English football in 2016 with 97 goals, while on course to pass the milestone in the 12th quickest manner.[12]\n\n\nOf the still active players in the Premier League, Callum Wilson is closest to joining the *100 Club*; the Newcastle United striker has hit 86 goals so far, with 41 of them coming for Bournemouth.[13] Marcus Rashford is not far behind with 77 goals, all for Manchester United.[14]\n\n\n\n\n## Players\n\n[edit]\n\n**Key**\n\n\n\n* **Bold** shows players still

Didier Drogba was the first African player to reach the hundred goal milestone on 10 March 2012 and Sergio Agüero was the first South American to reach a century of goals on 19 April 2016. On 8 April 2023, Son Heung-min became the most recent player to reach 100 goals, as well as the first Asian player.[8]\n\n\nSix of the 34 players accomplished the feat without scoring a penalty – Sadio Mané, Peter Crouch, Emile Heskey, Les Ferdinand, Andy Cole,[9] and Ryan Giggs.[10][11][a] Emmanuel Adebayor departed English football in 2016 with 97 goals, while on course to pass the milestone in the 12th quickest manner.[12]\n\n\nOf the still active players in the Premier League, Callum Wilson is closest to joining the *100 Club*; the Newcastle United striker has hit 86 goals so far, with 41 of them coming for Bournemouth.[13] Marcus Rashford is not far behind with 77 goals, all for Manchester United.[14]\n\n\n\n\n## Players\n\n[edit]\n\n**Key**\n\n\n\n* **Bold** shows players still
