Only one NBA championship is awarded per season, and it happens at the end of the playoffs (typically in June).\n\nAdditionally, while I can try to search for information about NBA teams and their standings, the tools available to me (only Wikipedia search) are not ideal for getting real-time sports statistics and current season information. To get accurate, up-to-date information about the current NBA season standings, I would recommend:\n\n1. Visiting the official NBA website (nba.com)\n2. Checking sports news websites\n3. Using sports statistics websites\n\nWould you like to know about historical NBA championships for these teams instead? I could search for that information using Wikipedia.",
