He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era, as well as one of the most popular directors and producers in film history.[1] He is also one of the co-founders of Amblin Entertainment, DreamWorks Pictures, and DreamWorks Animation.\n\n\nIn a career spanning more than five decades, Spielberg's films have spanned many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking.[2] In later years, his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust, the transatlantic slave trade, civil rights, war, and terrorism.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Film\n | Director\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1978\n | *I Wanna Hold Your Hand* | Robert Zemeckis |  |  |\n| 1980\n | *Used Cars* |  |  |\n| 1981\n | *Continental Divide* | Michael Apted |  |  |\n| 1984\n | *Gremlins* | Joe Dante |  |  |\n| 1985\n | *Back to the Future* | Robert Zemeckis\n |  |  |\n| *Young Sherlock Holmes* | Barry Levinson |  |  |\n| 1986\n | *An American Tail* | Don Bluth |  |  |\n| *The Money Pit* | Richard Benjamin |  |  |\n| 1987\n | *Batteries Not Included* | Matthew Robbins |  |  |\n| *Innerspace* | Joe Dante\n |  |  |\n| 1988\n | *Who Framed Roger Rabbit* | Robert Zemeckis\n |  |  |\n| *The Land Before Time* | Don Bluth\n |  |  |\n| 1989\n | *Back to the Future Part II* | Robert Zemeckis\n |  |  |\n| *Tummy Trouble* | Rob MinkoffFrank Marshall | Short film\n |  |\n| *Dad* | Gary David Goldberg |  |  |\n| 1990\n | *Arachnophobia* | Frank Marshall\n | Also uncredited 2nd unit director\n |  |\n| *Dreams* | Akira Kurosawa |  |  |\n| *Back to the Future Part III* | Robert Zemeckis\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *Men in Black: International* | F.

He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era, as well as one of the most popular directors and producers in film history.[1] He is also one of the co-founders of Amblin Entertainment, DreamWorks Pictures, and DreamWorks Animation.\n\n\nIn a career spanning more than five decades, Spielberg's films have spanned many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking.[2] In later years, his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust, the transatlantic slave trade, civil rights, war, and terrorism.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Film\n | Director\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1978\n | *I Wanna Hold Your Hand* | Robert Zemeckis |  |  |\n| 1980\n | *Used Cars* |  |  |\n| 1981\n | *Continental Divide* | Michael Apted |  |  |\n| 1984\n | *Gremlins* | Joe Dante |  |  |\n| 1985\n | *Back to the Future* | Robert Zemeckis\n |  |  |\n| *Young Sherlock Holmes* | Barry Levinson |  |  |\n| 1986\n | *An American Tail* | Don Bluth |  |  |\n| *The Money Pit* | Richard Benjamin |  |  |\n| 1987\n | *Batteries Not Included* | Matthew Robbins |  |  |\n| *Innerspace* | Joe Dante\n |  |  |\n| 1988\n | *Who Framed Roger Rabbit* | Robert Zemeckis\n |  |  |\n| *The Land Before Time* | Don Bluth\n |  |  |\n| 1989\n | *Back to the Future Part II* | Robert Zemeckis\n |  |  |\n| *Tummy Trouble* | Rob MinkoffFrank Marshall | Short film\n |  |\n| *Dad* | Gary David Goldberg |  |  |\n| 1990\n | *Arachnophobia* | Frank Marshall\n | Also uncredited 2nd unit director\n |  |\n| *Dreams* | Akira Kurosawa |  |  |\n| *Back to the Future Part III* | Robert Zemeckis\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *Men in Black: International* | F.
