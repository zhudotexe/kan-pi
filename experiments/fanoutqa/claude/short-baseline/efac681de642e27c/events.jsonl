Cutler – a scholar of political science at Carleton University,[63] the terms South Asia, Southwest Asia, and Central Asia are distinct, but the confusion and disagreements have arisen due to the geopolitical movement to enlarge these regions into Greater South Asia, Greater Southwest Asia, and Greater Central Asia. The frontier of Greater South Asia, states Cutler, between 2001 and 2006 has been geopolitically extended to eastern Iran and western Afghanistan in the west, and in the north to northeastern Iran, northern Afghanistan, and southern Uzbekistan.[63]\n\n\nIdentification with a South Asian identity was found to be significantly low among respondents in an older two-year survey across Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[64]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of South Asian history.

By various definitions based on substantially different reasons, the British Indian Ocean Territory and the Tibet Autonomous Region may be included as well.[28][29][30][31][32][33][34] Myanmar (Burma), a former British colony and now largely considered a part of Southeast Asia, is also sometimes included.[18][20][35] Afghanistan is also included by some sources.[18][20][36][37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use\".

The spoken languages of the region are largely based on geography and shared across religious boundaries, but the written script is sharply divided by religious boundaries. In particular, Muslims of South Asia such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan use the Arabic alphabet and Persian Nastaliq. Till 1952, Muslim-majority Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) also mandated only the Nastaliq script, but after that adopted regional scripts and particularly Bengali, after the Language Movement for the adoption of Bengali as the official language of the then East Pakistan. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Places adjacent to South Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Central AsiaWest Asia | Central Asia, East Asia | East Asia |\n|  | ![](image) |  |\n| West Asia | ![](image)**South Asia**![](image)\n | Southeast Asia |\n|  | ![](image) |  |\n| Arabian Sea | Indian Ocean | Bay of BengalIndian Ocean |\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSouth Asian topics\n |\n| --- |\n| Countries and regions | * Afghanistan\n* Bangladesh\n* Bhutan\n* India\n\t+ North\n\t\t- Northwest\n\t+ South\n\t+ Northeast\n\t+ Islands\n* Maldives\n* Nepal\n* Pakistan\n\t+ Punjab\n* Sri Lanka\n* South Asian regions\n\t+ Northwestern\n\t+ Northern\n\t+ Eastern\n\t+ Southern\n* General geography\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Ethnic groups | * Andamanese\n* Austroasiatic\n* Austronesian\n* Dravidian\n* Indo-Aryan\n* Iranic\n* Nuristani\n* Tibeto-Burman\n* Turkic\n* Other groups\n\t+ Afro-Asians\n\t+ Chinese\n\t+ European and Eurasian\n\t+ Semitic\n* Diaspora\n |\n| Culture | * Architecture‎\n* Art\n* Cinema\n* Cuisine\n* Cultural sphere\n* Fashion\n* Languages\n* Literature\n* Music\n* Mythology\n* Philosophy\n* Scripts\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country\n | Capital\n | Form of government\n | Head of state\n | Head of government\n | Legislature\n | Official language\n | Currency\n | Coat of arms / National Emblems\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | Kabul | Unitary totalitarian provisional theocratic Islamic emirate | Supreme Leader | Prime Minister | Leadership Council[277] | PashtoDari | **؋** Afghani | ![](image) |\n| ![](image) Bangladesh | Dhaka | Unitary parliamentary constitutional republic | President | Prime Minister | Jatiya Sangsad | BengaliEnglish | **৳** Taka | ![](image) |\n| ![](image) Bhutan | Thimphu | Unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy | King | Prime Minister | National CouncilNational Assembly | Dzongkha | **Nu.** Ngultrum | ![](image) |\n| ![](image) India | New Delhi | Federal parliamentary constitutional republic\n | President | Prime Minister | Rajya SabhaLok Sabha | HindiEnglish | **₹** Indian rupee | ![](image) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Robert M. Cutler – a scholar of political science at Carleton University,[63] the terms South Asia, Southwest Asia, and Central Asia are distinct, but the confusion and disagreements have arisen due to the geopolitical movement to enlarge these regions into Greater South Asia, Greater Southwest Asia, and Greater Central Asia. The frontier of Greater South Asia, states Cutler, between 2001 and 2006 has been geopolitically extended to eastern Iran and western Afghanistan in the west, and in the north to northeastern Iran, northern Afghanistan, and southern Uzbekistan.[63]\n\n\nIdentification with a South Asian identity was found to be significantly low among respondents in an older two-year survey across Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[64]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of South Asian history.

The current territories of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan which were the core territories of the British Empire from 1857 to 1947 also form the core territories of South Asia.[25][26] The mountain countries of Nepal and Bhutan, two independent countries that were not under the British Raj but were protectorates of the Empire,[27] and the island countries of Sri Lanka and Maldives are generally included. By various definitions based on substantially different reasons, the British Indian Ocean Territory and the Tibet Autonomous Region may be included as well.[28][29][30][31][32][33][34] Myanmar (Burma), a former British colony and now largely considered a part of Southeast Asia, is also sometimes included.[18][20][35] Afghanistan is also included by some sources.[18][20][36][37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use\".
