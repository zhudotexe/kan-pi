Cast members are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer, with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years.[82] The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years; six on *SNL* and then six on a sitcom. The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films, a company owned by NBC, Paramount Pictures, and Michaels. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *Saturday Night Live* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Logo used since October 1, 2022\n |\n| Also known as | *NBC's Saturday Night*(1975–1977)*Saturday Night Live '80*(1980) |\n| Genre | * Stand-up comedy\n* Satire\n* Political satire\n* Variety show\n* Sketch comedy\n |\n| Created by | Lorne Michaels |\n| Written by | List of *Saturday Night Live* writers |\n| Directed by | * Dave Wilson(1975–1986; 1989–1995)[1]\n* Paul Miller(1986–1989)[1]\n* Beth McCarthy-Miller(1995–2006)[1]\n* Don Roy King(2006–2021)[1]\n* Liz Patrick(2021–present)[1]\n |\n| Starring | List of *Saturday Night Live* cast members |\n| Narrated by | Don PardoMel BrandtBill HanrahanDarrell Hammond |\n| Country of origin | United States |\n| Original language | English |\n| No. of seasons | 49 |\n| No. of episodes | 953 (list of episodes) |\n| Production |\n| Executive producers | Lorne Michaels(1975–1980; 1985–present)Jean Doumanian (1980–1981)Dick Ebersol (1981–1985) |\n| Production locations | Studio 8H, NBC Studios, New York City |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** Meaney, Jake (October 14, 2010). \"'Saturday Night Live: The Best of Eddie Murphy' Brings on Bursts of Genius\". *PopMatters*.

Michaels currently serves as the program's showrunner. The show's premiere was hosted by George Carlin on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title ***NBC's Saturday Night***. The show's comedy sketches, which often parody contemporary American culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest, who usually delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast, with featured performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\", properly beginning the show.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Saturday Night Live*\n |\n| --- |\n| Seasons | * 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n* 10\n* 11\n* 12\n* 13\n* 14\n* 15\n* 16\n* 17\n* 18\n* 19\n* 20\n* 21\n* 22\n* 23\n* 24\n* 25\n* 26\n* 27\n* 28\n* 29\n* 30\n* 31\n* 32\n* 33\n* 34\n* 35\n* 36\n* 37\n* 38\n* 39\n* 40\n* 41\n* 42\n* 43\n* 44\n* 45\n\t+ *At Home*\n* 46\n* 47\n* 48\n* 49\n* 50\n |\n| Episodes | * Seasons 1−30\n* Season 31−present\n |\n| History | * History\n |\n| Lists | * Commercials\n* Cast members\n* Writers\n* Guests\n\t+ A–D\n\t+ E–H\n\t+ I–L\n\t+ M–P\n\t+ Q–T\n\t+ U–Z\n* Awards\n* DVD releases\n* Incidents\n* Unsuccessful auditions\n |\n| Charactersand sketches | * Chronological\n* Alphabetical\n* By cast member\n* Musical sketches\n* TV show sketches\n* *Weekend Update* characters\n* *TV Funhouse* segments\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Introducedin season | * 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n* 10\n* 11\n* 12\n* 13\n* 14\n* 15\n* 16\n* 17\n* 18\n* 19\n* 20\n* 21\n* 22\n* 23\n* 24\n* 25\n* 26\n* 27\n* 28\n* 29\n* 30\n* 31\n* 32\n* 33\n* 34\n* 35\n* 36\n* 37\n* 38\n* 39\n* 40\n* 41\n* 42\n* 43\n* 44\n* 45\n* 46\n* 47\n* 48\n* 49\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Porter, Rick (September 28, 2021). \"'Saturday Night Live' Director Don Roy King Retiring\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries, meeting with different levels of success. Successful sketches have seen life outside the show as feature films, including *The Blues Brothers* (1980) and *Wayne's World* (1992).

Thompson first joined the series in 2003 and has been on the show for twenty years.[69] Those selected to join the cast of *SNL* are normally already accomplished performers, recruited from improvisational comedy groups such as The Groundlings (Newman, Ferrell, Hartman,[70] Lovitz, Wiig[71]) and The Second City (Aykroyd, Farley, Fey,[72] Tim Meadows), or established stand-up comedians (Carvey, Sandler, Rock, Norm Macdonald), who already possess the training or experience necessary for *SNL*.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSo stick around, we'll be right back.\" Comedian George Carlin was the first to host *SNL* in the debut October 1975 episode;[114] three episodes later, Candice Bergen became the first woman to host[115] and subsequently the first host to return.[116] Guests who have hosted five or more times are sometimes referred to as belonging to the Five-Timers Club, a term that originated on a sketch performed on Tom Hanks's fifth episode.[117] As of February 11, 2017, actor Alec Baldwin holds the record for most times hosting, having performed the duty on seventeen different occasions since 1990; Baldwin took the record from actor Steve Martin who has hosted fifteen times since 1976.[118] Occasionally, former SNL cast members also host.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n87. **^** Grow, Kory (January 6, 2014). \"Meet the New 'SNL' Cast Member\". *Rolling Stone*.\n88. **^** Goldberg, Lesley (January 6, 2014). \"Upright Citizens Brigade alum Sasheer Zamata will join the late-night sketch series Jan. 18\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

Cast members are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer, with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years.[82] The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years; six on *SNL* and then six on a sitcom. The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films, a company owned by NBC, Paramount Pictures, and Michaels. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *Saturday Night Live* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Logo used since October 1, 2022\n |\n| Also known as | *NBC's Saturday Night*(1975–1977)*Saturday Night Live '80*(1980) |\n| Genre | * Stand-up comedy\n* Satire\n* Political satire\n* Variety show\n* Sketch comedy\n |\n| Created by | Lorne Michaels |\n| Written by | List of *Saturday Night Live* writers |\n| Directed by | * Dave Wilson(1975–1986; 1989–1995)[1]\n* Paul Miller(1986–1989)[1]\n* Beth McCarthy-Miller(1995–2006)[1]\n* Don Roy King(2006–2021)[1]\n* Liz Patrick(2021–present)[1]\n |\n| Starring | List of *Saturday Night Live* cast members |\n| Narrated by | Don PardoMel BrandtBill HanrahanDarrell Hammond |\n| Country of origin | United States |\n| Original language | English |\n| No. of seasons | 49 |\n| No. of episodes | 953 (list of episodes) |\n| Production |\n| Executive producers | Lorne Michaels(1975–1980; 1985–present)Jean Doumanian (1980–1981)Dick Ebersol (1981–1985) |\n| Production locations | Studio 8H, NBC Studios, New York City |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** Meaney, Jake (October 14, 2010). \"'Saturday Night Live: The Best of Eddie Murphy' Brings on Bursts of Genius\". *PopMatters*.

Michaels currently serves as the program's showrunner. The show's premiere was hosted by George Carlin on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title ***NBC's Saturday Night***. The show's comedy sketches, which often parody contemporary American culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest, who usually delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast, with featured performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\", properly beginning the show.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Saturday Night Live*\n |\n| --- |\n| Seasons | * 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n* 10\n* 11\n* 12\n* 13\n* 14\n* 15\n* 16\n* 17\n* 18\n* 19\n* 20\n* 21\n* 22\n* 23\n* 24\n* 25\n* 26\n* 27\n* 28\n* 29\n* 30\n* 31\n* 32\n* 33\n* 34\n* 35\n* 36\n* 37\n* 38\n* 39\n* 40\n* 41\n* 42\n* 43\n* 44\n* 45\n\t+ *At Home*\n* 46\n* 47\n* 48\n* 49\n* 50\n |\n| Episodes | * Seasons 1−30\n* Season 31−present\n |\n| History | * History\n |\n| Lists | * Commercials\n* Cast members\n* Writers\n* Guests\n\t+ A–D\n\t+ E–H\n\t+ I–L\n\t+ M–P\n\t+ Q–T\n\t+ U–Z\n* Awards\n* DVD releases\n* Incidents\n* Unsuccessful auditions\n |\n| Charactersand sketches | * Chronological\n* Alphabetical\n* By cast member\n* Musical sketches\n* TV show sketches\n* *Weekend Update* characters\n* *TV Funhouse* segments\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Introducedin season | * 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n* 10\n* 11\n* 12\n* 13\n* 14\n* 15\n* 16\n* 17\n* 18\n* 19\n* 20\n* 21\n* 22\n* 23\n* 24\n* 25\n* 26\n* 27\n* 28\n* 29\n* 30\n* 31\n* 32\n* 33\n* 34\n* 35\n* 36\n* 37\n* 38\n* 39\n* 40\n* 41\n* 42\n* 43\n* 44\n* 45\n* 46\n* 47\n* 48\n* 49\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Porter, Rick (September 28, 2021). \"'Saturday Night Live' Director Don Roy King Retiring\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries, meeting with different levels of success. Successful sketches have seen life outside the show as feature films, including *The Blues Brothers* (1980) and *Wayne's World* (1992). The show has been marketed in other ways, including home media releases of \"best of\" and whole seasons, and books and documentaries about behind-the-scenes activities of running and developing the show.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWithin a few years Jimmy Fallon and Tina Fey also joined the cast.[66] While cast members would leave over the following two decades, the show saw its next biggest transition in 2013, with the addition of six cast members to compensate for the departure of several longtime cast members like Bill Hader, Jason Sudeikis, and Fred Armisen.[67] Its next biggest transition happened nearly a decade later in 2022, when the show hired four new cast members, in the wake of the departures of 8 cast members, including Kate McKinnon, Pete Davidson, and Aidy Bryant.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01SYesfuYaGbAR9ukTka3rm5","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He returned as a guest to perform stand-up comedy on season 11's last episode and hosted *SNL* in 1995.\n |\n| Beth Cahill | 13 | She joined the show during season 17 as an off-and-on featured player.

The dates given are those of the years they were part of the cast. The chart also shows whether the cast member has served as a guest host, appeared as the anchorperson of the \"Weekend Update\" segment (by any of its titles), or has been the subject of their own \"Best of\" home video collection. Many of the cast members were writers as well. \"Middle group\" performers are introduced after the main cast by the announcer saying \"...with\" and reading off these performers before ending with featured players.\n\n\nSid Caesar has the distinction of being the only person who has been named an honorary cast member. Caesar was presented with a plaque during the goodnights of his hosting stint in 1983. \n\n\n\n### Table[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAllegedly \"cursed\" *Saturday Night Live* cast members\n| Cast member\n | Age\n | Date of death\n | Cause of death\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| John Belushi | 33 | March 5, 1982 | Belushi died of a drug overdose from a speedball injection (cocaine and heroin). His death led to the conviction of Cathy Smith for administering the fatal injection.\n |\n| Gilda Radner | 42 | May 20, 1989 | Radner died from ovarian cancer. She was originally scheduled to host the season 13 finale, a first for a former female cast member. However, *SNL* was canceled due to a 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. Radner's health worsened the following year. Moments before the season 14 finale, news broke of Radner's death. In lieu of the opening monologue Steve Martin, visibly shaken, introduced a replay of the \"Dancing in the Dark\" sketch he and Radner had performed in a 1978 episode;[26] her ex-husband G. E. Smith performed a musical tribute to Radner with the SNL Band.\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01Hv1Cs5tChUQW6Hauvp6tpd","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
