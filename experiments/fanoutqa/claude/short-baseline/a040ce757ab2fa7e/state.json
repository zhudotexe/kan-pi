They'll be a favorite next year.\"[72] However, Hayward chose to leave early for the NBA draft and Butler went through a rough patch early in the season, at one point losing three straight games and having a 6\u20135 conference record. Bolstered by the emergence of Andrew Smith at center and Matt Howard's success as a perimeter forward, Butler ended up winning a share of the conference title at 13\u20135. The Bulldogs then won the Horizon League tournament to secure an automatic NCAA tournament bid, and received the No. 8 seed.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBoston Celtics head coaches\n |\n| --- |\n| * Honey Russell (1946\u20131948)\n* Doggie Julian (1948\u20131950)\n* Red Auerbach (1950\u20131966)\n* Bill Russell (1966\u20131969)\n* Tom Heinsohn (1969\u20131978)\n* Satch Sanders (1978)\n* Dave Cowens (1978\u20131979)\n* Bill Fitch (1979\u20131983)\n* K.
