Sebastian Vettel has the most wins on the track, with five Singapore Grand Prix victories. In 2022, a contract extension was announced which will put the race on the Formula One calendar until at least 2028.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Formula Libre[edit]\n\n\nFirst organised in 1961, the race was initially known as the *Orient Year Grand Prix*, located at the Thomson Road Grand Prix circuit.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Singapore Grand Prix**[a] is a motor racing event which forms part of the Formula One World Championship. The event takes place on the Marina Bay Street Circuit and was the inaugural night race and first street circuit in Asia designed for Formula One races.[1][2][3]\n\n\nThe original Singapore Grand Prix was held at Thomson Road from 1966 to 1973, before returning to the calendar in 2008 at Marina Bay. Fernando Alonso won the inaugural Formula One edition of the renewed Grand Prix, driving for the Renault team amid controversial circumstances, when it emerged a year later that his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. had been ordered to crash on purpose by senior team management to bring out the safety car at a time chosen to benefit Alonso. The race itself was also notable for being the 800th Formula One World Championship race since its inception in 1950, and the first ever Formula One race held at night.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2023 | ![Spain](image) Carlos Sainz Jr. | Ferrari | Formula One | Report |\n| Sources:[50][51][52] |\n\n\n## Track layouts[edit]\n\n\n* ![Original circuit (2008–2012)](image)\n\nOriginal circuit (2008–2012)\n* ![Revised circuit with the Singapore Sling chicane at turn 10 removed (2013–2014)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with the Singapore Sling chicane at turn 10 removed (2013–2014)\n* ![Revised circuit with re-profiled turns 11–13 (2015–2017)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with re-profiled turns 11–13 (2015–2017)\n* ![Revised circuit with re-profiled turns 16–17 (2018–2019, 2022)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with re-profiled turns 16–17 (2018–2019, 2022)\n* ![Revised circuit with new straight between turns 15–16 (2023)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with new straight between turns 15–16 (2023)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Formula One Grands Prix\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Chinese: 新加坡大奖赛;  \nMalay: *Grand Prix Singapura*;  \nTamil: சிங்கப்பூர் கிராண்ட் பிரிக்ஸ்\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFormula 1 Grand Prix in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image) Singapore Grand Prix| Marina Bay Street Circuit(2023) |\n| ![](image) |\n| Race information |\n| Number of times held | 22 |\n| First held | 1966 |\n| Most wins (drivers) | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel (5) |\n| Most wins (constructors) | ![Italy](image) Ferrari (5) |\n| Circuit length | 4.940 km (3.070 miles) |\n| Race length | 306.143 km (190.228 miles) |\n| Laps | 62 |\n| Last race (2023) |\n| Pole position |\n| * ![Spain](image) Carlos Sainz Jr.\n* Ferrari\n* 1:30.984\n |\n| Podium |\n| * + **1.** ![Spain](image) C.

Michael Schumacher again struggled as he slammed into the Sauber of Sergio Pérez.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Singapore Grand Prix has been frequently described by drivers as being the “toughest race of the Formula 1 calendar”; the endurance of drivers is heavily strained due to various factors such as high heat, high humidity, high amount of sweat and bodily fluid loss, high number of corners (19 in total), little margin for error (due to the lack of run-off area within a street circuit) and race finishes always completing near to the 2-hour allocated time limit (with 4 races being time-limited, instead of completing the allotted laps).[35][36]\n\n\n\n## Attendance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Class\n | Location\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1966\n | ![Singapore](image) Lee Han Seng | Lotus-Ford | Formula Libre | Thomson Road | Report |\n| 1967\n | ![Singapore](image) Rodney Seow | Merlyn–Ford | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1968\n | ![Australia](image) Garrie Cooper | Elfin–Ford | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1969\n | ![New Zealand](image) Graeme Lawrence | McLaren-Ford | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1970\n | ![New Zealand](image) Graeme Lawrence | Ferrari | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1971\n | ![New Zealand](image) Graeme Lawrence | Brabham-Ford | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1972\n | ![Australia](image) Max Stewart | Mildren-Ford[53] | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1973\n | ![Australia](image) Vern Schuppan | March-Hart | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1974–2007\n | *Not held* |\n| 2008 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Formula One | Marina Bay | Report |\n| 2009 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | McLaren-Mercedes | Formula One | Report |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"SingTel to sponsor first Singapore Grand Prix\".

Sebastian Vettel has the most wins on the track, with five Singapore Grand Prix victories. In 2022, a contract extension was announced which will put the race on the Formula One calendar until at least 2028.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Formula Libre[edit]\n\n\nFirst organised in 1961, the race was initially known as the *Orient Year Grand Prix*, located at the Thomson Road Grand Prix circuit.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Singapore Grand Prix**[a] is a motor racing event which forms part of the Formula One World Championship. The event takes place on the Marina Bay Street Circuit and was the inaugural night race and first street circuit in Asia designed for Formula One races.[1][2][3]\n\n\nThe original Singapore Grand Prix was held at Thomson Road from 1966 to 1973, before returning to the calendar in 2008 at Marina Bay. Fernando Alonso won the inaugural Formula One edition of the renewed Grand Prix, driving for the Renault team amid controversial circumstances, when it emerged a year later that his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. had been ordered to crash on purpose by senior team management to bring out the safety car at a time chosen to benefit Alonso. The race itself was also notable for being the 800th Formula One World Championship race since its inception in 1950, and the first ever Formula One race held at night.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2023 | ![Spain](image) Carlos Sainz Jr. | Ferrari | Formula One | Report |\n| Sources:[50][51][52] |\n\n\n## Track layouts[edit]\n\n\n* ![Original circuit (2008–2012)](image)\n\nOriginal circuit (2008–2012)\n* ![Revised circuit with the Singapore Sling chicane at turn 10 removed (2013–2014)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with the Singapore Sling chicane at turn 10 removed (2013–2014)\n* ![Revised circuit with re-profiled turns 11–13 (2015–2017)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with re-profiled turns 11–13 (2015–2017)\n* ![Revised circuit with re-profiled turns 16–17 (2018–2019, 2022)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with re-profiled turns 16–17 (2018–2019, 2022)\n* ![Revised circuit with new straight between turns 15–16 (2023)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with new straight between turns 15–16 (2023)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Formula One Grands Prix\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Chinese: 新加坡大奖赛;  \nMalay: *Grand Prix Singapura*;  \nTamil: சிங்கப்பூர் கிராண்ட் பிரிக்ஸ்\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFormula 1 Grand Prix in Singapore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image) Singapore Grand Prix| Marina Bay Street Circuit(2023) |\n| ![](image) |\n| Race information |\n| Number of times held | 22 |\n| First held | 1966 |\n| Most wins (drivers) | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel (5) |\n| Most wins (constructors) | ![Italy](image) Ferrari (5) |\n| Circuit length | 4.940 km (3.070 miles) |\n| Race length | 306.143 km (190.228 miles) |\n| Laps | 62 |\n| Last race (2023) |\n| Pole position |\n| * ![Spain](image) Carlos Sainz Jr.\n* Ferrari\n* 1:30.984\n |\n| Podium |\n| * + **1.** ![Spain](image) C.

Now at Ferrari, he took pole and resisted Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel on his way to the 25th victory of his F1 career. Michael Schumacher, making his F1\ncomeback in 2010, struggled in his Mercedes and was 13th, while Heikki Kovalainen leapt from his burning Lotus T127, borrowed a fire extinguisher and put the fire out himself.\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) – 1:45.390 (173.287 km/h)\n* Race winner: Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) – 1:57:53.579 (61 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) – 1:47.976 (169.137 km/h)\n\n\n### 2011[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nSebastian Vettel, an eight-time winner in 2011 before Marina Bay, led the drivers' championship by over 100 points. He won the race from his 11th pole of the season. Vettel, Button, Webber, Alonso and Hamilton filled the top five places. Michael Schumacher again struggled as he slammed into the Sauber of Sergio Pérez.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Singapore Grand Prix has been frequently described by drivers as being the “toughest race of the Formula 1 calendar”; the endurance of drivers is heavily strained due to various factors such as high heat, high humidity, high amount of sweat and bodily fluid loss, high number of corners (19 in total), little margin for error (due to the lack of run-off area within a street circuit) and race finishes always completing near to the 2-hour allocated time limit (with 4 races being time-limited, instead of completing the allotted laps).[35][36]\n\n\n\n## Attendance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Class\n | Location\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1966\n | ![Singapore](image) Lee Han Seng | Lotus-Ford | Formula Libre | Thomson Road | Report |\n| 1967\n | ![Singapore](image) Rodney Seow | Merlyn–Ford | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1968\n | ![Australia](image) Garrie Cooper | Elfin–Ford | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1969\n | ![New Zealand](image) Graeme Lawrence | McLaren-Ford | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1970\n | ![New Zealand](image) Graeme Lawrence | Ferrari | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1971\n | ![New Zealand](image) Graeme Lawrence | Brabham-Ford | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1972\n | ![Australia](image) Max Stewart | Mildren-Ford[53] | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1973\n | ![Australia](image) Vern Schuppan | March-Hart | Formula Libre | Report |\n| 1974–2007\n | *Not held* |\n| 2008 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Formula One | Marina Bay | Report |\n| 2009 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | McLaren-Mercedes | Formula One | Report |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"SingTel to sponsor first Singapore Grand Prix\".
