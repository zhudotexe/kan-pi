Lynch serves on the board of directors of AHIP, CVS Health, and U.S. Bancorp. In 2015, she became the first female president of Aetna. She has held executive positions at Magellan Health Services and Cigna. In 2021, she became the highest-ranking female chief executive on the Fortune 500 list.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nLynch was born on December 30, 1963, in Ware, Massachusetts.[2] She attended Ware Junior/Senior High School and graduated in 1980.[3] Lynch attended Carroll School of Management at Boston College, where she received a bachelor’s degree in Accounting and has a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) certification.[4] Upon graduating, she started her financial career in the Boston office of Ernst & Young, where she specialized in insurance.[5][4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nLynch credits her chosen career path in health care to her family life experiences.[5] She spent nearly a decade in insurance before returning to graduate school to pursue her MBA, saying, \"I wanted to broaden my financial background to have more exposure to the business aspects of running a company\".[4] In 2004, Lynch was appointed president of Cigna Dental.[6] The following year, she was named to a newly-created position that combines leadership of Cigna Group Insurance and Cigna Dental.[7] She left Cigna in 2009 to become president of Magellan Health Services.[8][9]\n\n\nLynch stayed with Magellan until 2012, when she joined Aetna as executive vice president and head of Specialty Products.[10] Three months after joining Aetna, Lynch led the integration of Coventry Health Care, which was the largest health care acquisition at the time.[11] In 2015, Lynch became Aetna's first female president, a role she retained through the $70 billion acquisition of Aetna by CVS Health in 2018.[12][13]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Lynch took the helm as president and chief executive officer of CVS Health on February 1, 2021, following the retirement of Larry Merlo. The appointment made her the highest-ranking female CEO on the Fortune 500 list and the 40th female chief executive on the Fortune 500 list.[14][15] Under Lynch's leadership, CVS Health administered the COVID-19 vaccine in more than 40,000 long-term care facilities and in CVS Pharmacy locations in 50 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.[16]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nLynch was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50, a list of female entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists, and creators who are over the age of 50.[15] She was awarded the 2021 Committee for Economic Development Distinguished Leadership Award, which recognizes business leaders for their contributions.[17][18] She was also ranked number one on Fortune’s Most Powerful Women in Business list.[1] Additionally, Lynch is a board member of U.S. Bancorp,[19] AHIP,[20] The Business Council,[21] Boston College Women’s Council,[8] The Business Roundtable,[22] and is an advisory board member of IBM Watson Health.[8] Lynch is also a trustee of the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts.[19]\n\n\nLynch was awarded an honorary Doctor of Commercial Science from the University of Hartford in 2022 and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Becker College in 2015.[23]\n\n\nShe served as honorary co-chair of the Komen Connecticut Race for the Cure benefiting breast cancer research.[24][11] In 2022, she was listed on the Fortune's “50 Most Powerful Women in Business.[25] Lynch was later named to Time's Time 100 annual list of the hundred most influential people in the world in 2023.[26]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLynch was raised by a single mother. Her mother died by suicide when Lynch was 12 years old.[5] Following her mother’s death, Lynch and her three siblings were raised by their aunt, who was a single mother with a son of her own.[27][28] In Lynch’s early 20s, she lost her aunt to breast cancer, lung cancer, and emphysema.[8]\n\n\nLynch is married to Kevin M. Lynch, the founder, president and CEO of the Quell Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to remove the stigma around mental health, reduce the number of suicides, overdoses, and the incarceration of those with mental illness.[8][29]\n\n\nIn an interview given by Lynch in 2020 she said “Outside of work, I make time for physical fitness, and running is one of my favorite past times. Running helps me to unwind and clear my mind—many times my greatest ideas come from an exhilarating run.”[30]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"CVS Health CEO Karen Lynch is the most powerful woman in American business\". *Fortune*.

They lived in Mountain Iron, Minnesota and had three children, including a son named Reino,[8] called Ray. Barra's father, Ray, married a second-generation Finnish American named Eva Pyykkönen, and Mary was born in 1961.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn February 2008, she became vice president of Global Manufacturing Engineering. In July 2009, she advanced to the position of vice president of Global Human Resources, which she held until February 2011 when she was named executive vice president of Global Product Development.[12][15] The latter position included responsibilities for design; she worked to reduce the number of automobile platforms in GM.[3] In August 2013, her vice president responsibility was extended to include Global Purchasing and Supply Chain.[16]\n\n\nWhen Barra took over as chief executive of General Motors in January 2014, she became the first female head of an automobile manufacturer.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring her first year as CEO, General Motors issued 84 safety recalls involving over 30 million cars.[18] Barra was called before the Senate to testify about the recalls and deaths attributed to the faulty ignition switch.[19] Barra and General Motors also came under suspicion of paying for awards to burnish the CEO and corporation's image during that time.[20] The recalls led to the creation of new policies encouraging workers to report problems they encounter in an attempt to change company culture.[21]\n\n\nAs CEO, Barra directed GM's move into driverless and electric-powered cars through acquisitions including Strobe, a startup in driverless technology.[22]\n\n\nIn 2017, Barra was the highest paid Detroit Three executive, with a total remuneration of $21.96 million.[23] In November 2018, Barra announced the closure of five North American plants and 14,000 worker layoffs.[24] Her decision was criticized by President Donald Trump, who threatened to remove the company's government subsidies in response.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Ignition switch recalls\n\t+ Motors Liquidation Company\n\t+ Motorama\n\t+ Reorganization\n\t+ Streetcar conspiracy\n\t+ 1945–46 strike\n\t+ 2007 strike\n\t+ 2019 strike\n* Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle\n* *Concept of the Corporation*\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nThe Walt Disney Company\n |\n| --- |\n| * Timeline\n* Assets\n* Acquisitions\n* Criticism\n* Logo\n* Headquarters\n |\n| Companyofficials | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Key | * Founders\n\t+ Walt Disney\n\t+ Roy O.

They lived in Mountain Iron, Minnesota and had three children, including a son named Reino,[8] called Ray. Barra's father, Ray, married a second-generation Finnish American named Eva Pyykkönen, and Mary was born in 1961.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn February 2008, she became vice president of Global Manufacturing Engineering. In July 2009, she advanced to the position of vice president of Global Human Resources, which she held until February 2011 when she was named executive vice president of Global Product Development.[12][15] The latter position included responsibilities for design; she worked to reduce the number of automobile platforms in GM.[3] In August 2013, her vice president responsibility was extended to include Global Purchasing and Supply Chain.[16]\n\n\nWhen Barra took over as chief executive of General Motors in January 2014, she became the first female head of an automobile manufacturer.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring her first year as CEO, General Motors issued 84 safety recalls involving over 30 million cars.[18] Barra was called before the Senate to testify about the recalls and deaths attributed to the faulty ignition switch.[19] Barra and General Motors also came under suspicion of paying for awards to burnish the CEO and corporation's image during that time.[20] The recalls led to the creation of new policies encouraging workers to report problems they encounter in an attempt to change company culture.[21]\n\n\nAs CEO, Barra directed GM's move into driverless and electric-powered cars through acquisitions including Strobe, a startup in driverless technology.[22]\n\n\nIn 2017, Barra was the highest paid Detroit Three executive, with a total remuneration of $21.96 million.[23] In November 2018, Barra announced the closure of five North American plants and 14,000 worker layoffs.[24] Her decision was criticized by President Donald Trump, who threatened to remove the company's government subsidies in response.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ Ignition switch recalls\n\t+ Motors Liquidation Company\n\t+ Motorama\n\t+ Reorganization\n\t+ Streetcar conspiracy\n\t+ 1945–46 strike\n\t+ 2007 strike\n\t+ 2019 strike\n* Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle\n* *Concept of the Corporation*\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nThe Walt Disney Company\n |\n| --- |\n| * Timeline\n* Assets\n* Acquisitions\n* Criticism\n* Logo\n* Headquarters\n |\n| Companyofficials | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Key | * Founders\n\t+ Walt Disney\n\t+ Roy O.

Lynch** (née Rohan, born December 30, 1963) is an American businesswoman and the president and chief executive officer of CVS Health. Lynch serves on the board of directors of AHIP, CVS Health, and U.S. Bancorp. In 2015, she became the first female president of Aetna. She has held executive positions at Magellan Health Services and Cigna. In 2021, she became the highest-ranking female chief executive on the Fortune 500 list.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nLynch was born on December 30, 1963, in Ware, Massachusetts.[2] She attended Ware Junior/Senior High School and graduated in 1980.[3] Lynch attended Carroll School of Management at Boston College, where she received a bachelor’s degree in Accounting and has a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) certification.[4] Upon graduating, she started her financial career in the Boston office of Ernst & Young, where she specialized in insurance.[5][4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nLynch credits her chosen career path in health care to her family life experiences.[5] She spent nearly a decade in insurance before returning to graduate school to pursue her MBA, saying, \"I wanted to broaden my financial background to have more exposure to the business aspects of running a company\".[4] In 2004, Lynch was appointed president of Cigna Dental.[6] The following year, she was named to a newly-created position that combines leadership of Cigna Group Insurance and Cigna Dental.[7] She left Cigna in 2009 to become president of Magellan Health Services.[8][9]\n\n\nLynch stayed with Magellan until 2012, when she joined Aetna as executive vice president and head of Specialty Products.[10] Three months after joining Aetna, Lynch led the integration of Coventry Health Care, which was the largest health care acquisition at the time.[11] In 2015, Lynch became Aetna's first female president, a role she retained through the $70 billion acquisition of Aetna by CVS Health in 2018.[12][13]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Lynch took the helm as president and chief executive officer of CVS Health on February 1, 2021, following the retirement of Larry Merlo. The appointment made her the highest-ranking female CEO on the Fortune 500 list and the 40th female chief executive on the Fortune 500 list.[14][15] Under Lynch's leadership, CVS Health administered the COVID-19 vaccine in more than 40,000 long-term care facilities and in CVS Pharmacy locations in 50 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.[16]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nLynch was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50, a list of female entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists, and creators who are over the age of 50.[15] She was awarded the 2021 Committee for Economic Development Distinguished Leadership Award, which recognizes business leaders for their contributions.[17][18] She was also ranked number one on Fortune’s Most Powerful Women in Business list.[1] Additionally, Lynch is a board member of U.S. Bancorp,[19] AHIP,[20] The Business Council,[21] Boston College Women’s Council,[8] The Business Roundtable,[22] and is an advisory board member of IBM Watson Health.[8] Lynch is also a trustee of the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts.[19]\n\n\nLynch was awarded an honorary Doctor of Commercial Science from the University of Hartford in 2022 and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Becker College in 2015.[23]\n\n\nShe served as honorary co-chair of the Komen Connecticut Race for the Cure benefiting breast cancer research.[24][11] In 2022, she was listed on the Fortune's “50 Most Powerful Women in Business.[25] Lynch was later named to Time's Time 100 annual list of the hundred most influential people in the world in 2023.[26]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLynch was raised by a single mother. Her mother died by suicide when Lynch was 12 years old.[5] Following her mother’s death, Lynch and her three siblings were raised by their aunt, who was a single mother with a son of her own.[27][28] In Lynch’s early 20s, she lost her aunt to breast cancer, lung cancer, and emphysema.[8]\n\n\nLynch is married to Kevin M. Lynch, the founder, president and CEO of the Quell Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to remove the stigma around mental health, reduce the number of suicides, overdoses, and the incarceration of those with mental illness.[8][29]\n\n\nIn an interview given by Lynch in 2020 she said “Outside of work, I make time for physical fitness, and running is one of my favorite past times. Running helps me to unwind and clear my mind—many times my greatest ideas come from an exhilarating run.”[30]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"CVS Health CEO Karen Lynch is the most powerful woman in American business\". *Fortune*.

In 2021, she became the highest-ranking female chief executive on the Fortune 500 list.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nLynch was born on December 30, 1963, in Ware, Massachusetts.[2] She attended Ware Junior/Senior High School and graduated in 1980.[3] Lynch attended Carroll School of Management at Boston College, where she received a bachelor’s degree in Accounting and has a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) certification.[4] Upon graduating, she started her financial career in the Boston office of Ernst & Young, where she specialized in insurance.[5][4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nLynch credits her chosen career path in health care to her family life experiences.[5] She spent nearly a decade in insurance before returning to graduate school to pursue her MBA, saying, \"I wanted to broaden my financial background to have more exposure to the business aspects of running a company\".[4] In 2004, Lynch was appointed president of Cigna Dental.[6] The following year, she was named to a newly-created position that combines leadership of Cigna Group Insurance and Cigna Dental.[7] She left Cigna in 2009 to become president of Magellan Health Services.[8][9]\n\n\nLynch stayed with Magellan until 2012, when she joined Aetna as executive vice president and head of Specialty Products.[10] Three months after joining Aetna, Lynch led the integration of Coventry Health Care, which was the largest health care acquisition at the time.[11] In 2015, Lynch became Aetna's first female president, a role she retained through the $70 billion acquisition of Aetna by CVS Health in 2018.[12][13]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Lynch took the helm as president and chief executive officer of CVS Health on February 1, 2021, following the retirement of Larry Merlo. The appointment made her the highest-ranking female CEO on the Fortune 500 list and the 40th female chief executive on the Fortune 500 list.[14][15] Under Lynch's leadership, CVS Health administered the COVID-19 vaccine in more than 40,000 long-term care facilities and in CVS Pharmacy locations in 50 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.[16]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nLynch was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50, a list of female entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists, and creators who are over the age of 50.[15] She was awarded the 2021 Committee for Economic Development Distinguished Leadership Award, which recognizes business leaders for their contributions.[17][18] She was also ranked number one on Fortune’s Most Powerful Women in Business list.[1] Additionally, Lynch is a board member of U.S. Bancorp,[19] AHIP,[20] The Business Council,[21] Boston College Women’s Council,[8] The Business Roundtable,[22] and is an advisory board member of IBM Watson Health.[8] Lynch is also a trustee of the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts.[19]\n\n\nLynch was awarded an honorary Doctor of Commercial Science from the University of Hartford in 2022 and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from Becker College in 2015.[23]\n\n\nShe served as honorary co-chair of the Komen Connecticut Race for the Cure benefiting breast cancer research.[24][11] In 2022, she was listed on the Fortune's “50 Most Powerful Women in Business.[25] Lynch was later named to Time's Time 100 annual list of the hundred most influential people in the world in 2023.[26]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLynch was raised by a single mother. Her mother died by suicide when Lynch was 12 years old.[5] Following her mother’s death, Lynch and her three siblings were raised by their aunt, who was a single mother with a son of her own.[27][28] In Lynch’s early 20s, she lost her aunt to breast cancer, lung cancer, and emphysema.[8]\n\n\nLynch is married to Kevin M. Lynch, the founder, president and CEO of the Quell Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to remove the stigma around mental health, reduce the number of suicides, overdoses, and the incarceration of those with mental illness.[8][29]\n\n\nIn an interview given by Lynch in 2020 she said “Outside of work, I make time for physical fitness, and running is one of my favorite past times. Running helps me to unwind and clear my mind—many times my greatest ideas come from an exhilarating run.”[30]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"CVS Health CEO Karen Lynch is the most powerful woman in American business\". *Fortune*.

Educated at Girton College, Cambridge, and Harvard Business School, she worked at McKinsey & Company for 10 years, rising to partner prior to joining Citigroup in 2004. In 2019, she was named president of Citigroup and CEO of its consumer banking division.[2]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Citigroup announced that she would replace Michael Corbat as CEO of Citigroup Inc. in February 2021, becoming the first woman to head a major U.S. bank.[3][4] She was included on *Fortune*'s \"Most Powerful Women in Business\" list in 2014 and 2015 and has been called the \"Number 1 Woman to Watch\" for two consecutive years by *American Banker*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJane Fraser was born in St Andrews, Scotland.[5] She attended Girton College, Cambridge, from 1985 to 1988, graduating with a BA (promoted to a MA per tradition) in economics.[6][7]\n\n\nAfter graduation, she worked as a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Goldman Sachs, London, from July 1988 to July 1990, then as a brokerage associate for Asesores Bursátiles, a Madrid-based securities broker, from August 1990 to June 1992.[6][8] In 1992 she enrolled at Harvard Business School, earning her MBA in 1994.[6]\n\n\n\n## McKinsey & Company[edit]\n\n\n> \n> Being a mother of young children and having a career is the toughest thing I have ever had to do. You are exhausted, guilty, and you must learn how to do things differently. It was the making of me because I became much more 80-20 – focusing on what was really important – got good at saying no, and also became more human to the clients who also face many of these issues too.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJane Fraser[9]\n\nIn 1994 she joined McKinsey & Company, working in financial services and global strategy, eventually rising to partner.[6] For the first six years she worked in New York, and for the last four years in London.[5] She worked part-time while raising her young children.[9]\n\n\nShe wrote articles on globalization and was a co-author, with three other McKinsey employees, of the 1999 book *Race for the World: Strategies to Build a Great Global Firm*.[8][10] As part of her research for the book, she traveled to China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, and India to interview McKinsey clients about their global challenges.[9] After hearing her speak about the book, Citigroup executive Michael Klein spent several years encouraging Fraser to make the move to Citigroup, which she eventually did in 2004.[11]\n\n\n\n## Citigroup[edit]\n\n\nFraser was hired as Head of Client Strategy in Citigroup's investment and global banking division in July 2004.[5][11] In October 2007 she was promoted to Global Head of Strategy and Mergers and Acquisitions, a position she held until May 2009.[9] Her tenure as Global Head coincided with the financial crisis of 2007–2009, and she was part of the executive team that was \"charged with restructuring the group, leading its re-engineering effort, making divestments and raising new capital\".[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Citi Private Bank office\nIn June 2009 she was named CEO of Citi Private Bank.[11] At the time of her promotion, the bank was running an annual deficit of approximately $250 million; it returned to the black during her four-year tenure.[12] Among the changes she implemented were a decrease in the ratio of private bankers to clients, with a target of one banker for every 30 clients, and the removal of commissions and sales formulas for bankers in favor of a year-end discretionary bonus.[5]\n\n\nIn May 2013 she was asked to replace the retiring CEO of CitiMortgage. Though she knew the move was a career risk, she accepted the challenge.[12] Her stewardship of Citigroup's mortgage division coincided with the marketwide drop in demand for mortgage refinancing, forcing the bank to refocus its efforts on selling residential mortgages to home buyers. Citigroup closed several mortgage offices nationwide and laid off 1,000 employees in September 2013 alone.[13]\n\n\nLess than a year later, in March 2014, Fraser was promoted to CEO of US Consumer and Commercial Banking, succeeding Cecelia Stewart who announced her retirement.[14] And in April 2015 she was named CEO of Citigroup Latin America,[15] with responsibility for operations in 24 countries.[16] The latter promotion followed a reshuffling of Citigroup executives sparked by the retirement of Manuel Medina-Mora, CEO of Citigroup's global consumer bank.[17] Medina-Mora was replaced by Stephen Bird, former CEO for the Asia-Pacific region, who in turn was replaced by Francisco Aristeguieta, former CEO of Citigroup Latin America.[18] While based in Miami,[17][18] Fraser has been tasked with, among other things, \"instilling a more U.S.-like culture\" at Banamex (Banco Nacional de México), owned and operated by Citigroup since 2001.[16] The bank was fined $2.2 million on fraud charges in 2014.[18] The head of Banamex, Ernesto Torres Cantu, reports directly to Fraser.[17][18]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Fraser was appointed President of Citigroup and Head of Global Consumer Banking (GCB), and was responsible for all of Citi’s Consumer businesses, including Retail Banking and Wealth Management, Credit Cards, Mortgage and Operations and Technology in 19 markets.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### Promotion to CEO and tenure[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Citigroup announced its CEO, Michael Corbat's retirement, to be effective in February 2021. Fraser was appointed to succeed Corbat, becoming the first female CEO of a top-tier Wall Street Investment Bank,[21][22] leading the third-largest bank in the U.S.[3]\nFraser has taken an approach to work during the COVID-19 pandemic that differs from peer CEOs, instituting permanent plans to allow staff to work from home some days of the week, and granting staff greater flexibility in their schedules than other Wall Street firms.[23] She has cited differentiating Citigroup from other bulge bracket banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase during recruiting as a motivation for this approach.[23]\n\n\nFraser is scheduled to speak at the November 2022 Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, with the Hong Kong Democracy Council claiming that her presence, along with other financial executives, legitimizes the Hong Kong government's whitewashing of the erosion of freedoms in the city.[24]\n\n\n\n## Memberships[edit]\n\n\nFraser is Vice Chair for Partnership for New York City and a member of the Harvard Business School’s Board of Dean’s Advisors, the Stanford Global Advisory Board, the Economic Club of New York and the Council on Foreign Relations.[20] Fraser has led the Citi Operations team since 2021.[25][26][27] She was also a member of the board of the Touch Foundation from 2006 to 2015.[6]\n\n\n\n## Honours and recognition[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015 Fraser was ranked number 41 on *Fortune*'s list of the 51 Most Powerful Women in Business,[15] up from number 48 on the 2014 list.[28] *American Banker* named her the \"Number 1 Woman to Watch\" both in 2014[12] and 2015.[16]\n\n\nFraser was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators who are over the age of 50.[29]\n\n\n\n## Personal[edit]\n\n\nFraser is married and the mother of two sons.[11][8] Her husband Alberto Piedra,[30] a former banker, and native of Cuba,[5] left his job as a bank manager in Europe during the financial crisis of 2008 to spend more time caring for their young children.[31] In June 2015 Fraser appeared on a CBS Local report about Citi Global Community Day, in which she and other volunteers spruced up the Liberty Square public housing project in Miami.[32]\n\n\nIn April 2021, during her first televised interview as CEO of Citigroup (on CNBC), Fraser disclosed that despite the [British] accent, she had \"been a proud American [citizen] for the last twenty years\".[33]\n\n\nIn May 26, 2021, during a congressional testimony before the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Fraser noted in her opening remarks as CEO of Citigroup, that she first arrived in the United States in 1987, before becoming a U.S. citizen in 2001.[34][35][36]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Next List\". *CNBC*. 2015.

Educated at Girton College, Cambridge, and Harvard Business School, she worked at McKinsey & Company for 10 years, rising to partner prior to joining Citigroup in 2004. In 2019, she was named president of Citigroup and CEO of its consumer banking division.[2]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Citigroup announced that she would replace Michael Corbat as CEO of Citigroup Inc. in February 2021, becoming the first woman to head a major U.S. bank.[3][4] She was included on *Fortune*'s \"Most Powerful Women in Business\" list in 2014 and 2015 and has been called the \"Number 1 Woman to Watch\" for two consecutive years by *American Banker*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJane Fraser was born in St Andrews, Scotland.[5] She attended Girton College, Cambridge, from 1985 to 1988, graduating with a BA (promoted to a MA per tradition) in economics.[6][7]\n\n\nAfter graduation, she worked as a mergers and acquisitions analyst at Goldman Sachs, London, from July 1988 to July 1990, then as a brokerage associate for Asesores Bursátiles, a Madrid-based securities broker, from August 1990 to June 1992.[6][8] In 1992 she enrolled at Harvard Business School, earning her MBA in 1994.[6]\n\n\n\n## McKinsey & Company[edit]\n\n\n> \n> Being a mother of young children and having a career is the toughest thing I have ever had to do. You are exhausted, guilty, and you must learn how to do things differently. It was the making of me because I became much more 80-20 – focusing on what was really important – got good at saying no, and also became more human to the clients who also face many of these issues too.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJane Fraser[9]\n\nIn 1994 she joined McKinsey & Company, working in financial services and global strategy, eventually rising to partner.[6] For the first six years she worked in New York, and for the last four years in London.[5] She worked part-time while raising her young children.[9]\n\n\nShe wrote articles on globalization and was a co-author, with three other McKinsey employees, of the 1999 book *Race for the World: Strategies to Build a Great Global Firm*.[8][10] As part of her research for the book, she traveled to China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, and India to interview McKinsey clients about their global challenges.[9] After hearing her speak about the book, Citigroup executive Michael Klein spent several years encouraging Fraser to make the move to Citigroup, which she eventually did in 2004.[11]\n\n\n\n## Citigroup[edit]\n\n\nFraser was hired as Head of Client Strategy in Citigroup's investment and global banking division in July 2004.[5][11] In October 2007 she was promoted to Global Head of Strategy and Mergers and Acquisitions, a position she held until May 2009.[9] Her tenure as Global Head coincided with the financial crisis of 2007–2009, and she was part of the executive team that was \"charged with restructuring the group, leading its re-engineering effort, making divestments and raising new capital\".[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Citi Private Bank office\nIn June 2009 she was named CEO of Citi Private Bank.[11] At the time of her promotion, the bank was running an annual deficit of approximately $250 million; it returned to the black during her four-year tenure.[12] Among the changes she implemented were a decrease in the ratio of private bankers to clients, with a target of one banker for every 30 clients, and the removal of commissions and sales formulas for bankers in favor of a year-end discretionary bonus.[5]\n\n\nIn May 2013 she was asked to replace the retiring CEO of CitiMortgage. Though she knew the move was a career risk, she accepted the challenge.[12] Her stewardship of Citigroup's mortgage division coincided with the marketwide drop in demand for mortgage refinancing, forcing the bank to refocus its efforts on selling residential mortgages to home buyers. Citigroup closed several mortgage offices nationwide and laid off 1,000 employees in September 2013 alone.[13]\n\n\nLess than a year later, in March 2014, Fraser was promoted to CEO of US Consumer and Commercial Banking, succeeding Cecelia Stewart who announced her retirement.[14] And in April 2015 she was named CEO of Citigroup Latin America,[15] with responsibility for operations in 24 countries.[16] The latter promotion followed a reshuffling of Citigroup executives sparked by the retirement of Manuel Medina-Mora, CEO of Citigroup's global consumer bank.[17] Medina-Mora was replaced by Stephen Bird, former CEO for the Asia-Pacific region, who in turn was replaced by Francisco Aristeguieta, former CEO of Citigroup Latin America.[18] While based in Miami,[17][18] Fraser has been tasked with, among other things, \"instilling a more U.S.-like culture\" at Banamex (Banco Nacional de México), owned and operated by Citigroup since 2001.[16] The bank was fined $2.2 million on fraud charges in 2014.[18] The head of Banamex, Ernesto Torres Cantu, reports directly to Fraser.[17][18]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Fraser was appointed President of Citigroup and Head of Global Consumer Banking (GCB), and was responsible for all of Citi’s Consumer businesses, including Retail Banking and Wealth Management, Credit Cards, Mortgage and Operations and Technology in 19 markets.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### Promotion to CEO and tenure[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2020, Citigroup announced its CEO, Michael Corbat's retirement, to be effective in February 2021. Fraser was appointed to succeed Corbat, becoming the first female CEO of a top-tier Wall Street Investment Bank,[21][22] leading the third-largest bank in the U.S.[3]\nFraser has taken an approach to work during the COVID-19 pandemic that differs from peer CEOs, instituting permanent plans to allow staff to work from home some days of the week, and granting staff greater flexibility in their schedules than other Wall Street firms.[23] She has cited differentiating Citigroup from other bulge bracket banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase during recruiting as a motivation for this approach.[23]\n\n\nFraser is scheduled to speak at the November 2022 Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit, with the Hong Kong Democracy Council claiming that her presence, along with other financial executives, legitimizes the Hong Kong government's whitewashing of the erosion of freedoms in the city.[24]\n\n\n\n## Memberships[edit]\n\n\nFraser is Vice Chair for Partnership for New York City and a member of the Harvard Business School’s Board of Dean’s Advisors, the Stanford Global Advisory Board, the Economic Club of New York and the Council on Foreign Relations.[20] Fraser has led the Citi Operations team since 2021.[25][26][27] She was also a member of the board of the Touch Foundation from 2006 to 2015.[6]\n\n\n\n## Honours and recognition[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015 Fraser was ranked number 41 on *Fortune*'s list of the 51 Most Powerful Women in Business,[15] up from number 48 on the 2014 list.[28] *American Banker* named her the \"Number 1 Woman to Watch\" both in 2014[12] and 2015.[16]\n\n\nFraser was selected for the inaugural 2021 Forbes 50 Over 50; made up of entrepreneurs, leaders, scientists and creators who are over the age of 50.[29]\n\n\n\n## Personal[edit]\n\n\nFraser is married and the mother of two sons.[11][8] Her husband Alberto Piedra,[30] a former banker, and native of Cuba,[5] left his job as a bank manager in Europe during the financial crisis of 2008 to spend more time caring for their young children.[31] In June 2015 Fraser appeared on a CBS Local report about Citi Global Community Day, in which she and other volunteers spruced up the Liberty Square public housing project in Miami.[32]\n\n\nIn April 2021, during her first televised interview as CEO of Citigroup (on CNBC), Fraser disclosed that despite the [British] accent, she had \"been a proud American [citizen] for the last twenty years\".[33]\n\n\nIn May 26, 2021, during a congressional testimony before the United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Fraser noted in her opening remarks as CEO of Citigroup, that she first arrived in the United States in 1987, before becoming a U.S. citizen in 2001.[34][35][36]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Next List\". *CNBC*. 2015.
