Seven planets were placed in orbit around it in an order of increasing distance from the Earth, as established by the Greek Stoics: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. This list included two objects, the Sun and the Moon, which are now not generally considered planets.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 5th century BCE, the Greek philosophers Philolaus and Hicetas speculated separately that the Earth was a sphere revolving daily around some mystical \"central fire\" that regulated the universe. Anaxagoras proposed that the Sun is a star around 450 BCE. In the 3rd century BCE, Aristarchus of Samos extended this idea by proposing that the Earth and other planets moved around a definite central object, which he believed to be the Sun though this was not widely accepted until the 17th century and not proven until the 19th.[3]\n |\n| *Earth* | ![](image) | *3rd Planet* | Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the subject of historical misconception for centuries.[4][5] Earth was never formally 'discovered' because it was never an unrecognized entity by humans. However, its shared identity with other bodies as a \"planet\" is a historically recent discovery.\nThe Earth's position in the Solar System was correctly described in the heliocentric model proposed by Aristarchus of Samos.[6]\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Early 20th century\n |\n| --- |\n| Date\n | Name\n | Image\n | Permanent designation\n | Discoverer(s) and notes\n |\n| 1900s\n |\n| i: December 3, 1904p: January 6, 1905\n | **Himalia** | ![](image) | Jupiter VI | Perrine[37][40][41] |\n| i: January 2, 1905p: February 27, 1905\n | **Elara** | ![](image) | Jupiter VII | Perrine[37][41][42] |\n| i: January 27, 1908o: February 28, 1908p: March 1\u20136, 1908\n | **Pasiphae** | ![](image) | Jupiter VIII | Melotte[37][43][44] |\n| 1910s\n |\n| i: July 21, 1914p: September 17, 1914\n | **Sinope** | ![](image) | Jupiter IX | Nicholson[37][45] |\n| 1930s\n |\n| i: January 23, 1930o: February 18, 1930p: March 13, 1930\n | *Pluto* | ![](image) | *9th Planet\u00a0(1930)**Dwarf planet\u00a0(2006)* | Tombaugh[46] |\n| i: July 6, 1938p: August 1938\n | **Lysithea** | ![](image) | Jupiter X | Nicholson[37][47] |\n| i: July 30, 1938p: August 1938\n | **Carme** | ![](image) | Jupiter XI\n |\n| 1940s\n |\n| i: February 16, 1948p: June 1949\n | **Miranda** | ![](image) | Uranus V | Kuiper[37][48] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe numbering of Titania and Oberon underwent some confusion, because in 1797, Herschel reported four more satellites of Uranus[23] that turned out not to exist. Before any more Uranian moons were discovered, William Lassell sometimes adopted Herschel's numbers where Titania and Oberon are respectively Uranus II and IV,[24] and sometimes called them respectively Uranus I and II.[25] After he discovered Ariel and Umbriel in 1851, Lassell numbered the four real Uranian satellites then known outward from their parent planet as I (Ariel), II (Umbriel), III (Titania), and IV (Oberon), and this finally stuck.[26]\n\n\n\n## 19th century[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Late 20th century\n |\n| --- |\n| Date\n | Name\n | Temporary Designation\n | Image\n | Permanent Designation\n | Discoverer(s) and notes\n |\n| 1950s\n |\n| i: September 28, 1951p: December 1951\n | **Ananke** | \u2014 | ![](image) | Jupiter XII | Nicholson[51][52] |\n| 1960s\n |\n| i: December 15, 1966p: January 3, 1967\n | **Janus**\\* | S/1966 S 2 | ![](image) | Saturn X | Dollfus[51][53][54][55][56](Dollfus may have seen either Janus or Epimetheus)\n |\n| i: December 18, 1966p: January 6, 1967\n | **Epimetheus**\\* | S/1980 S 3 | ![](image) | Saturn XI | Walker[51][57] |\n| 1970s\n |\n| i: September 11, 1974p: September 20, 1974\n | **Leda** | \u2014 | ![](image) | Jupiter XIII | Kowal[37][58] |\n| i: September 30, 1975p: October 3, 1975\n | **Themisto**\\* | S/1975 J 1 | ![](image) | Jupiter XVIII | Kowal and Roemer[37][59](Discovered and then lost)\n |\n| i: April 13, 1978o: June 22, 1978p: July 7, 1978\n | **Charon** | S/1978 P 1 | ![](image) | Pluto I | Christy[60][61] |\n| i: July 8, 1979p: November 23, 1979\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Herschel initially thought it was a comet when he first reported it on April 26, 1781, but it was later confirmed to be a planet.\n\n2. Neptune - Discovered on September 23, 1846 by Johann Gottfried Galle and Urbain Le Verrier. Le Verrier had mathematically predicted Neptune's existence and position based on irregularities in Uranus's orbit, and Galle found it based on Le Verrier's calculations.\n\nIt's worth noting that Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh and was initially considered the ninth planet, but it was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006, so it's no longer considered one of the main planets of our solar system.\n\nAll other planets in our solar system (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) were known since ancient times, having been identified by Babylonian astronomers in the 2nd millennium BC. While Earth was always known to humans, its status as a planet similar to the others wasn't fully understood until the development of the heliocentric model.",
