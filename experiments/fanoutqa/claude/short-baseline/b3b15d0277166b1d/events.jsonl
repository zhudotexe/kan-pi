Seven planets were placed in orbit around it in an order of increasing distance from the Earth, as established by the Greek Stoics: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. This list included two objects, the Sun and the Moon, which are now not generally considered planets.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 5th century BCE, the Greek philosophers Philolaus and Hicetas speculated separately that the Earth was a sphere revolving daily around some mystical \"central fire\" that regulated the universe. Anaxagoras proposed that the Sun is a star around 450 BCE. In the 3rd century BCE, Aristarchus of Samos extended this idea by proposing that the Earth and other planets moved around a definite central object, which he believed to be the Sun though this was not widely accepted until the 17th century and not proven until the 19th.[3]\n |\n| *Earth* | ![](image) | *3rd Planet* | Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the subject of historical misconception for centuries.[4][5] Earth was never formally 'discovered' because it was never an unrecognized entity by humans. However, its shared identity with other bodies as a \"planet\" is a historically recent discovery.\nThe Earth's position in the Solar System was correctly described in the heliocentric model proposed by Aristarchus of Samos.[6]\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Early 20th century\n |\n| --- |\n| Date\n | Name\n | Image\n | Permanent designation\n | Discoverer(s) and notes\n |\n| 1900s\n |\n| i: December 3, 1904p: January 6, 1905\n | **Himalia** | ![](image) | Jupiter VI | Perrine[37][40][41] |\n| i: January 2, 1905p: February 27, 1905\n | **Elara** | ![](image) | Jupiter VII | Perrine[37][41][42] |\n| i: January 27, 1908o: February 28, 1908p: March 1–6, 1908\n | **Pasiphae** | ![](image) | Jupiter VIII | Melotte[37][43][44] |\n| 1910s\n |\n| i: July 21, 1914p: September 17, 1914\n | **Sinope** | ![](image) | Jupiter IX | Nicholson[37][45] |\n| 1930s\n |\n| i: January 23, 1930o: February 18, 1930p: March 13, 1930\n | *Pluto* | ![](image) | *9th Planet (1930)**Dwarf planet (2006)* | Tombaugh[46] |\n| i: July 6, 1938p: August 1938\n | **Lysithea** | ![](image) | Jupiter X | Nicholson[37][47] |\n| i: July 30, 1938p: August 1938\n | **Carme** | ![](image) | Jupiter XI\n |\n| 1940s\n |\n| i: February 16, 1948p: June 1949\n | **Miranda** | ![](image) | Uranus V | Kuiper[37][48] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe numbering of Titania and Oberon underwent some confusion, because in 1797, Herschel reported four more satellites of Uranus[23] that turned out not to exist.
