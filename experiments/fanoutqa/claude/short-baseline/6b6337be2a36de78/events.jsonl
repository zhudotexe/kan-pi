These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

As of 2006, it was widely considered the most popular breed in the world.[36] And it is the most popular dog by ownership in Canada, New Zealand[37] and the United Kingdom.[38] In 2006 both the United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over twice as many registered Labradors as the next most popular breed.[39][40] If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3–5 times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the German shepherd dog and Golden retriever.[39][40]\n\n\nThey are the most popular breed of assistance dog in the United States, Australia, and many other countries,[41] as well as being widely used by police and other official bodies for their detection and working abilities. Approximately 60–70% of all guide dogs in the United States are Labradors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDogs originating in the United Kingdom\n |\n| --- |\n| Hounds | * Beagle\n* Bloodhound\n* English Foxhound\n* Greyhound\n* Harrier\n* Otterhound\n* Scottish Deerhound\n* Welsh Hound\n* West Country Harrier\n* Whippet\n |\n| Gun dogs | * Clumber Spaniel\n* Curly-Coated Retriever\n* English Cocker Spaniel\n* English Setter\n* English Springer Spaniel\n* Field Spaniel\n* Flat-Coated Retriever\n* Golden Retriever\n* Gordon Setter\n* Labrador Retriever\n* Pointer\n* Sussex Spaniel\n* Welsh Springer Spaniel\n |\n| Terriers | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDogs\n |\n| --- |\n| Types | * African village dogs\n* Feral dogs\n\t+ Pye-dogs\n\t+ Street dogs\n* Hairless dogs\n* Herding dogs\n\t+ Collies\n\t+ Livestock guardian dogs\n\t+ Sheepdogs\n* Hunting dogs\n\t+ Curs\n\t\t- Feists\n\t\t- Lurchers\n\t+ Gun dogs\n\t\t- Pointers\n\t\t- Retrievers\n\t\t- Setters\n\t\t- Spaniels\n\t\t- Water dogs\n\t+ Hounds\n\t\t- Scenthounds\n\t\t\t* Bassets\n\t\t\t* Coonhounds\n\t\t\t* Foxhounds\n\t\t- Sighthounds\n\t\t\t* Longdogs\n\t+ Terriers\n\t\t- Bull-type terriers\n\t\t- Pinschers\n\t\t- Schnauzers\n* Mastiffs\n\t+ Bulldogs\n* Spitz\n\t+ Huskies\n\t+ Laikas\n\t+ Tugous\n* Toy dogs\n\t+ Bichons\n* Turnspit dogs\n |\n| Breeds | * List of breeds\n* List of crossbreeds\n* Mixed-breed dogs\n* Crossbreeds\n* Extinct breeds\n* Most popular\n |\n| Roles | * Assistance dogs\n\t+ Autism dogs\n\t+ Guide dogs\n\t+ Hearing dogs\n\t+ Medical response dogs\n\t\t- Seizure dogs\n\t+ Mobility assistance dogs\n\t+ Therapy dogs\n\t\t- Psychiatric service dogs\n* Attack dogs\n* Bay dogs\n* Carriage dogs\n* Catch dogs\n* Companion dogs\n* Detection dogs\n* Fighting dogs\n* Guard dogs\n* Lap dogs\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Meat dogs\n* Mercy dogs\n* Pet dogs\n* Police dogs\n\t+ usage by country\n* Search and rescue dogs\n* Sled dogs\n* War dogs\n |\n| Behavior | * Communication\n\t+ Barking\n\t+ Howling\n* Human–canine bond\n* Intelligence\n* Dog–cat relationship\n |\n| Human–doginteraction | * Animal testing\n* Baiting\n* Breed-specific legislation\n* Dog bite\n* Dog fighting\n* Dog park\n* Dog show\n* Human–canine bond\n* Dog sports\n* Dog walking\n* Dog daycare\n* Dog grooming\n* Therapy\n* Fear of dogs\n* Dog licence\n* Dog meat\n* Dog food\n\t+ dog biscuit\n\t+ 2007 recalls\n* Dogs in religion\n* Dogs in space\n* Origin of the domestic dog\n |\n| Health | * Aging (List of longest-living dogs)\n* Anatomy\n* Breeding\n* Coat\n* Conformation\n* Diseases\n* Dog food\n* Odor\n* Rabies in animals\n* Rage syndrome\n* Reproduction\n* Skin disorders\n* Vaccination\n |\n| Training | * Clicker\n* Crate training\n* Training\n* Housebreaking\n* Socialization\n |\n| Related | * List of individual dogs\n* List of fictional dogs\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nConant, E.K.; Juras, R.; Cothran, E.G.
