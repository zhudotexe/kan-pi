On average they stand between 20 and 26 inches (51 and 66\u00a0cm) and weigh between 35 and 75 pounds (16 and 34\u00a0kg).[11][12] Tough feet are an important feature and desirable trait for breeding consideration. As with their build, the Alaskan husky's coat can vary greatly; they usually have double coats with all colors and patterns of colors seen within various lines.[11][12] Distance-type Alaskan huskies often have denser double coats to better contend with cold temperatures and harsh wind, whereas sprint lines have shorter coats to allow for greater heat dissipation during races at high speeds.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDog breed\n\n\n| Alaskan husky |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)An Alaskan husky resting during a run at Riley Creek Campground in Denali National Park and Preserve, Denali Park, AK\n |\n| Origin | United States (Alaska) |\n| Breed status | Not recognized as a breed by any major kennel club. |\n| \n\n| Traits |\n| --- |\n| Height | \n20\u201326\u00a0in (51\u201366\u00a0cm) |\n| Weight | \n35\u201375\u00a0lb (16\u201334\u00a0kg) |\n| Coat | \nUsually double coat |\n| Color | \nAny color or pattern |\n| Life\u00a0span | \n10\u201315 years |\n\n |\n| Dog (domestic dog) |\n\n\nThe **Alaskan husky** is a breed of medium-sized working sled dog, developed specifically for its performance as such.[1][2][3]\n\n\nAlaskan huskies are the most commonly used type of dog for competitive sled dog racing, both in short-distance sprint racing as well as long-distance expedition races such as the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race,[4] the Yukon Quest,[5] and the Finnmarkslopet.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)An Alaskan husky at Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska\n![](image)Alaskan husky standing on his doghouseIn the latter half of the 20th century the primary use of sled dogs shifted from utility to sport, particularly career competitive sled dog racing. In order to facilitate greater speed for racing sport, various breeds of gundogs and sighthounds have now been bred into Alaskan husky lines, including Pointers, Greyhounds, German Shorthaired Pointers, Salukis, Borzois, Labradors and Setters; some breeders have even used wolves at various points.[10][12][11]\n\n\n## Lineage[edit]\n\n\nGenetic studies indicate that the Alaskan Husky originates from pre-Colonial North American Arctic village dogs (including precursors to the Alaskan Malamute) and Siberian imports (precursors to the Siberian Husky), crossbred with European breeds such as Pointers, German Shepherd Dogs, and Salukis to improve its performance.[9][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe behaviors and temperament of the Alaskan husky can vary greatly due to the wide range of genetic backgrounds and bred-purposes within the breed. As with all sled dogs, a desire to pull and run are essential and are of high priority in decisions of breeding. Mental soundness is also important due to the need for dogs to be in close quarters with other dogs while hooked in the team, handled by people for proper care and transportation, and for dogs on racing teams to perform under environments which include trails crowded with spectators and other dog teams.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Five-year-old male Alaskan husky from championship distance racing lines\nLike most working sled dogs, Alaskan huskies are capable of pulling far greater than their own body weight in load while in harness. Sprint teams of Alaskan huskies are capable of speeds of up to 28\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h),[16] whereas distance-specialist teams have completed 938 mile (1510\u00a0km) races in just 8 days, 3 hours, 40 minutes, and 13 seconds with time including 40 hours of mandatory rests and other routine rests on the trail.[17]\n\n\nAs specifically purposed working sled dogs, Alaskan huskies can be subject to climate or work-specific health conditions that any sled dogs may experience, such as temperature-related bronchitis or bronchopulmonary ailments, also known as \"ski asthma\".[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A three-year-old male Alaskan husky\nThe Alaskan husky has selectively been bred specifically for its athletic performance.[14][5] As such, its level of athletic ability, as well as anabolic efficiency are far greater than the average domesticated dog, especially in endurance feats. Distance-specialist Alaskan huskies out-speed most animals and all other types of sled dogs when running distances of 50 miles or greater, even while pulling moderately sized loads.[5] Studies on the metabolic capabilities in working Alaskan husky sled dogs reveal that their system transitions to utilization of low-glucose energy sources (from high-glycogen carbohydrates) early on during long periods of travel, and their reliance on these low-glucose fuels (such as those higher in fats and proteins) continue and even extend to become more pronounced after working for longer periods.[14] A good appetite is a highly desirable trait, and is emphasized in breeding choices.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Alaskan husky is not an officially recognized breed by any kennel club, nor does it have a formal breed standard.[6] Unlike breeds developed for the show ring, the Alaskan husky is instead a product of careful selection for desirable sled dog traits from various other breeds, such as aptitude for pulling, endurance, speed, intelligence, appetite, and tolerance of extreme weather.[7][8] As a result of this specific and mindful performance-only based breeding, DNA studies show that Alaskan Huskies share a genetic signature and indeed can be identified accurately on DNA breed tests.[9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The distance group showed a higher contribution from the Arctic/Asian group, mainly the Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute, and the Mastiff/Terrier group consisting primarily of Great Pyrenees and Anatolian Shepard.[9] The distance group also showed to be more genetically distinct from one another across kennel-based populations and at the individual level, than the sprint group.[9]\n* The sprint group displayed a higher contribution from Pointer-type dogs and Salukis, and the lowest contribution from Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes, as well as the extreme-sprint specialists displaying the highest contribution from already long-bred Alaskan husky lineage.[9]\n* A sub-group chosen for analysis due to its overlap between distance and sprint types displayed the most Saluki contribution, more than the extreme sprint or extreme distance specialists.[9]\n\n\n![](image)Two Alaskan husky lead dogs hooked up at a race event\n## Health and physical capabilities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Brown, S K; Darwent, C M; Wictum, E J; Sacks, B N (2015). \"Using multiple markers to elucidate the ancient, historical and modern relationships among North American Arctic dog breeds\". *Heredity*. **115** (6): 488\u2013495. doi:10.1038/hdy.2015.49.

Dogs are expected to read the trail and situation through instincts and experience, and thus superior cognitive abilities are often bred into Alaskan husky lines in tandem with physical athletic attributes.[20]\n\n\n\n## See Also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Dogs portal\n\n\n* List of dog breeds\n* Husky\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2015, a DNA study indicated that the Alaskan husky, the Siberian Husky, and the Alaskan Malamute share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled-dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs: the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog. The Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through crossing with European breeds.[8]\n\n\nOther breeds identified as having contributed to the Alaskan husky sled dog gene pool include Pointers, and a number of other non-arctic breeds by breed and type group. Genetic variation in the Alaskan husky has been analyzed based on the groupings of two purpose-driven distinct populations within the Alaskan sled dog gene pool: A distance group, and a sprint group:[9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Desmond., Morris (2008). *Dogs\u00a0: the ultimate dictionary of over 1,000 dog breeds*.

Most lines today contain some form of traditional husky heritage in their bloodlines, Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies being the most common, although Mackenzie River huskies, Greenland Dogs, and Samoyeds have also been utilized.[10][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, the largest study of \"canine hematologic and serum biochemical analytes\" to date was published, including within it the largest data set of healthy athlete dogs; the dogs of reference were 4,804 sled dogs training for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, the overwhelming majority of which were Alaskan huskies.[19] The study found that anti-aging and anti-inflammatory biochemical levels in the dogs increased over time and with training, enhancing the dogs' physical and mental abilities until an average of 6.6 years of age. Despite noted differences in sex, genetic, and age groups in other areas, they were not statistically significant and were outside the scope of the study, making them scientifically inconclusive despite their observance.[19]\n\n\n\n## Behavior[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Ryukyu dog\n* Shar Pei\n* Thai Bangkaew Dog\n |\n| Companion dogs | * Alaskan Klee Kai\n* American Eskimo Dog\n* Danish Spitz\n* Eurasier\n* German Spitz\n\t+ Keeshond (Wolfspitz)\n\t+ Pomeranian (Zwergspitz)\n* Northern Inuit Dog\n* Schipperke\n* Tonya Finosu\n* Volpino Italiano\n |\n| Extinct breeds | * Argentine polar dog\n* Guejae Gae\n* Hare Indian Dog\n* H\u00fctespitz\n* Salish Wool Dog\n* Tahltan Bear Dog\n |\n| **Types:** Husky, Laika, Tugou\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDogs originating in the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Extant | * Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog\n* Alaskan husky\n* Alaskan Klee Kai\n* Alaskan Malamute\n* American Bulldog\n* American Bully\n* American Cocker Spaniel\n* American English Coonhound\n* American Eskimo Dog\n* American Foxhound\n* American Hairless Terrier\n* American Leopard Hound\n* American Pit Bull Terrier\n* American Staffordshire Terrier\n* American Staghound\n* American Water Spaniel\n* Australian Shepherd\n* Black and Tan Coonhound\n* Black Mouth Cur\n* Blue Lacy\n* Bluetick Coonhound\n* Boston Terrier\n* Boykin Spaniel\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Connolly, Sara L.; Nelson, Stuart; Jones, Tabitha; Kahn, Julia; Constable, Peter D.

Several European studies found a much lower prevalence (20\u201339%), which may reflect the significant genetic divergence between the American and European populations. They are especially prone to hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma, with an estimated lifetime risk of one in five for the former and one in eight for the latter. The high prevalence of cancer deaths among Golden Retrievers may partly represent a lack of other congenital diseases.[19][20][21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Kennel Club breed standard is accepted by every kennel club in the world except those of Canada and the United States.[6] Breed standards in North America call for a slightly taller dog[note 4] and the cream colour is not permitted.[6]\n\n\n\n### Temperament[edit]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever is considered an intelligent, gentle natured and very affectionate breed of dog.[3][8] As is typical with retriever breeds, the breed is generally calm and biddable, being very easy to train and extremely keen to please their master.[6][8] The breed is known to make excellent pets and family dogs, being generally extremely tolerant of children and keen to accompany any member of the family in a range of activities.[4] Due to their affable natures, the breed is often completely devoid of guarding instincts.[4] However, there have also been reports of some very aggressive Golden Retrievers in certain lineages. It has been suggested that these variations in aggression are partially caused by genetic factors.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Golden Retriever is still used as a gundog by sportsmen, both as a hunting companion in the field and for competing in field trials.[3][8][12] It is used more for retrieval of land-based gamebirds such as grouse and partridge than for wildfowl hunting.[8] Those used as gundogs are usually from working lines specifically bred for field use; dogs from pet or show lines are rarely suitable.[3][8][12] A Golden Retriever with a traditional dense double coat is well suited to working in cold and wet conditions, as the coat provides water resistance and insulation.[8][12] Compared to other retriever breeds, the Golden Retriever is not a strong swimmer; its long coat causes it to sit low in the water when swimming.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** MacSmith, James (17 August 2021). \"Australia's most popular dog breeds\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.\n\n\nThe breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGundogs\n |\n| --- |\n| Pointersand setters | * Ari\u00e8ge Pointer\n* Blue Picardy Spaniel\n* Bracco Italiano\n* Braque d'Auvergne\n* Braque du Bourbonnais\n* Braque Fran\u00e7ais\n* Braque Saint-Germain\n* Brittany\n* Burgos Pointer\n* Ca M\u00e8 Mallorqu\u00ed\n* Cesky Fousek\n* Drentse Patrijshond\n* English Setter\n* French Spaniel\n* German Longhaired Pointer\n* German Roughhaired Pointer\n* German Shorthaired Pointer\n* German Wirehaired Pointer\n* Gordon Setter\n* Irish Red and White Setter\n* Irish Setter\n* Large M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder\n* Old Danish Pointer\n* Pach\u00f3n Navarro\n* Picardy Spaniel\n* Perdigueiro Galego\n* Pointer\n* Portuguese Pointer\n* Pudelpointer\n* Saint-Usuge Spaniel\n* Slovakian Roughhaired Pointer\n* Small M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder\n* Spinone Italiano\n* Stabyhoun\n* Vizsla\n* Weimaraner\n* Wirehaired Pointing Griffon\n* Wirehaired Vizsla\n |\n| Retrievers | * Chesapeake Bay Retriever\n* Curly-coated Retriever\n* Flat-coated Retriever\n* Golden Retriever\n* Labrador Retriever\n* Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe breed usually retains many of their gundog traits and instincts including an excellent sense of smell and a strong instinct to retrieve; even among those not trained as gundogs it is typical for Golden Retrievers to present their owners with toys or other objects.[6][8] Compared to other retriever breeds the Golden Retriever is typically quite slow to mature.[8][12]\n\n\n\n## Popularity and uses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Retrieving a shot gamebird\nThe Golden Retriever is one of the most commonly kept breeds of companion dog in the Western world, and is often among the top ten dog breeds by number of registrations in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada.[2][3][15][16][17][18] It is a frequent competitor at dog shows; separate show lines of the breed have been developed.[3][8][12] The dogs can be trained as guide dogs and therapy dogs,[3][4] and may compete in obedience trials and other dog sports.[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Berkowitz, Bonnie (30 January 2021). \"'Who pours the kibble?'
