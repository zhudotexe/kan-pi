As a result, the length measurements of many rivers are only approximations (see also coastline paradox). In particular, there seems to exist disagreement as to whether the Nile[3] or the Amazon[4] is the world's longest river. The Nile has traditionally been considered longer, but in 2007 and 2008 some scientists claimed that the Amazon is longer[5][6][7] by measuring the river plus the adjacent Par\u00e1 estuary and the longest connecting tidal canal.[8] A peer-reviewed article published 2009 in the *International Journal of Digital Earth* concludes that the Nile is longer.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** Kammerer, J.C.

Traditionally, the Nile is considered longer, but recent information suggests that the Amazon may be longer. Differences in the recorded length of the Amazon mainly depend on whether the course south of the Ilha de Maraj\u00f3 at the Amazon's mouth is to be treated as part of the Amazon, or as part of the separate Tocantins River. New evidence, (dated 16 June 2007) obtained from a high-altitude scientific venture in the Andes, claims that \"the Amazon is longer than the Nile by 100\u00a0km, with its longest headwater being the Carhuasanta stream originating in the south of Peru on the Nevado Mismi mountain's northern slopes and flowing into the R\u00edo Apur\u00edmac\".[29] However, the origin of the river at Nevado Mismi had already been known more than one decade earlier (see Jacek Palkiewicz), and satellite based measuring from this origin to the Amazon mouth has resulted in not more than 6,400\u00a0km.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 879\n |  |  | Amazon\n | Peru\n |\n| 104.\n | Dniester | 1,411 (1,352)\n | 877 (840)\n | 72,100\n | 310\n | Black Sea | Ukraine, Moldova |\n| 105.\n | Benue | 1,400\n | 870\n |  |  | Niger | Cameroon, Nigeria |\n| 105.\n | Chari | 1,400[23] | 870\n |  |  | Lake Chad | Chad, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria |\n| 105.\n | Ili (Yili) | 1,400\n | 870\n |  |  | Lake Balkhash | China, Kazakhstan\n |\n| 105.\n | Warburton\u2013Georgina | 1,400\n | 870\n | 365,000\n |  | Lake Eyre | Australia\n |\n| 108.\n | Sutlej | 1,372\n | 852\n |  |  | Chenab | China, India, Pakistan\n |\n| 109.\n | Yamuna | 1,370\n | 851\n | 366,223\n | 2,950\n | Ganges | India\n |\n| 109.\n | Vyatka | 1,370\n | 851\n | 129,000\n | 890\n | Kama | Russia\n |\n| 111.\n | Fraser | 1,368\n | 850\n | 220,000\n | 3,475\n | Pacific Ocean\n | Canada, United States[24] |\n| 112.\n | Grande | 1,360\n | 845\n |  |  | Paran\u00e1 | Brazil\n |\n| 113.\n | Liao-Xiliao-Laoha\n | 1,345\n | 836\n |  |  | Bohai Sea | China\n |\n| 114.\n | Lachlan River | 1,339 [15] | 832\n | 84,700\n | 49\n | Murrumbidgee River | Australia\n |\n| 115.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Generally, the most commonly used/anglicised name of the river is used.

That gives the impression that most of the Congo basin was formerly on a much higher land level and that the Congo River was rejuvenated by much of its lower course being removed, likeliest when Africa split from South America when Gondwanaland broke up due to continental drift, and before that, the Congo would likely have flowed into the Amazon,[30] producing a river around 6000 miles or 10,000\u00a0km long.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Yenisey\u2013Angara\u2013Selenga\u2013Ider | 5,539 | 3,445 | 2,580,000\n | 18,050\n | Kara Sea | Russia (97%), Mongolia (2.9%)\n |\n| 6.\n | Yellow River(Huang He) | 5,464 | 3,395 | 745,000\n | 2,571\n | Bohai Sea | China\n |\n| 7.\n | Ob\u2013Irtysh | 5,410\n | 3,364\n | 2,990,000\n | 12,475\n | Gulf of Ob | Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia\n |\n| 8.\n | R\u00edo de la Plata\u2013Paran\u00e1\u2013Rio Grande[12] | 4,880 | 3,030 | 2,582,672\n | 22,000\n | R\u00edo de la Plata | Brazil (46.7%), Argentina (27.7%), Paraguay (13.5%), Bolivia (8.3%), Uruguay (3.8%)\n |\n| 9.\n | Congo\u2013Chambeshi(Za\u00efre) | 4,700 | 2,922 | 3,680,000\n | 41,800\n | Atlantic Ocean\n | Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Angola, Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Cameroon, Zambia, Burundi, Rwanda |\n| 10.\n | Amur\u2013Argun\u2013Kherlen(Heilong Jiang) | 4,444\n | 2,763\n | 1,855,000\n | 11,400\n | Sea of Okhotsk | Russia, China, Mongolia\n |\n| 11.\n | Lena | 4,400 | 2,736 | 2,490,000\n | 15,500\n | Laptev Sea | Russia\n |\n| 12.\n | Mekong(Lancang Jiang) | 4,350\n | 2,705\n | 810,000\n | 16,000\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 176.\n | Kuskokwim | 1,050\n | 652\n |  |  | Bering Sea | United States\n |\n| 179.\n | Tennessee | 1,049\n | 652\n |  |  | Ohio | United States\n |\n| 180.\n | Oder\u2013Warta | 1,045\n | 649\n | 118,861\n | 550\n | Baltic Sea | Poland, Germany, Czech Republic\n |\n| 181.\n | Aruwimi[26] | 1,030\n | 640\n |  |  | Congo | Democratic Republic of the Congo\n |\n| 182.\n | Chambal | 1,024\n | 636\n |  |  | Yamuna | India |\n| 183.\n | Daugava | 1,020\n | 634\n | 87,900\n | 678\n | Gulf of Riga | Latvia, Belarus, Russia\n |\n| 184.\n | Gila | 1,015\n | 631\n |  |  | Colorado (western U.S.)\n | United States\n |\n| 185.\n | Loire | 1,012\n | 629\n | 115,271\n | 840\n | Atlantic Ocean\n | France\n |\n| 186.\n | Essequibo | 1,010\n | 628\n |  |  | Atlantic Ocean\n | Guyana |\n| 186.\n | Khopyor | 1,010\n | 628\n | 61,100\n | 150\n | Don | Russia\n |\n| 188.\n | Tagus(Tajo/Tejo) | 1,006\n | 625\n | 80,100\n | 444\n | Atlantic Ocean\n | Spain, Portugal\n |\n| 189.\n | Flinders River | 1,004 [15] | 624\n | 109,000\n | 122\n | Gulf of Carpentaria | Australia\n |\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |  |  | Mississippi | United States\n |\n| 129.\n | Rhine | 1,233\n | 768\n | 185,000 [27] | 2,330\n | North Sea | Germany (57.3%), Switzerland (15.1%), Netherlands (12.3%), France (12.2%), Luxembourg (1.4%), Austria (1.3%), Belgium (0.4%), Liechtenstein (0.1%), Italy (0.03%)\n |\n| 130.\n | Athabasca | 1,231\n | 765\n | 95,300\n |  | Mackenzie | Canada\n |\n| 131.\n | Canadian | 1,223\n | 760\n |  |  | Arkansas | United States\n |\n| 132.\n | North Saskatchewan | 1,220\n | 758\n |  |  | Saskatchewan | Canada\n |\n| 133.\n | Vistula\u2013Narew-Bug | 1,213\n | 754\n | 194,424\n | 1,080\n | Baltic Sea | Poland, Belarus, Ukraine\n |\n| 134.\n | Vaal | 1,210\n | 752\n |  |  | Orange | South Africa |\n| 135.\n | Shire | 1,200\n | 746\n |  |  | Zambezi | Mozambique, Malawi |\n| 135.\n | Ogoou\u00e9 (or Ogowe) | 1,200\n | 746\n | 223,856\n | 4,706\n | Atlantic Ocean\n | Gabon, Republic of the Congo |\n| 137.\n | Nen (Nonni) | 1,190\n | 739\n |  |  | Songhua | China\n |\n| 138.\n | K\u0131z\u0131l River | 1,182\n | 734\n | 115,000\n | 400\n | Black Sea | Turkey\n |\n| 139.\n | Markha | 1,181\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
