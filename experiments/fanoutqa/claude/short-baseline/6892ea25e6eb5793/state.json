In 1938, the three schools moved again, this time further southwest to Kunming, and formed the National Southwestern Associated University.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOver the past century, some Peking University alumni have become presidents of other major Chinese universities, including former Tsinghua President Luo Jialun, Renmin University President Yuan Baohua, Zhejiang University President Qian Sanqiang, Fudan University President Zhang Zhirang, Nankai University President Teng Weizao, Chinese University of Science and Technology President Guan Weiyan and many others.[30]\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n#### General rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Global \u2013 Overall |\n| *ARWU* World[31] | 29 |\n| *QS* World[32] | 17 |\n| *QS* Employability[33] | 23 |\n| *THE* World[34] | 14 |\n| *THE* Reputation[35] | 13 |\n| *USNWR* Global[36] | 39 |\n|  |\n| Regional \u2013 Overall |\n| *ARWU* Asia[37] | 3 |\n| *QS* Asia[38] | 1 |\n| *QS* BRICS[39] | 2 |\n| *THE* Asia[34] | 2 |\n| *THE* Emerging Economies[40] | 1 |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2001, Peking University established the Yuanpei Program.

In the same year, Peking University set up a satellite campus for graduate students in Shenzhen.

President Cai, inspired by the German model of academic freedom, introduced faculty governance and democratic management to the university. Cai recruited an intellectually diverse faculty that included some of the most prominent figures in the progressive New Culture Movement, including Hu Shih, Liu Bannong, Ma Yinchu, Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu, Lu Xun and Liang Shuming. Meanwhile, leading conservatives Gu Hongming and Huang Kan also taught at the university.[9] A firm supporter for freedom of thought, Cai advocated for educational independence and resigned several times protesting the government's policy and interference. \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn May 4, 1998, at the 100th anniversary of Peking University, Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin announced that the government would initiate a national project to promote China's higher education by funding selected universities to achieve world-class level.

In June 1896, Minister Li Duanfen proposed to create a university in the capital. On 11 June 1898, the Guangxu Emperor, as part of the Hundred Days' Reform, authorised the creation of the **Imperial University of Peking**[7] (simplified Chinese: \u4eac\u5e08\u5927\u5b66\u5802; traditional Chinese: \u4eac\u5e2b\u5927\u5b78\u5802; pinyin: *J\u012bngsh\u012b D\u00e0xu\u00e9t\u00e1ng*; lit. 'Capital Grand Study Hall').[8] The Imperial University was formally established on 3 July 1898 when the emperor approved the royal charter written by Liang. Minister Sun Jianai was charged with the implementation. IUP served as the country's foremost institute for higher learning, but also as its highest educational authority.[7] William Alexander Parsons Martin was appointed as the first president.[8] Most of the reforms were abolished when the conservative Empress Dowager Cixi seized power on 21 September. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn June 29, 2020, the Sino-Russian Mathematics Center was established.[14] The Sino-Russian Mathematics Center is led by Peking University and Moscow State University, and jointly constructed by relevant domestic units and other Russian universities and research institutes such as St. Petersburg University, relying on the \u201cDouble First-class\u201d construction alliance in mathematics.[15]\n\n\nOn April 2, 2021, Peking University Nanchang Innovation Research Institute was inaugurated.[16]\n\n\nOn July 15, 2021, Peking University School of Integrated Circuits\u00a0was inaugurated.[17]\n\n\nIn July 2021, the College of Future Technology at Peking University\u00a0was officially inaugurated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nProject 211\n |\n| --- |\n| **Higher education and universities in China**\n |\n| Beijing | * Agricultural\n* Beihang\n* Beijing Jiaotong\n* Central Music\n* Central Finance and Economics\n* Chemical Technology\n* Communication\n* Geosciences\n* Chinese Medicine\n* International Business and Economics\n* Minzu\n* Normal\n* Union Medical\n* Petroleum\n* Peking\n* Mining\n* Political Science and Law\n* Renmin\n* Posts\n* Science and Technology\n* Technology\n* Tsinghua\n* Foreign Studies\n* Forestry\n* University of Technology\n |\n| Tianjin | * Medical\n* Nankai\n* Tianjin\n |\n| Hebei | * Technology\n |\n| Shanxi | * Taiyuan Technology\n |\n| Inner Mongolia | * Inner Mongolia\n |\n| Liaoning | * Dalian Maritime\n* Dalian Technology\n* Liaoning\n* Northeastern\n |\n| Jilin | * Jilin\n* Northeast Normal\n* Yanbian\n |\n| Heilongjiang | * Harbin Engineering\n* Harbin Technology\n* Northeast Agricultural\n* Northeast Forestry\n |\n| Shanghai | * Donghua\n* East China Normal\n* East China Science and Technology\n* Fudan\n* Naval Medical\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPlan 111\n |\n| --- |\n| **Higher education and universities in China**\n |\n| Beijing (24) | * Agricultural\n* Beihang\n* Beijing Jiaotong\n* Chinese Medicine\n* Communication\n* Chemical Technology\n* Finance and Economics\n* Forestry\n* Geosciences\n* Information ST\n* Mining and Technology\n* Normal\n* Peking\n* Petroleum\n* Posts and Telecommunications\n* Political Science and Law\n* Renmin\n* Science and Technology\n* Minzu\n* Union Medical\n* Tsinghua\n |\n| Tianjin (4) | * Nankai\n* Tianjin\n* Traditional Chinese Medicine\n* Technology\n |\n| Inner Mongolia (1) | * Inner Mongolia\n |\n| Liaoning (3) | * Dalian Technology\n* Northeastern\n* Dalian Maritime\n |\n| Jilin (4) | * Jilin\n* Northeast Normal\n* Changchun ST\n |\n| Heilongjiang (4) | * Harbin Technology\n* Harbin Engineering\n* Northeast Forestry\n* Northeast Agricultural\n |\n| Shanghai (10) | * Donghua\n* East China Normal\n* East China ST\n* Fudan\n* Finance and Economics\n* Normal\n* Shanghai Jiaotong\n* Shanghai\n* Tongji\n* Traditional Chinese Medicine\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2020 CWTS Leiden Ranking ranked Peking University at 8th in the world based on their publications for the time period 2015\u20132018.[47] For the high quality of research in natural science and life science, Peking University ranked 10th among the leading institutions, and 6th among the leading universities globally in the *Nature Index 2022 Annual Tables* by Nature Research.[48] In 2020, it ranked 13th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[63]\n\n\nAs of 2021, it was ranked 8th globally in \"Education\", 12th in \"Engineering and Technology\", 15th in \"Physical Science\", 17th in \"Computer Science\", 18th in \"Social Science\", 19th in \"Life Science\", 21st in \"Arts and Humanities\", 22nd in \"Business and Economics\", 22nd in \"Clinical, pre-clinical and Health\" and 45th in \"Psychology\" by the *Times Higher Education Rankings by Subjects*.[64][65]\n\n\n\n### Schools and Institutes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"A destination to be explored\".
