The exact land area is sometimes challenged by border disputes, most notably about Taiwan, Aksai Chin, the Trans-Karakoram Tract, and South Tibet. The area of the People's Republic of China is 9,596,960\u00a0km2 (3,705,410\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) according to the CIA's *The World Factbook*.[1] The People's Republic of China is either the third or fourth-largest country in the world, being either slightly larger or slightly smaller than the United States, depending on how the area of the United States is measured. Both countries are smaller than Russia and Canada and larger than Brazil.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouth China Sea by Hainan.\n![](image)\nLuoping in Yunnan.\n\n\n## Physical geography[edit]\n\n\n### Generalities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe security and strength of the Chinese borders vary depending on the location of the section of the border in question. This is due to the nature of the borders as well as the physical geography of the country. China has a large territory, about the same size as the United States, but the actual distribution of population is highly disproportionate. Sixty percent of the population live on the east coast of China which is only 22 percent of its territory while the other 78 percent lying inland is sparsely populated with ethnic minorities such as Tibetans, Kazakhs, Uighurs, and other Chinese Muslim groups. Many of these groups have little to no loyalty to the central government of China further adding to the strained security of China's borders. The regions of Xinjiang and Tibet in particular harbor strong separatist movements[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChina is a party to the Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, the Antarctic Treaty, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Climate Change treaty, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the Endangered Species treaty, the Hazardous Wastes treaty, the Law of the Sea, the International Tropical Timber Agreements of 1983 and 1994, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, and agreements on Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, and Wetlands protection. China has signed, but not ratified, the Kyoto Protocol (but is not yet required to reduce its carbon emission under the agreement, as is India) and the Nuclear Test Ban treaty.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChina's borders have more than 20,000\u00a0km (12,000\u00a0mi) of land frontier shared with nearly all the nations of mainland East Asia, and have been disputed at a number of points. In the western sector, China claimed portions of the 41,000\u00a0km2 (16,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) Pamir Mountains area, a region of soaring mountain peaks and glacier-filled valleys where the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union, and China meet in Central Asia. North and east of this region, some sections of the border remained undemarcated in 1987. The 6,542 kilometres (4,065\u00a0mi) frontier with the Soviet Union has been a source of continual friction. In 1954 China published maps showing substantial portions of Soviet Siberian territory as its own. In the northeast, border friction with the Soviet Union produced a tense situation in remote regions of Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang along segments of the Argun River, Amur River, and Ussuri River. Each side had massed troops and had exchanged charges of border provocation in this area. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Afghanistan\n* Armenia\n* Azerbaijan\n* Bahrain\n* Bangladesh\n* Bhutan\n* Brunei\n* Cambodia\n* China\n* Cyprus\n* East Timor (Timor-Leste)\n* Egypt\n* Georgia\n* India\n* Indonesia\n* Iran\n* Iraq\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Jordan\n* Kazakhstan\n* North Korea\n* South Korea\n* Kuwait\n* Kyrgyzstan\n* Laos\n* Lebanon\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Mongolia\n* Myanmar\n* Nepal\n* Oman\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Qatar\n* Russia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n* Sri Lanka\n* Syria\n* Tajikistan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* Turkmenistan\n* United Arab Emirates\n* Uzbekistan\n* Vietnam\n* Yemen\n |\n| States withlimited recognition | * Abkhazia\n* Northern Cyprus\n* Palestine\n* South Ossetia\n* Taiwan\n |\n| Dependencies andother territories | * British Indian Ocean Territory\n* Christmas Island\n* Cocos (Keeling) Islands\n* Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Asia portal\n |\n\nPortals:* ![icon](image) Geography\n* ![flag](image) China\n\n35\u00b000\u2032N 105\u00b000\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff35.000\u00b0N 105.000\u00b0E\ufeff / 35.000; 105.000\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to the World Bank, as of 2015, China's total arable land was estimated at 119,000,000 hectares.[11] Since 2005, arable land in China has been on the decline and the total arable land per citizen has reached .2 acres.[12] As a percentage, agricultural land makes up about 54.7% of land. The climate of the country is difficult to describe because it varies so much depending on the region of China. The southernmost parts of the country are almost tropical, while the northernmost part is subarctic.[13]\n\n*Click any region for more info.

About 1.3% (some 116,580\u00a0km\u00b2) is planted to permanent crops and the rest planted to temporary crops. With comparatively little land planted to permanent crops, intensive agricultural techniques are used to reap harvests that are sufficient to feed the world's largest population and still have surplus for export. An estimated 544,784\u00a0km\u00b2 of land were irrigated in 2004. 42.9% of total land area was used as pasture, and 17.5% was forest.\n\n\n\n### Wildlife[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNorth of the Himalayas and east of the Karakorum/Pamirs is the vast Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest and highest plateau in the world, and for this reason is also informally known as the \"Roof of the World\". Its average elevation is 4000 meters above sea level. Its area is 2.5 million square kilometers which is just over a quarter of China's total area. In the north, the plateau is hemmed in by the Kunlun Mountains, which extends eastward from the intersection of the Pamirs, Karakorum and Tian Shan.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChina is involved in a complex dispute with Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, and possibly Brunei over the Spratly (Nansha) Islands in the South China Sea. The 2002 \"Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea\" eased tensions but fell short of a legally binding code of conduct desired by several of the disputants. China also controls the Paracel (Xisha) Islands, which are also claimed by Vietnam, and asserts a claim to the Japanese-administered Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands in the East China Sea.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Natural resources | coal, iron ore, petroleum, natural gas, mercury, tin, tungsten, antimony, manganese, molybdenum, vanadium, magnetite, aluminum, lead, zinc, rare earth elements, uranium, hydropower potential, arable land[1] |\n| Natural hazards | typhoons; damaging floods; tsunamis; earthquakes; droughts; land subsidence[1] |\n| Environmental issues | air pollution; water shortages; water pollution; deforestation; soil erosion; desertification; trade in endangered species[1] |\n\n\nGeography and climates of China\n![](image)\nSatellite imagery of China\n![](image)\nLongsheng Rice Terraces\n![](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSouth China Sea: On 16 June 2011, the Chinese government sent out one of its largest patrol ships known as the Haixun-31 which the Chinese government describe as routine. The ship will pass the Paracel and Spratly Islands and make its way up from the Malaysian to Filipino coast. Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia all have competing claims to the Spratlys Islands while Beijing and Hanoi are in dispute over the Paracel islands. Hanoi has proposed a multilateral solution between the Asian countries but China says that it prefers to negotiate with individual states separately.[16]\n\n\n\n#### Border security[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"China sends ship to disputed sea\". *BBC News*. 16 June 2011.

In the wake of the 1960s Sino-Soviet split, and for 25 years after the split, the border between China and Russia was one of the most unfriendly borders in the world. At one point over \"one and a half million troops armed with nuclear weapons\" were installed along the two sides of the border. Relations improved in the mid 1980s but this is due to Russia's decrease in power and threat to the Chinese government.[14]\n\n\nDue to China's ancient history and central location in the geography of Asia, it is surrounded by potential enemies and many complicated rivalries. The government plays the fine line between domination and cooperation in order to preserve their national identity and borders. However, due to the nature of their political geography, the borders are very much volatile and disputes continue to exist in different areas of the border.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Islamic population, consisting mostly of Hui and Uighur Muslims, is concentrated in the northwestern Xinjiang region of the country which shares borders with Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Russia.[8]\n\n\n\n### Administrative geography[edit]\n\n\nChinese administrative geography was drawn mainly during the 1949 and 1954 administrative reorganizations. These reorganizations have been the source of much debate within China. In addition, a parcel of land was ceded from Guangdong to Guangxi to grant the latter immediate access to the Gulf of Tonkin, while Hainan was split from Guangdong in 1988 and Chongqing from Sichuan in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

This double structure (*r\u00e9gion*/**d\u00e9partement**) is new, due to the recent extension of the regional scheme to the overseas d\u00e9partements, and may soon transform into a single structure, with the merger of the regional and departmental assemblies. Another proposed change is that new *d\u00e9partements* are created such as in the case of R\u00e9union, where it has been proposed to create a second **d\u00e9partement** in the south of the island, with the *r\u00e9gion* of R\u00e9union above these two *d\u00e9partements*.\n* Four overseas collectivities (*collectivit\u00e9s d'outre-mer*, or *COM*): Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, and Wallis and Futuna.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![Forest in Solli\u00e8res-Sardi\u00e8res (Natura 2000 site).](image)\n\nForest in Solli\u00e8res-Sardi\u00e8res (Natura 2000 site).\n* ![Calanques National Park in Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne](image)\n\nCalanques National Park in Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne\n* ![Mont Blanc, the highest summit in Western Europe](image)\n\nMont Blanc, the highest summit in Western Europe\n* ![\u00c9tang de Lavalduc, the lowest point in France](image)\n\n\u00c9tang de Lavalduc, the lowest point in France\n\n\n## Political geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Significant remaining forested areas are in the Gascony region and north in the Alsace-Ardennes area. The Ardennes Forest was the scene of extensive fighting in both world wars.\n\n\nThe north central part of this region is dominated by the Paris Basin, which consists of a layered sequence of sedimentary rocks. Fertile soils over much of the area make good agricultural land. The Normandy coast to the northwest is characterized by high, chalk cliffs, while the Brittany coast (the peninsula to the west) is highly indented where deep valleys were drowned by the sea, and the Biscay coast to the southwest is marked by flat, sandy beaches.\n\n\nA recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,433\u00a0km2 of tidal flats in France, making it the 23rd ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.[2]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGeography of France| ![](image) |\n| Continent | Europe |\n| Region | Western Europe |\n| Coordinates | 48\u00b051\u2032N 2\u00b021\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff48.850\u00b0N 2.350\u00b0E\ufeff / 48.850; 2.350 |\n| Area | Ranked 42nd |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 551,695\u00a0km2 (213,011\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Land | 99.48% |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Water | 0.52% |\n| Coastline | 3,427\u00a0km (2,129\u00a0mi) |\n| Borders | 4,176\u00a0km (2,595\u00a0mi) |\n| Highest point | Mont Blanc 4,808\u00a0m (15,774\u00a0ft) |\n| Lowest point | \u00c9tang de Lavalduc \u221210\u00a0m (\u221233\u00a0ft) |\n| Longest river | Loire 1,012\u00a0km (629\u00a0mi) |\n| Largest lake | Lac du Bourget 44.5\u00a0km (27.7\u00a0mi) |\n| Climate | Oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate (south), mountain climate (Alps and Pyrenees) |\n| Terrain | Plains and hills (north and west), mountainous (south) |\n| Natural resources | Coal, iron ore, bauxite, zinc, uranium, antimony, arsenic, potash, feldspar, fluorspar, gypsum, timber, fish, gold |\n| Natural hazards | Flooding, avalanches, midwinter windstorms, drought, forest fires (south) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Agriculture\n* Automotive industry\n* Banking\n\t+ Central bank\n* Economic history\n* Energy\n* Euro\n* Exports\n* Franc (former currency)\n* French subdivisions by GDP\n* Mining\n* Stock exchange\n* Science and technology\n* Taxation\n* Telecommunications\n* Tourism\n* Trade unions\n* Transport\n |\n\n |\n| Society | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Abortion\n* Birth control\n* Crime\n* Demographics\n* Education\n* Health care\n* Homelessness\n* Immigration\n* Life expectancy\n* People\n* Poverty\n* Religion\n\t+ secularism\n* Racism\n* Social class\n* Welfare\n |\n| Culture | * Anthem\n* Architecture\n* Art\n* Coat of arms\n* Cinema\n* Cuisine\n* Cultural icons\n* Fashion\n* Flag\n* Gardens\n* Language\n* Literature\n* Media\n* Music\n* Philosophy\n* Public holidays\n* Sport\n* Symbols\n* Theatre\n |\n\n |\n| * Outline\n* Category\n* Portal\n* WikiProject\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for France\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 45.9(114.6)\n | 43.9(111.0)\n | 44.1(111.4)\n | 38.0(100.4)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 45.9(114.6)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u221241.0(\u221241.8)\n | \u221235(\u221231)\n | \u221232.0(\u221225.6)\n | \u221219.0(\u22122.2)\n | \u221210(14)\n | \u22124.0(24.8)\n | \u22124.0(24.8)\n | \u22124.0(24.8)\n | \u22127.0(19.4)\n | \u221214.0(6.8)\n | \u221229.0(\u221220.2)\n | \u221237.0(\u221234.6)\n | \u221241.0(\u221241.8)\n |\n| Source: [4] |\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of fifteen largest French metropolitan areas by population\n* G\u00e9oportail\n* Institut g\u00e9ographique national\n\n\n**General:**\n\n\n\n* Geography of Europe\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOverview of the geography of France\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.
