LaGuardia High School) as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant.[27] The exam, named the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), tested the mathematical and verbal abilities of students who were applying to any of the specialized high schools. The only exception was for applicants to LaGuardia High School, who were accepted by audition rather than examination.[27]\n\n\n\n#### September 11 attacks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNew York City Department of Education\n |\n| --- |\n| * Panel for Educational Policy\n* Public Schools Athletic League\n* Tweed Courthouse\n* New York City School Construction Authority\n* Specialized High Schools Admissions Test\n |\n| Schools | * List of public elementary schools\n* List of high schools in The Bronx\n* List of high schools in Brooklyn\n* List of high schools in Manhattan\n* List of high schools in Queens\n* List of high schools in Staten Island\n* School of One\n* Empowerment Schools\n |\n| Specializedhigh schools | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| The Bronx | * Bronx HS of Science\n* HS of American Studies at Lehman College\n |\n| Brooklyn | * Brooklyn Latin\n* Brooklyn Technical HS\n |\n| Manhattan | * Fiorello H.

Operated by the New York City Department of Education, these specialized schools offer tuition-free accelerated academics to city residents. It is one of the most selective public high schools in New York City, New York State, and the United States.\n\n\nStuyvesant was established as an all-boys school in the East Village of Manhattan in 1904. An entrance examination was mandated for all applicants starting in 1934, and the school started accepting female students in 1969. Stuyvesant moved to its current location at Battery Park City in 1992 because the student body had become too large to be suitably accommodated in the original campus. The old building now houses several high schools.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** \"Stuyvesant High School\". New York City Department of Education. 2020.

All students studied a full set of courses. These double sessions ran until Spring 1957.[20][21] The school implemented a system of entrance examinations in 1934.[22] The examination program, developed with the assistance of Columbia University, was expanded in 1938 to include the newly founded Bronx High School of Science.[14]:\u200a5[22]\n\n\nIn 1956, a team of six students designed and began construction of a cyclotron. A low-power test of the device succeeded six years later. A later attempt at full-power operation, however, knocked out the power to the school and surrounding buildings.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### Co-educational school[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAll of these locations were named after Peter Stuyvesant,[16] the last Dutch governor of New Netherland and owner of the area's Stuyvesant Farm.[17]:\u200a4 The appellation was selected in order to avoid confusion with Brooklyn's Manual Training High School.[14]:\u200a8\n\n\n\n### Opening and boys' school[edit]\n\n\nStuyvesant High School opened in September 1904 as Manhattan's first manual trade school for boys.[14]:\u200a5 At the time of its opening, the school consisted of 155 students and 12 teachers.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEducation in Manhattan\n |\n| --- |\n| Includes Governors Island and Roosevelt Island\n |\n| Public schools | * 47 The American Sign Language and English Secondary School\n* Bard HS Early College Manhattan\n* Baruch College Campus HS\n* Beacon\n* Murry Bergtraum HS\n* Chelsea CATE HS\n* City-As-School HS\n* Clinton\n* Columbia SS\n* East Side Community HS\n* HS for Environmental Studies\n* HS for Health Professions and Human Services\n* HS for Math, Science and Engineering at City College\n* HS of Art and Design\n* HS of Economics and Finance\n* HS of Fashion Industries\n* HS of Graphic Comm Arts\n* Humanities Prep Acad\n* Hunter College HS\n* Innovation Diploma Plus HS\n* Washington Irving Campus\n* Martin Luther King Jr. Educational Campus\n* Fiorello H.

Enrollment is based solely on performance on the three-hour Specialized High Schools Admissions Test,[68]:\u200a25 which is administered annually. Approximately 28,000 students took the test in 2017.[68]:\u200a10 The list of schools using the SHSAT has since grown to include eight of New York's nine specialized high schools. The test score necessary for admission to Stuyvesant has consistently been higher than that needed for admission to the other schools using the test.[69] Admission is currently based on an individual's score on the examination and the pre-submitted ranking of Stuyvesant among the other specialized schools. Ninth- and rising tenth\u2013grade students are also eligible to take the test for enrollment, but far fewer students are admitted that way.[70] The test covers math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension) skills. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn January 1903, Maxwell and Snyder submitted a report to the New York City Board of Education in which they suggested the creation of a trade school in Manhattan.[15] The Board of Education approved the plans in April 1904. They suggested that the school occupy a plot on East 15th Street, west of First Avenue. However, that plot did not yet contain a school building, and so the new trade school was initially housed within PS\u00a047's former building at 225 East 23rd Street.[14]:\u200a4 The Board of Education also wrote that the new trade school would be \"designated as the Stuyvesant High School, as being reminiscent of the locality.\"[14] Stuyvesant Square, Stuyvesant Street, and later Stuyvesant Town (which was built in 1947) are all located near the proposed 15th Street school building. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant. The exam would become known as the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) and tested students in Math and English. With its statewide recognition, the school had to become co-educational. Previous to this, Brooklyn Tech was All Boys, and had a sister school, Bay Ridge High School which was all girls.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNew York City Department of Education\n |\n| --- |\n| * Panel for Educational Policy\n* Public Schools Athletic League\n* Tweed Courthouse\n* New York City School Construction Authority\n* Specialized High Schools Admissions Test\n |\n| Schools | * List of public elementary schools\n* List of high schools in The Bronx\n* List of high schools in Brooklyn\n* List of high schools in Manhattan\n* List of high schools in Queens\n* List of high schools in Staten Island\n* School of One\n* Empowerment Schools\n |\n| Specializedhigh schools | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| The Bronx | * Bronx HS of Science\n* HS of American Studies at Lehman College\n |\n| Brooklyn | * Brooklyn Latin\n* Brooklyn Technical HS\n |\n| Manhattan | * Fiorello H.

As a public school, BTHS has no tuition fee, but only students who reside in New York City are allowed to attend, as per the Hecht-Calandra Act.[a]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Admissions | Competitive Examination |\n| Website | bths.edu |\n\n\n**Brooklyn Technical High School**, commonly called **Brooklyn Tech** and administratively designated **High School 430**, is a public high school in New York City that specializes in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It is one of the three original specialized high schools operated by the New York City Department of Education, along with Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx High School of Science. Brooklyn Tech is considered one of the country's most prestigious and selective high schools.[4][5]\n\n\nAdmission to Brooklyn Tech involves taking the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test and scoring the cutoff for Brooklyn Tech. Each November, about 30,000 eighth and ninth graders take the 3-hour test for admittance to eight of the nine specialized high schools. About 1,400 to 1,500 students are admitted each year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1918, Dr. Albert L. Colston, chair of the Math Department at Manual Training High School, recommended establishing a technical high school for Brooklyn boys. His plan envisioned a heavy concentration of math, science, and drafting courses with parallel paths leading either to college or to a technical career in industry. By 1922, Dr. Colston's concept was approved by the Board of Education, and Brooklyn Technical High School opened in a converted warehouse at 49 Flatbush Avenue Extension, with 2,400 students. This location, in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge, is the reason the school seal bears that bridge's image, rather than the more obvious symbol for the borough, the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Tech would occupy one more location before settling into its site at 29 Fort Greene Place, for which the groundbreaking was held in 1930.[17]\n\n\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"BTHS Homepage (numbers found at bottom)\".

The curriculum consists of two years of general studies with a technical and engineering emphasis, followed by two years of a student-chosen major.\n\n\nThe curriculum remained largely unchanged until the end of Dr. Colston's 20-year term as principal in 1942. Upon his retirement, Tech was led briefly by acting principal Ralph Breiling, who was succeeded by Principal Harold Taylor in 1944. Tech's modernization would come under Principal William Pabst, who assumed stewardship in 1946 after serving as chair of the Electrical Department. Pabst created new majors and refined older ones, allowing students to select science and engineering preparatory majors including Aeronautical, Architecture, Chemical, Civil, Electrical (later including Electronics and Broadcast), Industrial Design, Mechanical, Structural, and Arts and Sciences. A general College Preparatory curriculum was added later.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEducation in Brooklyn\n |\n| --- |\n| Public schools | * Public School 39\n* Acad for Excellence in Leadership\n* Acad of Urban Planning\n* Benjamin Banneker Acad\n* Clara Barton HS\n* Boys and Girls HS\n* Brooklyn Acad of Science and the Environment\n* Brooklyn College Acad\n* Brooklyn Democracy Acad\n* Brooklyn Frontiers HS\n* Brooklyn HS of the Arts\n* Brooklyn Int'l HS\n* Brooklyn Latin\n* Brooklyn Prep HS\n* Brooklyn Technical HS\n* Bushwick Leaders HS for Academic Excellence\n* Bushwick School for Social Justice\n* Roy Campanella OTC\n* Rachel Carson HS for Coastal Studies\n* John Dewey HS\n* El Puente Acad for Peace and Justice\n* Fort Hamilton HS\n* Khalil Gibran Int'l Acad\n* Leon M.
