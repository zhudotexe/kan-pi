It is organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member states, with the presiding state setting the group's priorities and hosting the summit; Japan presides for 2023.[5] While lacking a legal or institutional basis, the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international influence;[6] it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives, including efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to developing countries, and address climate change through the 2015 Paris Agreement.[6][1][7] However, the group has been criticized by observers for its allegedly outdated and limited membership, narrow global representation, and ineffectualness.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the G7 broadened its areas of concern to include issues of international security, human rights, and global security; for example, during this period, the G7 concerned itself with the ongoing Iran-Iraq War and Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.[48] In the 1990s, it launched a debt-relief program for the 42 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC);[50] provided $300 million to help build the Shelter Structure over the damaged reactor at Chernobyl;[51] and established the Financial Stability Forum to help in \"managing the international monetary system\".[52]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in North America](image)![2nd](image)\n2nd\n![7th](image)\n7th\n![9th](image)\n9th\n![14th](image)\n14th\n![16th](image)\n16th\n![21st](image)\n21st\n![23rd](image)\n23rd\n![28th](image)\n28th\n![30th](image)\n30th\n![36th](image)\n36th\n![38th](image)\n38th\n![44th](image)\n44th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in North America\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"What is the G7?\". *G7 UK Presidency 2021*.

The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth,[130] but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index.[20] As of 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth;[131] including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.[131]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOriginating from an *ad hoc* gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.[4] Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's Commission President and European Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDefence ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Blair\n* ![](image) Lecornu\n* ![](image) Pistorius\n* ![](image) Crosetto\n* ![](image) Kihara\n* ![](image) Shapps\n* ![](image) Austin\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nInterior ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Canada](image) LeBlanc\n* ![France](image) Darmanin\n* ![Germany](image) Faeser\n* ![Italy](image) Piantedosi\n* ![Japan](image) Suzuki\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Cleverly\n* ![United States](image) Mayorkas\n* ![European Union](image) Johansson\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJustice ministers of the Group of Seven\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image) Virani\n* ![](image) Dupond-Moretti\n* ![](image) Buschmann\n* ![](image) Nordio\n* ![](image) Koizumi\n* ![](image) Chalk\n* ![](image) Garland\n* ![](image) Reynders\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2023, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida invited South Korea, Australia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, Comoros (representing the African Union), the Cook Islands (representing the Pacific Islands Forum) and Ukraine to the 49th summit hosted in Hiroshima.[41][42][43][44][45][46]\n\n\n\n## Activities and initiatives[edit]\n\n\n![G7 is located in Europe](image)![1st](image)\n1st\n![3rd, 10th, 17th](image)\n3rd, 10th, 17th\n![4th, 11th](image)\n4th, 11th\n![6th, 13th](image)\n6th, 13th\n![8th](image)\n8th\n![15th](image)\n15th\n![18th](image)\n18th\n![20th](image)\n20th\n![22nd](image)\n22nd\n![24th](image)\n24th\n![25th](image)\n25th\n![27th](image)\n27th\n![29th](image)\n29th\n![31st](image)\n31st\n![32nd](image)\n32nd\n![33rd](image)\n33rd\n![35th](image)\n35th\n![37th](image)\n37th\n![39th](image)\n39th\n![40th](image)\n40th\n![41st](image)\n41st\n![43rd'](image)\n43rd'\n![45th](image)\n45th\n![47th](image)\n47th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Europe\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 44th | 8\u20139 June 2018 | ![](image)\u00a0Canada[104] | Justin Trudeau | La Malbaie, Qu\u00e9bec (Charlevoix)[105] | The summit took place at the Manoir Richelieu. Prime Minister Trudeau announced five themes for Canada's G7 presidency, which began in January 2018. Climate, along with commerce trades, was one of the main themes. \"*Working together on climate change, oceans and clean energy*.\"[106] The final statement contained 28 points. US President Donald Trump did not agree to the economic section of the final statement.[107] The G7 members also announced to recall sanctions and to be ready to take further restrictive measures against Russian Federation for its failure to implement the Minsk Protocol completely.[108] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere have been various proposals to expand the G7. The U.S.-based Atlantic Council has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from what it calls \"leading democracies\" which support a \"rules-based democratic order\", consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union) plus Australia and South Korea. Several democratic countries\u00a0\u2013 including India, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain\u00a0\u2013 participate as observers.[29] Centered around a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some analysts to be an alternative to the group;[30] This is also favored by various think tanks and former British leader Boris Johnson.[29]\n\n\nIn 2019 under Putin, Russia had signaled support for the inclusion of China, India, and Turkey if the G7 had reinstated Russian membership.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Flags of G7 members as seen on University Avenue, Toronto (September 2016)\nUntil the 1985 Plaza Accord, meetings between the seven governments' finance ministers were not public knowledge. The Accord, which involved only the original Group of Five, was announced the day before it was finalized, with a communiqu\u00e9 issued afterward.[19] The 1980s also marked the G7's expanded concerns beyond macroeconomic issues, namely with respect to international security and conflict; for example, it sought to address the ongoing conflicts between Iran and Iraq and between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Where Is the G7 Headed?\". *Council on Foreign Relations*.
