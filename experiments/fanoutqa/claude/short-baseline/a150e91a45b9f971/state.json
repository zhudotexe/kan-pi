It rose to dominate the personal computer operating system market with MS-DOS in the mid-1980s, followed by Windows. The company's 1986 initial public offering (IPO) and subsequent rise in its share price created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000\u00a0millionaires among Microsoft employees. Since the 1990s, it has increasingly diversified from the operating system market and has made several corporate acquisitions, the largest being the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion in October 2023,[3] followed by its acquisition of LinkedIn for $26.2\u00a0billion in December 2016,[4] and its acquisition of Skype Technologies for $8.5\u00a0billion in May 2011.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Microsoft Corporation** is an American multinational technology corporation headquartered in Redmond, Washington.
