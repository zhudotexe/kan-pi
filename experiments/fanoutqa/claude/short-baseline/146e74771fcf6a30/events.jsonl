It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of $9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** \"Hurley stepping down as YouTube chief executive\".

After Google's acquisition of YouTube, the CEO role was retained. Salar Kamangar took over Hurley's position and held the job until 2014. He was replaced by Susan Wojcicki, who later resigned in 2023.[95] The current CEO is Neal Mohan, who was appointed on February 16, 2023.[95]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\n### Video technology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2006, YouTube was bought by Google for $1.65 billion.[12] Google's ownership of YouTube expanded the site's business model, expanding from generating revenue from advertisements alone to offering paid content such as movies and exclusive content produced by YouTube. It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of $9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** \"Hurley stepping down as YouTube chief executive\".
