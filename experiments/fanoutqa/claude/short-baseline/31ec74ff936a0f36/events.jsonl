Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGS*Variety* put the worldwide rental for *The Greatest Show on Earth* at around $18.35 million (with $12.8 million coming from the United States[53]) a year after its release; however, Birchard puts its earnings at just over $15 million up to 1962.

Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time.

He said, \"While *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[295] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to \"try to topple *Titanic* off its perch\" because it \"just struck some kind of chord\" and there had been other good films in recent years.[296] He changed his prediction by mid-January. \"It's gonna happen.
