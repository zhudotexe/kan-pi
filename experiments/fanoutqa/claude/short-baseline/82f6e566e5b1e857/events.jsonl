It was the third time, and the second in a row, that three players were selected from Serbian team KK Mega Basket in the same draft (Vlatko Čančar, Ognjen Jaramaz, Alpha Kaba), with it previously occurring during the 2014 and 2016 NBA draft. The draft also received much media coverage from ESPN pertaining to eventual second overall pick Lonzo Ball and his outspoken father, LaVar Ball, much to the chagrin of many sports fans and even some ESPN employees. This was one of the rare occasions where a player drafted from their year did not win Rookie of the Year; the award went to 2016 first overall pick Ben Simmons, the first player since Blake Griffin in 2011 to win the award in a year he was not drafted.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Draft selections[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe NBA annually invites around 15–20 players to sit in the so-called \"green room\", a special room set aside at the draft site for the invited players plus their families and agents. When their names are called, the player leaves the room and goes up on stage. Other players who are not invited are allowed to attend the ceremony. They sit in the stands with the fans and walk up on stage when (or if) they are drafted.[77] 10 players were invited to the 2017 NBA draft on June 8, with three more of them being invited two days later.[78] Seven more players would be invited to complete the green room listing on June 14, bringing the total invite list to 20.

The 53–29 Boston Celtics, who were also the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference and reached the Eastern Conference Finals at the time of the NBA draft lottery, won the #1 pick with pick swapping rights thanks to a previous trade with the Brooklyn Nets, who had the worst record the previous season. The Los Angeles Lakers, who had risked losing their 2017 first round pick to the Philadelphia 76ers, moved up two spots to get the Second overall pick, while Philadelphia moved up to receive the No. 3 pick due to the Sacramento Kings moving up in the draft, which activated pick swapping rights the 76ers had from an earlier trade. On June 19, four days before the NBA draft began, the Celtics and 76ers traded their top first round picks to each other, meaning the holders of the top four picks of this year's draft would be exactly the same as the previous year's draft.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2017–18 NBA season by team\n |\n| --- |\n| * Draft\n* Summer League\n* All-Star Game\n* Playoffs\n* Finals\n* Transactions\n* G League\n |\n| Eastern | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic | * Boston\n* Brooklyn\n* New York\n* Philadelphia\n* Toronto\n |\n| Central | * Chicago\n* *Cleveland*\n* Detroit\n* Indiana\n* Milwaukee\n |\n| Southeast | * Atlanta\n* Charlotte\n* Miami\n* Orlando\n* Washington\n |\n\n |\n| Western | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Northwest | * Denver\n* Minnesota\n* Oklahoma City\n* Portland\n* Utah\n |\n| Pacific | * **Golden State**\n* L.A.

At the end of the international deadline, 36 players wound up declining entry for the draft, leaving only 10 international players staying in the NBA Draft.

It was the third time, and the second in a row, that three players were selected from Serbian team KK Mega Basket in the same draft (Vlatko Čančar, Ognjen Jaramaz, Alpha Kaba), with it previously occurring during the 2014 and 2016 NBA draft. The draft also received much media coverage from ESPN pertaining to eventual second overall pick Lonzo Ball and his outspoken father, LaVar Ball, much to the chagrin of many sports fans and even some ESPN employees. This was one of the rare occasions where a player drafted from their year did not win Rookie of the Year; the award went to 2016 first overall pick Ben Simmons, the first player since Blake Griffin in 2011 to win the award in a year he was not drafted.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Draft selections[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe NBA annually invites around 15–20 players to sit in the so-called \"green room\", a special room set aside at the draft site for the invited players plus their families and agents. When their names are called, the player leaves the room and goes up on stage. Other players who are not invited are allowed to attend the ceremony. They sit in the stands with the fans and walk up on stage when (or if) they are drafted.[77] 10 players were invited to the 2017 NBA draft on June 8, with three more of them being invited two days later.[78] Seven more players would be invited to complete the green room listing on June 14, bringing the total invite list to 20.

The 53–29 Boston Celtics, who were also the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference and reached the Eastern Conference Finals at the time of the NBA draft lottery, won the #1 pick with pick swapping rights thanks to a previous trade with the Brooklyn Nets, who had the worst record the previous season. The Los Angeles Lakers, who had risked losing their 2017 first round pick to the Philadelphia 76ers, moved up two spots to get the Second overall pick, while Philadelphia moved up to receive the No. 3 pick due to the Sacramento Kings moving up in the draft, which activated pick swapping rights the 76ers had from an earlier trade. On June 19, four days before the NBA draft began, the Celtics and 76ers traded their top first round picks to each other, meaning the holders of the top four picks of this year's draft would be exactly the same as the previous year's draft.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2017–18 NBA season by team\n |\n| --- |\n| * Draft\n* Summer League\n* All-Star Game\n* Playoffs\n* Finals\n* Transactions\n* G League\n |\n| Eastern | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Atlantic | * Boston\n* Brooklyn\n* New York\n* Philadelphia\n* Toronto\n |\n| Central | * Chicago\n* *Cleveland*\n* Detroit\n* Indiana\n* Milwaukee\n |\n| Southeast | * Atlanta\n* Charlotte\n* Miami\n* Orlando\n* Washington\n |\n\n |\n| Western | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Northwest | * Denver\n* Minnesota\n* Oklahoma City\n* Portland\n* Utah\n |\n| Pacific | * **Golden State**\n* L.A.

Initially, there were 46 players who originally expressed interest entering the 2017 draft. At the end of the international deadline, 36 players wound up declining entry for the draft, leaving only 10 international players staying in the NBA Draft. As a result, 73 total underclassmen entered the 2017 NBA Draft.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 56\n | Jabari Bird | SG\n | ![](image) United States\n | Boston Celtics (from L.A.
