Many of the authors had read Christie's novels first, before other mystery writers, in English or in their native language, influencing their own writing, and nearly all still viewed her as the \"Queen of Crime\" and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors. Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie's mysteries and found her books still good to read nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Just one of the 25 authors held with Wilson's views.[163]\n\n\n\n### Book sales[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChristie is one of the most-borrowed authors in UK libraries.[172][173][174][175] She is also the UK's best-selling spoken-book author.

Tolkien.[176][177] In 2015, the Christie estate claimed *And Then There Were None* was \"the best-selling crime novel of all time\",[178] with approximately 100 million sales, also making it one of the highest-selling books of all time.[132][179] More than two million copies of her books were sold in English in 2020.[180]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* William Shakespeare's works: *Sad Cypress*, *By the Pricking of My Thumbs*, *There is a Tide\u00a0...*, *Absent in the Spring*, and *The Mousetrap*, for example.

G. Wells and Hugo Gernsback.[7] In the 2010s, he was the most translated French author in the world. In France, 2005 was declared \"Jules Verne Year\" on the occasion of the centenary of the writer's death.\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTranslation of Verne into English began in 1852, when Verne's short story *A Voyage in a Balloon* (1851) was published in the American journal *Sartain's Union Magazine of Literature and Art* in a translation by Anne T. Wilbur.[112] Translation of his novels began in 1869 with William Lackland's translation of *Five Weeks in a Balloon* (originally published in 1863),[113] and continued steadily throughout Verne's lifetime, with publishers and hired translators often working in great haste to rush his most lucrative titles into English-language print.[114] Unlike Hetzel, who targeted all ages with his publishing strategies for the *Voyages extraordinaires*, the British and American publishers of Verne chose to market his books almost exclusively to young audiences; this business move, with its implication that Verne could be treated purely as a children's author, had a long-lasting effect on Verne's reputation in English-speaking countries.[110][115]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese early English-language translations have been widely criticized for their extensive textual omissions, errors, and alterations, and are not considered adequate representations of Verne's actual novels.[114][116][117] In an essay for *The Guardian*, British writer Adam Roberts commented: \"I'd always liked reading Jules Verne and I've read most of his novels; but it wasn't until recently that I really understood I hadn't been reading Jules Verne at all ... It's a bizarre situation for a world-famous writer to be in. Indeed, I can't think of a major writer who has been so poorly served by translation.\"[116]\n\n\nSimilarly, the American novelist Michael Crichton observed:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> Verne's prose is lean and fast-moving in a peculiarly modern way ... [but] Verne has been particularly ill-served by his English translators. At best they have provided us with clunky, choppy, tone-deaf prose. At worst \u2013 as in the notorious 1872 \"translation\" [of *Journey to the Center of the Earth*] published by Griffith & Farran \u2013 they have blithely altered the text, giving Verne's characters new names, and adding whole pages of their own invention, thus effectively obliterating the meaning and tone of Verne's original.[117]\n> \n> \n\n\nSince 1965, a considerable number of more accurate English translations of Verne have appeared. However, the older, deficient translations continue to be republished due to their public domain status, and in many cases their easy availability in online sources.[110]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with science fiction[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Monument to Verne in Redondela, Spain\nVerne's novels have had a wide influence on both literary and scientific works; writers known to have been influenced by Verne include Marcel Aym\u00e9, Roland Barthes, Ren\u00e9 Barjavel, Michel Butor, Blaise Cendrars, Paul Claudel, Jean Cocteau, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, Rick Riordan, Raymond Roussel, Claude Roy, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, and Jean-Paul Sartre,[124] while scientists and explorers who acknowledged Verne's inspiration have included Richard E. Byrd, Yuri Gagarin, Simon Lake, Hubert Lyautey, Guglielmo Marconi, Fridtjof Nansen, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Wernher von Braun,[109] and Jack Parsons.[125] Verne is credited with helping inspire the steampunk genre, a literary and social movement that glamorizes science fiction based on 19th-century technology.[126][127]\n\n\nRay Bradbury summarized Verne's influence on literature and science the world over by saying: \"We are all, in one way or another, the children of Jules Verne.\"[128]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nVerne's reputation in English-speaking countries has been considerably slower in changing. Throughout the 20th century, most anglophone scholars dismissed Verne as a genre writer for children and a na\u00efve proponent of science and technology (despite strong evidence to the contrary on both counts), thus finding him more interesting as a technological \"prophet\" or as a subject of comparison to English-language writers such as Edgar Allan Poe and H. G. Wells than as a topic of literary study in his own right. This narrow view of Verne has undoubtedly been influenced by the poor-quality English translations and very loosely adapted Hollywood film versions through which most American and British readers have discovered Verne.[5][109] However, since the mid-1980s a considerable number of serious English-language studies and translations have appeared, suggesting that a rehabilitation of Verne's anglophone reputation may currently be underway.[110][111]\n\n\n\n### English translations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Evans, Arthur B.

His son, Michel Verne, oversaw the publication of the novels *Invasion of the Sea* and *The Lighthouse at the End of the World* after Jules's death. The *Voyages extraordinaires* series continued for several years afterwards at the same rate of two volumes a year. It was later discovered that Michel Verne had made extensive changes in these stories,[3] and the original versions were eventually published at the end of the 20th century by the Jules Verne Society (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jules Verne). In 1919, Michel Verne published *The Barsac Mission* (French: *L'\u00c9tonnante Aventure de la Mission Barsac*), whose original drafts contained references to Esperanto,[90] a language that his father had been very interested in.[91][92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
