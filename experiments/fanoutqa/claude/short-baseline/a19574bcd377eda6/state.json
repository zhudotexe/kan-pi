Charles is the head of the House of Windsor. There is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member, although the Royal Household has issued different lists outlining who is a part of the royal family.[1][2] Members often support the monarch in undertaking public engagements, and pursue charitable work and interests. The royal family are regarded as British and world cultural icons.\n\n\n\n\n## Members[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: List of members of the House of Windsor\n\nFurther information: Family tree of the British royal family\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain's \"List of the Royal Family\" published in 2020 mentions all of King George VI's descendants and their spouses (including Sarah, Duchess of York, who is divorced), along with Queen Elizabeth II's cousins with royal rank and their spouses.[2] The Lord Chamberlain's list applies for the purposes of regulating the use of royal symbols and images of the family.[3] Meanwhile, the website of the royal family provides a list of \"Members of the Royal Family\"; those listed correspond to the royal family members mentioned and pictured below, with the exception of Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, the Duchess of Kent, and Prince Michael of Kent and his wife.[4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The core of the royal family is made up of King Charles III and Queen Camilla; William, Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales; Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh and Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh. They carry out royal duties full-time.[5]\n* Lower profile relatives who perform some duties are Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester and Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester; Prince Edward, Duke of Kent; and Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy.[5]\n* Other members of the royal family with royal rank who do not carry out official duties are Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis of Wales; Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex; Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet of Sussex; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; Princess Beatrice; Princess Eugenie; Katharine, Duchess of Kent; and Prince Michael and Princess Michael of Kent.[5]\n\n\n* ![The King and Queen](image)\n\nThe King and Queen\n* ![The Prince and Princess of Wales](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Royal Family\". royal.gov.uk.

Members of the royal family are members of the Church of England\nGiven the royal family's public role and activities, it is sometimes referred to by courtiers as \"The Firm\", a term that originated with George VI.[32][33] Members of the royal family are politically and commercially independent, avoiding conflict of interest with their public roles.[34] The royal family are considered British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the family among a group of people who they most associated with British culture.[35] Members are expected to promote British industry.[36] Royals are typically members of the Church of England, headed by the monarch. When in Scotland they attend the Church of Scotland as members and some have served as Lord High Commissioner to the Church of Scotland.[37][38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy tradition, wives of male members of the royal family share their husbands' title and style.[15] Princesses by marriage do not have the title prefixed to their own name[11] but to their husband's; for example, the wife of Prince Michael of Kent is Princess Michael of Kent.[15] Sons of monarchs are customarily given dukedoms upon marriage, and these peerage titles pass to their eldest sons.[15]\n\n\nMale-line descendants of King George V, including women until they marry, bear the surname Windsor. The surname of the male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II, except for women who marry, is Mountbatten-Windsor, reflecting the name taken by her Greek-born husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, upon his naturalisation. A surname is generally not needed by members of the royal family who are entitled to the titles of prince or princess and the style His or Her Royal Highness. Such individuals use surnames on official documents such as marriage registers.[16]\n\n\n\n## Public role[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"The Royal Family\". *royal.uk*.

Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace, which represented the Queen, the then Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge respectively, described these suggestions as \"overblown and unfounded claims\".[65]\n\n\n\n## Funding[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Finances of the British royal family\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Royal Family* (1969) is a celebrated and reverential BBC documentary made by Richard Cawston to accompany the investiture of the current Prince of Wales.
