In Houston, Bill O'Brien was his head coach before Fitzpatrick suffered a broken leg in 2014. \n\nIn 2015 with the Jets, Fitzpatrick was initially acquired to be the backup to Geno Smith, but became the starter after Smith suffered a broken jaw in a locker room incident. He went on to have his best statistical season as a pro under head coach Todd Bowles.\n\nThe complete list of head coaches for each team would require additional research as not all of this information was readily available in the search results, but we can confirm Todd Bowles (Jets), Bill O'Brien (Texans), and Chan Gailey (Bills) were among his head coaches during his career.",
