The epicentre was located in the Mishmi Hills. It is the strongest earthquake ever recorded on land and is tied with the 2012 Indian Ocean Earthquakes as the strongest Strike-slip earthquake to date.\n\n\nOccurring on a Tuesday evening at 7:39 pm Indian Standard Time, the earthquake was destructive in both Assam (India) and Tibet (China), and approximately 4,800 people were killed. The earthquake is notable as being the largest recorded quake caused by continental collision rather than subduction, and is also notable for the loud noises produced by the quake and reported throughout the region.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an attempt to further uncover the seismic history of Northeast India, field studies were conducted by scientists with the National Geophysical Research Institute and Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar. The study discovered signs of soil liquefaction including sills and sand volcanoes inside of at least twelve trenches in alluvial fans and on the Burhi Dihing River Valley that were formed by past seismic activity. Radiocarbon dating identified the deposits at roughly 500 years old, which would correspond with a recorded earthquake in 1548.[5]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earthquake occurred in the rugged mountainous areas between the Himalayas and the Hengduan Mountains. The earthquake was located just south of the McMahon Line between India and Tibet, and had devastating effects in both regions. This great earthquake has a calculated magnitude of 8.7 and is regarded as one of the most important since the introduction of seismological observing stations.\n\n\nIt was the sixth largest earthquake of the 20th century.[6] It is also the largest known earthquake to have not been caused by an oceanic subduction. Instead, this quake was caused by two continental plates colliding.\n\n\nAftershocks were numerous; many of them were of magnitude 6 and over and well enough recorded at distant stations for reasonably good epicentre location. From such data the Indian Seismological Service established an enormous geographical spread of this activity, from about 90 deg to 97 deg east longitude, with the epicentre of the great earthquake near the eastern margin.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Impact\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1950 Assam–Tibet earthquake had devastating effects on both Assam and Tibet. In Assam, 1,526 fatalities were recorded[7] and another 3,300 were reported in Tibet for a total of approximately 4,800 deaths.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAlterations of relief were brought about by many rock falls in the Mishmi Hills and surrounding forested regions. In the Abor Hills, 70 villages were destroyed with 156 casualties due to landslides. Landslides blocked the tributaries of the Brahmaputra. In the Dibang Valley, a landslide lake burst without causing damage, but another at Subansiri River opened after an interval of 8 days and the wave, 7 m (23 ft) high, submerged several villages and killed 532 people.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe shock was more damaging in Assam, in terms of property loss, than the earthquake of 1897. In addition to the extreme shaking, there were floods when the rivers rose high after the earthquake bringing down sand, mud, trees, and all kinds of debris. Pilots flying over the meizoseismal area reported great changes in topography. This was largely due to enormous landslides, some of which were photographed.\n\n\nIn Tibet, Heinrich Harrer reported strong shaking in Lhasa and loud cracking noises from the earth.[8] Aftershocks were felt in Lhasa for days. In Rima, Tibet (modern-day Zayü Town), Frank Kingdon-Ward, noted violent shaking, extensive slides, and the rise of the streams.[9] Helen Myers Morse, an American missionary living in Putao, northern Burma at the time, wrote letters home describing the main shake, the numerous aftershocks, and of the noise coming out of the earth.[10]\n\n\nOne of the more westerly aftershocks, a few days later, was felt more extensively in Assam than the main shock. This led certain journalists to the belief that the later shock was 'bigger' and must be the greatest earthquake of all time. This is a typical example of the confusion between the essential concepts of magnitude and intensity. The extraordinary sounds heard by Kingdon-Ward and many others at the times of the main earthquake have been specially investigated. Seiches were observed as far away as Norway and England. (p. 63–64.)\n\n\n\n## Future threat\n\n[edit]\n\nAn article in *Science*, published in response to the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, calculated that 70 percent of the Himalayas could experience an extremely powerful earthquake. The prediction came from research of the historical records from the area as well as the presumption that since the 1950 Medog earthquake enough slippage has taken place for a large earthquake to occur.[11] In 2015, the Himalayas were hit by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake with an epicenter further west in Nepal.\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Earth sciences portal\n\n\n* 1897 Assam earthquake\n* 2009 Bhutan earthquake\n* April 2015 Nepal earthquake\n* List of earthquakes in 1950\n* List of earthquakes in India\n* List of earthquakes in China\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ISC (2022), *ISC-GEM Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue (1904–2018)*, Version 9.1, International Seismological Centre\n2. **^** USGS. \"M8.6 - eastern Xizang-India border region\".

Instead, this quake was caused by two continental plates colliding.\n\n\nAftershocks were numerous; many of them were of magnitude 6 and over and well enough recorded at distant stations for reasonably good epicentre location. From such data the Indian Seismological Service established an enormous geographical spread of this activity, from about 90 deg to 97 deg east longitude, with the epicentre of the great earthquake near the eastern margin.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Impact\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1950 Assam–Tibet earthquake had devastating effects on both Assam and Tibet. In Assam, 1,526 fatalities were recorded[7] and another 3,300 were reported in Tibet for a total of approximately 4,800 deaths.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAlterations of relief were brought about by many rock falls in the Mishmi Hills and surrounding forested regions. In the Abor Hills, 70 villages were destroyed with 156 casualties due to landslides. Landslides blocked the tributaries of the Brahmaputra. In the Dibang Valley, a landslide lake burst without causing damage, but another at Subansiri River opened after an interval of 8 days and the wave, 7 m (23 ft) high, submerged several villages and killed 532 people.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe shock was more damaging in Assam, in terms of property loss, than the earthquake of 1897. In addition to the extreme shaking, there were floods when the rivers rose high after the earthquake bringing down sand, mud, trees, and all kinds of debris. Pilots flying over the meizoseismal area reported great changes in topography. This was largely due to enormous landslides, some of which were photographed.\n\n\nIn Tibet, Heinrich Harrer reported strong shaking in Lhasa and loud cracking noises from the earth.[8] Aftershocks were felt in Lhasa for days. In Rima, Tibet (modern-day Zayü Town), Frank Kingdon-Ward, noted violent shaking, extensive slides, and the rise of the streams.[9] Helen Myers Morse, an American missionary living in Putao, northern Burma at the time, wrote letters home describing the main shake, the numerous aftershocks, and of the noise coming out of the earth.[10]\n\n\nOne of the more westerly aftershocks, a few days later, was felt more extensively in Assam than the main shock. This led certain journalists to the belief that the later shock was 'bigger' and must be the greatest earthquake of all time. This is a typical example of the confusion between the essential concepts of magnitude and intensity. The extraordinary sounds heard by Kingdon-Ward and many others at the times of the main earthquake have been specially investigated. Seiches were observed as far away as Norway and England. (p. 63–64.)\n\n\n\n## Future threat\n\n[edit]\n\nAn article in *Science*, published in response to the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, calculated that 70 percent of the Himalayas could experience an extremely powerful earthquake. The prediction came from research of the historical records from the area as well as the presumption that since the 1950 Medog earthquake enough slippage has taken place for a large earthquake to occur.[11] In 2015, the Himalayas were hit by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake with an epicenter further west in Nepal.\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Earth sciences portal\n\n\n* 1897 Assam earthquake\n* 2009 Bhutan earthquake\n* April 2015 Nepal earthquake\n* List of earthquakes in 1950\n* List of earthquakes in India\n* List of earthquakes in China\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ISC (2022), *ISC-GEM Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue (1904–2018)*, Version 9.1, International Seismological Centre\n2. **^** USGS. \"M8.6 - eastern Xizang-India border region\".

The main area affected is the districts of Latur and Osmanabad, including the Ausa block of Latur and Omerga of Osmanabad in Maharashtra, Western India.[7] Fifty-two villages were demolished in the intraplate earthquake. It measured 6.2 on the moment magnitude scale, and approximately 10,000 people died,[8] whilst another 30,000 were injured. The earthquake's hypocenter was around 10 km deep – relatively shallow – allowing shock waves to cause more damage. It is considered the deadliest earthquake in the stable continental crust to have occurred in recorded history.[4]\n\n\nBecause the location does not lie on a plate boundary, there was some debate as to what caused the earthquake. The Indian sub-continent crumples as it pushes against Asia and pressure is released. It is possible that this pressure is released along fault lines. Another argument is that reservoir construction along the Terna was responsible for increasing pressure on fault lines. Killari,[9] where the epicenter of the quake is believed to have been, had a large crater, which remains in place to date.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## Background and geology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Latur area, and indeed peninsular India where it is located, was previously considered having the least possibility of seismic activity. Prior to 1967 there had been only three recorded notable earthquakes in peninsular India. The Koyna earthquake, a few hundred miles west of Latur in 1967 was the most recent one.[12] Latur area is near the eastern end of Deccan Traps formed by flood basalt. The basalt flows in the area are estimated to be 450 meters thick). The terrain is generally flat.[13]\n\n\n\n## Details\n\n[edit]\n\n* Deadliest earthquake in state of Maharashtra.[14]\n* Main districts affected were Latur and Osmanabad.\n* Occurred around 3.56am IST.\n* 52 villages affected and destroyed.[15][16]\n* 10,000 people killed and 30,000 injured.\n* Huge hollow in Killari, epicentre of quake still remains.\n* With measurement in moment magnitude scale of 6.4.[15]\n* Casualties of being killed and injured high as it being densely populated.\n* Shockwaves causing high damage as earthquake focus being 12 km deep.\n* Relief teams and rescue workers with support from foreign and local support reached immediately.\n* Deaths included many women and children.\n* Financial assistance of Rs 46.55 lakhs for handicapped people.\n* World Bank offering funding and financial and other assistance for reconstruction of Latur.\n* Villagers provided with 299 cattle.\n\n\n## Relief efforts\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral foreign and local donors reacted immediately to the tragedy by sending relief teams and rescue workers.[14] Physicians and staff from Railway Hospital, Solapur and V.M. Medical College, Solapur were amongst the first to reach the site and assisted with treatment of the injured over the next several weeks. The first convoy of over 120 trucks laden with relief material such as tents, blankets, food and clothing, medical supplies and temporary shelters given by international donors[14] departed from Mumbai at around 10am on 2 October 1993. 42nd battalion of MIL, The Indian Army, State Reserve Police Force, Central Reserve Police Force and other law enforcement agencies rushed their personnel almost immediately after the quake,[14] assuming there would be a greater number of casualties.\n\n\n\n### See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n\n\n* List of earthquakes in 1993\n* List of earthquakes in India\n* Geology of Maharashtra\n* Nanded earthquakes\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ISC (2016), *ISC-GEM Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue (1900–2012)*, Version 3.0, International Seismological Centre\n2. **^** \"Event: MAHARASHTRA, INDIA\". *ngdc.noaa.gov*.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** USGS (4 September 2009), *PAGER-CAT Earthquake Catalog*, Version 2008\\_06.1, United States Geological Survey\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS) (1972), *Significant Earthquake Database*, National Geophysical Data Center, NOAA, doi:10.7289/V5TD9V7K\n5. **^** Harsh Gupta; Bal Krishna Rastogi (1998). \"An investigation into the Latur earthquake of September 29, 1993 in southern India\". *Tectonophysics*. **287** (1): 299-318. doi:10.1016/S0040-1951(98)80075-9.\n6. **^** \"overview of the maharashtra, india emergency earthquake rehabilitation program\" (PDF). *iitk.ac.in*.
