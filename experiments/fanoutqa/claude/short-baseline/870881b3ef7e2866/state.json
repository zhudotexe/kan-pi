To accurately answer this question, I would need:\n\n1. A tool to search box office earnings for 2023\n2. A tool to look up directors' filmographies and their first directing credits\n\nWith the tools currently available to me (only Wikipedia search), I could look up individual directors or movies, but I wouldn't be able to comprehensively gather and verify all this information. Would you like me to:\n\n1. Provide you with a different format for this question that I can answer with the available tools?\n2. Focus on a specific director or movie that you're interested in?\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed.",
