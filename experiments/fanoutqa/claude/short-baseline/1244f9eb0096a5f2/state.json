While in several high-income countries the ratio of total estimated cases and deaths to reported cases and deaths is low and close to 1, for some countries it may be more than 10[7] or even more than 100.[8] Implementation of COVID-19 surveillance methods varies widely.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n## Maps and timelines[edit]\n\n\n### Total cases[edit]\n\n\nWorld maps showing total confirmed cases, and total confirmed cases per million, by country.

China was criticised for initially minimising the severity of the outbreak, but its wide-scale response has largely contained the disease since March 2020.[55][56][57][58]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** \"Covid: Half of Europe to be infected with Omicron within weeks - WHO\". *BBC News*. 11 January 2022.

United States: First case confirmed on January 20, 2020\n2. India: First case confirmed on January 30, 2020\n3. France: First case confirmed on January 24, 2020\n4.
