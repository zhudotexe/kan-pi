Where the president is still living, their lifespan and post-presidency timespan are calculated up to October 25, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## Age of presidents\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Age of presidents when assuming office\nThe median age at inauguration of incoming U.S. presidents is 55 years.[1][2] The specific years and days median is 55 years and 104.5 days, which falls midway between how old Warren G. Harding was in 1921 and Lyndon B. Johnson was in 1963.\n\n\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution provides that U.S. presidents must be at least 35 years old at the time of taking office. The youngest person to become U.S. president was Theodore Roosevelt, who, at age 42, succeeded to the office after the assassination of William McKinley.[1] The youngest at the time of his election to the office was John F. Kennedy, at age 43.[3] The oldest person elected president was Joe Biden, the nation's current president, at age 77. Biden celebrated a birthday between Election Day and Inauguration Day making him 78 when sworn into office.[1][4]\n\n\nAssassinated at age 46, John F. Kennedy was the youngest president at the end of his tenure, and his lifespan was the shortest of any president.[3][5] At age 50, Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest person to become a former president.[6] The oldest president at the end of his tenure was Ronald Reagan at 77; this distinction will eventually fall upon Joe Biden,[2][4] who is currently 81.\n\n\nJames K. Polk had the shortest retirement of any president, dying 3 months after leaving office at age 53 (the youngest president to die of natural causes).[7] Jimmy Carter's retirement, now 43 years, is the longest in American presidential history. At age 100, Carter is also the oldest living president[2] and the nation's longest-lived president.[8] The youngest living president is Barack Obama, age 63.\n\n\n\n## Presidential age-related data\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| No. | President\n | Born\n | Age atstart of presidency | Age atend of presidency | Post-presidencytimespan\n | Lifespan\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Died\n | Age\n |\n| 01\n | George Washington | Feb 22, 1732[a] | 57 years, 67 daysApr 30, 1789 | 65 years, 10 daysMar 4, 1797 | 2 years, 285 days\n | Dec 14, 1799 | 67 years, 295 days\n |\n| 02\n | John Adams | Oct 30, 1735[a] | 61 years, 125 daysMar 4, 1797 | 65 years, 125 daysMar 4, 1801 | 25 years, 122 days | July 5, 1826Jul 4, 1826 | 90 years, 247 days |\n| 03\n | Thomas Jefferson | Apr 13, 1743[a] | 57 years, 325 daysMar 4, 1801 | 65 years, 325 daysMar 4, 1809 | 17 years, 122 days\n | Jul 4, 1826 | 83 years, 82 days\n |\n| 04\n | James Madison | Mar 16, 1751[a] | 57 years, 353 daysMar 4, 1809 | 65 years, 353 daysMar 4, 1817 | 19 years, 116 days\n | Jun 28, 1836 | 85 years, 104 days\n |\n| 05\n | James Monroe | Apr 28, 1758 | 58 years, 310 daysMar 4, 1817 | 66 years, 310 daysMar 4, 1825 | 6 years, 122 days\n | Jul 4, 1831 | 73 years, 67 days\n |\n| 06\n | John Quincy Adams | Jul 11, 1767 | 57 years, 236 daysMar 4, 1825 | 61 years, 236 daysMar 4, 1829 | 18 years, 356 days\n | Feb 23, 1848 | 80 years, 227 days\n |\n| 07\n | Andrew Jackson | Mar 15, 1767 | 61 years, 354 daysMar 4, 1829 | 69 years, 354 daysMar 4, 1837 | 8 years, 96 days\n | Jun 8, 1845 | 78 years, 85 days\n |\n| 08\n | Martin Van Buren | Dec 5, 1782 | 54 years, 89 daysMar 4, 1837 | 58 years, 89 daysMar 4, 1841 | 21 years, 142 days\n | Jul 24, 1862 | 79 years, 231 days\n |\n| 09\n | William Henry Harrison | Feb 9, 1773 | 68 years, 23 daysMar 4, 1841 | 68 years, 54 days Apr 4, 1841 | 00,0010 days[b] | Apr 4, 1841 | 68 years, 54 days\n |\n| 10\n | John Tyler | Mar 29, 1790 | 51 years, 6 daysApr 4, 1841 | 54 years, 340 daysMar 4, 1845 | 16 years, 320 days\n | Jan 18, 1862 | 71 years, 295 days\n |\n| 11\n | James K.

Where the president is still living, their lifespan and post-presidency timespan are calculated up to October 25, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## Age of presidents\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Age of presidents when assuming office\nThe median age at inauguration of incoming U.S. presidents is 55 years.[1][2] The specific years and days median is 55 years and 104.5 days, which falls midway between how old Warren G. Harding was in 1921 and Lyndon B. Johnson was in 1963.\n\n\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution provides that U.S. presidents must be at least 35 years old at the time of taking office. The youngest person to become U.S. president was Theodore Roosevelt, who, at age 42, succeeded to the office after the assassination of William McKinley.[1] The youngest at the time of his election to the office was John F. Kennedy, at age 43.[3] The oldest person elected president was Joe Biden, the nation's current president, at age 77. Biden celebrated a birthday between Election Day and Inauguration Day making him 78 when sworn into office.[1][4]\n\n\nAssassinated at age 46, John F. Kennedy was the youngest president at the end of his tenure, and his lifespan was the shortest of any president.[3][5] At age 50, Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest person to become a former president.[6] The oldest president at the end of his tenure was Ronald Reagan at 77; this distinction will eventually fall upon Joe Biden,[2][4] who is currently 81.\n\n\nJames K. Polk had the shortest retirement of any president, dying 3 months after leaving office at age 53 (the youngest president to die of natural causes).[7] Jimmy Carter's retirement, now 43 years, is the longest in American presidential history. At age 100, Carter is also the oldest living president[2] and the nation's longest-lived president.[8] The youngest living president is Barack Obama, age 63.\n\n\n\n## Presidential age-related data\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| No. | President\n | Born\n | Age atstart of presidency | Age atend of presidency | Post-presidencytimespan\n | Lifespan\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Died\n | Age\n |\n| 01\n | George Washington | Feb 22, 1732[a] | 57 years, 67 daysApr 30, 1789 | 65 years, 10 daysMar 4, 1797 | 2 years, 285 days\n | Dec 14, 1799 | 67 years, 295 days\n |\n| 02\n | John Adams | Oct 30, 1735[a] | 61 years, 125 daysMar 4, 1797 | 65 years, 125 daysMar 4, 1801 | 25 years, 122 days | July 5, 1826Jul 4, 1826 | 90 years, 247 days |\n| 03\n | Thomas Jefferson | Apr 13, 1743[a] | 57 years, 325 daysMar 4, 1801 | 65 years, 325 daysMar 4, 1809 | 17 years, 122 days\n | Jul 4, 1826 | 83 years, 82 days\n |\n| 04\n | James Madison | Mar 16, 1751[a] | 57 years, 353 daysMar 4, 1809 | 65 years, 353 daysMar 4, 1817 | 19 years, 116 days\n | Jun 28, 1836 | 85 years, 104 days\n |\n| 05\n | James Monroe | Apr 28, 1758 | 58 years, 310 daysMar 4, 1817 | 66 years, 310 daysMar 4, 1825 | 6 years, 122 days\n | Jul 4, 1831 | 73 years, 67 days\n |\n| 06\n | John Quincy Adams | Jul 11, 1767 | 57 years, 236 daysMar 4, 1825 | 61 years, 236 daysMar 4, 1829 | 18 years, 356 days\n | Feb 23, 1848 | 80 years, 227 days\n |\n| 07\n | Andrew Jackson | Mar 15, 1767 | 61 years, 354 daysMar 4, 1829 | 69 years, 354 daysMar 4, 1837 | 8 years, 96 days\n | Jun 8, 1845 | 78 years, 85 days\n |\n| 08\n | Martin Van Buren | Dec 5, 1782 | 54 years, 89 daysMar 4, 1837 | 58 years, 89 daysMar 4, 1841 | 21 years, 142 days\n | Jul 24, 1862 | 79 years, 231 days\n |\n| 09\n | William Henry Harrison | Feb 9, 1773 | 68 years, 23 daysMar 4, 1841 | 68 years, 54 days Apr 4, 1841 | 00,0010 days[b] | Apr 4, 1841 | 68 years, 54 days\n |\n| 10\n | John Tyler | Mar 29, 1790 | 51 years, 6 daysApr 4, 1841 | 54 years, 340 daysMar 4, 1845 | 16 years, 320 days\n | Jan 18, 1862 | 71 years, 295 days\n |\n| 11\n | James K.
