In 1970, he was selected as Lunar Module Pilot for the Apollo 15 backup crew, and prime crew on Apollo 18. When program cutbacks canceled missions 18 through 20, NASA's lunar geological community insisted on having a geologist on the Moon, so Slayton reassigned Schmitt to Apollo 17.\n\n\n\n### 1966[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NASA Astronaut Group 5\n\n![](image)NASA Astronaut Group 5\nNASA named a group of 19 more astronauts in April 1966. None had spaceflight experience before their Apollo mission.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Joe H. Engle \u2013 from Group 5; was originally named as Apollo 17 Lunar Module Pilot, but lost his slot to Schmitt. After Apollo, he flew in the Space Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests, then commanded STS-2 and STS-51-I.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon[edit]\n\n\nTwelve men walked on the Moon during six Moon landings of the Apollo program between July 1969 and December 1972. All landed on the surface only once, and five missions consisted of two or more surface EVAs. Four of them are alive as of January\u00a02023.[update] Most astronauts at that time came from the military services and were considered to be on active duty during their NASA service. The few exceptions were considered civilian NASA astronauts, regardless of any prior military service.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFive of this group got their first spaceflight experience as second seat on Gemini:\n\n\n\n* David R. Scott \u2013 Second-seat veteran of Gemini 8, flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 9, and commanded the Apollo 15 lunar landing.\n* Eugene A. Cernan \u2013 Second-seat veteran on Gemini 9A, flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 10, and commanded the final lunar landing mission Apollo 17.\n* Michael Collins \u2013 Second-seat veteran on Gemini 10, flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 11.\n* Edwin E. \"Buzz\" Aldrin Jr. \u2013 Second-seat veteran on Gemini 12, flew as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 11, the first Moon landing.\n* Richard F. Gordon Jr. \u2013 Second-seat veteran on Gemini 11, flew as Command Module Pilot on Apollo 12. Gordon was selected to command the Apollo 18 lunar landing, which was later canceled.\n\n\nThe remaining six members of this group were selected for their first space flights on Apollo:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPeople who have traveled to the Moon\n |\n| --- |\n| Walked on the Moon | * Neil Armstrong (Apollo 11)\n* Buzz Aldrin (Apollo 11)\n* Pete Conrad (Apollo 12)\n* Alan Bean (Apollo 12)\n* Alan Shepard (Apollo 14)\n* Edgar Mitchell (Apollo 14)\n* David Scott (Apollo 15)\n* James Irwin (Apollo 15)\n* John Young (Apollo 16)\n* Charles Duke (Apollo 16)\n* Harrison Schmitt (Apollo 17)\n* Gene Cernan (Apollo 17)\n |\n| Flew to the Moonwithout landing | * William Anders (Apollo 8)\n* Frank Borman (Apollo 8)\n* Jim Lovell (Apollo 8, Apollo 13)\n* Thomas Stafford (Apollo 10)\n* Michael Collins (Apollo 11)\n* Dick Gordon (Apollo 12)\n* Fred Haise (Apollo 13)\n* Jack Swigert (Apollo 13)\n* Stuart Roosa (Apollo 14)\n* Al Worden (Apollo 15)\n* Ken Mattingly (Apollo 16)\n* Ronald Evans (Apollo 17)\n |\n| * Apollo program\n* Saturn V\n* Command and Service Module\n* Lunar Module\n* Lunar Roving Vehicle\n* Exploration of the Moon\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* John W.

He also commanded the first Space Shuttle flight, STS-1 *Columbia*, April 12\u201314, 1981, and STS-9, also on *Columbia*, November 28\u2013December 8, 1983.\n* Neil A. Armstrong \u2013 Commander of Gemini 8, commanded Apollo 11, becoming the first human to set foot on the Moon.\n* Charles \"Pete\" Conrad Jr. \u2013 Second-seat veteran of Gemini 5 and commander of Gemini 11, commanded Apollo 12, the second lunar landing. He went on to command Skylab 2, successfully completing repairs to the spacecraft that saved it for this and two subsequent missions.\n\n\n### 1963[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NASA Astronaut Group 3\n\n![](image)NASA Astronaut Group 3\nThis was the first class of astronauts for which test pilot experience was not required, but military jet fighter pilot experience was acceptable.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBesides the 12 people who have walked on the Moon, 12 more have flown to within 0.001 lunar distance of its surface. During each of the six missions with successful lunar landings, one astronaut remained in lunar orbit while the other two landed. In addition, the three-person crews of Apollo 8 and Apollo 10 also entered lunar orbit, and the crew of Apollo 13 looped around the Moon on a free-return trajectory.\n\n\nAll nine crewed missions to the Moon took place as part of the Apollo program over a period of just under four years, from 21 December 1968 to 19 December 1972. The 24 people who have flown to the Moon are the only people who have traveled beyond low Earth orbit. Eight of them are alive with an average age of 91.9\nyears.\n\n\nJim Lovell, John Young, and Eugene Cernan are the only three people to have flown to the Moon twice. Young and Cernan each set foot on it during their respective second lunar missions, while Lovell is the only person to have flown to the Moon twice without landing.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![](image) | **Charles Duke**(NASA Astronaut Group 5) |  (1935-10-03) October 3, 1935 (age\u00a088) |  | 36y 6m 18d\n | 3\n | 20 hours 14 minutes | Air Force | United States Naval Academy, MIT |\n| 11\n | ![](image) | **Eugene Cernan**(NASA Astronaut Group 3) | (1934-03-14)March 14, 1934 | January 16, 2017(2017-01-16) (aged\u00a082) | 38y 9m 7d\n | Apollo 17 | December 11, 1972 at 7:54 PM\n | December 14, 1972 at 10:54 PM\n | 3 days 3 hours 0 minutes\n | 3\n | 22 hours 3 minutes | Navy | Purdue University, Naval Postgraduate School |\n| 12\n | ![](image) | **Harrison Schmitt**(NASA Astronaut Group 4) |  (1935-07-03) July 3, 1935 (age\u00a088) |  | 37y 5m 8d\n | 3\n | 22 hours 3 minutes | Civilian[nb 3] | Caltech, University of Oslo, Harvard University |\n\n\n## Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  | Portrait\n | Name and group\n | Born\n | Died\n | Age atfirst step\n | Mission\n | Lunar Module Landing Time (UTC)[5] | Lunar Module Ascent Time (UTC)[5] | Elapsed Time on Lunar Surface\n | Lunar EVAs[5] | Total EVA Duration[5] | Military service\n | Alma mater\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Neil Armstrong**(NASA Astronaut Group 2) | (1930-08-05)August 5, 1930 | August 25, 2012(2012-08-25) (aged\u00a082) | 38y 11m 15d\n | Apollo 11 | July 20, 1969 at 8:17 PM\n | July 21, 1969 at 5:54 PM\n | 21 hours 37 minutes | 1\n | 2 hours 31 minutes | Civilian[nb 2] (Navy veteran) | Purdue University, University of Southern California |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | **Buzz Aldrin**(NASA Astronaut Group 3) |  (1930-01-20) January 20, 1930 (age\u00a094) |  | 39y 6m 0d\n | 1\n | 2 hours 31 minutes | Air Force | United States Military Academy, MIT |\n| 3\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Roger B.

Apollo 4\u20136 and AS-201 and AS-202 were uncrewed, while AS-203 is considered a test flight. The Apollo program included three other crewed missions: Apollo 1 (AS-204) did not launch and its crew died in a ground-based capsule fire, while Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were low Earth orbit missions that only tested spacecraft components and docking maneuvers. Apollo missions 18, 19, and 20 were canceled. Nine astronauts later flew unused Apollo command modules in the Apollo Applications Program's Skylab and Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project. Of the twenty-four astronauts who flew to the Moon, two went on to command a Skylab mission, one commanded Apollo\u2013Soyuz, one flew as commander for Approach and Landing Tests of the Space Shuttle, and two commanded orbital Space Shuttle missions.\n\n\n\n\n## Prime crew members[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Edward H.

McDivitt \u2013 Commander of Gemini 4, selected in late 1966 to command the first Earth orbital flight test of the Apollo Lunar Module with the CSM. This mission flew in March 1969 as Apollo 9. After his flight, McDivitt was promoted to Manager of Lunar Landing Operations, and in August 1969 was promoted to Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program.\n* Frank F. Borman II \u2013 Commander of Gemini 7, selected to command a higher Earth orbit test of the complete Apollo spacecraft. But when delays prevented the LM from being ready in time for its first flight in December 1968, Borman's mission was changed to the first lunar orbital flight of the CSM on Apollo 8.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  | Portrait\n | Name and group\n | Born\n | Died\n | Age\n | Mission\n | Military service\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Frank Borman**(NASA Astronaut Group 2) | (1928-03-14)March 14, 1928 | November 7, 2023(2023-11-07) (aged\u00a095) | 40 | Apollo 8  December 21\u201327, 1968 | Air Force |  |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | **Jim Lovell**(NASA Astronaut Group 2) |  (1928-03-25) March 25, 1928 (age\u00a096) |  | 4042 | Apollo 8  December 21\u201327, 1968 Apollo 13  April 11\u201317, 1970 | Navy | Intended to land on Apollo 13; only person to fly to the Moon twice without landing.\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | **Bill Anders**(NASA Astronaut Group 3) |  (1933-10-17) October 17, 1933 (age\u00a090) |  | 35 | Apollo 8  December 21\u201327, 1968 | Air Force |  |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | **Tom Stafford**(NASA Astronaut Group 2) |  (1930-09-17) September 17, 1930 (age\u00a093) |  | 38 | Apollo 10  May 18\u201326, 1969 | Air Force | Later flew on Apollo\u2013Soyuz Test Project.\n |\n| 5\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** George E.

When Armstrong first stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[1][2][3][4] It was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide. Apollo 11 was a major U.S. victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon and received the 1969 Collier Trophy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** \"Neil Armstrong grants rare interview to accountants organization\".

The first thing Slayton said was, \"The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room.\"[100] According to Cernan, only Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise\u2014the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Chris Kraft, a March 1969 meeting among Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Kraft determined that Armstrong would be the first person on the Moon, in part because NASA management saw him as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the LM pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book.[113][114] Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time. Slayton added, \"Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out\u00a0... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision.\"[115]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, Deke Slayton, called Armstrong on September 13, 1962, and asked whether he would be interested in joining the NASA Astronaut Corps as part of what the press dubbed \"the New Nine\"; without hesitation, Armstrong said yes. The selections were kept secret until three days later, although newspaper reports had circulated since earlier that year that he would be selected as the \"first civilian astronaut\".[68] Armstrong was one of two civilian pilots selected for this group;[69] the other was Elliot See, another former naval aviator.[70] NASA selected the second group that, compared with the Mercury Seven astronauts, were younger,[67] and had more impressive academic credentials.[71] Collins wrote that Armstrong was by far the most experienced test pilot in the Astronaut Corps.[55]\n\n\n\n### Gemini program[edit]\n\n\n#### Gemini 5[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter being released from an 18-day quarantine to ensure that they had not picked up any infections or diseases from the Moon, the crew was feted across the United States and around the world as part of a 38-day \"Giant Leap\" tour.[162] \n\n![](image)New York City ticker tape parade, August 13, 1969\nThe tour began on August 13, when the three astronauts spoke and rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, with an estimated six million attendees.[163][164] On the same evening an official state dinner was held in Los Angeles to celebrate the flight, attended by members of Congress, 44\u00a0governors, the Chief Justice of the United States, and ambassadors from 83\u00a0nations.

With two other flights (Gemini 3 and Gemini 4) in preparation, six crews were competing for simulator time, so Gemini\u00a05 was postponed. It finally lifted off on August 21.[73] Armstrong and See watched the launch at Cape Kennedy, then flew to the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in Houston.[74] The mission was generally successful, despite a problem with the fuel cells that prevented a rendezvous. Cooper and Conrad practiced a \"phantom rendezvous\", carrying out the maneuver without a target.[75]\n\n\n\n\n#### Gemini 8[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gemini 8\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n238. **^** Shane, Scott; Kliff, Sarah (August 1, 2019). \"A Scoop About Neil Armstrong Arrived in a Plain Brown Envelope\". *The New York Times*.

The Apollo command module was relatively roomy compared with the Gemini spacecraft. None of the Apollo 11 crew suffered space sickness, as some members of previous crews had. Armstrong was especially glad about this, as he had been prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after long periods of aerobatics.[119]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Chaikin, Andrew (1994). *A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts*.

However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions.[63] Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin \"resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second\".[64]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter earning a Doctor of Science degree in astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Aldrin was selected as a member of NASA's Astronaut Group 3, making him the first astronaut with a doctoral degree. His doctoral thesis, *Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous*, earned him the nickname \"Dr. Rendezvous\" from fellow astronauts. His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12, during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit.

Armstrong thought it over for a day before declining. He had no issues working with Aldrin, and thought Lovell deserved his own command.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Aldrin, Buzz and Ken Abraham. 2009. *Magnificent Desolation: The Long Journey Home from the Moon*.

The astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter, and flown to the aircraft carrier USS\u00a0*Hornet*,[100] where they spent the first part of the Earth-based portion of 21 days of quarantine.[101] On August 13, the three astronauts rode in ticker-tape parades in their honor in New York and Chicago, attended by an estimated six million people.[102] An official state dinner that evening in Los Angeles celebrated the flight.
