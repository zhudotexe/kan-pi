The firm operates the largest investment bank in the world by revenue.[9][10] It occupies 24th place on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by revenue. It produces institutional research on financial markets, economics, geopolitics, and personal finance across its business lines. The company's balance sheet, geographic footprint, and thought leadership have yielded a substantial market share in banking and a high level of brand loyalty. Alternatively, it receives routine criticism for its risk management, broad financing activities, and large-scale legal settlements.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"in PDF on page 8 second table (Assets under management (\"AUM\"))\" (PDF). *www.jpmorganchase.com*.\n2. **^** \"J.P.

It is the largest bank in the United States and the world's largest bank by market capitalization as of 2023.[4][5] As the largest of Big Four banks, the firm is considered systemically important by the Financial Stability Board. Its size and scale have often led to enhanced regulatory oversight as well as the maintenance of an internal \"Fortress Balance Sheet\"[6][7] of capital reserves.
