It is no doubt true that other civilizations, prior to, or wholly alien to, the medieval West, such as the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Islam, or China, were familiar with forms of higher education which a number of historians, for the sake of convenience, have sometimes described as universities. Yet a closer look makes it plain that the institutional reality was altogether different and, no matter what has been said on the subject, there is no real link such as would justify us in associating them with medieval universities in the West. Until there is definite proof to the contrary, these latter must be regarded as the sole source of the model which gradually spread through the whole of Europe and then to the whole world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> This is considerably later than the beginning of instruction at the al-Azhar under the Fatimids. So it is very difficult to sustain the claim that the University of Qarawiyyin is the \"oldest university\", and not only in the Muslim world! The mosque school or college did not assume the name of university until 1960 when in a ceremony Muhammad V invested it with that dignified title.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nA number of well-known philosophers, scholars, and politicians in the history of Morocco and the western Mediterranean have either studied or taught at the Qarawiyyin since its founding.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> Thus the university, as a form of social organization, was peculiar to medieval Europe. Later, it was exported to all parts of the world, including the Muslim East; and it has remained with us down to the present day. But back in the Middle Ages, outside of Europe, there was nothing anything quite like it anywhere.\n> \n>\n100. **^** Rüegg, Walter: \"Foreword.

These centres were places where teachers and students of that time would meet and also where all intellectuals would gather and take part in extremely important scientific debates. It is not a coincidence that around the 9th century the first university in the world, the Qarawiyyin University in Fez, was established in the Muslim world followed by az-Zaytuna in Tunis and Al-Azhar in Cairo. The university model, which in the West was widespread starting only from the 12th century, had an extraordinary fortune and was spread throughout the Muslim world at least until the colonial period.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> No other European institution has spread over the entire world in the way in which the traditional form of the European university has done.

It included the current grand reading room, which measures 23 metres long and features an ornately-painted wooden ceiling, and also added an entrance outside the mosque which made it accessible to non-Muslims.[40][39] This new library expansion was inaugurated in 1949.[72] The library complex underwent another major restoration in recent years led by Aziza Chaouni and was set to reopen in 2016 or 2017.[79][76][77][80]\n\n\n\n## Status as world's oldest university[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Madrasa § Madrasa and university\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAssociation of African Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) Algeria | * Algiers 1 University\n* Constantine 1 University\n* Oran 1 University\n* University of Ouargla\n* University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Angola | * Agostinho Neto University\n |\n| ![](image) Benin | * University of Abomey-Calavi\n |\n| ![](image) Botswana | * Botho University\n* Botswana Accountancy College\n* Botswana International University of Science and Technology\n* Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources\n* University of Botswana\n |\n| ![](image) Burkina Faso | * Nazi Boni University\n* University of Ouagadougou\n |\n| ![](image) Burundi | * University of Burundi\n |\n| ![](image) Cameroon | * University of Bamenda\n* University of Buea\n* University of Douala\n* University of Dschang\n* University of Maroua\n* University of Ngaoundéré\n* University of Yaoundé I\n |\n| ![](image) Cape Verde | * Jean Piaget University of Cape Verde\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Marozzi, Justin (2019). *Islamic Empires: Fifteen Cities that Define a Civilization*.

It is no doubt true that other civilizations, prior to, or wholly alien to, the medieval West, such as the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Islam, or China, were familiar with forms of higher education which a number of historians, for the sake of convenience, have sometimes described as universities. Yet a closer look makes it plain that the institutional reality was altogether different and, no matter what has been said on the subject, there is no real link such as would justify us in associating them with medieval universities in the West. Until there is definite proof to the contrary, these latter must be regarded as the sole source of the model which gradually spread through the whole of Europe and then to the whole world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> This is considerably later than the beginning of instruction at the al-Azhar under the Fatimids. So it is very difficult to sustain the claim that the University of Qarawiyyin is the \"oldest university\", and not only in the Muslim world! The mosque school or college did not assume the name of university until 1960 when in a ceremony Muhammad V invested it with that dignified title.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nA number of well-known philosophers, scholars, and politicians in the history of Morocco and the western Mediterranean have either studied or taught at the Qarawiyyin since its founding.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> Thus the university, as a form of social organization, was peculiar to medieval Europe. Later, it was exported to all parts of the world, including the Muslim East; and it has remained with us down to the present day. But back in the Middle Ages, outside of Europe, there was nothing anything quite like it anywhere.\n> \n>\n100. **^** Rüegg, Walter: \"Foreword.

These centres were places where teachers and students of that time would meet and also where all intellectuals would gather and take part in extremely important scientific debates. It is not a coincidence that around the 9th century the first university in the world, the Qarawiyyin University in Fez, was established in the Muslim world followed by az-Zaytuna in Tunis and Al-Azhar in Cairo. The university model, which in the West was widespread starting only from the 12th century, had an extraordinary fortune and was spread throughout the Muslim world at least until the colonial period.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> No other European institution has spread over the entire world in the way in which the traditional form of the European university has done. The degrees awarded by European universities – the bachelor's degree, the licentiate, the master's degree, and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world. The four medieval faculties of *artes* – variously called philosophy, letters, arts, arts and sciences, and humanities –, law, medicine, and theology have survived and have been supplemented by numerous disciplines, particularly the social sciences and technological studies, but they remain nonetheless at the heart of universities throughout the world.\n> \n> \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe *Encyclopædia Britannica* dates al-Qarawiyyin University's foundation to the mosque's foundation in 859[87] and generally considers that \"universities\" existed outside Europe before the advent of the European university model.[88] Other sources also refer to the historical or pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin as a \"university\" or an \"Islamic university\".[89][90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe current library building dates in part from a Saadian construction by Ahmad al-Mansur (late 16th century), who built a chamber called *al-Ahmadiyya* behind the *qibla* wall.[40] Most of the building dates from a major 20th-century expansion commissioned by King Mohammed V that started in 1940. It included the current grand reading room, which measures 23 metres long and features an ornately-painted wooden ceiling, and also added an entrance outside the mosque which made it accessible to non-Muslims.[40][39] This new library expansion was inaugurated in 1949.[72] The library complex underwent another major restoration in recent years led by Aziza Chaouni and was set to reopen in 2016 or 2017.[79][76][77][80]\n\n\n\n## Status as world's oldest university[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Madrasa § Madrasa and university\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAssociation of African Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) Algeria | * Algiers 1 University\n* Constantine 1 University\n* Oran 1 University\n* University of Ouargla\n* University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Angola | * Agostinho Neto University\n |\n| ![](image) Benin | * University of Abomey-Calavi\n |\n| ![](image) Botswana | * Botho University\n* Botswana Accountancy College\n* Botswana International University of Science and Technology\n* Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources\n* University of Botswana\n |\n| ![](image) Burkina Faso | * Nazi Boni University\n* University of Ouagadougou\n |\n| ![](image) Burundi | * University of Burundi\n |\n| ![](image) Cameroon | * University of Bamenda\n* University of Buea\n* University of Douala\n* University of Dschang\n* University of Maroua\n* University of Ngaoundéré\n* University of Yaoundé I\n |\n| ![](image) Cape Verde | * Jean Piaget University of Cape Verde\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Marozzi, Justin (2019). *Islamic Empires: Fifteen Cities that Define a Civilization*.

Associated with Al-Azhar Al-Sharif in Islamic Cairo, it is Egypt's oldest degree-granting university and is known as one of the most prestigious universities for Islamic learning.[2][3] In addition to higher education, Al-Azhar oversees a national network of schools with approximately two million students.[4] As of 1996, over 4,000 teaching institutes in Egypt were affiliated with the university.[5]\n\n\nFounded in 970 or 972 by the Fatimid Caliphate as a centre of Islamic learning, its students studied the Qur'an and Islamic law in detail, along with logic, grammar, rhetoric, and how to calculate the phases of the moon. Today it is the chief centre of Arabic literature and Islamic learning in the world.[6] In 1961 additional non-religious subjects were added to its curriculum.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** \"Al-Azhar University\".\n2. **^** Delman, Edward (February 26, 2015). \"An Anti-ISIS Summit in Mecca A\". *The Atlantic*.\n3. **^** Aishah Ahmad Sabki (2018). *Pedagogy in Islamic Education: The Madrasah Context*.

These centres were places where teachers and students of that time would meet and also where all intellectuals would gather and take part in extremely important scientific debates. It is not a coincidence that around the 9th century the first university in the world, the Qarawiyyin University in Fez, was established in the Muslim world followed by az-Zaytuna in Tunis and Al-Azhar in Cairo. The university model, which in the West was widespread starting only from the 12th century, had an extraordinary fortune and was spread throughout the Muslim world at least until the colonial period.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> No other European institution has spread over the entire world in the way in which the traditional form of the European university has done.

It included the current grand reading room, which measures 23 metres long and features an ornately-painted wooden ceiling, and also added an entrance outside the mosque which made it accessible to non-Muslims.[40][39] This new library expansion was inaugurated in 1949.[72] The library complex underwent another major restoration in recent years led by Aziza Chaouni and was set to reopen in 2016 or 2017.[79][76][77][80]\n\n\n\n## Status as world's oldest university[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Madrasa § Madrasa and university\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAssociation of African Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) Algeria | * Algiers 1 University\n* Constantine 1 University\n* Oran 1 University\n* University of Ouargla\n* University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Angola | * Agostinho Neto University\n |\n| ![](image) Benin | * University of Abomey-Calavi\n |\n| ![](image) Botswana | * Botho University\n* Botswana Accountancy College\n* Botswana International University of Science and Technology\n* Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources\n* University of Botswana\n |\n| ![](image) Burkina Faso | * Nazi Boni University\n* University of Ouagadougou\n |\n| ![](image) Burundi | * University of Burundi\n |\n| ![](image) Cameroon | * University of Bamenda\n* University of Buea\n* University of Douala\n* University of Dschang\n* University of Maroua\n* University of Ngaoundéré\n* University of Yaoundé I\n |\n| ![](image) Cape Verde | * Jean Piaget University of Cape Verde\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Marozzi, Justin (2019). *Islamic Empires: Fifteen Cities that Define a Civilization*.

These centres were places where teachers and students of that time would meet and also where all intellectuals would gather and take part in extremely important scientific debates. It is not a coincidence that around the 9th century the first university in the world, the Qarawiyyin University in Fez, was established in the Muslim world followed by az-Zaytuna in Tunis and Al-Azhar in Cairo. The university model, which in the West was widespread starting only from the 12th century, had an extraordinary fortune and was spread throughout the Muslim world at least until the colonial period.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> No other European institution has spread over the entire world in the way in which the traditional form of the European university has done. The degrees awarded by European universities – the bachelor's degree, the licentiate, the master's degree, and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world. The four medieval faculties of *artes* – variously called philosophy, letters, arts, arts and sciences, and humanities –, law, medicine, and theology have survived and have been supplemented by numerous disciplines, particularly the social sciences and technological studies, but they remain nonetheless at the heart of universities throughout the world.\n> \n> \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nthe *Encyclopædia Britannica* dates al-Qarawiyyin University's foundation to the mosque's foundation in 859[87] and generally considers that \"universities\" existed outside Europe before the advent of the European university model.[88] Other sources also refer to the historical or pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin as a \"university\" or an \"Islamic university\".[89][90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe current library building dates in part from a Saadian construction by Ahmad al-Mansur (late 16th century), who built a chamber called *al-Ahmadiyya* behind the *qibla* wall.[40] Most of the building dates from a major 20th-century expansion commissioned by King Mohammed V that started in 1940. It included the current grand reading room, which measures 23 metres long and features an ornately-painted wooden ceiling, and also added an entrance outside the mosque which made it accessible to non-Muslims.[40][39] This new library expansion was inaugurated in 1949.[72] The library complex underwent another major restoration in recent years led by Aziza Chaouni and was set to reopen in 2016 or 2017.[79][76][77][80]\n\n\n\n## Status as world's oldest university[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Madrasa § Madrasa and university\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAssociation of African Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) Algeria | * Algiers 1 University\n* Constantine 1 University\n* Oran 1 University\n* University of Ouargla\n* University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene\n | ![](image)\n |\n| ![](image) Angola | * Agostinho Neto University\n |\n| ![](image) Benin | * University of Abomey-Calavi\n |\n| ![](image) Botswana | * Botho University\n* Botswana Accountancy College\n* Botswana International University of Science and Technology\n* Botswana University of Agriculture and Natural Resources\n* University of Botswana\n |\n| ![](image) Burkina Faso | * Nazi Boni University\n* University of Ouagadougou\n |\n| ![](image) Burundi | * University of Burundi\n |\n| ![](image) Cameroon | * University of Bamenda\n* University of Buea\n* University of Douala\n* University of Dschang\n* University of Maroua\n* University of Ngaoundéré\n* University of Yaoundé I\n |\n| ![](image) Cape Verde | * Jean Piaget University of Cape Verde\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Marozzi, Justin (2019). *Islamic Empires: Fifteen Cities that Define a Civilization*.
