Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v.

However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n203. **^** Casey, Nicholas (May 18, 2020). \"Passed By for Decades, Clarence Thomas Is a New Symbol of the Trump Era\". *The New York Times*.

Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v.

Marshall would later give advice to Thomas after the confirmation.[106][107]\nWhen Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n203. **^** Casey, Nicholas (May 18, 2020). \"Passed By for Decades, Clarence Thomas Is a New Symbol of the Trump Era\". *The New York Times*.
