Though the 1983–84 season saw the Celtics win the title and the Sixers upset in the first round by the New Jersey Nets, the Sixers had a measure of satisfaction in the regular season by winning 4 of their 6 regular season games versus Boston, the only time the Sixers managed to win the regular season series versus Boston in the Larry Bird era. Charles Barkley joined the Sixers for the 1984–85 season, and the 1985 Eastern Final series was the Sixers' last conference final until 2001. In the 1985 Finals, they lost to Boston in five games after Boston had won the first 3 games, including a third game in Philadelphia where Julius Erving was uncharacteristically booed by the home crowd for his poor play. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe next season, both the Celtics and the Sixers finished with the best record in the NBA at 62–20, but Boston held the tiebreaker in the ranking. In a classic 7-game Eastern Finals, the Celtics beat the 76ers in 1981 4–3, coming all the way back from a 3–1 deficit to win the next 3 games in classic finishes. The Celtics won Games 5 and 6 by 2 points each and the seventh game by 1 point, 91–90, coming back from a 7-point deficit with a few minutes left to win on a Larry Bird banker from the left side with barely a minute left. The Celtics then defeated the Houston Rockets on their way to their first title in 5 years. For the 1981–1982 season, the Celtics again had the best record in the NBA at 63–19, followed by Philadelphia at 58–24, with one of the Sixers' key victories in the regular season being a win in Boston to snap the Celtics' 18-game winning streak. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Celtics and Sixers met in the Eastern Conference Finals that season with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line. The series went the distance, with Game 7 being held at the Boston Garden. With 5 seconds left and Boston leading 110–109, Russell tried to inbound the ball when it hit a guy wire that supported the backboard, which resulted in a turnover. However, the Sixers failed to capitalize when Celtics forward John Havlicek deflected the inbound pass to Sam Jones, who ran out the clock. The Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in five games for their seventh straight title.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1966 season, the Sixers looked poised to end Boston's 7-year reign as NBA Champions; Philadelphia won the regular season series against Boston 6–4 and finished 55–25 to beat out the Celtics by one game and win the number one seed in Eastern Division. Chamberlain also won the MVP over Russell, who had won three of the previous four awards. When they met in the Conference Championship however, Boston defeated Philadelphia 4-1 and went on to win their eighth straight NBA Championship.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1982 Eastern Finals, Boston attempted to come back from a similar 3–1 predicament and managed to extend the series to seven games, with the seventh game playing in raucous Boston Garden. However, Philadelphia had the last laugh, winning Game 7. In that finale, as Boston fans saw their team losing, in a show of respect, they congratulated the Sixers by shouting the now-famous \"Beat L.A.\" chant as the Sixers were about to face the well-rested Lakers.[9][10] In the end, however, the weary Sixers couldn't keep up, losing to the Lakers in the Finals.\n\n\nThe next season, the Sixers picked up MVP Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Malone repeated as the MVP and led the 76ers to an NBA Championship in a 4-game sweep against the Lakers. With the Bucks sweeping Boston, it made the Sixers' title run much easier.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Wilt Chamberlain being defended by Bill Russell.\nThe **76ers–Celtics rivalry** is a National Basketball Association (NBA) rivalry between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Boston Celtics. The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 22 series (and the 1954 Eastern Division Round Robin), with the Celtics winning 15 of them.[1] The 76ers are considered to be the Celtics' second biggest rival, behind only the Los Angeles Lakers.[2][3][4][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Celtics–Nationals rivalry[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

He is remembered for scoring 25 points against Boston in the fourth quarter on March 21, 1982, at the Philadelphia Spectrum. It is still the Sixers' team record for most points scored in a quarter. He also scored a team-high 33 points in the classic Game 7 of the 1982 Eastern Finals in Boston (the famous \"Beat LA!\" game), leading the Sixers to the Finals and avoiding a second straight meltdown in the Eastern Finals versus Boston. Andrew Toney's ability to have big scoring games in the playoffs versus the Celtics was one of the reasons for the Celtics in acquiring defensive ace and Hall of Famer Dennis Johnson from the Phoenix Suns prior to the 1983–84 season, and Johnson would go on to have several great seasons with the Celtics, winning two titles with them in 1984 and 1986.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBoston Celtics\n |\n| First meeting | November 30, 1949Nationals 87, Celtics 71 |\n| Latest meeting | November 15, 202376ers 107, Celtics 117 |\n| Next meeting | December 1, 2023 |\n| Statistics |\n| Meetings total | 581 |\n| All-time series | 334–247 (BOS) |\n| Regular season series | 268–197 (BOS) |\n| Postseason results | 66–50 (BOS) |\n| Longest win streak | BOS W20 |\n| Current win streak | BOS W1 |\n| Postseason history |\n| * **1953 Eastern Division Semifinals**: Celtics won, 2–0\n* **1954 Eastern Division Finals**: Nationals won, 2–0\n* **1955 Eastern Division Finals**: Nationals won, 3–1\n* **1956 Eastern Division Semifinals**: Nationals won, 2–1\n* **1957 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 3–0\n* **1959 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4–3\n* **1961 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4–1\n* **1965 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4–3\n* **1966 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4–1\n* **1967 Eastern Division Finals**: 76ers won, 4–1\n* **1968 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4–3\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Schuhmann, John. \"Celtics, Sixers usher historic rivalry into new era\". *www.nba.com*.

Bird and the Celtics would win one more championship in 1986, but the Sixers would not reach another conference finals until 2001. The Sixers saw a steep decline through the rest of the '80's, trading Malone and Cheeks along with the retirements of Erving and Toney. Charles Barkley emerged as the Sixers new leader and a prominent NBA superstar, however he was not able to get the team past the second round. Though considered an MVP candidate in his prime, the Sixers traded him in 1992 and went through a period of rebuilding.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe next year the Sixers brought in Alex Hannum as head coach. Hannum had also coached the Bob Pettit-led St. Louis Hawks to the 1958 NBA Championship-the last year someone had defeated the Celtics in the championship. The Sixers went a then-NBA record 68-13 while the Celtics were 60–21. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Sixers overpowered Boston, beating them in five games and ending Boston's eight-year reign as NBA champions. The Sixers won the NBA Championship by beating the San Francisco Warriors in six games, giving the Sixers and Chamberlain their first title. The 1966-67 76ers were voted in 1980 as being the greatest team in the history of the NBA to that point.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter winning the championship in 1986, the Celtics also began a decline that started with tragedy. Two days after they drafted him in the 1986 draft, Len Bias died of a drug overdose. Reggie Lewis died of a heart attack in his prime in 1993. The Celtics then missed the playoffs in 1994, and did not post a winning record until the 2001–02 season.\n\n\nDespite the 90's being a period of stagnation for both teams, it did produce some key developments. Allen Iverson was drafted by the 76ers as the first overall pick in the 1996 draft, and the Celtics would draft Paul Pierce two years later. Both players would become superstars in the league and lead their respective team into the playoffs numerous times.\n\n\nIn 2002, the Celtics, in their first appearance since 1995, won the first round meeting 3–2 over the defending conference champion 76ers. That series featured the scoring exploits of Allen Iverson and Paul Pierce.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1968, the Sixers finished 62–20, eight games above Boston, and Chamberlain won his third consecutive MVP award. Both teams met in the Conference Championship again, and the Celtics won the Series in seven games after trailing 3–1, and went on to win the 1968 NBA Championship. After the season, 76ers head coach Alex Hannum left the NBA for the ABA in order to move closer to his family on the West Coast, and Chamberlain requested a trade, and was traded to Los Angeles.\n\n\nWithout Wilt, the Sixers managed a 55–27 record. Though Philadelphia again won the regular-season series against the Celtics, they were no match for Boston in the playoffs and lost 4–1. The Celtics went on to win the championship, their 11th in 13 seasons. After this season, Russell retired and both teams would not meet in the playoffs until 1977. The only two years Russell's Celtics did not win the championship, they lost to teams coached by Alex Hannum.\n\n\n\n### Dr. J and Bird[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Viser, Matt (June 1, 2008). \"Region revs up for an East-West rivalry reborn\". *Boston Globe*. p. A1.

They became a contender in the East, and in Erving's first season with the team, the Sixers eliminated the defending champion Boston Celtics in a tough seven-game Eastern semifinals in 1977. Boston slumped for the next two seasons while Philadelphia continued to be a strong team in the NBA, but in 1978, the Celtics drafted Indiana State forward Larry Bird in the hope of reviving their glory years as a franchise. Bird joined the team for the 1980 season and his impact was immediate. The Celtics improved from a 29–53 record in the 1978–79 season to a league-best 61–21 record in 1979–1980, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals that season to face the Sixers.

When they met in the Conference Championship however, Boston defeated Philadelphia 4-1 and went on to win their eighth straight NBA Championship.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1982 Eastern Finals, Boston attempted to come back from a similar 3–1 predicament and managed to extend the series to seven games, with the seventh game playing in raucous Boston Garden. However, Philadelphia had the last laugh, winning Game 7. In that finale, as Boston fans saw their team losing, in a show of respect, they congratulated the Sixers by shouting the now-famous \"Beat L.A.\" chant as the Sixers were about to face the well-rested Lakers.[9][10] In the end, however, the weary Sixers couldn't keep up, losing to the Lakers in the Finals.\n\n\nThe next season, the Sixers picked up MVP Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Malone repeated as the MVP and led the 76ers to an NBA Championship in a 4-game sweep against the Lakers. With the Bucks sweeping Boston, it made the Sixers' title run much easier.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Wilt Chamberlain being defended by Bill Russell.\nThe **76ers–Celtics rivalry** is a National Basketball Association (NBA) rivalry between the Philadelphia 76ers and the Boston Celtics. The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 22 series (and the 1954 Eastern Division Round Robin), with the Celtics winning 15 of them.[1] The 76ers are considered to be the Celtics' second biggest rival, behind only the Los Angeles Lakers.[2][3][4][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Celtics–Nationals rivalry[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

He is remembered for scoring 25 points against Boston in the fourth quarter on March 21, 1982, at the Philadelphia Spectrum. It is still the Sixers' team record for most points scored in a quarter. He also scored a team-high 33 points in the classic Game 7 of the 1982 Eastern Finals in Boston (the famous \"Beat LA!\" game), leading the Sixers to the Finals and avoiding a second straight meltdown in the Eastern Finals versus Boston. Andrew Toney's ability to have big scoring games in the playoffs versus the Celtics was one of the reasons for the Celtics in acquiring defensive ace and Hall of Famer Dennis Johnson from the Phoenix Suns prior to the 1983–84 season, and Johnson would go on to have several great seasons with the Celtics, winning two titles with them in 1984 and 1986.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBoston Celtics\n |\n| First meeting | November 30, 1949Nationals 87, Celtics 71 |\n| Latest meeting | November 15, 202376ers 107, Celtics 117 |\n| Next meeting | December 1, 2023 |\n| Statistics |\n| Meetings total | 581 |\n| All-time series | 334–247 (BOS) |\n| Regular season series | 268–197 (BOS) |\n| Postseason results | 66–50 (BOS) |\n| Longest win streak | BOS W20 |\n| Current win streak | BOS W1 |\n| Postseason history |\n| * **1953 Eastern Division Semifinals**: Celtics won, 2–0\n* **1954 Eastern Division Finals**: Nationals won, 2–0\n* **1955 Eastern Division Finals**: Nationals won, 3–1\n* **1956 Eastern Division Semifinals**: Nationals won, 2–1\n* **1957 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 3–0\n* **1959 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4–3\n* **1961 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4–1\n* **1965 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4–3\n* **1966 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4–1\n* **1967 Eastern Division Finals**: 76ers won, 4–1\n* **1968 Eastern Division Finals**: Celtics won, 4–3\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Schuhmann, John. \"Celtics, Sixers usher historic rivalry into new era\". *www.nba.com*.

Bird and the Celtics would win one more championship in 1986, but the Sixers would not reach another conference finals until 2001. The Sixers saw a steep decline through the rest of the '80's, trading Malone and Cheeks along with the retirements of Erving and Toney. Charles Barkley emerged as the Sixers new leader and a prominent NBA superstar, however he was not able to get the team past the second round. Though considered an MVP candidate in his prime, the Sixers traded him in 1992 and went through a period of rebuilding.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe next year the Sixers brought in Alex Hannum as head coach. Hannum had also coached the Bob Pettit-led St. Louis Hawks to the 1958 NBA Championship-the last year someone had defeated the Celtics in the championship. The Sixers went a then-NBA record 68-13 while the Celtics were 60–21. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Sixers overpowered Boston, beating them in five games and ending Boston's eight-year reign as NBA champions. The Sixers won the NBA Championship by beating the San Francisco Warriors in six games, giving the Sixers and Chamberlain their first title. The 1966-67 76ers were voted in 1980 as being the greatest team in the history of the NBA to that point.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter winning the championship in 1986, the Celtics also began a decline that started with tragedy. Two days after they drafted him in the 1986 draft, Len Bias died of a drug overdose. Reggie Lewis died of a heart attack in his prime in 1993. The Celtics then missed the playoffs in 1994, and did not post a winning record until the 2001–02 season.\n\n\nDespite the 90's being a period of stagnation for both teams, it did produce some key developments. Allen Iverson was drafted by the 76ers as the first overall pick in the 1996 draft, and the Celtics would draft Paul Pierce two years later. Both players would become superstars in the league and lead their respective team into the playoffs numerous times.\n\n\nIn 2002, the Celtics, in their first appearance since 1995, won the first round meeting 3–2 over the defending conference champion 76ers. That series featured the scoring exploits of Allen Iverson and Paul Pierce.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1968, the Sixers finished 62–20, eight games above Boston, and Chamberlain won his third consecutive MVP award. Both teams met in the Conference Championship again, and the Celtics won the Series in seven games after trailing 3–1, and went on to win the 1968 NBA Championship. After the season, 76ers head coach Alex Hannum left the NBA for the ABA in order to move closer to his family on the West Coast, and Chamberlain requested a trade, and was traded to Los Angeles.\n\n\nWithout Wilt, the Sixers managed a 55–27 record. Though Philadelphia again won the regular-season series against the Celtics, they were no match for Boston in the playoffs and lost 4–1. The Celtics went on to win the championship, their 11th in 13 seasons. After this season, Russell retired and both teams would not meet in the playoffs until 1977. The only two years Russell's Celtics did not win the championship, they lost to teams coached by Alex Hannum.\n\n\n\n### Dr. J and Bird[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Viser, Matt (June 1, 2008). \"Region revs up for an East-West rivalry reborn\". *Boston Globe*. p. A1.

They became a contender in the East, and in Erving's first season with the team, the Sixers eliminated the defending champion Boston Celtics in a tough seven-game Eastern semifinals in 1977. Boston slumped for the next two seasons while Philadelphia continued to be a strong team in the NBA, but in 1978, the Celtics drafted Indiana State forward Larry Bird in the hope of reviving their glory years as a franchise. Bird joined the team for the 1980 season and his impact was immediate. The Celtics improved from a 29–53 record in the 1978–79 season to a league-best 61–21 record in 1979–1980, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals that season to face the Sixers. The Sixers beat Boston in 5 but failed to win the title against the Lakers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01PT1RHw9MSNXVtc2wHD7GQF","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
