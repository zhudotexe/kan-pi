The two highest ranks during the scoring period would be counted, with only the best two if more than that number.\n\n\nFor the first three series if there were equal top scores at the end of the competition the tiebreakers were head-to-head competition and, if necessary, a majority vote of the five WMM race directors. This happened in the 2007–08 women's competition.\n\n\nBeginning in 2009–10 season, following best head-to-head record, the following tie-breakers were implemented, in descending order: the person who achieved his or her points in the fewest races, the person who won the most qualifying races during the period, the person with the fastest average time in their scoring races, and a majority vote of the six-race directors. If the final circumstance is necessary, the race directors could award the title jointly.\n\n\n\n## Major marathons by year[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Tokyo | Boston | London | Berlin | Chicago | New York | World (WCh) or Olympic (OG)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006\n | Not held\n | ![Kenya](image) Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot (1/4) | ![Kenya](image) Felix Limo | ![Ethiopia](image) Haile Gebrselassie (1/4) | ![Kenya](image) Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot (2/4) | ![Brazil](image) Marilson Gomes dos Santos (1/2) | —\n |\n| 2007\n | Was not part of WMM\n | ![Kenya](image) Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot (3/4) | ![Kenya](image) Martin Lel (1/3) | ![Ethiopia](image) Haile Gebrselassie (2/4) | ![Kenya](image) Patrick Ivuti | ![Kenya](image) Martin Lel (2/3) | ![Kenya](image) Luke Kibet (Osaka) WCh\n |\n| 2008\n | Was not part of WMM\n | ![Kenya](image) Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot (4/4) | ![Kenya](image) Martin Lel (3/3) | ![Ethiopia](image) Haile Gebrselassie (3/4) | ![Kenya](image) Evans Cheruiyot | ![Brazil](image) Marilson Gomes dos Santos (2/2) | ![Kenya](image) Samuel Wanjiru (Beijing) OG (1/4) |\n| 2009\n | Was not part of WMM\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Regional | * Arab\n\t+ Outdoor\n\t+ Cross Country\n* GCC Championships\n* Ibero-American Championships\n* Balkan\n\t+ Outdoor\n\t+ Indoor\n\t+ Cross Country\n* Central American\n\t+ Outdoor\n\t+ Cross Country\n\t+ Race Walking\n* Central American and Caribbean\n\t+ Outdoor\n\t+ Cross Country\n* East Caribbean Championships\n* Pan American\n\t+ Combined Events\n\t+ Cross Country\n\t+ Race Walking\n* Southern African\n* West African\n* East African\n* Small States of Europe\n |\n| Seasonal | * World Marathon Majors\n* Diamond League\n* World Continental Tour\n* World Indoor Tour\n* World Cross Country Tour\n* World Race Walking Tour\n* World Combined Events Tour\n* World Label Road Races\n* WMRA World Cup\n |\n| Defunct | * Golden Events\n* Golden Four\n* Grand Prix\n\t+ Grand Prix II\n\t+ Super Grand Prix\n\t+ Final\n* World Athletics Tour\n\t+ Final\n* Golden League\n* World Challenge\n* Indoor Permit Meetings\n* World Cross Challenge\n* Cross Country Permit Meetings\n* Race Walking Challenge Final\n* Hammer Throw Challenge\n* International Cross Country Championships\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Tokyo Marathon | Boston Marathon | London Marathon | Berlin Marathon | Chicago Marathon | New York City Marathon |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016\n | Was not part of WMM\n | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (1/7) | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (2/7) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (1/20) | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (3/7) | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (4/7) |\n| 2017\n | ![United States](image) Amanda McGrory | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (2/20) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (3/20) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (4/20) | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (5/7) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (5/20) |\n| 2018\n | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (6/20) | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (6/7) | ![Australia](image) Madison de Rozario (1/3) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (7/20) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (8/20) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (9/20) |\n| 2019\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01DpRtELazekudnoyeL5fJqA","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

If the final circumstance is necessary, the race directors could award the title jointly.\n\n\n\n## Major marathons by year[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Tokyo | Boston | London | Berlin | Chicago | New York | World (WCh) or Olympic (OG)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006\n | Not held\n | ![Kenya](image) Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot (1/4) | ![Kenya](image) Felix Limo | ![Ethiopia](image) Haile Gebrselassie (1/4) | ![Kenya](image) Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot (2/4) | ![Brazil](image) Marilson Gomes dos Santos (1/2) | —\n |\n| 2007\n | Was not part of WMM\n | ![Kenya](image) Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot (3/4) | ![Kenya](image) Martin Lel (1/3) | ![Ethiopia](image) Haile Gebrselassie (2/4) | ![Kenya](image) Patrick Ivuti | ![Kenya](image) Martin Lel (2/3) | ![Kenya](image) Luke Kibet (Osaka) WCh\n |\n| 2008\n | Was not part of WMM\n | ![Kenya](image) Robert Kipkoech Cheruiyot (4/4) | ![Kenya](image) Martin Lel (3/3) | ![Ethiopia](image) Haile Gebrselassie (3/4) | ![Kenya](image) Evans Cheruiyot | ![Brazil](image) Marilson Gomes dos Santos (2/2) | ![Kenya](image) Samuel Wanjiru (Beijing) OG (1/4) |\n| 2009\n | Was not part of WMM\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Regional | * Arab\n\t+ Outdoor\n\t+ Cross Country\n* GCC Championships\n* Ibero-American Championships\n* Balkan\n\t+ Outdoor\n\t+ Indoor\n\t+ Cross Country\n* Central American\n\t+ Outdoor\n\t+ Cross Country\n\t+ Race Walking\n* Central American and Caribbean\n\t+ Outdoor\n\t+ Cross Country\n* East Caribbean Championships\n* Pan American\n\t+ Combined Events\n\t+ Cross Country\n\t+ Race Walking\n* Southern African\n* West African\n* East African\n* Small States of Europe\n |\n| Seasonal | * World Marathon Majors\n* Diamond League\n* World Continental Tour\n* World Indoor Tour\n* World Cross Country Tour\n* World Race Walking Tour\n* World Combined Events Tour\n* World Label Road Races\n* WMRA World Cup\n |\n| Defunct | * Golden Events\n* Golden Four\n* Grand Prix\n\t+ Grand Prix II\n\t+ Super Grand Prix\n\t+ Final\n* World Athletics Tour\n\t+ Final\n* Golden League\n* World Challenge\n* Indoor Permit Meetings\n* World Cross Challenge\n* Cross Country Permit Meetings\n* Race Walking Challenge Final\n* Hammer Throw Challenge\n* International Cross Country Championships\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Tokyo Marathon | Boston Marathon | London Marathon | Berlin Marathon | Chicago Marathon | New York City Marathon |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016\n | Was not part of WMM\n | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (1/7) | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (2/7) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (1/20) | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (3/7) | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (4/7) |\n| 2017\n | ![United States](image) Amanda McGrory | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (2/20) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (3/20) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (4/20) | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (5/7) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (5/20) |\n| 2018\n | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (6/20) | ![United States](image) Tatyana McFadden (6/7) | ![Australia](image) Madison de Rozario (1/3) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (7/20) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (8/20) | ![Switzerland](image) Manuela Schär (9/20) |\n| 2019\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01DpRtELazekudnoyeL5fJqA","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It is traditionally held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April.[1] Begun in 1897, the event was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics.[2] The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.\n\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897,[3] including a \"virtual alternative\" after the 2020 road race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn October 28, 2020, the B.A.A. announced that the 2021 edition of the marathon would not be held in April; organizers stated that they hoped to stage the event later in the year, possibly in the autumn.[48] In late January 2021, organizers announced October 11 as the date for the marathon, contingent upon road races being allowed in Massachusetts at that time.[49] In March, organizers announced that the field would be limited to 20,000 runners.[50] The race was the fourth of the five World Marathon Majors held in 2021; all the events in the series were run in the space of six weeks between late September and early November.[51] In 2021, the B.A.A. also offered a virtual alternative to the in-person race to be completed anytime between 8-10 October.[52]\n\n\n\n## Race[edit]\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Sports | * Boston Bruins\n* Boston Celtics\n* Boston Marathon\n* Boston Red Sox\n* New England Free Jacks\n* New England Patriots\n* New England Revolution\n |\n| * Suffolk County\n* Greater Boston\n* Massachusetts\n* United States\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Marathon Majors\n |\n| --- |\n| Marathons | * Tokyo\n\t+ winners\n* Boston\n\t+ winners\n* London\n\t+ winners\n* Berlin\n\t+ winners\n* Chicago\n\t+ winners\n* New York City\n\t+ winners\n |\n| Results | * Final standings\n |\n| * Marathons at the World Athletics Championships\n* IAAF World Marathon Cup\n* Marathons at the Olympics\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Athletics Label Road Races\n |\n| --- |\n| Editions | * 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| Platinum | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Marathon | * Amsterdam\n* Berlin\n* Boston\n* Chicago\n* London\n* Nagoya\n* New York City\n* Osaka Women's\n* Seoul\n* Shanghai\n* Sydney\n* Tokyo\n* Valencia\n* Xiamen\n |\n| Half marathon | * Bangsaen\n* Guadalajara\n |\n\n |\n| Gold | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\nThe Boston Marathon was originally a local event, but its fame and status have attracted runners from all over the world. For most of its history, the Boston Marathon was a free event, and the only prize awarded for winning the race was a wreath woven from olive branches.[11] However, corporate-sponsored cash prizes began to be awarded in the 1980s, when professional athletes refused to run the race unless a cash award was available. The first cash prize for winning the marathon was awarded in 1986.[12]\n\n\nWalter A. Brown was the President of the Boston Athletic Association from 1941 to 1964.[13] During the height of the Korean War in 1951, Brown denied Koreans entry into the Boston Marathon. He stated: \"While American soldiers are fighting and dying in Korea, every Korean should be fighting to protect his country instead of training for marathons.

The event was scheduled for the recently established holiday of Patriots' Day, with the race linking the Athenian and American struggles for liberty.[8] The race, which became known as the Boston Marathon, has been held in some form every year since then, even during the World War years and the Great Depression, making it the world's oldest annual marathon. In 1924, the starting line was moved from Metcalf's Mill in Ashland to the neighboring town of Hopkinton. The course was lengthened to 26 miles 385 yards (42.195 km) to conform to the standard set by the 1908 Summer Olympics and codified by the IAAF in 1921.[9] The first 1.9 miles (3.1 km) are run in Hopkinton before the runners enter Ashland.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Gibbs, Roberta \"Bobbi\". \"Roberta \"Bobbi\" Gibb - A Run of One's Own\".

It is traditionally held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April.[1] Begun in 1897, the event was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics.[2] The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.\n\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897,[3] including a \"virtual alternative\" after the 2020 road race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn October 28, 2020, the B.A.A. announced that the 2021 edition of the marathon would not be held in April; organizers stated that they hoped to stage the event later in the year, possibly in the autumn.[48] In late January 2021, organizers announced October 11 as the date for the marathon, contingent upon road races being allowed in Massachusetts at that time.[49] In March, organizers announced that the field would be limited to 20,000 runners.[50] The race was the fourth of the five World Marathon Majors held in 2021; all the events in the series were run in the space of six weeks between late September and early November.[51] In 2021, the B.A.A. also offered a virtual alternative to the in-person race to be completed anytime between 8-10 October.[52]\n\n\n\n## Race[edit]\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Sports | * Boston Bruins\n* Boston Celtics\n* Boston Marathon\n* Boston Red Sox\n* New England Free Jacks\n* New England Patriots\n* New England Revolution\n |\n| * Suffolk County\n* Greater Boston\n* Massachusetts\n* United States\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Marathon Majors\n |\n| --- |\n| Marathons | * Tokyo\n\t+ winners\n* Boston\n\t+ winners\n* London\n\t+ winners\n* Berlin\n\t+ winners\n* Chicago\n\t+ winners\n* New York City\n\t+ winners\n |\n| Results | * Final standings\n |\n| * Marathons at the World Athletics Championships\n* IAAF World Marathon Cup\n* Marathons at the Olympics\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Athletics Label Road Races\n |\n| --- |\n| Editions | * 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| Platinum | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Marathon | * Amsterdam\n* Berlin\n* Boston\n* Chicago\n* London\n* Nagoya\n* New York City\n* Osaka Women's\n* Seoul\n* Shanghai\n* Sydney\n* Tokyo\n* Valencia\n* Xiamen\n |\n| Half marathon | * Bangsaen\n* Guadalajara\n |\n\n |\n| Gold | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\nThe Boston Marathon was originally a local event, but its fame and status have attracted runners from all over the world. For most of its history, the Boston Marathon was a free event, and the only prize awarded for winning the race was a wreath woven from olive branches.[11] However, corporate-sponsored cash prizes began to be awarded in the 1980s, when professional athletes refused to run the race unless a cash award was available. The first cash prize for winning the marathon was awarded in 1986.[12]\n\n\nWalter A.

Cloney wrote back that he could not give Hall a race number, but would recognize Hall as an official finisher if he completed the race in under 3 hours and 30 minutes. Hall finished in 2 hours and 58 minutes, paving the way for the wheelchair division.[83] Ernst Van Dyk, in 2004, set a course record at 1:18.29, almost 50 minutes faster than the fastest runner.[84]\n\n\nHandcyclists have competed in the race since at least 2014. Starting in 2017, handcyclists are honored the same way runners and wheelchair racers are: with wreaths, prize money, and the playing of the men's and women's winners' national anthems.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_012xWLBMxRtLLwGzWwr3KfR7","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The marathon grew in popularity two years later when Norwegian Grete Waitz broke the women's world record, finishing in 2:32:30. She went on to win the race an unprecedented nine times.[9] An official wheelchair and handcycle division was introduced in 2000 and starting in 2002, the elite women are given a 35-minute head start before the elite men and rest of the field.\n\n\nBeginning in 1976, the race was run in late October and continued to be held in late October until 1986, when the race day was moved to November. The earliest race day was the marathon's first; the latest date in the marathon season was November 14, 1993. The hottest year for the race was 1979 when the race day of October 21 reached 80 °F (27 °C). The coldest race was in 1995 when the race day of November 12 only reached 43 °F (6 °C), with an intense wind chill.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Runners before the race at Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in the 2007 marathon.\n![](image)Professional wheelers heading for the starting line in 2007.\nThe 2007 race was held on Sunday, November 4. It was the final race of the 2006–2007 World Marathon Majors, a two-year series of elite marathon racing that also included the Boston, Chicago, London and Berlin marathons. However, there were very few elite American marathoners participating in 2007 because many had competed the day before at the 2008 USA Men's Olympic Marathon Trials, which was held in conjunction with the New York City Marathon on some of the same course.\n\n\nMartin Lel from Kenya won the men's race in a time of 2:09:04, completing a double of the 2007 London and New York Marathons. The women's winner was the world marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain in a time of 2:23:09, one second faster than her 2004 win.\n\n\n\n#### 2008[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| New York City Marathon |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The TCS New York City Marathon logo\n |\n| Date | First Sunday in November[1] |\n| Location | New York City, U.S. |\n| Event type | Road |\n| Distance | Marathon26.219 miles (42.195 km) |\n| Primary sponsor | TCS (since 2013)[2] |\n| Established | 1970, 54 years ago |\n| Course records | 2:04:58 Tamirat Tola (2023)2:22:31 Margaret Okayo (2003) |\n| Official site | www.nycmarathon.org |\n\n\nThe **New York City Marathon**, currently branded as the **TCS New York City Marathon** for sponsorship reasons, is an annual marathon (42.195 km or 26.219 mi) that courses through the five boroughs of New York City.

Gianni Poli of Italy won in 2:11:06, the third year in a row that the men's winner was from Italy. Grete Waitz won for the eighth time in 2:28:06.\n\n\n\n#### 1987[edit]\n\n\nIbrahim Hussein of Kenya won the NYC Marathon in 2:11:01, the first man from Africa to do so.

Gebregziabher Gebremariam of Ethiopia, in his first ever marathon, won the race after breaking away from his last rival, Emmanuel Mutai of Kenya, in the 25th mile to finish in a time of 2:08:14. The race featured 37-year-old world record holder Haile Gebrselassie, who ran with a bad knee and dropped out of the race at the 16th mile. Afterwards, he announced his retirement,[37] but later reversed this decision. Edna Kiplagat won the women's title with a time of 2 hours, 28 minutes, 20 seconds, ahead of American Shalane Flanagan.\n\n\nThe total number of official finishers, 44,829 (28,757 men and 16,072 women) was a new world record for a marathon race.[38]\n\n\n\n#### 2011[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lead women in Brooklyn\nMain article: 2011 New York City Marathon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2008, the race initiated a corral system. Professional women runners were given a separate, earlier start and the balance of the runners began in three staggered starts. The official times are those recorded by a computer chip attached to the back of the runner's bib number, which calculates when a runner crosses the start and when she crosses the finish, known as \"net time\" (as opposed to \"gun time\").\n\n\nRunners also pass timing mats at 5 km intervals along the course, and e-mail notifications can be received by people following runners during the race to track their progress. Although the marathon publicity material uses miles, the timing mats are at 5 km intervals to accommodate the publishing of splits and also enabling potential world records for 20 km, 30 km and other sub-marathon distances to be recorded.\n\n\n\n### Different initial routes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 2011 Marathon was held on November 6. The men's event was won by Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya in a time of 2:05:06, breaking the 10-year-old course record. Second-place runner Emmanuel Mutai, also of Kenya, and third-place runner Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia also beat the previous record for the event, with times of 2:06:28 and 2:07:14, respectively.[39] Geoffrey Mutai, who won the Boston Marathon earlier in the year, became the first man to win both races in course-record time in the same year. Firehiwot Dado of Ethiopia won the women's race in a time of 2:23:15, her first major marathon victory.[40] Coming second, 4 seconds behind the leader originally from Ethiopia, but now living in the Bronx, was Bizunesh Deba with a time of 2:23:19.[41] There were a world record 46,795 official finishers: 29,867 men and 16,928 women.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe New York City Marathon has now become the largest marathon anywhere in the world. Each year nearly two million spectators line the course. Before 2013, the marathon was broadcast live in the New York area on WNBC and on Universal Sports for the entire country; however, in 2013, WABC-TV and ESPN announced they would begin broadcasting the New York City Marathon. Since 2022, the marathon has also been aired in Spanish via ESPN Deportes.[11] The Marathon can also be watched online.[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n### Initial course[edit]\n\n\nThe race was founded by Fred Lebow. Ted Corbitt helped plan the course of the New York City Marathon.[14] The initial course of 1970 consisted of repeated racing around Central Park.[15] As per Ted Corbitt, who measured the original course:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Paula Radcliffe, the victor of the women's division in the 2007 NYC Marathon.\nSee also: List of winners of the New York City Marathon\n\nThe first New York City Marathon was held 54 years ago on September 13, 1970,[6] organized by Fred Lebow and the then president of New York Road Runners, Vincent Chiappetta,[7][8][*better source needed*] with 127 competitors running several loops around the Park Drive of Central Park. Only about 100 spectators watched Gary Muhrcke win the race in 2:31:38. Only 55 runners crossed the finish line.[9]\n\n\nOver the years, the marathon grew larger and larger.[10] To celebrate the U.S. bicentennial in 1976, city auditor George Spitz proposed that the race traverse all five boroughs. With the support of Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, the men convinced Mayor Abraham Beame and, eventually, race director Fred Lebow. The race was a huge success, and what was intended as a one-time celebration became the annual course.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: 2019 New York City Marathon\nThe 49th New York City Marathon took place November 3. Joyciline Jepkosgei, of Kenya, won the women's marathon and Geoffrey Kamworor, also of Kenya, won the men's marathon. Jepkosgei was a first-time winner while Kamworor had won in 2017. Manuela Schär, of Switzerland, won the women's wheelchair competition and Daniel Romanchuk, of the United States, won the men's. The 2019 NYC Marathon set another world record for the number of finishers ever for a marathon with 53,627 runners crossing the finish line.\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2022 marathon as viewed from above 60th St and 1st Avenue in Manhattan, the first full-capacity race since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe race is organized by New York Road Runners and has been run every year since 1970, with the exception of 2012, when it was cancelled due to the landfall of Hurricane Sandy, and 2020, when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race is held on the first Sunday of November and attracts professional competitors and amateurs from all over the world. Because of the popularity of the race, participation is chosen largely by a lottery system. Guaranteed entry to the marathon can be gained by satisfying the requirements of the 9+1 program or the 9+$1K program (where NYRR members run in nine sponsored races and either volunteer at another event or donate $1,000 to support NYRR programs for young athletes), having completed 15 or more previous NYC Marathons, or meeting time qualification standards. In addition, runners can gain an entry by joining a team to raise funds for one of a number of charities.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: 2016 New York City Marathon\nThe 2016 New York City Marathon was run on Sunday, November 6.

Duplicating their London Marathon wins from April 2013, Tsegaye Kebede and Priscah Jeptoo each won $500,000 for their season-wide efforts. After the 2012 cancellation, Geoffrey Mutai returned to become the first repeat winner in 15 years (after John Kagwe in 1997–1998). Under windy conditions, his 2:08:24 was more than 3 minutes slower than in 2011. Mutai broke away around mile 22 to win by almost a minute over Ethiopian Tsegaye Kebede, who had finished third two years earlier.

The marathon grew in popularity two years later when Norwegian Grete Waitz broke the women's world record, finishing in 2:32:30. She went on to win the race an unprecedented nine times.[9] An official wheelchair and handcycle division was introduced in 2000 and starting in 2002, the elite women are given a 35-minute head start before the elite men and rest of the field.\n\n\nBeginning in 1976, the race was run in late October and continued to be held in late October until 1986, when the race day was moved to November. The earliest race day was the marathon's first; the latest date in the marathon season was November 14, 1993. The hottest year for the race was 1979 when the race day of October 21 reached 80 °F (27 °C). The coldest race was in 1995 when the race day of November 12 only reached 43 °F (6 °C), with an intense wind chill.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Runners before the race at Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in the 2007 marathon.\n![](image)Professional wheelers heading for the starting line in 2007.\nThe 2007 race was held on Sunday, November 4. It was the final race of the 2006–2007 World Marathon Majors, a two-year series of elite marathon racing that also included the Boston, Chicago, London and Berlin marathons. However, there were very few elite American marathoners participating in 2007 because many had competed the day before at the 2008 USA Men's Olympic Marathon Trials, which was held in conjunction with the New York City Marathon on some of the same course.\n\n\nMartin Lel from Kenya won the men's race in a time of 2:09:04, completing a double of the 2007 London and New York Marathons. The women's winner was the world marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain in a time of 2:23:09, one second faster than her 2004 win.\n\n\n\n#### 2008[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| New York City Marathon |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The TCS New York City Marathon logo\n |\n| Date | First Sunday in November[1] |\n| Location | New York City, U.S. |\n| Event type | Road |\n| Distance | Marathon26.219 miles (42.195 km) |\n| Primary sponsor | TCS (since 2013)[2] |\n| Established | 1970, 54 years ago |\n| Course records | 2:04:58 Tamirat Tola (2023)2:22:31 Margaret Okayo (2003) |\n| Official site | www.nycmarathon.org |\n\n\nThe **New York City Marathon**, currently branded as the **TCS New York City Marathon** for sponsorship reasons, is an annual marathon (42.195 km or 26.219 mi) that courses through the five boroughs of New York City.

Gianni Poli of Italy won in 2:11:06, the third year in a row that the men's winner was from Italy. Grete Waitz won for the eighth time in 2:28:06.\n\n\n\n#### 1987[edit]\n\n\nIbrahim Hussein of Kenya won the NYC Marathon in 2:11:01, the first man from Africa to do so.

Gebregziabher Gebremariam of Ethiopia, in his first ever marathon, won the race after breaking away from his last rival, Emmanuel Mutai of Kenya, in the 25th mile to finish in a time of 2:08:14. The race featured 37-year-old world record holder Haile Gebrselassie, who ran with a bad knee and dropped out of the race at the 16th mile. Afterwards, he announced his retirement,[37] but later reversed this decision. Edna Kiplagat won the women's title with a time of 2 hours, 28 minutes, 20 seconds, ahead of American Shalane Flanagan.\n\n\nThe total number of official finishers, 44,829 (28,757 men and 16,072 women) was a new world record for a marathon race.[38]\n\n\n\n#### 2011[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lead women in Brooklyn\nMain article: 2011 New York City Marathon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2008, the race initiated a corral system. Professional women runners were given a separate, earlier start and the balance of the runners began in three staggered starts. The official times are those recorded by a computer chip attached to the back of the runner's bib number, which calculates when a runner crosses the start and when she crosses the finish, known as \"net time\" (as opposed to \"gun time\").\n\n\nRunners also pass timing mats at 5 km intervals along the course, and e-mail notifications can be received by people following runners during the race to track their progress. Although the marathon publicity material uses miles, the timing mats are at 5 km intervals to accommodate the publishing of splits and also enabling potential world records for 20 km, 30 km and other sub-marathon distances to be recorded.\n\n\n\n### Different initial routes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 2011 Marathon was held on November 6. The men's event was won by Geoffrey Mutai of Kenya in a time of 2:05:06, breaking the 10-year-old course record. Second-place runner Emmanuel Mutai, also of Kenya, and third-place runner Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia also beat the previous record for the event, with times of 2:06:28 and 2:07:14, respectively.[39] Geoffrey Mutai, who won the Boston Marathon earlier in the year, became the first man to win both races in course-record time in the same year. Firehiwot Dado of Ethiopia won the women's race in a time of 2:23:15, her first major marathon victory.[40] Coming second, 4 seconds behind the leader originally from Ethiopia, but now living in the Bronx, was Bizunesh Deba with a time of 2:23:19.[41] There were a world record 46,795 official finishers: 29,867 men and 16,928 women.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe New York City Marathon has now become the largest marathon anywhere in the world. Each year nearly two million spectators line the course. Before 2013, the marathon was broadcast live in the New York area on WNBC and on Universal Sports for the entire country; however, in 2013, WABC-TV and ESPN announced they would begin broadcasting the New York City Marathon. Since 2022, the marathon has also been aired in Spanish via ESPN Deportes.[11] The Marathon can also be watched online.[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n### Initial course[edit]\n\n\nThe race was founded by Fred Lebow. Ted Corbitt helped plan the course of the New York City Marathon.[14] The initial course of 1970 consisted of repeated racing around Central Park.[15] As per Ted Corbitt, who measured the original course:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Paula Radcliffe, the victor of the women's division in the 2007 NYC Marathon.\nSee also: List of winners of the New York City Marathon\n\nThe first New York City Marathon was held 54 years ago on September 13, 1970,[6] organized by Fred Lebow and the then president of New York Road Runners, Vincent Chiappetta,[7][8][*better source needed*] with 127 competitors running several loops around the Park Drive of Central Park. Only about 100 spectators watched Gary Muhrcke win the race in 2:31:38. Only 55 runners crossed the finish line.[9]\n\n\nOver the years, the marathon grew larger and larger.[10] To celebrate the U.S. bicentennial in 1976, city auditor George Spitz proposed that the race traverse all five boroughs. With the support of Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, the men convinced Mayor Abraham Beame and, eventually, race director Fred Lebow. The race was a huge success, and what was intended as a one-time celebration became the annual course.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: 2019 New York City Marathon\nThe 49th New York City Marathon took place November 3. Joyciline Jepkosgei, of Kenya, won the women's marathon and Geoffrey Kamworor, also of Kenya, won the men's marathon. Jepkosgei was a first-time winner while Kamworor had won in 2017. Manuela Schär, of Switzerland, won the women's wheelchair competition and Daniel Romanchuk, of the United States, won the men's. The 2019 NYC Marathon set another world record for the number of finishers ever for a marathon with 53,627 runners crossing the finish line.\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2022 marathon as viewed from above 60th St and 1st Avenue in Manhattan, the first full-capacity race since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe race is organized by New York Road Runners and has been run every year since 1970, with the exception of 2012, when it was cancelled due to the landfall of Hurricane Sandy, and 2020, when it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race is held on the first Sunday of November and attracts professional competitors and amateurs from all over the world. Because of the popularity of the race, participation is chosen largely by a lottery system. Guaranteed entry to the marathon can be gained by satisfying the requirements of the 9+1 program or the 9+$1K program (where NYRR members run in nine sponsored races and either volunteer at another event or donate $1,000 to support NYRR programs for young athletes), having completed 15 or more previous NYC Marathons, or meeting time qualification standards. In addition, runners can gain an entry by joining a team to raise funds for one of a number of charities.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: 2016 New York City Marathon\nThe 2016 New York City Marathon was run on Sunday, November 6.
