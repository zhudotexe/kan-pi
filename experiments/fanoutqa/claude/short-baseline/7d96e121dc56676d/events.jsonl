The flow rate varies between 600–950 cubic metres per second (21,000–34,000 cu ft/s) depending on the head available; the greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses Francis turbines with a diameter of 9.7/10.4 m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and a rotation speed of 75 revolutions per minute. This means that in order to generate power at 50 Hz, the generator rotors have 80 poles. Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840 MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20 kV. The electricity generated is then stepped up to 500 kV for transmission at 50 Hz. The generator's stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3 m in height; the outer diameter of the stator is 21.4/20.9 m, the inner diameter is 18.5/18.8 m, and the bearing load is 5,050/5,500 tonnes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe dam's body was completed in 2006; the power plant was completed and fully operational by 2012,[10][11] when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production.

The designed hydraulic head of the generators is 80.6 metres (264 ft). The flow rate varies between 600–950 cubic metres per second (21,000–34,000 cu ft/s) depending on the head available; the greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses Francis turbines with a diameter of 9.7/10.4 m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and a rotation speed of 75 revolutions per minute. This means that in order to generate power at 50 Hz, the generator rotors have 80 poles. Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840 MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20 kV. The electricity generated is then stepped up to 500 kV for transmission at 50 Hz. The generator's stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3 m in height; the outer diameter of the stator is 21.4/20.9 m, the inner diameter is 18.5/18.8 m, and the bearing load is 5,050/5,500 tonnes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe dam's body was completed in 2006; the power plant was completed and fully operational by 2012,[10][11] when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production.

Since the output capacity of the Paraguayan generators far exceeds the load in Paraguay, most of their production is exported directly to the Brazilian side, from where two 600 kV HVDC lines, each approximately 800 kilometres (500 mi) long, carry the majority of the energy to the São Paulo/Rio de Janeiro region where the terminal equipment converts the power to 60 Hz.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Negotiations between Brazil and Paraguay[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe name \"Itaipu\" was taken from an isle that existed near the construction site. In the Guarani language, *Itaipu* means \"the sounding stone\".[2] The Itaipu Dam's hydroelectric power plant produced the second-most electricity of any in the world as of 2020, only surpassed by the Three Gorges Dam plant in electricity production.\n\n\nCompleted in 1984, it is a binational undertaking run by Brazil and Paraguay at the border between the two countries, 15 km (9.3 mi) north of the Friendship Bridge. The project ranges from Foz do Iguaçu, in Brazil, and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, in the south to Guaíra and Salto del Guairá in the north. The installed generation capacity of the plant is 14 GW, with 20 generating units providing 700 MW each with a hydraulic design head of 118 metres (387 ft). In 2016, the plant employed 3038 workers.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** Barrionuevo, Alexei (November 11, 2009). \"Brazil Looks for Answers After Huge Blackout\". *New York Times*.

Itaipu is actually four dams joined together – from the far left, an earth fill dam, a rock fill dam, a concrete buttress main dam, and a concrete wing dam to the right.\n* The spillway has a length of 483 metres (1,585 ft).\n* The maximum flow of Itaipu's fourteen segmented spillways is 62.2 thousand cubic metres per second (2.20×10~~^~~6 cu ft/s), into three skislope formed canals. It is equivalent to 40 times the average flow of the nearby natural Iguaçu Falls.\n* The flow of two generators (700 cubic metres per second (25,000 cu ft/s) each) is roughly equivalent to the average flow of the Iguaçu Falls (1,500 cubic metres per second (53,000 cu ft/s)).\n* The dam is 196 metres (643 ft) high, equivalent to a 65-story building.[21]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, Brazil agreed to a fairer payment of electricity to Paraguay and also allowed Paraguay to sell excess power directly to Brazilian companies instead of solely through the Brazilian electricity monopoly.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Construction starts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1970, the consortium formed by the companies ELC Electroconsult S.p.A. (from Italy) and IECO (from the United States)[8] won the international competition for the realization of the viability studies and for the elaboration of the construction project. Design studies began in February 1971. On April 26, 1973, Brazil and Paraguay signed the Itaipu Treaty, the legal instrument for the hydroelectric exploitation of the Paraná River by the two countries. On May 17, 1974, the Itaipu Binacional entity was created to administer the plant's construction. The construction began in January of the following year. Brazil's (and Latin America's) first electric car was introduced in late 1974; it received the name *Itaipu* in honor of the project.[9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn November 10, 2009, transmission from the plant was completely disrupted, possibly due to a storm damaging up to three high-voltage transmission lines.[11] Itaipu itself was not damaged. This caused massive power outages in Brazil and Paraguay, blacking out the entire country of Paraguay for 15 minutes, and plunging Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo into darkness for more than 2 hours. 50 million people were reportedly affected.[12] The blackout hit at 22:13 local time. It affected the southeast of Brazil most severely, leaving São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo completely without electricity. Blackouts also swept through the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, the interior of Bahia and parts of Pernambuco, energy officials said.[13] By 00:30 power had been restored to most areas.\n\n\n\n## Wonder of the Modern World[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** \"Energy | Itaipu Binacional\".\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Itaipu Dam.\n\n* Itaipu Company Site (in Portuguese, English, and Spanish)\n* Introduction Archived 2004-10-20 at the Wayback Machine\n* Power conversion Archived 1999-02-19 at the Wayback Machine\n* Power conditioning Archived 2016-05-19 at the Portuguese Web Archive\n* The Itaipu Transmission System\n* ELC-Electroconsult\n* Voith-Siemens Hydro Power Generation, one of the hydro turbines and generators manufacturer for this project\n* Article on Brazil's Thermoelectric Priority Program Author's updated contact information\n* Panoramic – Itaipu Binacional – Foz do Iguaçu – Brazil Archived 2019-06-28 at the Wayback Machine\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHydroelectric dams on the Paraná River\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Brazil](image) Ilha Solteira\n* Engineer Souza Dias\n* Eng Sérgio Motta\n* ![Paraguay](image) ![Brazil](image) Itaipu\n* ![Paraguay](image) ![Argentina](image) Yacyretá\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_017GUGgQ2EttaLDCZ2CFc3cQ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Since the output capacity of the Paraguayan generators far exceeds the load in Paraguay, most of their production is exported directly to the Brazilian side, from where two 600 kV HVDC lines, each approximately 800 kilometres (500 mi) long, carry the majority of the energy to the São Paulo/Rio de Janeiro region where the terminal equipment converts the power to 60 Hz.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Negotiations between Brazil and Paraguay[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe name \"Itaipu\" was taken from an isle that existed near the construction site. In the Guarani language, *Itaipu* means \"the sounding stone\".[2] The Itaipu Dam's hydroelectric power plant produced the second-most electricity of any in the world as of 2020, only surpassed by the Three Gorges Dam plant in electricity production.\n\n\nCompleted in 1984, it is a binational undertaking run by Brazil and Paraguay at the border between the two countries, 15 km (9.3 mi) north of the Friendship Bridge. The project ranges from Foz do Iguaçu, in Brazil, and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, in the south to Guaíra and Salto del Guairá in the north. The installed generation capacity of the plant is 14 GW, with 20 generating units providing 700 MW each with a hydraulic design head of 118 metres (387 ft). In 2016, the plant employed 3038 workers.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** Barrionuevo, Alexei (November 11, 2009). \"Brazil Looks for Answers After Huge Blackout\". *New York Times*.

Itaipu is actually four dams joined together – from the far left, an earth fill dam, a rock fill dam, a concrete buttress main dam, and a concrete wing dam to the right.\n* The spillway has a length of 483 metres (1,585 ft).\n* The maximum flow of Itaipu's fourteen segmented spillways is 62.2 thousand cubic metres per second (2.20×10~~^~~6 cu ft/s), into three skislope formed canals. It is equivalent to 40 times the average flow of the nearby natural Iguaçu Falls.\n* The flow of two generators (700 cubic metres per second (25,000 cu ft/s) each) is roughly equivalent to the average flow of the Iguaçu Falls (1,500 cubic metres per second (53,000 cu ft/s)).\n* The dam is 196 metres (643 ft) high, equivalent to a 65-story building.[21]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, Brazil agreed to a fairer payment of electricity to Paraguay and also allowed Paraguay to sell excess power directly to Brazilian companies instead of solely through the Brazilian electricity monopoly.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Construction starts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1970, the consortium formed by the companies ELC Electroconsult S.p.A. (from Italy) and IECO (from the United States)[8] won the international competition for the realization of the viability studies and for the elaboration of the construction project. Design studies began in February 1971. On April 26, 1973, Brazil and Paraguay signed the Itaipu Treaty, the legal instrument for the hydroelectric exploitation of the Paraná River by the two countries. On May 17, 1974, the Itaipu Binacional entity was created to administer the plant's construction. The construction began in January of the following year. Brazil's (and Latin America's) first electric car was introduced in late 1974; it received the name *Itaipu* in honor of the project.[9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn November 10, 2009, transmission from the plant was completely disrupted, possibly due to a storm damaging up to three high-voltage transmission lines.[11] Itaipu itself was not damaged. This caused massive power outages in Brazil and Paraguay, blacking out the entire country of Paraguay for 15 minutes, and plunging Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo into darkness for more than 2 hours. 50 million people were reportedly affected.[12] The blackout hit at 22:13 local time. It affected the southeast of Brazil most severely, leaving São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo completely without electricity. Blackouts also swept through the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, the interior of Bahia and parts of Pernambuco, energy officials said.[13] By 00:30 power had been restored to most areas.\n\n\n\n## Wonder of the Modern World[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** \"Energy | Itaipu Binacional\".\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Itaipu Dam.\n\n* Itaipu Company Site (in Portuguese, English, and Spanish)\n* Introduction Archived 2004-10-20 at the Wayback Machine\n* Power conversion Archived 1999-02-19 at the Wayback Machine\n* Power conditioning Archived 2016-05-19 at the Portuguese Web Archive\n* The Itaipu Transmission System\n* ELC-Electroconsult\n* Voith-Siemens Hydro Power Generation, one of the hydro turbines and generators manufacturer for this project\n* Article on Brazil's Thermoelectric Priority Program Author's updated contact information\n* Panoramic – Itaipu Binacional – Foz do Iguaçu – Brazil Archived 2019-06-28 at the Wayback Machine\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHydroelectric dams on the Paraná River\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Brazil](image) Ilha Solteira\n* Engineer Souza Dias\n* Eng Sérgio Motta\n* ![Paraguay](image) ![Brazil](image) Itaipu\n* ![Paraguay](image) ![Argentina](image) Yacyretá\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_017GUGgQ2EttaLDCZ2CFc3cQ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
