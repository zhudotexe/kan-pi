Higher-paying customers, such as Shanghai, receive priority.[79] Nine provinces and two cities consume power from the dam.[80]\n\n\nPower distribution and transmission infrastructure cost about 34.387\u00a0billion yuan. Construction was completed in December 2007, one year ahead of schedule.[81]\n\n\nPower is distributed over multiple 500 kV transmission lines. Three direct current (DC) lines to the East China Grid carry 7,200 MW: Three Gorges \u2013 Shanghai (3,000 MW), HVDC Three Gorges \u2013 Changzhou (3,000 MW), and HVDC Gezhouba \u2013 Shanghai (1,200 MW). The alternating current (AC) lines to the Central China Grid have a total capacity of 12,000 MW.

The designed hydraulic head of the generators is 80.6 metres (264\u00a0ft). The flow rate varies between 600\u2013950 cubic metres per second (21,000\u201334,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) depending on the head available; the greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses Francis turbines with a diameter of 9.7/10.4\u00a0m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and a rotation speed of 75\u00a0revolutions per minute. This means that in order to generate power at 50\u00a0Hz, the generator rotors have 80 poles. Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840\u00a0MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20\u00a0kV. The electricity generated is then stepped up to 500\u00a0kV for transmission at 50\u00a0Hz. The generator's stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3\u00a0m in height; the outer diameter of the stator is 21.4/20.9\u00a0m, the inner diameter is 18.5/18.8\u00a0m, and the bearing load is 5,050/5,500 tonnes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe dam's body was completed in 2006; the power plant was completed and fully operational by 2012,[10][11] when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production.

This record was beaten in 2020, when the Three Gorges Dam produced a new record 111.8 TWh after extensive monsoon rainfall that year.[22]\n\n\nIn the period 2012\u20132021, the Itaipu Dam maintained the second highest average annual hydroelectric production in the world averaging 89.22 TWh per year, second to the 97.22 TWh per year average of the Three Gorges Dam in that period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Santa Maria Ecological Corridor now connects the Igua\u00e7u National Park with the protected margins of Lake Itaipu, and via these margins with the Ilha Grande National Park.[19]\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Central Control Room (CCR)\n![](image)The dam at night\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\n* The course of the seventh biggest river in the world was shifted, as were 50 million tonnes of earth and rock.\n* The amount of concrete used to build the Itaipu Power Plant would be enough to build 210 football stadiums the size of the Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3.\n* The iron and steel used would allow for the construction of 380 Eiffel Towers.\n* The volume of excavation of earth and rock in Itaipu is 8.5 times greater than that of the Channel Tunnel and the volume of concrete is 15 times greater.\n* Around forty thousand people worked in the construction.[20]\n* Itaipu is one of the most expensive objects ever built.\n\n\n### Generating station and dam[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rated nominal power of each generating unit (turbine and generator) is 700 MW. However, because the head (difference between reservoir level and the river level at the bottom of the dam) that actually occurs is higher than the designed head (118\u00a0m or 387\u00a0ft), the power available exceeds 750 MW half of the time for each generator.\nEach turbine generates around 700 MW; by comparison, all the water from the Igua\u00e7u Falls would have the capacity to feed only two generators.\n\n\n\n## November 2009 power failure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2009 Brazil and Paraguay blackout\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Though it is the seventh largest reservoir in size in Brazil, the Itaipu's reservoir has the best relation between electricity production and flooded area. For the 14,000\u00a0MW installed power, 1,350 square kilometres (520\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) were flooded. The reservoirs for the hydroelectric power plants of Sobradinho Dam, Tucuru\u00ed Dam, Porto Primavera Dam, Balbina Dam, Serra da Mesa Dam and Furnas Dam are all larger than the one for Itaipu, but have a smaller installed generating capacity. The one with the next largest hydroelectric production, Tucuru\u00ed, has an installed capacity of 8,000\u00a0MW, while flooding 2,430\u00a0km2 (938\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land.\n* Electricity is 55% cheaper when made by the Itaipu Dam than the other types of power plants in the area.\n\n\n### Generation[edit]\n\n\n![Inside the dam structure](image)\nInside the dam structure\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The dam undergoes expansion work.\nThe last two of the 20 electric generation units started operations in September 2006 and in March 2007, thus raising the installed capacity to 14 GW and completing the power plant. This increase in capacity allows 18 generation units to run permanently while two are shut down for maintenance. Due to a clause in the treaty signed between Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, the maximum number of generating units allowed to operate simultaneously cannot exceed 18 (see the agreement section for more information).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** J\u00falio J\u00fanior, Dei T\u00f3s, Agostinho, and Pavanelli (2009).

In the Guarani language, *Itaipu* means \"the sounding stone\".[2] The Itaipu Dam's hydroelectric power plant produced the second-most electricity of any in the world as of 2020, only surpassed by the Three Gorges Dam plant in electricity production.\n\n\nCompleted in 1984, it is a binational undertaking run by Brazil and Paraguay at the border between the two countries, 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) north of the Friendship Bridge. The project ranges from Foz do Igua\u00e7u, in Brazil, and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, in the south to Gua\u00edra and Salto del Guair\u00e1 in the north. The installed generation capacity of the plant is 14\u00a0GW, with 20 generating units providing 700 MW each with a hydraulic design head of 118 metres (387\u00a0ft). In 2016, the plant employed 3038 workers.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** Barrionuevo, Alexei (November 11, 2009). \"Brazil Looks for Answers After Huge Blackout\". *New York Times*.

It is equivalent to 40 times the average flow of the nearby natural Igua\u00e7u Falls.\n* The flow of two generators (700 cubic metres per second (25,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) each) is roughly equivalent to the average flow of the Igua\u00e7u Falls (1,500 cubic metres per second (53,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)).\n* The dam is 196 metres (643\u00a0ft) high, equivalent to a 65-story building.[21]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, Brazil agreed to a fairer payment of electricity to Paraguay and also allowed Paraguay to sell excess power directly to Brazilian companies instead of solely through the Brazilian electricity monopoly.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Construction starts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1970, the consortium formed by the companies ELC Electroconsult S.p.A. (from Italy) and IECO (from the United States)[8] won the international competition for the realization of the viability studies and for the elaboration of the construction project. Design studies began in February 1971. On April 26, 1973, Brazil and Paraguay signed the Itaipu Treaty, the legal instrument for the hydroelectric exploitation of the Paran\u00e1 River by the two countries. On May 17, 1974, the Itaipu Binacional entity was created to administer the plant's construction. The construction began in January of the following year. Brazil's (and Latin America's) first electric car was introduced in late 1974; it received the name *Itaipu* in honor of the project.[9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn November 10, 2009, transmission from the plant was completely disrupted, possibly due to a storm damaging up to three high-voltage transmission lines.[11] Itaipu itself was not damaged. This caused massive power outages in Brazil and Paraguay, blacking out the entire country of Paraguay for 15 minutes, and plunging Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo into darkness for more than 2 hours. 50 million people were reportedly affected.[12] The blackout hit at 22:13 local time. It affected the southeast of Brazil most severely, leaving S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Esp\u00edrito Santo completely without electricity. Blackouts also swept through the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, the interior of Bahia and parts of Pernambuco, energy officials said.[13] By 00:30 power had been restored to most areas.\n\n\n\n## Wonder of the Modern World[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** \"Energy | Itaipu Binacional\".\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Itaipu Dam.\n\n* Itaipu Company Site (in Portuguese, English, and Spanish)\n* Introduction Archived 2004-10-20 at the Wayback Machine\n* Power conversion Archived 1999-02-19 at the Wayback Machine\n* Power conditioning Archived 2016-05-19 at the Portuguese Web Archive\n* The Itaipu Transmission System\n* ELC-Electroconsult\n* Voith-Siemens Hydro Power Generation, one of the hydro turbines and generators manufacturer for this project\n* Article on Brazil's Thermoelectric Priority Program Author's updated contact information\n* Panoramic \u2013 Itaipu Binacional \u2013 Foz do Igua\u00e7u \u2013 Brazil Archived 2019-06-28 at the Wayback Machine\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHydroelectric dams on the Paran\u00e1 River\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![Brazil](image) Ilha Solteira\n* Engineer Souza Dias\n* Eng S\u00e9rgio Motta\n* ![Paraguay](image) ![Brazil](image) Itaipu\n* ![Paraguay](image) ![Argentina](image) Yacyret\u00e1\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
