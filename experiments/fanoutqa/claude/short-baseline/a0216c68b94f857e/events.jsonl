The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nLife expectancy in world, according to estimation of the World Bank Group, 2019–2021\n\n## United Nations (2021)[edit]\n\n\nShown is the \"period life expectancy\" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Countries\n | Life expectancy at birth\n | HALE at birth\n | Life expectancy at age 60\n | HALE at age 60\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All\n | M | F | FΔM | Δ2000 | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n |\n| ![](image) Japan | 84.3 | 81.5 | 86.9 | 5.4 | 3.2 | 74.1 | 72.6 | 75.5 | 2.9 | 2.5 | 26.3 | 23.9 | 28.6 | 4.7 | 2.2 | 20.4 | 18.8 | 21.8 | 3.0 | 1.7 | ![Japan](image) |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | 83.4 | 81.8 | 85.1 | 3.3 | 3.7 | 72.5 | 72.2 | 72.8 | 0.6 | 3.2 | 25.4 | 24.1 | 26.6 | 2.5 | 2.4 | 19.5 | 18.8 | 20.2 | 1.4 | 1.8 | ![Switzerland](image) |\n| ![](image) South Korea | 83.3 | 80.3 | 86.1 | 5.8 | 7.1 | 73.1 | 71.3 | 74.7 | 3.4 | 5.7 | 25.8 | 23.4 | 27.9 | 4.5 | 5.1 | 19.8 | 18.2 | 21.2 | 3.0 | 3.9 | ![South Korea](image) |\n| ![](image) Singapore | 83.2 | 81.0 | 85.5 | 4.5 | 4.8 | 73.6 | 72.4 | 74.7 | 2.3 | 4.1 | 25.5 | 23.8 | 27.2 | 3.4 | 4.0 | 20.0 | 18.8 | 21.0 | 2.2 | 3.4 | ![Singapore](image) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Mozambique | 57.10 | 55.76 | 58.49\n | 2.73\n |\n| ![](image) Somalia | 55.72 | 53.39 | 58.12\n | 4.73\n |\n| ![](image) Central African Republic | 55.52 | 54.19 | 56.88\n | 2.69\n |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 53.65 | 52.10 | 54.28\n | 2.18\n |\n|  World (2020) | 70.50 | 68.40 | 72.60\n | 4.20\n |\n| *![](image) European Union (2021)* | 77.63 | 72.98 | 82.51\n | 9.53\n |\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison of average female and male life expectancy as defined by WHO for 2019.

The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nLife expectancy in world, according to estimation of the World Bank Group, 2019–2021\n\n## United Nations (2021)[edit]\n\n\nShown is the \"period life expectancy\" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Countries\n | Life expectancy at birth\n | HALE at birth\n | Life expectancy at age 60\n | HALE at age 60\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All\n | M | F | FΔM | Δ2000 | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n | All\n | M\n | F\n | FΔM\n | Δ2000\n |\n| ![](image) Japan | 84.3 | 81.5 | 86.9 | 5.4 | 3.2 | 74.1 | 72.6 | 75.5 | 2.9 | 2.5 | 26.3 | 23.9 | 28.6 | 4.7 | 2.2 | 20.4 | 18.8 | 21.8 | 3.0 | 1.7 | ![Japan](image) |\n| ![](image) Switzerland | 83.4 | 81.8 | 85.1 | 3.3 | 3.7 | 72.5 | 72.2 | 72.8 | 0.6 | 3.2 | 25.4 | 24.1 | 26.6 | 2.5 | 2.4 | 19.5 | 18.8 | 20.2 | 1.4 | 1.8 | ![Switzerland](image) |\n| ![](image) South Korea | 83.3 | 80.3 | 86.1 | 5.8 | 7.1 | 73.1 | 71.3 | 74.7 | 3.4 | 5.7 | 25.8 | 23.4 | 27.9 | 4.5 | 5.1 | 19.8 | 18.2 | 21.2 | 3.0 | 3.9 | ![South Korea](image) |\n| ![](image) Singapore | 83.2 | 81.0 | 85.5 | 4.5 | 4.8 | 73.6 | 72.4 | 74.7 | 2.3 | 4.1 | 25.5 | 23.8 | 27.2 | 3.4 | 4.0 | 20.0 | 18.8 | 21.0 | 2.2 | 3.4 | ![Singapore](image) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Mozambique | 57.10 | 55.76 | 58.49\n | 2.73\n |\n| ![](image) Somalia | 55.72 | 53.39 | 58.12\n | 4.73\n |\n| ![](image) Central African Republic | 55.52 | 54.19 | 56.88\n | 2.69\n |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 53.65 | 52.10 | 54.28\n | 2.18\n |\n|  World (2020) | 70.50 | 68.40 | 72.60\n | 4.20\n |\n| *![](image) European Union (2021)* | 77.63 | 72.98 | 82.51\n | 9.53\n |\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison of average female and male life expectancy as defined by WHO for 2019.

It's worth noting that life expectancy can vary significantly between males and females within each country, with females typically having a higher life expectancy. The data also shows that there have been some fluctuations in recent years, particularly due to the impact of COVID-19 on global life expectancy figures.\n\nThese numbers reflect various factors including the quality of healthcare, living conditions, diet, lifestyle, and access to medical services in each country. China has the highest life expectancy among these four countries, while India has the lowest of the four.","name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":null}}
