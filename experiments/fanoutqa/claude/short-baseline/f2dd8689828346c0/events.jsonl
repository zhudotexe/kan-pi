It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]\n\n\nThis tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December instead of in the traditional months of May, June, or July.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities.

This year, rare cards with coloured borders were included and could be collected, traded, or sold.[244]\n\n\nOn 12 April 2022, FIFA released an over-the-top media service and app revolving around the World Cup called FIFA+, where fans could play games, predict matches, and compete with others.[245]\n\n\n\n### Broadcasting rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 FIFA World Cup broadcasting rights\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBefore submitting their final squad for the tournament, teams named a provisional squad of up to 55 players.

It was the first World Cup to be held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]\n\n\nThis tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot climate,[B] the event was held during November and December instead of in the traditional months of May, June, or July.[C] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2022 FIFA World Cup| كأس العالم لكرة القدم 2022*Kaʾs al-ʿālam li-kurat al-qadam 2022* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)الآن هو كل شيء‎*Al-ʾāna huwa kullu šayʾ*\"Now Is All\"[1]\n |\n| Tournament details |\n| Host country | Qatar |\n| Dates | 20 November – 18 December |\n| Teams | 32 (from 5 confederations) |\n| Venue(s) | 8 (in 5 host cities) |\n| Final positions |\n| Champions | ![](image) Argentina (3rd title) |\n| Runners-up | ![](image) France |\n| Third place | ![](image) Croatia |\n| Fourth place | ![](image) Morocco |\n| Tournament statistics |\n| Matches played | 64 |\n| Goals scored | 172 (2.69 per match) |\n| Attendance | 3,404,252 (53,191 per match) |\n| Top scorer(s) | ![France](image) Kylian Mbappé (8 goals) |\n| Best player(s) | ![Argentina](image) Lionel Messi |\n| Best young player | ![Argentina](image) Enzo Fernández |\n| Best goalkeeper | ![Argentina](image) Emiliano Martínez |\n| Fair play award | ![](image) England |\n| ← 2018\n*2026* →\n |\n\nInternational football competition\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe FIFA World Cup is a professional football tournament held between national football teams, organised by FIFA.[13][14] The tournament, held every four years, was first played in 1930 in Uruguay,[15] and has been contested by 32 teams since the 1998 event.[15] The tournament was contested with eight round-robin groups followed by a knockout round for 16 teams.[16] The defending champions were France, who defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.[17][18] The event was scheduled to take place under a reduced length,[19] from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar.[20][21][22] Being held in Qatar, it was the first World Cup tournament to be held in the Arab world.[23] Spectators were not required to follow most COVID-19 pandemic restrictions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.[24]\n\n\n\n### Schedule[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n219. **^** Hunter, Laura (10 December 2022). \"World Cup 2022 – Croatia 1–1 Brazil AET (4–2 on pens): Croatia stun five-time world champions in dramatic penalty shootout win\". *Sky Sports*.

The players that came closest were Kocsis in 1954, Müller in 1970 and Portugal's Eusébio in 1966, with 11, 10 and 9, respectively. The lowest scoring top scorer was in 1962, when six players tied at only four goals each. Across the 22 tournaments of the World Cup, 31 footballers have been credited with the most tournament goals, and no one has achieved this feat twice. Ten of them scored at least seven goals in a tournament, while Brazil's Jairzinho and Argentine's Lionel Messi were the only footballers to score at least seven goals without being the top goalscorer of the tournament in 1970 and 2022, respectively. These 31 top goalscorers played for 20 nations, the most (five) for Brazil.

At the next tournament, France's Just Fontaine improved on this record with 13 goals in only six games. Gerd Müller scored 10 for West Germany in 1970 and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal in a tournament match at a World Cup during West Germany's win in the 1974 final. His record stood for more than three decades until Ronaldo's 15 goals between 1998 and 2006 for Brazil.

Gerd Müller scored 10 for West Germany in 1970 and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal in a tournament match at a World Cup during West Germany's win in the 1974 final. His record stood for more than three decades until Ronaldo's 15 goals between 1998 and 2006 for Brazil.
