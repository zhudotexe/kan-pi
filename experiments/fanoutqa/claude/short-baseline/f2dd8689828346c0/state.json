Since then, only 25 players have scored more at all the games played at the World Cup than St\u00e1bile did throughout the 1930 tournament. The first was Hungary's S\u00e1ndor Kocsis with eleven in 1954. At the next tournament, France's Just Fontaine improved on this record with 13 goals in only six games. Gerd M\u00fcller scored 10 for West Germany in 1970 and broke the overall record when he scored his 14th goal in a tournament match at a World Cup during West Germany's win in the 1974 final. His record stood for more than three decades until Ronaldo's 15 goals between 1998 and 2006 for Brazil. Germany's Miroslav Klose went on to score a record 16 goals across four consecutive tournaments between 2002 and 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n90. **^** \"Rom\u00e1rio (Rom\u00e1rio de Souza Faria)\".

He also won the Silver Ball award for the second-best player of the tournament. This performance added to his impressive World Cup record, as he now has 12 total World Cup goals across two tournaments (2018 and 2022).\n\nSome notable achievements from Mbapp\u00e9's 2022 World Cup performance:\n- He became the first player to score 4 goals in World Cup finals, after his hat-trick in the 2022 final against Argentina\n- He tied the record for most goals (8) in World Cup knockout matches\n- His 8 goals in the 2022 tournament was the highest total by any player in a single World Cup since Ronaldo scored 8 for Brazil in 2002\n\nWould you like me to provide any additional specific information about the 2022 World Cup top scorers or Mbapp\u00e9's performance?",
