The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nLife expectancy in world, according to estimation of the World Bank Group, 2019\u20132021\n\n## United Nations (2021)[edit]\n\n\nShown is the \"period life expectancy\" at birth. This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \u2265 85.0\n 80.0 \u2013 84.9\n | 75.0 \u2013 79.9\n 70.0 \u2013 74.9\n | 65.0 \u2013 69.9\n 60.0 \u2013 64.9\n | < 60.0\n no data\n |\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in some big countries of the world\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in some European countries\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in some European countries\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in some European countries (continue)\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan\n\n![](image)life expectancy in countries of the South Caucasus and neighboring countries\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in some Asian countries\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in some countries of South-East Asia and Oceania\n\n![](image)Life expectancy at birth in some countries of the Near East\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in some North American countries\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in some South American countries\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in some African countries\n\n![](image)Life expectancy and HALE in various countries of the world in 2019, according to estimation of WHO\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Countries\n | Life expectancy at birth\n | HALE at birth\n | Life expectancy at age 60\n | HALE at age 60\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All\n | M | F | F\u0394M | \u03942000 | All\n | M\n | F\n | F\u0394M\n | \u03942000\n | All\n | M\n | F\n | F\u0394M\n | \u03942000\n | All\n | M\n | F\n | F\u0394M\n | \u03942000\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 84.3 | 81.5 | 86.9 | 5.4 | 3.2 | 74.1 | 72.6 | 75.5 | 2.9 | 2.5 | 26.3 | 23.9 | 28.6 | 4.7 | 2.2 | 20.4 | 18.8 | 21.8 | 3.0 | 1.7 | ![Japan](image) |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Switzerland | 83.4 | 81.8 | 85.1 | 3.3 | 3.7 | 72.5 | 72.2 | 72.8 | 0.6 | 3.2 | 25.4 | 24.1 | 26.6 | 2.5 | 2.4 | 19.5 | 18.8 | 20.2 | 1.4 | 1.8 | ![Switzerland](image) |\n| ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 83.3 | 80.3 | 86.1 | 5.8 | 7.1 | 73.1 | 71.3 | 74.7 | 3.4 | 5.7 | 25.8 | 23.4 | 27.9 | 4.5 | 5.1 | 19.8 | 18.2 | 21.2 | 3.0 | 3.9 | ![South Korea](image) |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Singapore | 83.2 | 81.0 | 85.5 | 4.5 | 4.8 | 73.6 | 72.4 | 74.7 | 2.3 | 4.1 | 25.5 | 23.8 | 27.2 | 3.4 | 4.0 | 20.0 | 18.8 | 21.0 | 2.2 | 3.4 | ![Singapore](image) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** \"Life expectancy and Healthy life expectancy, data by WHO region\".
