It was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in original release as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances, musical score and visual effects, but criticism for its characters. It grossed over $817.4\u00a0million worldwide,[2] becoming the highest-grossing film of 1996 and the second-highest-grossing film ever at the time, behind *Jurassic Park* (1993). The film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound.[4]\n\n\nThe sequel, *Independence Day: Resurgence*, was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, as part of a planned series of films.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Will Smith\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Film Editing\n | David Brenner\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Sound\n | Chris CarpenterBill W.

With advancements in CGI special effects, events depicting mass destruction became commonplace in films that soon followed, such as *Dante's Peak* and *Volcano* (both in 1997), as well as *Deep Impact* and *Armageddon* (both in 1998). The trend resumed from the mid-2000s to 2010s, evident in three of Emmerich's films titled *The Day After Tomorrow* (2004), *2012* (2009), and *White House Down* (2013), as well as other blockbusters like *Transformers* (2007) and *The Avengers* (2012).[117]\n\n\n\n## In other media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe next day on July 3, the film officially opened to the public with $17.4 million.[66] During its second day of release, it earned $17.3 million, which made it the highest Thursday gross, holding this record for six years until it was taken by *Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones* in 2002.[67] This was also the highest non-sequel Thursday gross, which would last until the opening of *Transformers* in 2007.[68] *Independence Day* earned $104.3\u00a0million in its opening week,[69] including $96.1\u00a0million during its five-day holiday opening, and $50.2\u00a0million during its opening weekend.[70] The film stayed in the number-one spot for three consecutive weeks before being displaced by *A Time to Kill*.[71][2] Moreover, it beat *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*'s record for largest five-day Wednesday gross of any film, as well as the biggest July opening weekend.[72] The combined total for the five-day Wednesday opening increased to $190 million, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** \"'Independence Day: 20th Anniversary Edition' to Invade 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray - High-Def Digest\".

For one, \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly\u00a0... *Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[144] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[142] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple *Titanic* off its perch. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997.

It would go on to surpass *The Godfather Part III*'s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2\u00a0million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6\u00a0million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing *Scream 2*.[114] By New Year's Day, *Titanic* had made over $120\u00a0million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEmpire Award for Best Film\n |\n| --- |\n| * *Braveheart* (1996)\n* *Se7en* (1997)\n* *Men in Black* (1998)\n* *Titanic* (1999)\n* *The Matrix* (2000)\n* *Gladiator* (2001)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (2002)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* (2003)\n* *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (2004)\n* *The Bourne Supremacy* (2005)\n* *King Kong* (2006)\n* *Casino Royale* (2007)\n* *The Bourne Ultimatum* (2008)\n* *The Dark Knight* (2009)\n* *Avatar* (2010)\n* *Inception* (2011)\n* *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2* (2012)\n* *Skyfall* (2013)\n* *Gravity* (2014)\n* *Interstellar* (2015)\n* *The Revenant* (2016)\n* *Rogue One* (2017)\n* *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* (2018)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** Wilson, Jeff (December 30, 1997). \"'Scream 2' losing its voice at box office\". *Associated Press Writer*.
