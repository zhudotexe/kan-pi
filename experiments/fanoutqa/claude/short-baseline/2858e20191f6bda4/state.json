Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, Ulugh Muztagh on the north Tibetan Plateau is often listed as 7,723\u00a0m (25,338\u00a0ft) to 7,754\u00a0m (25,440\u00a0ft), but appears to be only 6,973\u00a0m (22,877\u00a0ft) to 6,987\u00a0m (22,923\u00a0ft). Some mountains differ by > 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft) on different maps, while even very thorough current measurements of Mount Everest range from 8,840\u00a0m (29,003\u00a0ft) to 8,848\u00a0m (29,029\u00a0ft). These discrepancies serve to emphasize the uncertainties in the listed heights.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlmost all mountains in the list are located in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges to the south and west of the Tibetan plateau. All peaks 7,000\u00a0m (23,000\u00a0ft) or higher are located in East, Central or South Asia in a rectangle edged by Noshaq (7,492\u00a0m or 24,580\u00a0ft) on the Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan border in the west, Jengish Chokusu (Tu\u014dm\u00f9'\u011br F\u0113ng, 7,439\u00a0m or 24,406\u00a0ft) on the Kyrgyzstan\u2013Xinjiang border to the north, Gongga Shan (Minya Konka, 7,556\u00a0m or 24,790\u00a0ft) in Sichuan to the east, and Kabru (7,412\u00a0m or 24,318\u00a0ft) on the Sikkim\u2013Nepal border to the south.\n\n\nAs of December\u00a02018[update], the highest peaks on four of the mountains\u2014Gangkhar Puensum, Labuche Kang III, Karjiang, and Tongshanjiabu, all located in Bhutan or China\u2014have not been ascended. The most recent peak to have its first ever ascent is Saser Kangri II East, in India, on 24 August 2011.\n\n\nThe highest mountain outside of Asia is Aconcagua (6,961\u00a0m or 22,838\u00a0ft), the 189th highest in the world.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## List of world's highest peaks[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about mountains by height from sea level.

The peak rises over Lhotse, while Nuptse is the ridge on the left.\nThere are at least 108 mountains on Earth with elevations of 7,200 metres (23,622\u00a0ft) or greater above sea level. The vast majority of these mountains are located on the edge of the Indian and Eurasian plates in China, India, Nepal and Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Here defined as the first higher mountain beyond the key saddle with at least 500 m prominence itself.\n6. **^** The number of ascents and failed attempts up to 2004 is extracted from [13] These are the number of expeditions (not individuals) that announced their ascent or attempt in a journal. They are probably quite accurate for the rarely climbed peaks (though omissions were noted), but greatly underestimate the number of ascending parties on the easier and/or more popular mountains, like most eight-thousanders. For instance, Mount Everest has been scaled 2,251 times by individuals up to 2004 .[14]\n7. **^** Given the large differences between multiple \"definitive\" measurements of Mount Everest, the traditional 8,848 m is listed. For more information, see Mount Everest#Surveys.\n8. **^** Cho Oyu's height is 8,188 m according to the Nepal Survey's 1996 topographical map,[15] which represents the best known measurement to date. Previous estimates have been 8,153 m and 8,201 m\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Rank[dp 1] | Mountain name(s)\n | Height(rounded)[dp 2] | Prominence(rounded)[dp 3] | Range\n | Coordinates[dp 4] | Parent mountain[dp 5] | Ascents before2004[dp 6] | Country\n | Photo\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1st\n | successful\n |\n| m\n | ft\n | m\n | ft\n | y | n |\n| 1\n | * Mount Everest\n* Sagarmatha\n* Chomolungma\n | 8,849\n | 29,032[dp 7] | 8,849\n | 29,032\n | Mahalangur Himalaya | 27\u00b059\u203217\u2033N 86\u00b055\u203230\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff27.9881\u00b0N 86.925\u00b0E\ufeff / 27.9881; 86.925\ufeff (1.

Still, heights or prominences may be revised, so that the order of the list may change and even new mountains could enter the list over time. To be safe, the list has been extended to include all 7,200\u00a0m (23,622\u00a0ft) peaks.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe highest mountains are also not generally the most voluminous. Mauna Loa (4,169\u00a0m or 13,678\u00a0ft) is the largest mountain on Earth in terms of base area (about 2,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi or 5,200\u00a0km2) and volume (about 10,000\u00a0cu\u00a0mi or 42,000\u00a0km3), although, due to the intergrade of lava from Kilauea, Hualalai and Mauna Kea, the volume can only be estimated based on surface area and height of the edifice. Mount Kilimanjaro is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area (245\u00a0sq\u00a0mi or 635\u00a0km2) and volume (1,150\u00a0cu\u00a0mi or 4,793\u00a0km3). Mount Logan is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area (120\u00a0sq\u00a0mi or 311\u00a0km2).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe highest mountains above sea level are generally not the highest above the surrounding terrain. There is no precise definition of surrounding base, but Denali,[1] Mount Kilimanjaro[2] and Nanga Parbat[3] are possible candidates for the tallest mountain on land by this measure. The bases of mountain islands are below sea level, and given this consideration Mauna Kea (4,207\u00a0m (13,802\u00a0ft) above sea level) is the world's tallest mountain and volcano, rising about 10,203\u00a0m (33,474\u00a0ft) from the Pacific Ocean floor. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Annapurna Himalaya | 28\u00b035\u203206\u2033N 83\u00b059\u203224\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff28.58500\u00b0N 83.99000\u00b0E\ufeff / 28.58500; 83.99000\ufeff (42.
