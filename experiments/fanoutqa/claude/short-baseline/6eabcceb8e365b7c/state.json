The league's dominant team during this period was the Tokyo Kyojin, which won nine league championships, including six in a row from 1938 to 1943. (The team was officially renamed the Yomiuri Giants in 1947.)\n\n\n\n### NPB establishment[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 1949 season, the JBL team owners reorganized into the NPB; Daiei Stars owner Masaichi Nagata promoted a two-league system, which became the Pacific League (initially called the **Taiheiyo Baseball Union**) and the Central League. (Nagata became the first president of the Pacific League.)[11] The league now known as Nippon Pro Baseball began play in the 1950 season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNippon Professional Baseball consists of two leagues, the Central League and the Pacific League, which each have six teams. There are also two secondary-level professional minor leagues, the Eastern League and the Western League, that play shorter schedules for developing players. NPB teams are allowed to have more than one minor league team as long as they are outside of the established minor league system, with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks and Yomiuri Giants being the only teams taking advantage of this. As of 2023, the Hawks have three minor league teams,[3] the Giants have two, and the other ten teams only have one minor league team each. Teams below the Eastern and Western Leagues play exhibition matches against various teams of collegiate, industrial, Shikoku Island League Plus, and other NPB minor league statuses.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Locality\n | 1950\n | 1951\u20131952\n | 1953\n | 1954\n | 1955\u20131956\n | 1957\n | 1958\u20131972\n | 1973\u20131977\n | 1978\n | 1979\u20131988\n | 1989\u20132003\n | 2004\n | 2005\u20132022\n | 2023-present\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sapporo |  | Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (PL), 2004\u20132022\n |\n| Kitahiroshima |  | Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (PL), 2023\u2013present\n |\n| Sendai |  | Lotte Orions (PL), 1973\u20131977\n |  | Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles (PL), 2005\u2013present\n |\n| Greater Tokyo | Kokutetsu Swallows / Sankei Atoms / Yakult Swallows (CL), 1950\u2013present\n |\n| Yomiuri Giants (CL), 1950\u2013present\n |\n| Toei Flyers / Nippon-Ham Fighters (PL), 1950\u20132003\n |\n| Mainichi/Daimai/Tokyo/Lotte Orions (PL), 1950\u20131972\n |  | Lotte Orions / Chiba Lotte Marines (PL), 1978\u2013present\n |\n|  | Takahashi Unions (PL), 1954\u20131956\n | Daiei Unions (PL), 1957\n |  | Saitama Seibu Lions (PL), 1979\u2013present\n |\n| Daiei Stars (PL), 1950\u20131956\n |\n|  | Taiyo Whales / Yokohama BayStars (CL), 1955\u2013present\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Defunct Clubs |\n| --- |\n| Team\n | City\n | Stadium\n | Founded\n | Ceased Operations\n | Notes\n |\n| **Nishi Nippon Pirates** | Fukuoka, Fukuoka | 52 stadiums in 29 prefectures across Japan[36] | 1950\n | January 30, 1951[37] | Merged with the Nishitetsu Clippers to form the Fukuoka Nishitetsu Lions (now known as the Saitama Seibu Lions)\n |\n| **Shochiku Robins** | Kyoto, Kyoto | Kinugasa Stadium | 1936\n | January 1, 1953[38] | Merged with the Taiyo Whales to form the Taiyo-Shochiku Robins (now known as the Yokohama DeNA BayStars)\n |\n| **Takahashi Unions** | Kawasaki, Kanagawa | Kawasaki Stadium | 1954\n | February 25, 1957[39] | Merged with the Daiei Stars to form the Daiei Unions |\n| **Daiei Unions** | Bunky\u014d, Tokyo | Korakuen Stadium | 1946\n | November 24, 1957[40] | Merged with the Mainichi Orions to form the Daimai Orions (now known as the Chiba Lotte Marines)\n |\n| **Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes** | Osaka, Osaka | Kyocera Dome Osaka | 1949\n | December 1, 2004\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Team\n | City\n | Stadium\n | Capacity\n | Coordinates\n | Founded\n | Manager\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Central League |\n| **Chunichi Dragons** | Nagoya, Aichi | Vantelin Dome Nagoya | 40,500\n | 35\u00b011\u203215.36\u2033N 136\u00b056\u203257.119\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff35.1876000\u00b0N 136.94919972\u00b0E\ufeff / 35.1876000; 136.94919972\ufeff (Vantelin Dome Nagoya) | January 15, 1936[32] | Kazuyoshi Tatsunami |\n| **Hanshin Tigers** | HQ in Nishinomiya, Hy\u014dgo\nPlays between\nOsaka and Hyogo[33]\n | Hanshin Koshien StadiumKyocera Dome Osaka | 47,757\nand\n36,477\n | 34\u00b043\u203216.34\u2033N 135\u00b021\u203241.84\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff34.7212056\u00b0N 135.3616222\u00b0E\ufeff / 34.7212056; 135.3616222\ufeff (Hanshin Koshien Stadium)34\u00b040\u20329.48\u2033N 135\u00b028\u203233.97\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff34.6693000\u00b0N 135.4761028\u00b0E\ufeff / 34.6693000; 135.4761028\ufeff (Kyocera Dome Osaka) | December 10, 1935\n | Akinobu Okada |\n| **Hiroshima Toyo Carp** | Hiroshima, Hiroshima | Mazda Stadium | 32,000\n | 34\u00b023\u203233\u2033N 132\u00b029\u20322.4\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff34.39250\u00b0N 132.484000\u00b0E\ufeff / 34.39250; 132.484000\ufeff (Mazda Stadium) | December 5, 1949\n | Takahiro Arai |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Nagoya | Chunichi Dragons (CL), 1950\u2013present\n |\n| Greater Osaka | Hanshin Tigers (CL), 1950\u2013present\n |\n| Hankyu Braves / Orix BlueWave (PL), 1950\u20132004\n | Orix Buffaloes (PL), 2005\u2013present\n |\n| Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes (PL), 1950\u20132004\n |\n| Nankai Hawks (PL), 1950\u20131988\n |\n| Shochiku Robins (CL), 1950\u20131954\n |\n| Hiroshima | Hiroshima Toyo Carp (CL), 1950\u2013present\n |\n| Shimonoseki | Taiyo Whales (CL), 1950\u20131952\n |\n| Fukuoka | Nishitetsu Lions (PL), 1950\u20131978\n |  | Fukuoka Daiei/SoftBank Hawks (PL), 1989\u2013present\n |\n| Nishi Nippon Pirates (CL), 1950\n |\n\n\n## Champions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japan Series\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFour JBL teams formed the basis of the Central League: the Chunichi Dragons, the Hanshin Tigers, the Yomiuri Giants, and the Shochiku Robins (formerly the Taiy\u014d Robins).

Although the team was stocked with players from the other Pacific League teams, the Unions struggled from the outset and finished in the second division every season. In 1957, the Unions were merged with the Daiei Stars to form the Daiei Unions (and again bringing the number of Pacific League teams down to seven). The Unions existed for a single season, finishing in last place, 43-1/2 games out of first. In 1958, the Unions merged with the Mainichi Orions to form the Daimai Orions. This enabled the Pacific League to contract from the ungainly seven-team arrangement to six teams.\n\n\nAfter these various franchise developments, by the end of the 1950s Nippon Professional Baseball had contracted from the initial allotment of 15 teams down to the current number of 12.\n\n\n\n### 1960s and 1970s[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUntil 1993, baseball was the only team sport played professionally in Japan. In that year, the J.League professional football league was founded. The new football league placed teams in prefectural capitals around the country\u2014rather than clustering them in and around Tokyo\u2014and the teams were named after their locations rather than after corporate sponsors, despite many clubs in the J.League still being owned and subsidized by corporate entities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* YouTube (Pacific League TV ENG)\n |\n| Official website | NPB.jp |\n\n\n**Nippon Professional Baseball** (\u65e5\u672c\u91ce\u7403\u6a5f\u69cb, *Nippon Yaky\u016b Kik\u014d*) or **NPB** is the highest level of baseball in Japan. Locally, it is often called **Puro Yaky\u016b** (\u30d7\u30ed\u91ce\u7403), meaning *Professional Baseball*. Outside of Japan, it is often referred to as \"Japanese baseball\".\n\n\nThe roots of the league can be traced back to the formation of the \"Greater Japan Tokyo Baseball Club\" (\u5927\u65e5\u672c\u6771\u4eac\u91ce\u7403\u5036\u697d\u90e8, *Dai-Nippon T\u014dky\u014d Yaky\u016b Kurabu*) in Tokyo, founded in 1934, and the original circuit for the sport in the Empire founded two years later, the Japanese Baseball League (JBL), which continued to play even through the final years of World War II. The organization that is today's NPB was formed when the JBL reorganized in 1950, creating two leagues with six teams each in the Central League and the Pacific League with an annual season-ending Japan Series championship play-off series of games starting that year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNippon Professional Baseball seasons\n |\n| --- |\n| 1930s\u20131940s (Japanese Baseball League) | * 1936\n* 1937\n* 1938\n* 1939\n* 1940\n* 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944\n* 1945\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1948\n* 1949\n |\n| 1950s\u20131960s | * 1950\n* 1951\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1954\n* 1955\n* 1956\n* 1957\n* 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n |\n| 1970s\u20131980s | * 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n |\n| 1990s\u20132000s | * 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n |\n| 2010s\u20132020s | * 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n |\n| * Japan Series\n* Climax Series\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 1986 an All-Star team from Major League Baseball (MLB) is sent to a biennial end-of-the-season tour of Japan, dubbed as MLB Japan All-Star Series, playing exhibition games in a best-of format against the All-Stars from NPB or recently as of 2014 the national team Samurai Japan.\n\n\nThe 2014 series also celebrated the 80th anniversary of the establishment of Japan's professional baseball by holding an exhibition game of a joint team of Hanshin Tigers and Yomiuri Giants against the MLB All-Stars at the Koshien Stadium on November 11, 2014.\n\n\n\n## Agreement and systems[edit]\n\n\n* Nippon Professional Baseball Agreement\n* Nippon Professional Baseball rosters\n* Registration of players under control\n* Developmental player system\n* Nippon Professional Baseball draft\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n* ![flag](image)Japan portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kazuo Matsui: After eight stellar seasons with the Seibu Lions, Matsui signed with the New York Mets on December 15, 2003, in 2004 becoming the first Japanese infielder to play with a Major League Baseball team.[17] His seven seasons in Major League Baseball were not as successful, and he later returned to NPB.

The fallout from a series of game-fixing scandals resulted in several star players receiving long suspensions, salary cuts, or being banned from professional play entirely; the resulting abandonment of baseball by many fans in Japan also led to the sale of the Nishitetsu Lions and the Toei Flyers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
