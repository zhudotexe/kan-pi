After the success of the film *Iron Man* in May 2008, Marvel announced that *The Avengers* would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCasting began in October 2008 with Downey's signing.[12] Though Don Cheadle was also reported to be reprising his *Iron Man 2* role of War Machine for *The Avengers*, he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film.[12][64] At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film,[12] and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films\u2014*Iron Man\u00a02*, *Thor*, and *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011)\u2014at their Manhattan Beach, California complex.[65] In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in *Iron Man\u00a02* and other films.[38] In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in *The Incredible Hulk* stated that he was open to returning in the film.[66] The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would \"definitely have input and a say\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Ford, Rebecca (August 21, 2011). \"'The Avengers' at D23: Cobie Smulders Reveals the Scene that Made her Sweat (Video)\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales.

Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth.
