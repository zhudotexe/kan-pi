Bezos rose to be the 5th richest person in the world hours before market close; he gained $7\u00a0billion in one hour.[201] By the time the *Forbes* list was calculated in March 2016, his net worth was registered at $45.2\u00a0billion.[202] However, just months later in October 2016, his wealth increased by $16.2\u00a0billion to $66.5\u00a0billion, unofficially ranking him the third-richest person in the world, behind Warren Buffett.[203] After sporadic jumps in Amazon's share price, in July 2017 he briefly unseated Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates as the wealthiest person in the world.[204]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn March 6, 2018, Bezos was designated the wealthiest person in the world, with a registered net worth of $112\u00a0billion.[209] He unseated Bill Gates ($90\u00a0billion), who was $6\u00a0billion ahead of Warren Buffett ($84\u00a0billion), ranked third.[210] He is considered the first registered centi-billionaire (not adjusted for inflation).[b]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n187. **^** Academy, Kiddie Hawk Air. \"Jeff Bezos headlines newest class of inductees into Living Legends of Aviation\". *www.prnewswire.com* (Press release).
