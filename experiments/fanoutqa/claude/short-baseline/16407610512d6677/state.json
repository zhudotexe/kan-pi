He worked during the summer[4] unloading trucks in a distribution center. After high school, McMillon attended University of Arkansas, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1989.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMcMillon took over the company at a time of slowing growth and increased competition from rivals, such as Costco, Amazon.com, grocery store chains Kroger and Safeway, and discount chains of small stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General.[4] Within his first two years as chief executive, McMillon raised wages for hourly workers in the US, boosted the company's commitment to e-commerce and revamped Walmart's executive team. While increased spending on labor and Walmart's digital offerings lowered short-term profits, McMillon argued that the moves would lead to happier workers and better customer service,[18] as well as a better footing in a changing retail market.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWalmart promoted McMillon to president and CEO of Sam's Club on August 4, 2005.[7][10] Under McMillon, the wholesaler emphasized marketing to small business customers.[3] Additionally, McMillon incorporated what *The Wall Street Journal* called \"treasure hunt\" items that are limited-selection expensive premium items, such as diamond necklaces and wine vacations, for sale next to cheap bulk goods in an attempt to compete with Costco.[3]\n\n\n\n### Walmart International (2009\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWalmart officials moved McMillon from his role at Sam's Club to lead Walmart's international division in February 2009,[11] replacing Mike Duke, who was promoted to CEO of Walmart Stores, Inc.[9] Under McMillon, Walmart International focused on improving in existing markets, such as Canada, China, United Kingdom and the Americas.[12] One area of particular importance to McMillon was integrating Walmart's \"everyday low prices\" model to these international markets.[12] Under McMillon, the international division acquired a majority stake in South Africa's Massmart Holdings Ltd. for US$2.4\u00a0billion.[4][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMcMillon made it a long-term goal of Walmart to increase investments in e-commerce, stressing a need to create a \"seamless shopping experience\".[23] As such he announced in 2015 that Walmart would invest US$1\u00a0billion on its online operations.[24] Another goal is to improve the company's environmental sustainability and eliminate waste across the company.[25] In 2014, Walmart began rolling out an initiative to replace lighting in its stores in the US, UK, Latin America and Asia with LED lights for energy efficiency.[26] At the Davos World Economic Forum in January 2016, McMillon said Walmart would press three of its main goals: supply the company with renewable energy, eliminate waste and promote sustainably packaged goods.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn February 2015, McMillon announced Walmart would invest an additional US$2.7\u00a0billion in higher associate wages, benefits and training, including raising its lowest wage to US$9 an hour in 2015 and US$10 an hour for 2016.[20][21] The action affected 40 percent of the company's 1.4\u00a0million US workers.[22] In January 2016, McMillon announced raises for the majority of its workers, free basic short-term disability for full-time workers and a revised paid time off program.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWalmart\n |\n| --- |\n| Walton family | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1st generation | * Sam Walton\n* Helen Walton\n* James \"Bud\" Walton\n |\n| 2nd generation | * S.

Asa Hutchinson to veto the state's \"religious freedom\" bill.[28] McMillon said the bill \"threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold\".[28]\n\n\nIn June 2015, McMillon said the company would stop selling Confederate flag merchandise[21] following the shooting of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.[29] McMillon altered Walmart's gun sales. He told *CNNMoney* in an interview that Walmart's selection of firearms should be geared towards hunters and sports shooters.[30] In August 2015, the company ceased sales of military-style semiautomatic weapons.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican businessman\n\nFor the former Scottish\u2013American soccer forward, see Doug McMillan.\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Parts of this article (those related to role in coronavirus testing for the USA) need to be **updated**.
