Tryptophan (W)\n9. Valine (V)\n\nAdditionally, there are six conditionally essential amino acids, which means they become essential under specific conditions (like illness or stress):\n1. Arginine (R)\n2. Cysteine (C)\n3. Glutamine (Q)\n4. Glycine (G)\n5. Proline (P)\n6.

Glutamic acid (E)\n5. Serine (S)\n6. Selenocysteine (U)\n\nThe recommended daily intake for essential amino acids varies by organization (WHO, US NAM, FAO) and depends on factors like age and health status. For example, children typically need 10-20% higher intake than adults, and infants may need up to 150% more in their first year of life.\n\nA deficiency in essential amino acids can lead to various health issues, and it's important to ensure adequate intake through a balanced diet.

Scholarly Debate:\nThere is significant academic debate about its status as a \"university\":\n- Many scholars consider it to have operated as a madrasa (Islamic school) until after World War II\n- Its formal transformation into a modern university structure occurred in 1963\n- Some scholars argue that the term \"university\" should only apply to institutions following the European university model that emerged in medieval times\n\n3. Educational Structure:\nThe pre-modern institution had some unique characteristics:\n- No defined scholastic year\n- No mandatory registration\n- No fixed study durations\n- No formal examination system\n- Students typically attended courses for at least five years\n- Students received an ijazah (certification) upon proving their expertise\n\n4.

Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. He was accompanied by his wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connally's wife Nellie. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, shot Kennedy from the Texas School Book Depository. The motorcade rushed Kennedy to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead approximately 30 minutes after the shooting. Governor Connally was also wounded but survived the attack.\n\nFollowing the assassination:\n- Kennedy lay in repose in the White House's East Room for 24 hours\n- His coffin was then moved to the Capitol to lie in state, where about 250,000 mourners passed through to pay their respects\n- The funeral service was held on November 25 at St. Matthew's Cathedral, attended by representatives from over 90 countries\n- Kennedy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, where an eternal flame was lit at his burial site in 1967\n\nThe assassination has been the subject of numerous investigations:\n- The FBI's initial investigation concluded that three bullets were fired\n- The Warren Commission was established to investigate the assassination\n- Later investigations included the House Select Committee on Assassinations\n- In 1968, a panel convened by Attorney General Ramsey Clark examined autopsy photos and X-rays, confirming the Warren Commission's finding that Kennedy was struck by two bullets from behind\n\nThe assassination remains controversial and has spawned many conspiracy theories. Polls have shown that a majority of Americans believe there was a conspiracy. Kennedy was the fourth U.S. president to be assassinated and the most recent to die in office. His death was the first of four major assassinations in the 1960s, followed by Malcolm X (1965), and both Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy (1968).\n\nThe event had a profound impact on American society and Kennedy's legacy.
