The drainage basin of the Nile covers 3,254,555 square kilometers (1,256,591 sq mi), about 10% of the area of Africa.[28] Compared to other major rivers, though, the Nile carries little water (5% of that of the Congo River, for example).[29] The Nile basin is complex, and because of this, the discharge at any given point along the main stem depends on many factors including weather, diversions, evaporation and evapotranspiration, and groundwater flow.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe source of the White Nile, even after centuries of exploration, remains in dispute. The most remote source that is indisputably a source for the White Nile is the Kagera River; however, the Kagera has tributaries that are in contention for the farthest source of the White Nile. Two start in Burundi: the Ruvyironza River (also known as the Luvironza) and the Rurubu River.[34][33] In addition, in 2010, an exploration party in Rwanda[35] went to a place described as the source of the Rukarara tributary,[36] and by hacking a path up steep jungle-choked mountain slopes in the Nyungwe Forest found (in the dry season) an appreciable incoming surface flow for many kilometres upstream, and found a new source, giving the Nile a length of 6,758 km (4,199 mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### In Uganda[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Said, R (6 December 2012). *The Geological Evolution of the River Nile*.

However, the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of the Nile downstream, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia[11] and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Nile Delta from space\nThe annual sediment transport by the Nile in Egypt has been quantified.[42]\n\n\n\n* At Aswan: 0.14 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 28% of bedload\n* At Beni Sweif: 0.5 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 20% of bedload\n* At Qena: 0.27 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 27% of bedload\n* At Sohag: 1.5 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 13% of bedload\n\n\n## Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n### Red Nile[edit]\n\n\nBelow the confluence with the Blue Nile the only major tributary is the Atbarah River, also known as the Red Nile. Roughly halfway to the sea, it originates in Ethiopia north of Lake Tana, and is around 800 kilometers (500 mi) long. The Atbarah flows only while there is rain in Ethiopia and dries very rapidly. During the dry period of January to June, it typically dries up north of Khartoum.\n\n\n\n### Blue Nile[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Blue Nile\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the late-Miocene Messinian salinity crisis, when the Mediterranean Sea was a closed basin and evaporated to the point of being empty or nearly so, the Nile cut its course down to the new base level until it was several hundred metres below world ocean level at Aswan and 2,400 m (7,900 ft) below Cairo.[59][60] This created a very long and deep canyon which was filled with sediment after the Mediterranean was recreated.[61] At some point the sediments raised the riverbed sufficiently for the river to overflow westward into a depression to create Lake Moeris.\n\n\nLake Tanganyika drained northwards into the Nile until the Virunga Volcanoes blocked its course in Rwanda. The Nile was much longer at that time, with its furthest headwaters in northern Zambia. The currently existing Nile first flowed during the former parts of the Würm glaciation period.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Blue Nile Falls fed by Lake Tana near the city of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia\n![](image)Annotated view of the Nile and Red Sea, with a dust storm[43]\nThe Blue Nile (Amharic: ዓባይ, *ʿĀbay*[44][45]) springs from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands. The Blue Nile flows about 1,400 kilometres to Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and White Nile join to form the Nile.[46] Ninety percent of the water and ninety-six percent of the transported sediment carried by the Nile[47] originates in Ethiopia, with fifty-nine percent of the water from the Blue Nile (the rest being from the Tekezé, Atbarah, Sobat, and small tributaries). The erosion and transportation of silt only occurs during the Ethiopian rainy season when rainfall is especially high in the Ethiopian Highlands; the rest of the year, the great rivers draining Ethiopia into the Nile have a weaker flow. In harsh and arid seasons and droughts, the Blue Nile dries out completely.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Crossings from Jinja, Uganda to Khartoum[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(April 2009)*\n |\n\n\n* Source of the Nile Bridge, Jinja, Uganda\n* River Nile Railway Bridge, Jinja, Uganda\n* Nalubaale Bridge, Jinja, Uganda (Formerly Owen Falls Bridge)\n* Karuma Bridge, Karuma, Uganda\n* Pakwach Bridge, Uganda\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Rivers portal\n* ![map](image)Africa portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* Bujagali Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Egyptian Public Works\n* Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Water politics in the Nile Basin\n* Merowe Dam\n* Nalubaale Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Orders of magnitude\n* Vid Flumina, a river of liquid methane and ethane on Saturn's moon Titan\n* *The River War* (1899), Winston Churchill's second book, an account of steaming up the Nile to the Battle of Omdurman, Sudan, in 1898\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Blue Peace for the Nile, 2009 Archived 8 September 2013 at the Wayback Machine; Report by Strategic Foresight Group\n87. **^** Walsh, Decian (9 February 2020). \"For Thousands of Years, Egypt Controlled the Nile.

The drainage basin of the Nile covers 3,254,555 square kilometers (1,256,591 sq mi), about 10% of the area of Africa.[28] Compared to other major rivers, though, the Nile carries little water (5% of that of the Congo River, for example).[29] The Nile basin is complex, and because of this, the discharge at any given point along the main stem depends on many factors including weather, diversions, evaporation and evapotranspiration, and groundwater flow.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe source of the White Nile, even after centuries of exploration, remains in dispute.

Two start in Burundi: the Ruvyironza River (also known as the Luvironza) and the Rurubu River.[34][33] In addition, in 2010, an exploration party in Rwanda[35] went to a place described as the source of the Rukarara tributary,[36] and by hacking a path up steep jungle-choked mountain slopes in the Nyungwe Forest found (in the dry season) an appreciable incoming surface flow for many kilometres upstream, and found a new source, giving the Nile a length of 6,758 km (4,199 mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### In Uganda[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Said, R (6 December 2012). *The Geological Evolution of the River Nile*.

However, the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of the Nile downstream, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia[11] and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Nile Delta from space\nThe annual sediment transport by the Nile in Egypt has been quantified.[42]\n\n\n\n* At Aswan: 0.14 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 28% of bedload\n* At Beni Sweif: 0.5 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 20% of bedload\n* At Qena: 0.27 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 27% of bedload\n* At Sohag: 1.5 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 13% of bedload\n\n\n## Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n### Red Nile[edit]\n\n\nBelow the confluence with the Blue Nile the only major tributary is the Atbarah River, also known as the Red Nile. Roughly halfway to the sea, it originates in Ethiopia north of Lake Tana, and is around 800 kilometers (500 mi) long. The Atbarah flows only while there is rain in Ethiopia and dries very rapidly. During the dry period of January to June, it typically dries up north of Khartoum.\n\n\n\n### Blue Nile[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Blue Nile\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the late-Miocene Messinian salinity crisis, when the Mediterranean Sea was a closed basin and evaporated to the point of being empty or nearly so, the Nile cut its course down to the new base level until it was several hundred metres below world ocean level at Aswan and 2,400 m (7,900 ft) below Cairo.[59][60] This created a very long and deep canyon which was filled with sediment after the Mediterranean was recreated.[61] At some point the sediments raised the riverbed sufficiently for the river to overflow westward into a depression to create Lake Moeris.\n\n\nLake Tanganyika drained northwards into the Nile until the Virunga Volcanoes blocked its course in Rwanda. The Nile was much longer at that time, with its furthest headwaters in northern Zambia. The currently existing Nile first flowed during the former parts of the Würm glaciation period.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Blue Nile Falls fed by Lake Tana near the city of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia\n![](image)Annotated view of the Nile and Red Sea, with a dust storm[43]\nThe Blue Nile (Amharic: ዓባይ, *ʿĀbay*[44][45]) springs from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands. The Blue Nile flows about 1,400 kilometres to Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and White Nile join to form the Nile.[46] Ninety percent of the water and ninety-six percent of the transported sediment carried by the Nile[47] originates in Ethiopia, with fifty-nine percent of the water from the Blue Nile (the rest being from the Tekezé, Atbarah, Sobat, and small tributaries). The erosion and transportation of silt only occurs during the Ethiopian rainy season when rainfall is especially high in the Ethiopian Highlands; the rest of the year, the great rivers draining Ethiopia into the Nile have a weaker flow. In harsh and arid seasons and droughts, the Blue Nile dries out completely.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Crossings from Jinja, Uganda to Khartoum[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(April 2009)*\n |\n\n\n* Source of the Nile Bridge, Jinja, Uganda\n* River Nile Railway Bridge, Jinja, Uganda\n* Nalubaale Bridge, Jinja, Uganda (Formerly Owen Falls Bridge)\n* Karuma Bridge, Karuma, Uganda\n* Pakwach Bridge, Uganda\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Rivers portal\n* ![map](image)Africa portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* Bujagali Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Egyptian Public Works\n* Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Water politics in the Nile Basin\n* Merowe Dam\n* Nalubaale Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Orders of magnitude\n* Vid Flumina, a river of liquid methane and ethane on Saturn's moon Titan\n* *The River War* (1899), Winston Churchill's second book, an account of steaming up the Nile to the Battle of Omdurman, Sudan, in 1898\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Blue Peace for the Nile, 2009 Archived 8 September 2013 at the Wayback Machine; Report by Strategic Foresight Group\n87. **^** Walsh, Decian (9 February 2020). \"For Thousands of Years, Egypt Controlled the Nile.

Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853 km (4,258 mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Marajó and finally including the marine waters of the *Río Pará* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800 km (4,200 mi) by a Brazilian scientist. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Seyler, Patrick; Laurence Maurice-Bourgoin; Jean Loup Guyot. \"Hydrological Control on the Temporal Variability of Trace Element Concentration in the Amazon River and its Main Tributaries\".

Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80 km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apurímac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80 km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Left tributary\n | Right tributary\n | Length (km)\n | Basin size (km2)\n | Average discharge (m3/s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Upper Amazon**\n(Confluence of Ucayali and Marañón rivers *-* Tabatinga)\n |\n| Marañón |  | 2,112\n | 364,873.4\n | 16,708\n |\n|  | Ucayali | 2,738\n | 353,729.3\n | 13,630.1\n |\n|  | Tahuyo\n | 80\n | 1,630\n | 105.7\n |\n|  | Tamshiyaçu\n | 86.7\n | 1,367.3\n | 86.5\n |\n| Itaya |  | 213\n | 2,668\n | 161.4\n |\n| Nanay |  | 483\n | 16,673.4\n | 1,072.7\n |\n|  | Maniti\n | 198.7\n | 2,573.6\n | 180.4\n |\n| Napo |  | 1,075\n | 103,307.8\n | 7,147.8\n |\n| Apayaçu\n |  | 50\n | 2,393.6\n | 160.9\n |\n|  | Orosa\n | 95\n | 3,506.8\n | 234.3\n |\n| Ampiyaçu\n |  | 140\n | 4,201.4\n | 267.2\n |\n| Chichita\n |  | 48\n | 1,314.2\n | 87.7\n |\n|  | Cochiquinas\n | 49\n | 2,362.7\n | 150.2\n |\n|  | Santa Rosa\n | 45\n | 1,678\n | 101.5\n |\n| Cajocumal\n |  | 58\n | 2,094.9\n | 141.5\n |\n| Atacuari\n |  | 108\n | 3,480.5\n | 236.8\n |\n| **Middle Amazon**\n(Tabatinga *-* Encontro das Águas)\n |\n|  | Javary | 1,056\n | 99,674.1\n | 5,222.5\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Guo, Rongxing (2006). *Territorial Disputes and Resource Management: A Global Handbook*.

The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992 km (4,345 mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853 km (4,258 mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Marajó and finally including the marine waters of the *Río Pará* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800 km (4,200 mi) by a Brazilian scientist. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Seyler, Patrick; Laurence Maurice-Bourgoin; Jean Loup Guyot. \"Hydrological Control on the Temporal Variability of Trace Element Concentration in the Amazon River and its Main Tributaries\".
