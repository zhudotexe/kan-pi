It flows into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile is the longest river in Africa and has historically been considered the longest river in the world,[3][4] though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer.[5][6] Of the world's major rivers, the Nile is one of the smallest, as measured by annual flow in cubic metres of water.[7] About 6,650\u00a0km (4,130\u00a0mi)[a] long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt.[9] In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan.[10] Additionally, the Nile is an important economic river, supporting agriculture and fishing.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** The river's outflow from that lake occurs at 12\u00b002\u203209\u2033N 37\u00b015\u203253\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff12.03583\u00b0N 37.26472\u00b0E\ufeff / 12.03583; 37.26472\n12. **^** \"What's the Blue Nile and the White Nile?\". *The Times of India*.

The drainage basin of the Nile covers 3,254,555 square kilometers (1,256,591\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), about 10% of the area of Africa.[28] Compared to other major rivers, though, the Nile carries little water (5% of that of the Congo River, for example).[29] The Nile basin is complex, and because of this, the discharge at any given point along the main stem depends on many factors including weather, diversions, evaporation and evapotranspiration, and groundwater flow.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe source of the White Nile, even after centuries of exploration, remains in dispute. The most remote source that is indisputably a source for the White Nile is the Kagera River; however, the Kagera has tributaries that are in contention for the farthest source of the White Nile. Two start in Burundi: the Ruvyironza River (also known as the Luvironza) and the Rurubu River.[34][33] In addition, in 2010, an exploration party in Rwanda[35] went to a place described as the source of the Rukarara tributary,[36] and by hacking a path up steep jungle-choked mountain slopes in the Nyungwe Forest found (in the dry season) an appreciable incoming surface flow for many kilometres upstream, and found a new source, giving the Nile a length of 6,758\u00a0km (4,199\u00a0mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### In Uganda[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Said, R (6 December 2012). *The Geological Evolution of the River Nile*.

The White Nile is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream. However, the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of the Nile downstream, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins at Lake Victoria and flows through Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia[11] and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet at the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Nile Delta from space\nThe annual sediment transport by the Nile in Egypt has been quantified.[42]\n\n\n\n* At Aswan: 0.14 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 28% of bedload\n* At Beni Sweif: 0.5 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 20% of bedload\n* At Qena: 0.27 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 27% of bedload\n* At Sohag: 1.5 million tonnes of suspended sediment and an additional 13% of bedload\n\n\n## Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n### Red Nile[edit]\n\n\nBelow the confluence with the Blue Nile the only major tributary is the Atbarah River, also known as the Red Nile. Roughly halfway to the sea, it originates in Ethiopia north of Lake Tana, and is around 800 kilometers (500\u00a0mi) long. The Atbarah flows only while there is rain in Ethiopia and dries very rapidly. During the dry period of January to June, it typically dries up north of Khartoum.\n\n\n\n### Blue Nile[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Blue Nile\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the late-Miocene Messinian salinity crisis, when the Mediterranean Sea was a closed basin and evaporated to the point of being empty or nearly so, the Nile cut its course down to the new base level until it was several hundred metres below world ocean level at Aswan and 2,400\u00a0m (7,900\u00a0ft) below Cairo.[59][60] This created a very long and deep canyon which was filled with sediment after the Mediterranean was recreated.[61] At some point the sediments raised the riverbed sufficiently for the river to overflow westward into a depression to create Lake Moeris.\n\n\nLake Tanganyika drained northwards into the Nile until the Virunga Volcanoes blocked its course in Rwanda. The Nile was much longer at that time, with its furthest headwaters in northern Zambia. The currently existing Nile first flowed during the former parts of the W\u00fcrm glaciation period.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Blue Nile Falls fed by Lake Tana near the city of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia\n![](image)Annotated view of the Nile and Red Sea, with a dust storm[43]\nThe Blue Nile (Amharic: \u12d3\u1263\u12ed, *\u02bf\u0100bay*[44][45]) springs from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands. The Blue Nile flows about 1,400 kilometres to Khartoum, where the Blue Nile and White Nile join to form the Nile.[46] Ninety percent of the water and ninety-six percent of the transported sediment carried by the Nile[47] originates in Ethiopia, with fifty-nine percent of the water from the Blue Nile (the rest being from the Tekez\u00e9, Atbarah, Sobat, and small tributaries). The erosion and transportation of silt only occurs during the Ethiopian rainy season when rainfall is especially high in the Ethiopian Highlands; the rest of the year, the great rivers draining Ethiopia into the Nile have a weaker flow. In harsh and arid seasons and droughts, the Blue Nile dries out completely.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Crossings from Jinja, Uganda to Khartoum[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(April 2009)*\n |\n\n\n* Source of the Nile Bridge, Jinja, Uganda\n* River Nile Railway Bridge, Jinja, Uganda\n* Nalubaale Bridge, Jinja, Uganda (Formerly Owen Falls Bridge)\n* Karuma Bridge, Karuma, Uganda\n* Pakwach Bridge, Uganda\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Rivers portal\n* ![map](image)Africa portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* Bujagali Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Egyptian Public Works\n* Kiira Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Water politics in the Nile Basin\n* Merowe Dam\n* Nalubaale Hydroelectric Power Station\n* Orders of magnitude\n* Vid Flumina, a river of liquid methane and ethane on Saturn's moon Titan\n* *The River War* (1899), Winston Churchill's second book, an account of steaming up the Nile to the Battle of Omdurman, Sudan, in 1898\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n86. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Blue Peace for the Nile, 2009 Archived 8 September 2013 at the Wayback Machine; Report by Strategic Foresight Group\n87. **^** Walsh, Decian (9 February 2020). \"For Thousands of Years, Egypt Controlled the Nile.

During the wet season, the peak flow of the Blue Nile often exceeds 5,663\u00a0m3/s (200,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) in late August (a difference of a factor of 50).\n\n\nBefore the placement of dams on the river the yearly discharge varied by a factor of 15 at Aswan. Peak flows of over 8,212\u00a0m3/s (290,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) occurred during late August and early September, and minimum flows of about 552\u00a0m3/s (19,500\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) occurred during late April and early May.\n\n\n\n### Bahr el Ghazal and Sobat River[edit]\n\n\nThe Bahr al Ghazal and the Sobat River are the two most important tributaries of the White Nile in terms of discharge.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088\u00a0km (4,404\u00a0mi) for the Nile and 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest.

The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km (4,258\u00a0mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj\u00f3 and finally including the marine waters of the *R\u00edo Par\u00e1* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800\u00a0km (4,200\u00a0mi) by a Brazilian scientist. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Seyler, Patrick; Laurence Maurice-Bourgoin; Jean Loup Guyot. \"Hydrological Control on the Temporal Variability of Trace Element Concentration in the Amazon River and its Main Tributaries\".

Size and Length:\n- The Amazon River is the largest river by water discharge volume in the world\n- Its exact length is disputed and debated, with measurements ranging between 6,275 km (3,899 mi) and 6,992 km (4,345 mi)\n- It's often stated to be \"at least\" 6,400 km (4,000 mi) long\n- There's an ongoing debate whether it or the Nile is the world's longest river\n\n2. Location and System:\n- Located in South America\n- Has over 1,100 tributaries, with twelve of them being over 1,500 km long\n- Major tributaries include the Madeira, Negro, Japur\u00e1, Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Tapaj\u00f3s, and Ucayali rivers\n\n3. Discharge and Tributaries:\n- The main Amazon River has an average discharge of 209,000 m\u00b3/s\n- Major tributary contributions (by percentage of total flow):\n  - Madeira River: 15%\n  - Negro River: 14%\n  - Japur\u00e1 River: 9%\n  - Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River: 8%\n  - Tapaj\u00f3s River: 6%\n\n4. Historical Development:\n- The river's current eastward flow pattern developed 11-10 million years ago\n- This development led to the emergence of the Amazon rainforest\n- During glacial periods, sea level changes significantly affected the river's development\n\n5. Interesting Feature:\n- There is a large aquifer running parallel to the Amazon River, called the Hamza River, which was discovered and made public in August 2011\n\nThe Amazon River system is crucial to South America's ecology and is considered one of the most important river systems in the world.",
