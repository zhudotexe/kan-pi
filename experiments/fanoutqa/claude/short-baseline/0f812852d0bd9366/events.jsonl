Beck's album *Morning Phase* was named Album of the Year. This prompted Kanye West, who later said he thought Beyoncé should have won, to jokingly leap onstage to interrupt Beck in a re-enactment of his 2009 MTV VMA scandal, but West left the stage without saying anything.[4] Both Pharrell Williams and Beyoncé took three honors; with her wins, Beyoncé became the second-most-honored female musician in Grammy history following Alison Krauss. Lifetime Achievement awards were given to the Bee Gees, George Harrison, Pierre Boulez, Buddy Guy, and Flaco Jiménez.[5]\n\n\nIn all, 83 Grammy Awards were presented, one more than in 2014.[6]\n\n\nThe show aired simultaneously on Fox8 in Australia,[7] Sky TV in New Zealand,[8] and on Channel O in South Africa.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Pre-telecast ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***20 Feet from Stardom* – Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer and Judith Hill**\n\t+ **Morgan Neville, video director; Gil Friesen and Caitrin Rogers, video producers**\n* *On The Run Tour: Beyoncé and Jay-Z (TV Program)*\n\t+ Jonas Åkerlund, video director; Ed Burke, Svana Gisla and Dan Parise, video producers\n* *Ghost Stories* – Coldplay\n\t+ Paul Dugdale, video director; Jim Parsons, video producer\n* \"Metallica Through the Never\" – Metallica\n\t+ Nimród Antal, video director; Adam Ellison and Charlotte Huggins, video producers\n* *The Truth About Love Tour: Live from Melbourne* – Pink\n\t+ Larn Poland, video director; Roger Davies, video producer\n\n\n## Special Merit Awards[edit]\n\n\n### MusiCares Person of the Year[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MusiCares Person of the Year\n\n* Bob Dylan\n\n\n### Lifetime Achievement Award[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award\n\n* Bee Gees\n* Pierre Boulez\n* Buddy Guy\n* George Harrison\n* Maria Cordero\n* Flaco Jiménez\n* The Louvin Brothers\n* Wayne Shorter\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGrammy Awards\n |\n| --- |\n| * The Recording Academy\n* Categories\n* Grammy Nominees\n* Records\n* Locations\n* EGOT\n |\n| Special awards | * Legend Award\n* Lifetime Achievement Award\n* Trustees Award\n* Special Merit/Technical Grammy Award\n* Hall of Fame\n* MusiCares Person of the Year\n |\n| Ceremonies | * 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *G I R L* – Pharrell Williams\n\t+ Alicia Keys and Justin Timberlake, featured artists; Pharrell Williams, producer; Leslie Brathwaite, Adrian Breakspear, Andrew Coleman, Jimmy Douglas, Hart Gunther, Mick Guzauski, Florian Lagatta, Mike Larson, Stephanie McNally, Alan Meyerson, Ann Mincieli and Kenta Yonesaka, engineers/mixers; Bob Ludwig, mastering engineer\n\n\n**Song of the Year**\n\n\n\n* **\"Stay with Me\" (Darkchild Version)**1\n\t+ **James Napier, William Phillips and Sam Smith, songwriters (Sam Smith)**\n* \"All About That Bass\"\n\t+ Kevin Kadish and Meghan Trainor, songwriters (Meghan Trainor)\n* \"Chandelier\"\n\t+ Sia Furler and Jesse Shatkin, songwriters (Sia)\n* \"Shake It Off\"\n\t+ Max Martin, Shellback and Taylor Swift, songwriters (Taylor Swift)\n* \"Take Me to Church\"\n\t+ Andrew Hozier-Byrne, songwriter (Hozier)\n\n\n**Best New Artist**\n\n\n\n* **Sam Smith**\n* Iggy Azalea\n* Bastille\n* Brandy Clark\n* HAIM\n\n\n### Pop[edit]\n\n\n**Best Pop Solo Performance**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n | * Fred Hersch\n* John Hiatt\n* J-Roc\n* Keb' Mo'\n* Kevin Kadish\n* Wiz Khalifa\n* Richard King\n* Greg Kurstin\n* Luke Laird\n* Kendrick Lamar\n* Mike Larson\n* Howard Lawrence\n* John Legend\n* Morten Lindberg\n* Kristen Anderson-Lopez\n* Robert Lopez\n* Joe Lovano\n* Mali Music\n\n\n | * Elaine Martone\n* Pete McGuinness\n* MercyMe\n* Edgar Meyer\n* Ann Mincieli\n* Nicki Minaj\n* Ludovic Morlot\n* Jimmy Napes\n* Robbie Nelson\n* Nickel Creek\n* Smokie Norful\n* Partch\n* Katy Perry\n* Tom Petty\n* Steve Price\n* Julian Raymond\n* Rufus Reid\n* Robert Glasper Experiment\n\n\n | * Schoolboy Q\n* Jesse Shatkin\n* Noah \"40\" Shebib\n* Shellback\n* Chris Thile\n* Darrell Thorp\n* Timbaland\n* Justin Timberlake\n* Meghan Trainor\n* Daniil Trifonov\n* Cassidy Turbin\n* Carrie Underwood\n* Keith Urban\n* Joe Visciano\n* Kanye West\n* Charlie Wilson\n* Jesse Winchester\n\n\n |\n\nThe following received multiple awards:\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Four:*\n* Sam Smith\n\n*Three:*\n* Beyoncé\n* Rosanne Cash\n* Bob Ludwig\n* Pharrell Williams\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNot all Grammys were presented during the live telecast.

Beck's album *Morning Phase* was named Album of the Year. This prompted Kanye West, who later said he thought Beyoncé should have won, to jokingly leap onstage to interrupt Beck in a re-enactment of his 2009 MTV VMA scandal, but West left the stage without saying anything.[4] Both Pharrell Williams and Beyoncé took three honors; with her wins, Beyoncé became the second-most-honored female musician in Grammy history following Alison Krauss. Lifetime Achievement awards were given to the Bee Gees, George Harrison, Pierre Boulez, Buddy Guy, and Flaco Jiménez.[5]\n\n\nIn all, 83 Grammy Awards were presented, one more than in 2014.[6]\n\n\nThe show aired simultaneously on Fox8 in Australia,[7] Sky TV in New Zealand,[8] and on Channel O in South Africa.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Pre-telecast ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ***20 Feet from Stardom* – Darlene Love, Merry Clayton, Lisa Fischer and Judith Hill**\n\t+ **Morgan Neville, video director; Gil Friesen and Caitrin Rogers, video producers**\n* *On The Run Tour: Beyoncé and Jay-Z (TV Program)*\n\t+ Jonas Åkerlund, video director; Ed Burke, Svana Gisla and Dan Parise, video producers\n* *Ghost Stories* – Coldplay\n\t+ Paul Dugdale, video director; Jim Parsons, video producer\n* \"Metallica Through the Never\" – Metallica\n\t+ Nimród Antal, video director; Adam Ellison and Charlotte Huggins, video producers\n* *The Truth About Love Tour: Live from Melbourne* – Pink\n\t+ Larn Poland, video director; Roger Davies, video producer\n\n\n## Special Merit Awards[edit]\n\n\n### MusiCares Person of the Year[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MusiCares Person of the Year\n\n* Bob Dylan\n\n\n### Lifetime Achievement Award[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award\n\n* Bee Gees\n* Pierre Boulez\n* Buddy Guy\n* George Harrison\n* Maria Cordero\n* Flaco Jiménez\n* The Louvin Brothers\n* Wayne Shorter\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGrammy Awards\n |\n| --- |\n| * The Recording Academy\n* Categories\n* Grammy Nominees\n* Records\n* Locations\n* EGOT\n |\n| Special awards | * Legend Award\n* Lifetime Achievement Award\n* Trustees Award\n* Special Merit/Technical Grammy Award\n* Hall of Fame\n* MusiCares Person of the Year\n |\n| Ceremonies | * 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *G I R L* – Pharrell Williams\n\t+ Alicia Keys and Justin Timberlake, featured artists; Pharrell Williams, producer; Leslie Brathwaite, Adrian Breakspear, Andrew Coleman, Jimmy Douglas, Hart Gunther, Mick Guzauski, Florian Lagatta, Mike Larson, Stephanie McNally, Alan Meyerson, Ann Mincieli and Kenta Yonesaka, engineers/mixers; Bob Ludwig, mastering engineer\n\n\n**Song of the Year**\n\n\n\n* **\"Stay with Me\" (Darkchild Version)**1\n\t+ **James Napier, William Phillips and Sam Smith, songwriters (Sam Smith)**\n* \"All About That Bass\"\n\t+ Kevin Kadish and Meghan Trainor, songwriters (Meghan Trainor)\n* \"Chandelier\"\n\t+ Sia Furler and Jesse Shatkin, songwriters (Sia)\n* \"Shake It Off\"\n\t+ Max Martin, Shellback and Taylor Swift, songwriters (Taylor Swift)\n* \"Take Me to Church\"\n\t+ Andrew Hozier-Byrne, songwriter (Hozier)\n\n\n**Best New Artist**\n\n\n\n* **Sam Smith**\n* Iggy Azalea\n* Bastille\n* Brandy Clark\n* HAIM\n\n\n### Pop[edit]\n\n\n**Best Pop Solo Performance**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n | * Fred Hersch\n* John Hiatt\n* J-Roc\n* Keb' Mo'\n* Kevin Kadish\n* Wiz Khalifa\n* Richard King\n* Greg Kurstin\n* Luke Laird\n* Kendrick Lamar\n* Mike Larson\n* Howard Lawrence\n* John Legend\n* Morten Lindberg\n* Kristen Anderson-Lopez\n* Robert Lopez\n* Joe Lovano\n* Mali Music\n\n\n | * Elaine Martone\n* Pete McGuinness\n* MercyMe\n* Edgar Meyer\n* Ann Mincieli\n* Nicki Minaj\n* Ludovic Morlot\n* Jimmy Napes\n* Robbie Nelson\n* Nickel Creek\n* Smokie Norful\n* Partch\n* Katy Perry\n* Tom Petty\n* Steve Price\n* Julian Raymond\n* Rufus Reid\n* Robert Glasper Experiment\n\n\n | * Schoolboy Q\n* Jesse Shatkin\n* Noah \"40\" Shebib\n* Shellback\n* Chris Thile\n* Darrell Thorp\n* Timbaland\n* Justin Timberlake\n* Meghan Trainor\n* Daniil Trifonov\n* Cassidy Turbin\n* Carrie Underwood\n* Keith Urban\n* Joe Visciano\n* Kanye West\n* Charlie Wilson\n* Jesse Winchester\n\n\n |\n\nThe following received multiple awards:\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Four:*\n* Sam Smith\n\n*Three:*\n* Beyoncé\n* Rosanne Cash\n* Bob Ludwig\n* Pharrell Williams\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNot all Grammys were presented during the live telecast.

The band began recording material for their first album, *Days Are Gone* (2013), in sessions between touring dates, including appearances at the Glastonbury Festival. The album charted in the top ten in several countries, including the number-one spot in the UK, and the group had won several \"best of\" awards by the end of 2013. The group was nominated for Best New Artist at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. Their second album, *Something to Tell You*, was released in July 2017. Their third album, titled *Women in Music Pt. III*, was released in June 2020. The group received nominations at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards for Album of the Year (for *Women in Music Pt.
