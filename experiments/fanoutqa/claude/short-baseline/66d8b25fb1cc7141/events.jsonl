The 82nd edition of the tournament began play on March 18, 2021 in sites around the state of Indiana,[1] and concluded with the championship game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on April 5, with the Baylor Bears defeating the previously undefeated Gonzaga Bulldogs 86–70 to earn the team's first ever title.\n\n\nFor logistical considerations surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (which resulted in the cancellation of the previous year's tournament), the NCAA announced in January 2021 that all tournament games would be held in Indiana rather than at sites across the country. This was the only time in the history of the tournament that a single state has hosted it in its entirety.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNCAA Division I men's basketball tournament\n |\n| --- |\n| Tournaments | * 1939\n* 1940\n* 1941\n* 1942\n* 1943\n* 1944\n* 1945\n* 1946\n* 1947\n* 1948\n* 1949\n* 1950\n* 1951\n* 1952\n* 1953\n* 1954\n* 1955\n* 1956\n* 1957\n* 1958\n* 1959\n* 1960\n* 1961\n* 1962\n* 1963\n* 1964\n* 1965\n* 1966\n* 1967\n* 1968\n* 1969\n* 1970\n* 1971\n* 1972\n* 1973\n* 1974\n* 1975\n* 1976\n* 1977\n* 1978\n* 1979\n* 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n* 2024\n* *2025*\n |\n| Structure | * Selection process\n* Venues\n* No. 1 seeds\n* First Four\n* Elite Eight\n* Final four\n |\n| Champions & awards | * List of champions\n* Most Outstanding Player\n |\n| Media & culture | * Blue bloods\n* Bracketology\n* Broadcasting\n\t+ Tournament\n\t+ Final Four\n* Cutting down the nets\n* March Madness pools\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Saturday, March 27 and Sunday, March 28\n\t+ Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Indianapolis, Indiana (Host: Ball State University)\n\t+ Hinkle Fieldhouse, Indianapolis, Indiana (Host: Butler University)\n* Monday, March 29 and Tuesday, March 30\n\t+ Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, Indiana (Unity Court and Equality Court) (Hosts: IUPUI/Horizon League)\n\n\n**National Semifinals and Championship (Final Four and Championship):**\n\n\n\n* Saturday, April 3 and Monday, April 5\n\t+ Lucas Oil Stadium, Indianapolis, Indiana (Hosts: IUPUI/Horizon League)\n\n\n### Original 2021 NCAA Tournament schedule and venues[edit]\n\n\n![Map](image)2021 First Four (orange) and First and Second Rounds (green) as originally selected.\n\n![Map](image)2021 Regionals (blue) and Final Four (red) as originally selected.\n\nThe following sites were originally selected to host each round of the 2021 tournament;[17] with the exceptions of Boise and Minneapolis, all cities and venues listed are scheduled to host tournament games after 2021:\n\n\n**First Four**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Final Four game between UCLA and Gonzaga (the first semifinal game to go into overtime since 1998) saw a game-winning buzzer-beater by Jalen Suggs to take Gonzaga into the championship game, the first buzzer-beater in a national semifinal since 1977. By defeating Gonzaga in the championship game, the Baylor Bears became the second consecutive first-time NCAA champions, following the Virginia Cavaliers in 2019. The last time this happened was in 2002 and 2003, when the Maryland Terrapins and Syracuse Orange (then nicknamed Orangemen) won their first titles in their respective years. Baylor also joined Texas Western (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso) as the only two teams from the state of Texas to have won an NCAA Division I Basketball championship, the Miners having done so in 1966.\n\n\n\n\n## Tournament procedure[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament § Current tournament format\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"NCAA announces early-round dates for tourney\". *ESPN.com*.
