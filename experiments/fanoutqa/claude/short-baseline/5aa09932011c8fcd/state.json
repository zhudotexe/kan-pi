Consequently, in February 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25\u00a0billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds.[174] For the first time in 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft's Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits were $5.2\u00a0billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6\u00a0billion, on revenues of $14.5\u00a0billion and $24.7\u00a0billion respectively.[175] Microsoft's Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726\u00a0million. This follows a loss of $2.5\u00a0billion for the year 2010.[176]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n161. **^** Weise, Karen (January 18, 2023). \"Microsoft to Lay Off 10,000 Workers as It Looks to Trim Costs\". *The New York Times*.
