Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders.[29] Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader. As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n14th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (1992–1997)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier. However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary.[32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post. Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Brown, Kerry (15 October 2010). \"China's leader Hu Jintao leads a country in ferment\". *The Guardian*.

His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping. Following the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu is the only living former paramount leader of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu's birthplace, Jiangyan, Jiangsu.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1999–2005: Vice Chairman, State Central Military Commission\n* 1999–2004: Vice Chairman, Party Central Military Commission\n* 1998–2003: Vice President of the People's Republic of China\n* 1993–2002: President, Central Party School\n* 1988–1992: Party Committee Secretary, Tibet Autonomous Region\n* 1985–1988: Party Committee Secretary, Guizhou province\n* 1983–1985: First Secretary, Communist Youth League\n* 1983–1985: President, All-China Youth Federation\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Paramount Leader of  the People's Republic of China**\n* **←** Jiang Zemin\n* Xi Jinping **→**\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This article is part of a series about\nHu Jintao |\n\n |\n| * **Hu–Wen Administration**\n* 2002 election as General Secretary\n* 2007 reelection as General Secretary\n* Tuanpai\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nPolicies and theories\n* China's peaceful rise\n* Eight Honors and Eight Shames\n* Harmonious Society\n* Scientific Outlook on Development\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Hu Jintao\n |\n| --- |\n| 胡锦涛\n |\n| ![](image)Hu in 2011\n |\n|  |\n| General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party |\n| **In office**15 November 2002 – 15 November 2012 |\n| Preceded by | Jiang Zemin |\n| Succeeded by | Xi Jinping |\n| 6th President of the People's Republic of China |\n| **In office**15 March 2003 – 14 March 2013 |\n| Premier | Wen Jiabao |\n| Vice President | Zeng QinghongXi Jinping |\n| Preceded by | Jiang Zemin |\n| Succeeded by | Xi Jinping |\n| Chairman of the Central Military Commission |\n| **In office****Party Commission**: 19 September 2004 – 15 November 2012 **State Commission**: 13 March 2005 – 14 March 2013 |\n| Deputy | Xi JinpingGuo BoxiongXu CaihouCao Gangchuan |\n| Preceded by | Jiang Zemin |\n| Succeeded by | Xi Jinping |\n| First-ranked Secretary of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party |\n| **In office**19 October 1992 – 15 November 2002 |\n| General Secretary | Jiang Zemin |\n| Preceded by | Qiao Shi |\n| Succeeded by | Zeng Qinghong |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n17th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (2007–2012)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders.[29] Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader. As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n14th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (1992–1997)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier. However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary.[32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post. Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Brown, Kerry (15 October 2010). \"China's leader Hu Jintao leads a country in ferment\". *The Guardian*.
