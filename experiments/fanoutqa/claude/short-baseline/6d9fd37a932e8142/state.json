It saw heavy fighting across Europe for almost six years, starting with Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 and ending with the Western Allies conquering most of Western Europe, the Soviet Union conquering most of Eastern Europe including the German capital Berlin, and Germany's unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945[nb 24] although fighting continued elsewhere in Europe until 25 May. On 5 June 1945, the Berlin Declaration proclaiming the unconditional surrender of Germany to the four victorious powers was signed. The Allied powers fought the Axis powers on two major fronts (Eastern Front and Western Front), but there were other fronts varying in scale from the Italian campaign (the 3rd largest campaign in Europe), to the Polish Campaign, as well as in a strategic bombing offensive and in the adjoining Mediterranean and Middle East theatre.\n\n\n\n\n## Preceding events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld War II\n |\n| --- |\n| * Outline\n* Battles\n\t+ Operations\n* Leaders\n\t+ Allied\n\t+ Axis\n\t+ Commanders\n* Casualties\n* Conferences\n |\n| General | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCampaigns of World War II\n |\n| --- |\n| **Europe**\n* Poland\n* Phoney War\n* Finland\n\t+ Winter War\n\t+ Karelia\n\t+ Lapland\n* Denmark and Norway\n* Western Front\n\t+ 1940\n\t+ 1944\u20131945\n* Britain\n* Balkans\n* Eastern Front\n* Italy\n\t+ Sicily\n\n\n**Asia-Pacific**\n\n* China\n* Pacific Ocean\n\t+ South West Pacific\n* Franco-Thai War\n* South-East Asia\n* Burma and India\n* Japan\n* Manchuria and Northern Korea\n\t+ pre-war border conflicts\n\n\n**Mediterranean and Middle East**\n\n* Africa\n\t+ North Africa\n\t+ East Africa\n* Mediterranean Sea\n* Adriatic\n* Malta\n* Middle East\n\t+ Iraq\n\t+ Syria\u2013Lebanon\n\t+ Iran\n* Dodecanese\n* Southern France\n\n\n**Other campaigns**\n\n* Americas\n* Atlantic\n* Arctic\n* Strategic bombing\n* French West Africa\n* Indian Ocean\n\t+ Madagascar\n\n\n**Coups**\n\n* Yugoslavia\n* Iraq\n* Italy\n* Romania\n* Bulgaria\n* Hungary\n* French Indochina\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| European theatre of World War II |\n| --- |\n| Part of World War II |\n| ![](image)**From left to right, top to bottom*** German Stuka dive bombers on the Eastern Front, 1943 \u2022 German soldiers take position near a Sturmgesch\u00fctz III on the Eastern Front, 1942 \u2022 American soldiers during the Italian campaign, 1943 \u2022 German Junkers Ju 87 dive bomber over Stalingrad, 1942 .

The Axis forces themselves had lost over 6 million troops, whether by combat or by wounds, disease, starvation or exposure; many others were seized as POW, about 10% of them died in the rear [36]\n\n\nLend-Lease supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States had a very important impact on Soviet military forces. Supply convoys sailed to Soviet ports that were patrolled by Nazi U-boats. Allied activities before D-Day may have tied up only a few divisions in actual fighting, but many more were forced to guard lonely coasts against raids that never came or to man anti-aircraft guns throughout Nazi-controlled Europe.\n\n\n\n## Allied invasion of occupied France[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Front (World War II)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* MacDonald, C.

London suffered particularly, being bombed each night for several months. Other targets included Birmingham and Coventry, and strategically important cities, such as the naval base at Plymouth and the port of Kingston upon Hull. With no land forces in direct conflict in Europe, the war in the air attracted worldwide attention even as sea units fought the Battle of the Atlantic and a number of British commando raids hit targets in occupied Europe. Churchill famously said of the RAF personnel who fought in the battle: \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\".\n\n\n\n## Air war[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: aerial warfare on the Eastern Front and Soviet-based air operations.
