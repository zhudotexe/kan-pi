Team member Thomas Montgomerie designated the mountain \"K2\" for being the second peak of the Karakoram range. The other peaks were originally named K1, K3, K4, and K5, but were eventually renamed Masherbrum, Gasherbrum IV, Gasherbrum II, and Gasherbrum I, respectively.[37] In 1892, Martin Conway led a British expedition that reached \"Concordia\" on the Baltoro Glacier.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 28 July 2013, two New Zealanders, Marty Schmidt and his son Denali, died after an avalanche destroyed their camp. A guide had reached their camp, but said they were nowhere to be seen and the campsite tent showed signs of having been hit by an avalanche. British climber Adrian Hayes, who was with the group, later posted on his Facebook page that the campsite had been wiped out.[68]\n2014\nOn 26 July 2014, the first team of Pakistani climbers scaled K2. There were six Pakistani and three Italian climbers in the expedition, called K2 60 Years Later, according to BBC. Previously, K2 had only been summited by individual Pakistanis as part of international expeditions.[69] Another team, consisting of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita, Maya Sherpa, and Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, became the first Nepali women to climb K2.[70]\nOn 27 July 2014, Garrett Madison led a team of three American climbers and six Sherpas to summit K2.[71][72]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 31 July 2014, Boyan Petrov completed the first Bulgarian ascent, just 8 days after climbing Broad Peak. Boyan is among the very few climbers with diabetes to climb above 7,000 metres (23,000\u00a0ft) without the use of supplemental oxygen.[73]\n2017\nOn 28 July 2017, Vanessa O'Brien led an international team of 12 with Mingma Gyalje Sherpa of Dreamers Destination to the summit of K2 and became the first British and American woman to summit K2, and the eldest woman to summit K2 at the age of 52 years old.[74] She paid tribute to Julie Tullis and Alison Hargreaves, two British women who summited K2, in 1986 and 1995 respectively, but died during their descents. Other notable summits included John Snorri Sigurj\u00f3nsson and Dawa Gyalje Sherpa who joined his sister (Dawa Yangzum Sherpa), becoming the second set of siblings to summit K2.[75] Both Mingma Gyalje Sherpa and Fazal Ali recorded their second K2 summits.[*citation needed*]\n2018\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe standard route of ascent, used by 75% of all climbers, is the Abruzzi Spur,[102][103] located on the Pakistani side, first attempted by Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi in 1909. This is the peak's southeast ridge, rising above the Godwin-Austen Glacier. The spur proper begins at an altitude of 5,400 metres (17,700\u00a0ft), where Advanced Base Camp is usually placed. The route follows an alternating series of rock ribs, snow/ice fields, and some technical rock climbing on two famous features, \"House's Chimney\" and the \"Black Pyramid.\" Above the Black Pyramid, dangerously exposed and difficult-to-navigate slopes lead to the easily visible \"Shoulder\", and thence to the summit. The last major obstacle is a narrow couloir known as the \"Bottleneck\", which places climbers dangerously close to a wall of seracs that form an ice cliff to the east of the summit. It was partly due to the collapse of one of these seracs around 2001 that no climbers reached the summit in 2002 and 2003.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2021\u00a0\u2014 Ten climbers from an international expedition made the first winter summit on 16 January 2021. The group all summited together, and consisted of Mingma Gyalje Sherpa, Nirmal Purja, Gelje Sherpa, Mingma David Sherpa, Mingma Tenzi Sherpa, Dawa Temba Sherpa, Pem Chhiri Sherpa, Kilu Pemba Sherpa, Dawa Tenjing Sherpa, and Sona Sherpa. The summiting group consisted entirely of indigenous climbers from Nepal. Nirmal Purja was the only one who reached the summit without the use of supplemental oxygen. The summit temperature was \u221240\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221240\u00a0\u00b0F). On the same day Spanish team member Sergi Mingote died on the descent from Camp III; he fell somewhere between Camp I and Advanced Base Camp.[16][15][88][89][90][91][92][93][94] Other famous climbers who died on the same expedition include Atanas Skatov,[95][96][97] Ali Sadpara, John Snorri, and Juan Pablo Mohr Prieto.[98][99]\n\n\n## Climbing routes and difficulties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first serious attempt to climb K2 was undertaken in 1902 by Oscar Eckenstein, Aleister Crowley, Jules Jacot-Guillarmod, Heinrich Pfannl, Victor Wessely, and Guy Knowles via the Northeast Ridge. In the early 1900s, modern transportation did not exist in the region: it took \"fourteen days just to reach the foot of the mountain\".[39]\nAfter five serious and costly attempts, the team reached 6,525 metres (21,407\u00a0ft)[40]\u2014although considering the difficulty of the challenge, and the lack of modern climbing equipment or weatherproof fabrics, Crowley's statement that \"neither man nor beast was injured\" highlights the relative skill of the ascent. The failures were also attributed to sickness (Crowley was suffering the residual effects of malaria), a combination of questionable physical training, personality conflicts, and poor weather conditions\u2014of 68 days spent on K2 (at the time, the record for the longest time spent at such an altitude) only eight provided clear weather.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt may have been a compound name invented by Western explorers[22] or simply a bemused reply to the question \"What's that called?\"[19] It does, however, form the basis for the name *Qogir* (simplified Chinese: \u4e54\u6208\u91cc\u5cf0; traditional Chinese: \u55ac\u6208\u91cc\u5cf0; pinyin: *Qi\u00e1og\u0113l\u01d0 F\u0113ng*) by which Chinese authorities officially refer to the peak. Other local names have been suggested including *Lamba Pahar* (\"Tall Mountain\" in Urdu) and *Dapsang*, but these are not widely used.[19]\n\n\nWith the mountain lacking a local name, the name *Mount Godwin-Austen* was suggested, in honour of Henry Godwin-Austen, an early explorer of the area. While the name was rejected by the Royal Geographical Society,[19] it was used on several maps and continues to be used occasionally.[23][24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. **^** \"Sadpara, Snorri and Mohr Missing on K2; Rescue Mission Temporarily Suspended\". *ukclimbing.com*. 9 February 2021.

The attempt failed after a storm pinned down the team for 10 days at 7,800 metres (25,590\u00a0ft), during which time climber Art Gilkey became critically ill. A desperate retreat followed, during which Pete Schoening saved almost the entire team during a mass fall (known simply as The Belay), and Gilkey was killed, either in an avalanche or in a deliberate attempt to avoid burdening his companions. Despite the retreat and tragic end, the expedition has been given iconic status in mountaineering history.[47][48][49] The Gilkey Memorial was built in his memory at the mountain's foot.[50]\n\n\n\n### Success and repeats[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)K2 from the east, photographed during the 1909 expedition\nThe next attempt on K2 was not made until 1938, when the First American Karakoram expedition led by Charles Houston made a reconnaissance of the mountain. They concluded that the Abruzzi Spur was the most practical route and reached a height of around 8,000 meters (26,000\u00a0ft) before turning back due to diminishing supplies and the threat of bad weather.[43][44]\n\n\nThe following year, the 1939 American expedition led by Fritz Wiessner came within 200 metres (660\u00a0ft) of the summit but ended in disaster when Dudley Wolfe, Pasang Kikuli, Pasang Kitar, and Pintso disappeared high on the mountain.[45][46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBesides the original Japanese ascent, a notable ascent of the North Ridge was the one in 1990 by Greg Child, Greg Mortimer, and Steve Swenson, which was done alpine style above Camp 2, though using some fixed ropes already put in place by a Japanese team.[106]\n\n\n\n### Other routes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**K2**, at 8,611 metres (28,251\u00a0ft) above sea level, is the second-highest mountain on Earth, after Mount Everest at 8,849 metres (29,032\u00a0ft).[3] It lies in the Karakoram range, partially in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and partially in the China-administered Trans-Karakoram Tract in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang.[4][5][6][a]\n\n\nK2 also became popularly known as the *Savage Mountain* after George Bell\u2014a climber on the 1953 American expedition\u2014told reporters, \"It's a savage mountain that tries to kill you.\"[7] Of the five highest mountains in the world, K2 is the deadliest; approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who reach the summit.[7][8] Also occasionally known as *Mount Godwin-Austen*,[9] other nicknames for K2 are *The King of Mountains* and *The Mountaineers' Mountain*,[10] as well as *The Mountain of Mountains* after prominent Italian climber Reinhold Messner titled his book about K2 the same.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Kashmir\", *Encyclopedia Americana*, Scholastic Library Publishing, 2006, p.\u00a0328, ISBN\u00a0978-0-7172-0139-6, KASHMIR, kash'mer, the northernmost region of the Indian subcontinent, administered partly by India, partly by Pakistan, and partly by China.

As of February\u00a02021[update], only 377 people have summited K2.[13] There have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs.\n\n\nMost ascents are made during July and August, typically the warmest times of the year.[14] But in January 2021, K2 became the final eight-thousander to be summited in the winter; the mountaineering feat was accomplished by a team of Nepalese climbers, led by Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa.[15][16]\n\n\nK2 has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges, but unlike other eight-thousanders, never from its eastern face.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

They failed because of poor weather and snow conditions.[16]\n* In 1931, Paul Bauer led a second German expedition team who attempted the northeast spur before being turned back by bad weather, illnesses and deaths. The team, including Peter Aufschnaiter, retreated after climbing 300 m higher than the 1929 attempt.[38]\n* In 1954, John Kempe led a party comprising J. W. Tucker, S. R. Jackson, G. C. Lewis, T. H. Braham and medical officer D. S. Mathews. They explored the upper Yalung glacier with the intention to discover a practicable route to the great ice-shelf that runs across the southwest face of Kangchenjunga.[39] This reconnaissance led to the route used by the successful 1955 expedition.[40]\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In 1899, British mountaineer Douglas Freshfield set out with his party comprising the Italian photographer Vittorio Sella. They were the first mountaineers to examine the lower and upper ramparts, and the great western face of Kangchenjunga, rising from the Kangchenjunga Glacier.[3]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUntil 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.[6]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped just short of the true summit, keeping a promise given to Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of Sikkim, that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate.[7] The Indian side of the mountain is off-limits to climbers. In 2016, the adjoining Khangchendzonga National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe ascent proved that Aleister Crowley's 1905 route (also investigated by the 1954 reconnaissance) was viable. The route starts on the Yalung Glacier to the southwest of the peak, and climbs the Yalung Face, which is 3,000 metres (10,000\u00a0ft) high. The main feature of this face is the \"Great Shelf\", a large sloping plateau at around 7,500 metres (24,600\u00a0ft), covered by a hanging glacier. The route is almost entirely on snow, glacier and one icefall; the summit ridge itself can involve a small amount of travel on rock. The first ascent expedition made six camps above their base camp, two below the Shelf, two on it, and two above it. They started on 18 April, and everyone was back to base camp by 28 May.[41] Other members of this expedition included John Angelo Jackson and Tom Mackinnon.[42]\n\n\n\n### Other notable ascents[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In 1907, two Norwegians set about climbing *Jongri* via the Kabru glacier to the south, an approach apparently rejected by Graham's party. Progress was very slow, partly because of problems with supplies and porters, and presumably also lack of fitness and acclimatisation. However, from a high camp at about 22,600\u00a0ft (6,900\u00a0m) they were eventually able to reach a point 50 or 60\u00a0ft (15 or 18\u00a0m) below the summit before they were turned back by strong winds.[35]\n* In 1929, the German Paul Bauer led an expedition team that reached 7,400\u00a0m (24,300\u00a0ft) on the northeast spur before being turned back by a five-day storm.[38]\n* In May 1929, the American E. F. Farmer left Darjeeling with native porters, crossed the Kang La into Nepal and climbed up towards the *Talung Saddle*. When his porters refused to go any further, he climbed alone further upwards through drifting mists but did not return.[16]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* H.W.

Aleister Crowley had been part of the team attempting the 1902 ascent of K2. The team reached an estimated altitude of 6,500\u00a0m (21,300\u00a0ft) on the southwest side of the mountain before turning back. The exact height reached is somewhat unclear; Crowley stated that on 31 August, \"We were certainly over 21,000\u00a0ft (6,400\u00a0m) and possibly over 22,000\u00a0ft (6,700\u00a0m)\", when the team was forced to retreat to Camp 5 by the risk of avalanche. On 1 September, they evidently went further; some members of the team, Reymond, Pache and Salama, \"got over the bad patch\" that had forced them to return to Camp 5 the day before, and progressed \"out of sight and hearing\" before returning to Crowley and the men with packs, who could not cross the dangerous section unassisted with their burdens. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Recent Heroes of Modern Adventure, T.
