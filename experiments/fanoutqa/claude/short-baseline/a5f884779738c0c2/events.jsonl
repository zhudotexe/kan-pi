Its largest moon Charon, named after the ferryman who took souls across the River Styx, is more than half as large as Pluto itself, and large enough to orbit a point outside Pluto's surface. In effect, each orbits the other, forming a binary system informally referred to as a double-dwarf-planet. Pluto's four other moons, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx are far smaller and orbit the Pluto–Charon system.[5]\n\n\nAmong the other dwarf planets, Ceres has no known moons. It is 90 percent certain that Ceres has no moons larger than 1 km in size, assuming that they would have the same albedo as Ceres itself.[6] Eris has one large known moon, Dysnomia.

Haumea has two moons, Hiʻiaka and Namaka, of radii ~195 and ~100 km, respectively.[8] Makemake has one moon, discovered in April 2016.\n\n\nA number of other objects in the Kuiper belt and scattered disk may turn out to be dwarf planets. Orcus, Quaoar, Gonggong, and Sedna are generally agreed to be dwarf planets among astronomers, and all but Sedna are known to have moons.[9] A number of other smaller objects, such as Salacia, Varda, and 2013 FY27, also have moons, although their dwarf planethood is more doubtful. This list includes all objects with a best estimated diameter above 700 km, including 2003 AZ84 whose satellite has not been seen since its initial discovery.\n\n\nAs of October 2022[update], 365 asteroid moons and 128 trans-Neptunian moons (including those of Pluto and the other dwarf planets) had been discovered.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSaturn has 146 moons with known orbits; 66 of them have received permanent designations, and 63 have been named. Most of them are quite small. Seven moons are large enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, including Titan, the second largest moon in the Solar System. Including these large moons, 24 of Saturn's moons are regular, and traditionally named after Titans or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn. The remaining 122 are irregular, and classified by their orbital characteristics into Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies the groups are named after. The rings of Saturn are made up of icy objects ranging in size from one centimetre to hundreds of metres, each of which is on its own orbit about the planet. Thus, a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, as there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn's ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_011iG7u5UH8WxNR8UXrRWPLj","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Searches for more satellites have been unsuccessful, putting the maximum radius of any other satellites at 90 m (100 yd).[4]\n\n\nJupiter has 95 moons with known orbits; 72 of them have received permanent designations, and 57 have been named. Its eight regular moons are grouped into the planet-sized Galilean moons and the far smaller Amalthea group. They were named after lovers of Zeus, the Greek equivalent of Jupiter. Among them is Ganymede, the largest and most massive moon in the Solar System. Its 87 known irregular moons are organized into two categories: prograde and retrograde. The prograde satellites consist of the Himalia group and three others in groups of one. The retrograde moons are grouped into the Carme, Ananke and Pasiphae groups.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Some moons, minor planets and comets of the Solar System to scale (major planets not to scale)\n![](image)Selected moons, with Earth to scale.

Earth also has more than 20 known co-orbitals, including the asteroids 3753 Cruithne and 469219 Kamoʻoalewa, and the occasional temporary satellite, like 2020 CD3; however, since they do not permanently orbit Earth, they are not considered moons. (See Other moons of Earth and Quasi-satellite.)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to Earth's varying distance from these planets (as well as their distance to the Sun), the limits at which we are able to detect new moons are very inconsistent. As the below graph demonstrates, the absolute magnitude (total inherent brightness, abbreviated H) of moons we have detected around planets peaks at H = 17 for Jupiter, H = 16 for Saturn, H = 13 for Uranus, and H = 11 for Neptune.[*clarification needed*] Smaller moons may (and most likely do) exist around each of these planets, but are currently undetectable from Earth. Although spacecraft have visited all of these planets, Earth-based telescopes continue to outperform them in moon-detection ability due to their greater availability for wide-field surveys.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanetary moons by absolute magnitude\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Its largest moon Charon, named after the ferryman who took souls across the River Styx, is more than half as large as Pluto itself, and large enough to orbit a point outside Pluto's surface. In effect, each orbits the other, forming a binary system informally referred to as a double-dwarf-planet. Pluto's four other moons, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx are far smaller and orbit the Pluto–Charon system.[5]\n\n\nAmong the other dwarf planets, Ceres has no known moons. It is 90 percent certain that Ceres has no moons larger than 1 km in size, assuming that they would have the same albedo as Ceres itself.[6] Eris has one large known moon, Dysnomia. Accurately determining its size is difficult: one indicative estimate of its radius is 350±57.5 km.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ***Ganymede*** | ![](image) | Jupiter | III (3) | 2,634.1±0.3 | 1,070,400 | 7.155\n | 1610 | 1610 | Galileo | Main-group moon (Galilean) | [14][15] |\n| ***Callisto*** | ![](image) | Jupiter | IV (4) | 2,410.3±1.5 | 1,882,700 | 16.69\n | 1610 | 1610 | Galileo | Main-group moon (Galilean) | [14][15] |\n| Amalthea | ![](image) | Jupiter | V (5) | 83.5±2 | 181,400 | 0.498\n | 1892 | 1892 | Barnard | Inner moon (Amalthea) | [13][14][16] |\n| Himalia | ![](image) | Jupiter | VI (6) | 69.8 | 11,461,000 | 250.56\n | 1904 | 1905 | Perrine | Prograde irregular (Himalia) | [13][14][17][18] |\n| Elara | ![](image) | Jupiter | VII (7) | 43  | 11,741,000 | 259.64\n | 1905 | 1905 | Perrine | Prograde irregular (Himalia) | [13][14][19] |\n| Pasiphae | ![](image) | Jupiter | VIII (8) | 30  | 23,624,000 | 743.63 (r)\n | 1908 | 1908 | Melotte | Retrograde irregular (Pasiphae) | [13][14][20] |\n| Sinope | ![](image) | Jupiter | IX (9) | 19  | 23,939,000 | 758.90 (r)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe earliest published discovery of a moon other than Earth's was by Galileo Galilei, who discovered the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.

Haumea has two moons, Hiʻiaka and Namaka, of radii ~195 and ~100 km, respectively.[8] Makemake has one moon, discovered in April 2016.\n\n\nA number of other objects in the Kuiper belt and scattered disk may turn out to be dwarf planets. Orcus, Quaoar, Gonggong, and Sedna are generally agreed to be dwarf planets among astronomers, and all but Sedna are known to have moons.[9] A number of other smaller objects, such as Salacia, Varda, and 2013 FY27, also have moons, although their dwarf planethood is more doubtful. This list includes all objects with a best estimated diameter above 700 km, including 2003 AZ84 whose satellite has not been seen since its initial discovery.\n\n\nAs of October 2022[update], 365 asteroid moons and 128 trans-Neptunian moons (including those of Pluto and the other dwarf planets) had been discovered.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSaturn has 146 moons with known orbits; 66 of them have received permanent designations, and 63 have been named. Most of them are quite small. Seven moons are large enough to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, including Titan, the second largest moon in the Solar System. Including these large moons, 24 of Saturn's moons are regular, and traditionally named after Titans or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn. The remaining 122 are irregular, and classified by their orbital characteristics into Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies the groups are named after. The rings of Saturn are made up of icy objects ranging in size from one centimetre to hundreds of metres, each of which is on its own orbit about the planet. Thus, a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, as there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn's ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_011iG7u5UH8WxNR8UXrRWPLj","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
