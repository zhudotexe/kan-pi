English declared the official language\n Multiple official languages, including English (Alaska, Hawaii, South Dakota), or languages with special status (New Mexico)\n No official language specified.\n\nThe United States has never had an official language at the federal level,[21] but English is typically used at the federal level and in states without an official language. Outside of Puerto Rico, English is the primary language used for legislation, regulations, executive orders, treaties, federal court rulings, and all other official pronouncements. Nonetheless, laws require documents such as ballots to be printed in multiple languages when there are large numbers of non-English speakers in an area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United States does not have an official language at the federal level, but the most commonly used language is English (specifically, American English), which is the de facto national language. It is also the language spoken at home by the great majority of the U.S. population (approximately 78.5%).[6] Many other languages are also spoken at home, especially Spanish (13.3% of the population), according to the American Community Survey (ACS) of the U.S. Census Bureau; these include indigenous languages originally spoken by Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and native populations in the U.S. unincorporated territories. Other languages were brought in by people from Europe, Africa, Asia, other parts of the Americas, and Oceania, including multiple dialects, creole languages, pidgin languages, and sign languages originating in what is now the United States. Interlingua, an international auxiliary language, was also created in the U.S.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * **Countries and territories where English is an official language, but not the majority first language**\n |\n| Africa | * Botswana\n* Cameroon\n* Eswatini\n* The Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Kenya\n* Lesotho\n* Liberia\n* Malawi\n* Mauritius\n* Namibia\n* Nigeria\n* Rwanda\n* Sierra Leone\n* Somaliland\n* South Africa\n* South Sudan\n* Sudan\n* Tanzania\n* Uganda\n* Zambia\n* Zimbabwe\n |\n| Americas | * *Puerto Rico*\n |\n| Asia | * *Christmas Island*\n* *Cocos (Keeling) Islands*\n* *Hong Kong*\n* India\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Singapore\n |\n| Europe | * *Gibraltar*\n* *Akrotiri and Dhekelia*\n* Malta\n |\n| Oceania | * *American Samoa*\n* Cook Islands\n* Fiji\n* *Guam*\n* Kiribati\n* Marshall Islands\n* Micronesia\n* Nauru\n* Niue\n* *Northern Mariana Islands*\n* Palau\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Samoa\n* Solomon Islands\n* *Tokelau*\n* Tuvalu\n* Vanuatu\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Dependencies shown in *italics*.\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThirty-two states, in some cases as part of what has been called the English-only movement, have adopted legislation granting official status to English.[22][23][24] Typically only \"English\" is specified, not a particular variety like American English. (From 1923 to 1969, the state of Illinois recognized its official language as \"American\".)[25][26] Hawaiian, although having few native speakers, is an official language along with English of the state of Hawaii. Alaska has made some 20 native languages official, along with English;[27][28] for example, Alaska provides voting information in I\u00f1upiaq, Central Yup'ik, Gwich'in, Siberian Yupik, and Koyukon among others.[29] On July 1, 2019, a law went into effect making Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota\u00a0the official indigenous languages of South Dakota.[30]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * **Countries and territories where English is the national language or the native language of the majority**\n |\n| Africa | * *Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha*\n |\n| Americas | * *Anguilla*\n* Antigua and Barbuda\n* The Bahamas\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* *Bermuda*\n* *British Virgin Islands*\n* Canada\n* *Cayman Islands*\n* Dominica\n* *Falkland Islands*\n* Grenada\n* Guyana\n* Jamaica\n* *Montserrat*\n* *Saba*\n* Saint Kitts and Nevis\n* Saint Lucia\n* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n* *Sint Eustatius*\n* *Sint Maarten*\n* *South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands*\n* Trinidad and Tobago\n* *Turks and Caicos Islands*\n* United States\n* *United States Virgin Islands*\n |\n| Europe | * *Guernsey*\n* Ireland\n* *Isle of Man*\n* *Jersey*\n* United Kingdom\n |\n| Oceania | * Australia\n* New Zealand\n* *Norfolk Island*\n* *Pitcairn Islands*\n |\n\n |\n| \u00a0 | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| French | * Louisiana\n* M\u00e9tis\n* Missouri\n* Muskrat\n* New England\n |\n| German | * Pennsylvania Dutch\n* Hutterite\n* Plautdietsch\n* Bernese\n* Alsatian\n* Texas\n |\n| Spanish | * Cal\u00f3 (Chicano)\n* Isle\u00f1o\n* New Mexican\n* Puerto Rican\n* Sabine River\n |\n| Creole and mixed languages | * Gullah\n* Louisiana Creole\n* Spanglish\n* Angloromani\n |\n\n |\n| Manual settlerlanguages | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Francosign | * American Sign Language\n* Black American Sign Language\n* Protactile\n* Puerto Rican Sign Language\n |\n| BANZSL | * Samoan Sign Language\n |\n| *Kentish* | * *Martha's Vineyard Sign Language*\n |\n| Isolates | * *Sandy River Valley Sign Language*\n* *Henniker Sign Language*\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Languages of the United States |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Official | None[a] |\n| National | English (*de facto*) |\n| Main | English 78.5%, Spanish 13.2%, other Indo-European languages 3.7%, Asian and Pacific languages 3.5%, other languages 1.1% (2020 survey by the Census Bureau[2]) |\n| Indigenous | Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, Muscogee, Dakota, Lakota, Western Apache, Keres, Hopi, Zuni, Kiowa, Ojibwe, O'odham, Miwuk[3][4] Others\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bilingual education\n* Culture of the United States\n* Languages of Canada\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The United States does have an official designated language. However, the majority of the United States speaks English. A bill known as H.R.997\u2014the English Language Unity Act\u2014was introduced in 2017 in an attempt to make English the official language.[1]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrench is a *de facto*, but unofficial, language in Maine and Louisiana, while New Mexico law grants Spanish a special status. The government of Louisiana offers services and most documents in both English and French, and New Mexico does so in English and Spanish.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEnglish is at least one of the official languages in all five permanently inhabited U.S. territories. In Puerto Rico both English and Spanish are official, although Spanish has been declared the principal official language. The school system and the government operate almost entirely in Spanish, but federal law requires the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to use English,[31] like the rest of the federal court system. Guam recognizes English and Chamorro. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, English is the only official language. In American Samoa, both English and Samoan are officially recognized; English is common but Samoan is also seen in some official communications. In the Northern Mariana Islands, English, Chamorro, and Carolinian are official.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** Goldberg, David; Looney, Dennis; Lusin, Natalia (February 2015). \"Enrollments in Languages Other Than English in United States Institutions of Higher Education, Fall 2013\" (PDF).

All federal legislation is enacted bilingually. Provincially, only in New Brunswick are both English and French official to the same extent. French is Quebec's official language,[6] although legislation is enacted in both French and English and court proceedings may be conducted in either language. English is the official language of Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta, but government services are available in French in many regions of each, particularly in regions and cities where Francophones form the majority. Legislation is enacted in both languages and courts conduct cases in both. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### *De facto* English only, or limited French-language services: the other eight provinces[edit]\n\n\nMost provinces have laws that make either English or both English and French the official language(s) of the legislature and the courts but may also have separate policies in regards to education and the bureaucracy.\n\n\nFor example, in Alberta, English and French are both official languages of debate in the Legislative Assembly, but laws may be drafted solely in English and there is no legal requirement that they be translated into French. French can be used in some lower courts and education is offered in both languages, but the bureaucracy functions almost solely in English. Therefore, although Alberta is not officially an English-only province, English has a higher *de facto* status than French. Ontario and Manitoba are similar but allow for more services in French at the local level.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geographic distribution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* New Brunswick: English and French.
