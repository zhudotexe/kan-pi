But his results were questioned and he did not have enough quantities to isolate them, so he withdrew his claims in 1829.[119] However, in 1844 Karl Karlovich Klaus confirmed that there was one new metal, and reused Osann's name \"ruthenium\".[120] |\n| 55\n | Caesium | 1860\n | R.

It had been predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 as eka-manganese.[157][158][159] In 1952, Paul W. Merrill found its spectral lines in S-type red giants.[160] Minuscule trace quantities were finally found on Earth in 1962 by B. T. Kenna and Paul K. Kuroda: they isolated it from Belgian Congo pitchblende, where it occurs as a spontaneous fission product of uranium.[161] The Noddacks (rediscoverers of rhenium) claimed to have discovered element 43 in 1925 as well and named it *masurium* (after Masuria), but their claims were disproven by Kuroda, who calculated that there cannot have been enough technetium in their samples to have enabled a true detection.[162] |\n| 87\n | Francium | 1939\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Z\n | Element\n | Observed or predicted\n | Isolated (widely known) | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | By |  | By |  |\n| 15\n | Phosphorus | 1669\n | H.

Stromeyer, and J.C.H. Roloff\n | *1817* | *S. L Hermann, F. Stromeyer, and J.C.H.

Balard and C. Löwig | *1825* | *J. Balard and C. Löwig* | They both discovered the element in the autumn of 1825.

Lavoisier** |  |  | Lavoisier writes the first modern list of chemical elements – containing 33 elements including light and heat but omitting Na, K (he was unsure of whether soda and potash without carbonic acid, i.e. Na2O and K2O, are simple substances or compounds like NH3),[78] Sr, Te; some elements were listed in the table as unextracted \"radicals\" (Cl, F, B) or as oxides (Ca, Mg, Ba, Al, Si).[63] He also redefines the term \"element\". Until then, no metals except mercury were considered elements.\n |\n| 40\n | Zirconium | 1789\n | H. Klaproth | 1824\n | J. Berzelius | Martin Heinrich Klaproth identified a new oxide in zircon in 1789,[79][80] and in 1808 Davy showed that this oxide has a metallic base although he could not isolate it.[81][82] |\n| 92\n | Uranium | 1789\n | H. Klaproth | 1841\n | E.-M. Péligot | Klaproth mistakenly identified a uranium oxide obtained from pitchblende as the element itself and named it after the recently discovered planet Uranus.[83][84] |\n| 22\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Nutrition\n* Valence\n |\n| Data pages for elements\n* Abundance\n* Atomic radius\n* Boiling point\n* Critical point\n* Density\n* Elasticity\n* Electrical resistivity\n* Electron affinity / configuration\n* Electronegativity\n* Hardness\n* Heat capacity / of fusion / of vaporization\n* Ionization energy\n* Melting point\n* Oxidation state\n* Speed of sound\n* Thermal conductivity / expansion coefficient\n* Vapor pressure\n |\n| * **Category**\n* **Chemistry Portal**\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe discovery of the 118 chemical elements known to exist as of 2023 is presented in chronological order.

There are plans to synthesize more elements, and it is not known how many elements are possible.\n\n\nEach element's name, atomic number, year of first report, name of the discoverer, and notes related to the discovery are listed.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | W. Ramsay, T. Cleve, and N. Langlet | P. Janssen and Lockyer observed independently a yellow line in the solar spectrum that did not match any other element. However, only Lockyer made the correct conclusion that it was due to a new element. This was the first observation of a noble gas, located in the Sun. Years later after the isolation of argon on Earth, Ramsay, Cleve, and Langlet observed independently helium trapped in cleveite.[126] |\n|  |  | **1869** | **D. I.

The pure metallic form was only obtained in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter.[85][86] |\n| 39\n | Yttrium | 1794\n | J. Gadolin | 1843\n | H. Rose | Johan Gadolin discovered the earth in gadolinite in 1794. He did not name his discovery, but Andreas Ekeberg did so when he confirmed it in 1797.[5] Mosander showed later that its ore, yttria, contained more elements.[87][88] In 1808, Davy showed that yttria is a metallic oxide, although he could not isolate the metal.[89][90] Wöhler mistakenly thought he had isolated the metal in 1828 from a volatile chloride he supposed to be yttrium chloride,[91][92] but Rose proved otherwise in 1843 and correctly isolated the element himself that year.\n |\n| 24\n | Chromium | 1797\n | N.

Claus* | Gottfried Wilhelm Osann thought that he found three new metals in Russian platinum samples in 1826, which he named polinium, pluranium, and ruthenium in 1828. But his results were questioned and he did not have enough quantities to isolate them, so he withdrew his claims in 1829.[119] However, in 1844 Karl Karlovich Klaus confirmed that there was one new metal, and reused Osann's name \"ruthenium\".[120] |\n| 55\n | Caesium | 1860\n | R. Bunsen and R. Kirchhoff | 1882\n | C. Setterberg | Bunsen and Kirchhoff were the first to suggest finding new elements by spectrum analysis. They discovered caesium by its two blue emission lines in a sample of Dürkheim mineral water.[121] The pure metal was eventually isolated in 1882 by Setterberg.[122] |\n| 37\n | Rubidium | 1861\n | R. Bunsen and G. R. Kirchhoff | 1863\n | R. Bunsen\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Bunsen and Kirchhoff discovered it just a few months after caesium, by observing new spectral lines in the mineral lepidolite.[123] The metal was isolated by Bunsen around 1863.[108] |\n| 81\n | Thallium | 1861\n | W. Crookes | 1862\n | C.-A. Lamy | Shortly after the discovery of rubidium, Crookes found a new green line in a selenium sample; later that year, Lamy found the element to be metallic.[124] |\n| 49\n | Indium | 1863\n | F. Reich and T. Richter | 1864\n | T.

Segrè* | The two discovered a new element in a molybdenum sample that was used in a cyclotron, the first element to be discovered by synthesis. It had been predicted by Mendeleev in 1871 as eka-manganese.[157][158][159] In 1952, Paul W. Merrill found its spectral lines in S-type red giants.[160] Minuscule trace quantities were finally found on Earth in 1962 by B. T. Kenna and Paul K. Kuroda: they isolated it from Belgian Congo pitchblende, where it occurs as a spontaneous fission product of uranium.[161] The Noddacks (rediscoverers of rhenium) claimed to have discovered element 43 in 1925 as well and named it *masurium* (after Masuria), but their claims were disproven by Kuroda, who calculated that there cannot have been enough technetium in their samples to have enabled a true detection.[162] |\n| 87\n | Francium | 1939\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Z\n | Element\n | Observed or predicted\n | Isolated (widely known) | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  | By |  | By |  |\n| 15\n | Phosphorus | 1669\n | H.

Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Henry Cavendish, and Joseph Priestley also studied the element at about the same time, and Lavoisier named it in 1775–6.[69] |\n| 56\n | Barium | 1772\n | W. Scheele\n | 1808\n | H. Davy\n | Scheele distinguished a new earth (BaO) in pyrolusite in 1772. He did not name his discovery; Guyton de Morveau suggested *barote* in 1782.[5] It was changed to *baryte* in the *Méthode de nomenclature chimique* of Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Antoine Lavoisier, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy (1787). Davy isolated the metal by electrolysis.[70] |\n| 17\n | Chlorine | 1774\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor 18th-century discoveries, around the time that Antoine Lavoisier first questioned the phlogiston theory, the recognition of a new \"earth\" has been regarded as being equivalent to the discovery of a new element (as was the general practice then).[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Berzelius obtained the oxide of a new earth in thorite.[114] |\n| 57\n | Lanthanum | 1838\n | G.

Mosander | 1885\n | C. A. von Welsbach | Discovered by Mosander and called didymium. Carl Auer von Welsbach later split it into two elements, praseodymium and neodymium. Neodymium had formed the greater part of the old didymium and received the prefix \"neo-\".[72][116] |\n| 68\n | Erbium | 1843\n | G. Mosander | 1879\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | W.
