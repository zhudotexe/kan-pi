Five of the dice are shaped like the Platonic solids, whose faces are regular polygons. Aside from the cube, the other four Platonic solids have 4, 8, 12, and 20 faces, allowing for those number ranges to be generated. The only other common non-cubical die is the 10-sided die, a pentagonal trapezohedron die, whose faces are ten kites, each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices. Such sets frequently include a second 10-sided die either of contrasting color or numbered by tens, allowing the pair of 10-sided dice to be combined to generate numbers between 1 and 100.\n\n\nUsing these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate a variety of probability distributions. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a uniform distribution of random percentages, and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to normal distributions.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Pentagonal prism | ![](image) | Similar in constitution to the 5-sided die.

A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this method of divination. It is highly likely that the Pythagoreans used the Platonic solids as dice. They referred to such dice as \"the dice of the gods\" and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 120\n | Disdyakis triacontahedron | ![](image) | Each face is a scalene triangle.\n |\n\n\n### Non-numeric dice[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A set of Fudge dice\nThe faces of most dice are labelled using sequences of whole numbers, usually starting at one, expressed with either pips or digits. However, there are some applications that require results other than numbers. Examples include letters for Boggle, directions for *Warhammer Fantasy Battle*, Fudge dice, playing card symbols for poker dice, and instructions for sexual acts using sex dice.\n\n\n\n### Alternatively-numbered dice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe modern tradition of using *sets* of polyhedral dice started around the end of the 1960s when non-cubical dice became popular among players of wargames,[28] and since have been employed extensively in role-playing games and trading card games. Dice using both the numerals 6 and 9, which are reciprocally symmetric through rotation, typically distinguish them with a dot or underline.\n\n\n\n#### Common variations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Isohedron\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Rounded rhombicuboctahedron | ![](image) | Eighteen faces are squares.

The weight will settle in one of the points of the internal cavity, causing it to settle with one of the numbers uppermost. For instance, a sphere with an octahedral cavity and a small internal weight will settle with one of the 6 points of the cavity held downwards by the weight.\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDice may have numbers that do not form a counting sequence starting at one. One variation on the standard die is known as the \"average\" die.[34][35] These are six-sided dice with sides numbered `2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5`, which have the same arithmetic mean as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have a narrower range of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top wargames, where a narrower range of numbers is required.[35] Other numbered variations include Sicherman dice and intransitive dice.\n\n\n\n### Spherical dice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Triangular prism | ![](image) | A prism that is thin enough to land either on its \"edge\" or \"face\".

They are used for generating random values, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLong dice and teetotums can in principle be made with any number of faces, including odd numbers.[31] Long dice are based on the infinite set of prisms. All the rectangular faces are mutually face-transitive, so they are equally probable. The two ends of the prism may be rounded or capped with a pyramid, designed so that the die cannot rest on those faces. 4-sided long dice are easier to roll than tetrahedra, and are used in the traditional board games dayakattai and daldÃ¸s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA loaded, weighted, cheat, or crooked die is one that has been tampered with so that it will land with a specific side facing upwards more or less often than a fair die would. There are several methods for making loaded dice, including rounded faces, off-square faces, and weights. Casinos and gambling halls frequently use transparent cellulose acetate dice as tampering is easier to detect than with opaque dice.[27]\n\n\n\n## Variants[edit]\n\n\n### Polyhedral dice[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A typical set of polyhedral dice in various colors. They consist of the five Platonic solids, along with a ten-sided die that is also used for generating percentages.\nVarious shapes like two-sided or four-sided dice are documented in archaeological findings; for example, from Ancient Egypt and the Middle East. While the cubical six-sided die became the most common type in many parts of the world, other shapes were always known, like 20-sided dice in Ptolemaic and Roman times. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA traditional die is a cube with each of its six faces marked with a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing a random integer from one to six on its upper surface, with each value being equally likely. Dice may also have polyhedral or irregular shapes, may have faces marked with numerals or symbols instead of pips and may have their numbers carved out from the material of the dice instead of marked on it. Loaded dice are designed to favor some results over others for cheating or entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Hexagonal bipyramid | ![](image) | Each face is an isosceles triangle.\n |\n| 13\n | Truncated Sphere\n | ![](image) | A truncated sphere with thirteen landing positions.

A die roll is made random by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; they are thus a crude form of hardware random number generator. \n\n\nOne typical contemporary dice game is craps, where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to introduce randomness into board games, where they are often used to decide the distance through which a piece will move along the board (as in backgammon and *Monopoly*).\n\n\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n### Arrangement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chirality of dice. Faces may be placed counterclockwise (top) *or* clockwise.\nCommon dice are small cubes, most often 1.6Â cm (0.63Â in) across, whose faces are numbered from one to six, usually by patterns of round dots called pips. (While the use of Arabic numerals is occasionally seen, such dice are less common.)\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01RZmjBQ14EVEf6oWpMWXsWY","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The ten faces usually bear numbers from zero to nine, rather than one to ten (zero being read as \"ten\" in many applications). Often all odd numbered faces converge at one sharp corner, and the even ones at the other.

The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 21 if numbered 1â€“20.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDice can be used for divination and using dice for such a purpose is called cleromancy. A pair of common dice is usual, though other forms of polyhedra can be used. Tibetan Buddhists sometimes use this method of divination. It is highly likely that the Pythagoreans used the Platonic solids as dice. They referred to such dice as \"the dice of the gods\" and they sought to understand the universe through an understanding of geometry in polyhedra.[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 120\n | Disdyakis triacontahedron | ![](image) | Each face is a scalene triangle.\n |\n\n\n### Non-numeric dice[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A set of Fudge dice\nThe faces of most dice are labelled using sequences of whole numbers, usually starting at one, expressed with either pips or digits. However, there are some applications that require results other than numbers. Examples include letters for Boggle, directions for *Warhammer Fantasy Battle*, Fudge dice, playing card symbols for poker dice, and instructions for sexual acts using sex dice.\n\n\n\n### Alternatively-numbered dice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe modern tradition of using *sets* of polyhedral dice started around the end of the 1960s when non-cubical dice became popular among players of wargames,[28] and since have been employed extensively in role-playing games and trading card games. Dice using both the numerals 6 and 9, which are reciprocally symmetric through rotation, typically distinguish them with a dot or underline.\n\n\n\n#### Common variations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Isohedron\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Rounded rhombicuboctahedron | ![](image) | Eighteen faces are squares.

The weight will settle in one of the points of the internal cavity, causing it to settle with one of the numbers uppermost. For instance, a sphere with an octahedral cavity and a small internal weight will settle with one of the 6 points of the cavity held downwards by the weight.\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDice may have numbers that do not form a counting sequence starting at one. One variation on the standard die is known as the \"average\" die.[34][35] These are six-sided dice with sides numbered `2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5`, which have the same arithmetic mean as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have a narrower range of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top wargames, where a narrower range of numbers is required.[35] Other numbered variations include Sicherman dice and intransitive dice.\n\n\n\n### Spherical dice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Triangular prism | ![](image) | A prism that is thin enough to land either on its \"edge\" or \"face\".

They are used for generating random values, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLong dice and teetotums can in principle be made with any number of faces, including odd numbers.[31] Long dice are based on the infinite set of prisms. All the rectangular faces are mutually face-transitive, so they are equally probable. The two ends of the prism may be rounded or capped with a pyramid, designed so that the die cannot rest on those faces. 4-sided long dice are easier to roll than tetrahedra, and are used in the traditional board games dayakattai and daldÃ¸s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA loaded, weighted, cheat, or crooked die is one that has been tampered with so that it will land with a specific side facing upwards more or less often than a fair die would. There are several methods for making loaded dice, including rounded faces, off-square faces, and weights. Casinos and gambling halls frequently use transparent cellulose acetate dice as tampering is easier to detect than with opaque dice.[27]\n\n\n\n## Variants[edit]\n\n\n### Polyhedral dice[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A typical set of polyhedral dice in various colors. They consist of the five Platonic solids, along with a ten-sided die that is also used for generating percentages.\nVarious shapes like two-sided or four-sided dice are documented in archaeological findings; for example, from Ancient Egypt and the Middle East. While the cubical six-sided die became the most common type in many parts of the world, other shapes were always known, like 20-sided dice in Ptolemaic and Roman times. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA traditional die is a cube with each of its six faces marked with a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing a random integer from one to six on its upper surface, with each value being equally likely. Dice may also have polyhedral or irregular shapes, may have faces marked with numerals or symbols instead of pips and may have their numbers carved out from the material of the dice instead of marked on it. Loaded dice are designed to favor some results over others for cheating or entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Hexagonal bipyramid | ![](image) | Each face is an isosceles triangle.\n |\n| 13\n | Truncated Sphere\n | ![](image) | A truncated sphere with thirteen landing positions.

A die roll is made random by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; they are thus a crude form of hardware random number generator. \n\n\nOne typical contemporary dice game is craps, where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to introduce randomness into board games, where they are often used to decide the distance through which a piece will move along the board (as in backgammon and *Monopoly*).\n\n\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n### Arrangement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chirality of dice. Faces may be placed counterclockwise (top) *or* clockwise.\nCommon dice are small cubes, most often 1.6Â cm (0.63Â in) across, whose faces are numbered from one to six, usually by patterns of round dots called pips. (While the use of Arabic numerals is occasionally seen, such dice are less common.)\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01RZmjBQ14EVEf6oWpMWXsWY","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
