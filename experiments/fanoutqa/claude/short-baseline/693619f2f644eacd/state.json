However, in July 2018, the net worth of Bezos officially surpassed the $150\u00a0billion mark, which led most major wealth indexes to label him the wealthiest person in modern history (post-1982).[222]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2019, Bezos's wealth was reduced by the divorce from his wife MacKenzie Bezos.[227][228] According to *Forbes*, had the Washington state common law applied to their divorce without a prenuptial agreement, Bezos's wealth could have been equitably divided with his ex-wife;[229][230] however, she eventually received 25% of Bezos's Amazon shares, valued at approximately $36\u00a0billion, making her the third-richest woman in the world.
