On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition.[126][127] In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying Jos\u00e9 Altafini's record from the 1962\u201363 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd M\u00fcller to be top scorer in four campaigns.[128][129] Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.[130]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter a year at Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, Messi was finally enrolled in the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) in February 2002. Now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Gerard Piqu\u00e9.[24] After completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14,[25] Messi became an integral part of the \"Baby Dream Team\", Barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. During his first full season (2002\u201303), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the *Cadetes* A, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the Spanish and Catalan cups.[24][26] The Copa Catalunya final, a 4\u20131 victory over Espanyol, became known in club lore as the *partido de la m\u00e1scara*, the final of the mask. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwith Messi scoring Barcelona's only goal in that game.[309] On 15 March, Messi scored two goals in a 4\u20131 win against Huesca, and became the first player in history to score at least 20 goals in 13 consecutive seasons in the top five European leagues.[310] On 21 March, he surpassed Xavi's record to reach a club record of 768 appearances, in which he also scored a brace in a 6\u20131 away win against Real Sociedad.[311]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** Jackson, Jamie (12 January 2009). \"Ronaldo Adds Fifa World Player of the Year to List of Accolades\". *The Guardian*.

A turning point came on 11 January during a 3\u20131 victory over Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, the first time Bar\u00e7a's attacking trident of Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Neymar, dubbed \"MSN\", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run.[172][173] After five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, Messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to Su\u00e1rez, their striker.[173][174] From there, he regained his best form, while Su\u00e1rez and Neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player.[175][176] With 58 goals from Messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in Spanish football.[177]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n99. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lowe, Sid (17 May 2010). \"La Liga Title the Least Barcelona Deserve as Madrid Again Finish Empty Handed\". *The Guardian*.

French winger Ludovic Giuly explained how Messi caught the eye in a training session with Frank Rijkaard's first team: \"He destroyed us all... They were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. He would dribble past four players and score a goal. Even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. He was an alien.\"[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe set up his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6\u20132 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium.[87][88] Returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 May, scoring once and assisting a second goal as Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao 4\u20131 to win the Copa del Rey.[89] With 23 league goals from Messi that season, Barcelona became La Liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.[85][90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n191. **^** Gonzalez, Roger (27 August 2015). \"Messi Beats Ronaldo for 2014\u201315 UEFA Best Player in Europe Award\". *CBS Sports*.

However, I apologize but I'm having difficulty finding complete reliable information about the birthplaces of all of Barcelona's top five goalscorers through the searches. To provide accurate information about all five birthplaces, we would need to do additional research to confirm the birthplaces of other top scorers like C\u00e9sar Rodr\u00edguez, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala, Luis Su\u00e1rez, and Samuel Eto'o who are among Barcelona's highest scorers historically.
