The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51\u00a0billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Planets anddwarfs | * Terrestrials\n\t+ Mercury\n\t+ Venus\n\t+ Earth\n\t+ Mars\n* Giants\n\t+ Gas\n\t\t- Jupiter\n\t\t- Saturn\n\t+ Ice\n\t\t- Uranus\n\t\t- Neptune\n* Dwarfs\n\t+ Ceres\n\t+ Orcus\n\t+ Pluto\n\t+ Haumea\n\t+ Quaoar\n\t+ Makemake\n\t+ Gonggong\n\t+ Eris\n\t+ Sedna\n |\n| Moons | * Earth\n\t+ Moon\n\t+ other near-Earth objects\n* Mars\n\t+ Phobos\n\t+ Deimos\n* Jupiter\n\t+ Ganymede\n\t+ Callisto\n\t+ Io\n\t+ Europa\n\t+ all 95\n* Saturn\n\t+ Titan\n\t+ Rhea\n\t+ Iapetus\n\t+ Dione\n\t+ Tethys\n\t+ Enceladus\n\t+ Mimas\n\t+ Hyperion\n\t+ Phoebe\n\t+ all 146\n* Uranus\n\t+ Titania\n\t+ Oberon\n\t+ Umbriel\n\t+ Ariel\n\t+ Miranda\n\t+ all 28\n* Neptune\n\t+ Triton\n\t+ Proteus\n\t+ Nereid\n\t+ all 16\n* Orcus\n\t+ Vanth\n* Pluto\n\t+ Charon\n\t+ Nix\n\t+ Hydra\n\t+ Kerberos\n\t+ Styx\n* Haumea\n\t+ Hi\u02bbiaka\n\t+ Namaka\n* Quaoar\n\t+ Weywot\n* Makemake\n\t+ S/2015 (136472) 1\n* Gonggong\n\t+ Xiangliu\n* Eris\n\t+ Dysnomia\n |\n| Rings | * Jovian\n* Saturnian\u00a0(Rhean?)\n* Charikloan\n* Chironean\n* Uranian\n* Neptunian\n* Haumean\n* Quaoarian\n |\n| Small Solar System bodies | * Comets\n* Damocloids\n* Meteoroids\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon's diameter is about 3,500\u00a0km, more than a quarter of Earth's, with the face of the Moon comparable to the width of either Australia,[17] Europe or the US without Alaska.[69] The whole surface area of the Moon is about 38 million square kilometers, between the size of the Americas (North and South America) and Africa.\n\n\nThe Moon's mass is 1/81 of Earth's,[70] being the second densest among the planetary moons, and having the second highest surface gravity, after Io, at 0.1654\u00a0g and an escape velocity of 2.38\u00a0km/s (8600\u00a0km/h; 5300\u00a0mph).\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Internal structure of the Moon and Geology of the Moon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** With 27% the diameter and 60% the density of Earth, the Moon has 1.23% of the mass of Earth.

Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for. This 'fossil bulge' indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth, and that it is now too cold for its shape to restore hydrostatic equilibrium at its current orbital distance.[67]\n\n\n\n### Size and mass[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of natural satellites\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after Io.[76] However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about 350 kilometres (220\u00a0mi) or less,[1] around 20% of the radius of the Moon. Its composition is not well understood, but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel; analyses of the Moon's time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten.[77] The pressure at the lunar core is estimated to be 5\u00a0GPa (49,000\u00a0atm).[78]\n\n\n\n### Gravitational field[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An astronaut jumping on the Moon, illustrating that the gravitational pull of the Moon is approximately 1/6 of Earth's.\nOn average the Moon's surface gravity is 1.62\u00a0m/s2[4] (0.1654\u00a0g; 5.318\u00a0ft/s2), about half of the surface gravity of Mars and about a sixth of Earth's.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Martel, L.

It has an angular diameter of between 8' (rising) and 12' (overhead). Due to its close orbit, it would look smaller when the observer is further away from the Martian equator and is below the horizon and thus not visible from Mars's polar ice caps. Deimos looks more like a bright star or planet for an observer on Mars, only slightly bigger than Venus looks from Earth; it has an angular diameter of about 2'. The Sun's angular diameter as seen from Mars, by contrast, is about 21'. Thus there are no total solar eclipses on Mars, as the moons are far too small to completely cover the Sun. On the other hand, total lunar eclipses of Phobos happen almost every night.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Label  [note 1] | Name and pronunciation\n | Image\n | Diameter (km)\n | Surfacearea (km2)\n | Mass (kg)\n | Semi-majoraxis (km)\n | Orbitalperiod (h)\n | Average moonriseperiod (h, d)\n | Eccentricity\n | Inclination (\u00b0)[note 2] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| I\n | Phobos | /\u02c8fo\u028ab\u0259s/*FOH-b\u0259s* | ![](image) | 22.2\u00a0km (13.8\u00a0mi)(27\u00d721.6\u00d718.8\u00a0km)\n | 1,548\u00a0km2 | 10.7\u00d71015 | 9,377\u00a0km (5,827\u00a0mi)\n | 7.66\n | 11.12 h (0.463 d)\n | 0.0151\n | 1.093\n |\n| II\n | Deimos | /\u02c8da\u026am\u0259s/*DY-m\u0259ss* | ![](image) | 12.6\u00a0km (7.8\u00a0mi)(10\u00d712\u00d716\u00a0km)\n | 483\u00a0km2 | 1.5\u00d71015 | 23,460\u00a0km (14,580\u00a0mi)\n | 30.31\n | 131 h (5.44 d)\n | 0.00033\n | 0.93\n |\n| ![](image)The relative sizes of and distance between Mars, Phobos, and Deimos, to scale\n*(Load the image in full size to see both Moons of Mars.)*\n |\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNatural satellites of the Solar System\n |\n| --- |\n| Planetarysatellites of | * Earth\n* Mars\n* Jupiter\n* Saturn\n* Uranus\n* Neptune\n | ![](image)![](image)![](image)\n |\n| Dwarf planetsatellites of | * Orcus\n* Pluto\n* Haumea\n* Quaoar\n* Makemake\n* Gonggong\n* Eris\n |\n| Minor-planetmoons | Near-Earth\nFlorence\nDidymos\nDimorphos\nMoshup\nSquannit\n1994 CC\n2001 SN263\nMain belt\nKalliope\nLinus\nEuphrosyne\nDaphne\nPeneius\nEugenia\nPetit-Prince\nSylvia\nRomulus\nRemus\nMinerva\nAegis\nGorgoneion\nCamilla\nElektra\nKleopatra\nAlexhelios\nCleoselene\nIda\nDactyl\nRoxane\nOlympias\nPulcova\nBalam\nDinkinesh (Selam)\nJupiter trojans\nPatroclus\nMenoetius\nHektor\nSkamandrios\nEurybates\nQueta\nTNOs\nLempo\nHiisi\nPaha\n2002 UX25\nSila\u2013Nunam\nSalacia\nActaea\nVarda\nIlmar\u00eb\nG\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0\nG\u01c3\u00f2\u02bc\u00e9 \u01c3H\u00fa\n2013 FY27\n |\n| Rankedby size | * Ganymede\n\t+ **largest**: 5268 km / 0.413 Earths\n* Titan\n* Callisto\n* Io\n* Moon\n* Europa\n* Triton\n* Titania\n* Rhea\n* Oberon\n* Iapetus\n* Charon\n* Umbriel\n* Ariel\n* Dione\n* Tethys\n* Dysnomia\n* Enceladus\n* Miranda\n* Vanth\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNatural satellites orbiting Mars\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\nEnhanced color image of Phobos (MRO, 23 March 2008)\n![](image)\nEnhanced color image of Deimos (MRO, 21 February 2009)\n\nThe **two moons of Mars** are Phobos and Deimos.[1] They are irregular in shape.[2] Both were discovered by American astronomer Asaph Hall in August 1877[3] and are named after the Greek mythological twin characters Phobos (fear and panic) and Deimos (terror and dread) who accompanied their father Ares into battle. Ares, the god of war, was known to the Romans as Mars.\n\n\nCompared to the Earth's Moon, the moons Phobos and Deimos are small. Phobos has a diameter of 22.2\u00a0km (13.8\u00a0mi) and a mass of 1.08\u00d71016 kg, while Deimos measures 12.6\u00a0km (7.8\u00a0mi) across, with a mass of 2.0\u00d71015 kg. Phobos orbits closer to Mars, with a semi-major axis of 9,377\u00a0km (5,827\u00a0mi) and an orbital period of 7.66 hours; while Deimos orbits farther with a semi-major axis of 23,460\u00a0km (14,580\u00a0mi) and an orbital period of 30.35 hours.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Close Inspection for Phobos\".

The inner part of the ring formed a large moon. Gravitational interactions between this moon and the outer ring formed Phobos and Deimos. Later, the large moon crashed into Mars, but the two small moons remained in orbit. This theory agrees with the fine-grained surface of the moons and their high porosity. The outer disk would create fine-grained material.[40][41] Simulations suggest the object colliding with Mars had to be within the size range of Ceres and Vesta because a larger impact would have created a more massive disc and moons that would have prevented the survival of tiny moons like Phobos and Deimos.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Early speculation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Curiosity's* view of the Martian moons: Phobos passing in front of Deimos \u2013 in *real-time* (video-gif, 1 August 2013)\nSpeculation about the existence of the moons of Mars had begun when the moons of Jupiter were discovered. When Galileo Galilei, as a hidden report about his having observed two bumps on the sides of Saturn (later discovered to be its rings), used the anagram *smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras* for *Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi* (\"I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form\"), Johannes Kepler had misinterpreted it to mean *Salve umbistineum geminatum Martia proles* (Hello, furious twins, sons of Mars).[4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Andrews, Robin George (25 July 2020). \"Why the 'Super Weird' Moons of Mars Fascinate Scientists - What's the big deal about little Phobos and tinier Deimos?\". *The New York Times*.

At some point in the future, when it falls within the Roche limit, Phobos will be broken up by these tidal forces and either crash into Mars or form a ring.[26][27] Several strings of craters on the Martian surface, inclined further from the equator the older they are, suggest that there may have been other small moons that suffered the fate expected of Phobos, and that the Martian crust as a whole shifted between these events.[28] Deimos, on the other hand, is far enough away that its orbit is being slowly boosted instead,[29] akin to Earth's Moon.\n\n\n\n\n### Orbital details[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** Sheppard, Scott S.; Jewitt, David; Kleyna, Jan (November 2004). \"A Survey for Outer Satellites of Mars: Limits to Completeness\". *The Astronomical Journal*. **128** (5): 2542\u20132546. arXiv:astro-ph/0409522.

Phobos:\n- Diameter: 22.2 km (13.8 mi)\n- Dimensions: 27 \u00d7 21.6 \u00d7 18.8 km\n- Surface area: 1,548 km\u00b2\n- Mass: 10.7 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2075 kg\n- Orbital period: 7.66 hours\n- Distance from Mars: 9,377 km\n\n2. Deimos:\n- Diameter: 12.6 km (7.8 mi)\n- Dimensions: 10 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 16 km\n- Surface area: 483 km\u00b2\n- Mass: 1.5 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u2075 kg\n- Orbital period: 30.31 hours\n- Distance from Mars: 23,460 km\n\nSome interesting facts about Mars's moons:\n- Both moons are tidally locked to Mars\n- From Mars's surface near its equator, Phobos appears about one-third the size of how our Moon appears from Earth\n- Deimos looks more like a bright star from Mars's surface\n- The moons are too small to cause total solar eclipses on Mars\n- Phobos experiences total lunar eclipses almost every night\n- Both moons were discovered by American astronomer Asaph Hall in August 1877\n- They are named after the Greek mythological twins Phobos (fear/panic) and Deimos (terror/dread)\n\nOrigin theory:\nScientists believe these moons may have formed from a massive collision between Mars and a protoplanet (about one-third Mars's mass). This impact created a ring around Mars, with the inner part forming a large moon. Through gravitational interactions, this process led to the formation of Phobos and Deimos. The original large moon eventually crashed into Mars, but Phobos and Deimos remained in orbit.\n\nFuture of Phobos:\nDue to tidal forces, Phobos is slowly moving closer to Mars. Eventually (in about 100 million years), when it reaches the Roche",
