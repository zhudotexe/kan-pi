In the early 1980s, it was about seven years,[160]:\u200a33[161] rising to 9.4 years in 1995[160]:\u200a33 and about 15 years in 2021.[*citation needed*] Some cats have been reported as surviving into their 30s,[162] with the oldest known cat, Creme Puff, dying at a verified age of 38.[163]\n\n\nNeutering increases life expectancy: one study found castrated male cats live twice as long as intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females.[160]:\u200a35 Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.[164]\n\n\n\n### Disease\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of feline diseases\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCats are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they are ready to leave their mother.[156] They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as seven weeks to limit unwanted reproduction.[157] This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed before puberty, at about three to six months.[158] In the United States, about 80% of household cats are neutered.[159]\n\n\n\n## Lifespan and health\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Cat health and Aging in cats\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** Example: \"Me-wow!

Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species.\n\n\nAs of 2017,[update] the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9\u00a0million pet cats as of 2020.[update] As of 2021,[update] there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and naming\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n155. **^** Nutter, F.

Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have pre-adapted them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play, and high intelligence. Captive *Leopardus* cats may also display affectionate behavior toward humans but were not domesticated.[40] House cats often mate with feral cats.[41] Hybridisation between domestic and other Felinae species is also possible, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat in Scotland.[42][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSmall domesticated carnivorous mammal\n\nThis article is about the species commonly kept as a pet.

Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders.[46]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Cat anatomy\n\n### Size\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Diagram of the general anatomy of a male domestic cat\nThe domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.[47] It averages about 46\u00a0cm (18\u00a0in) in head-to-body length and 23\u201325\u00a0cm (9\u201310\u00a0in) in height, with about 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) long tails.

They had one to six kittens per litter, with an average of three kittens. They produced a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year. Of 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents.[155]\nThe first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age. Queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5\u201310 months, and males at 5\u20137 months. This varies depending on breed.[151] Kittens reach puberty at the age of 9\u201310 months.[148]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite this colonial organization, cats do not have a social survival strategy or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.[96]\n\n\nLife in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. Ethologically, a cat's human keeper functions as if a mother surrogate.[97] Adult cats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. Their high-pitched sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly difficult for humans to ignore.[98] Some pet cats are poorly socialized. In particular, older cats show aggressiveness toward newly arrived kittens, which include biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Landraces | * Aegean\n* Cyprus\n* Kellas\n* Sokoke\n* Van\n |\n| Diseases anddisorders | * Acne\n* Asthma\n* Calicivirus\n* Congenital sensorineural deafness\n* Feline corneal sequestrum\n* Flea\n* Coccidia\n* Heartworm\n* Hepatic lipidosis\n* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n* Immunodeficiency virus\n* Infectious peritonitis\n* Leukemia virus\n* Lower urinary tract disease\n* Panleukopenia\n* Giardiasis\n* Polydactyly\n* Rabies\n* Ringworm\n* Tritrichomonas foetus\n* Roundworm\n* Skin disorders\n* Tick\n* Toxoplasmosis\n* Viral rhinotracheitis\n |\n| Cats by country | * Australia\n* Canada\n* Japan\n* New Zealand\n* United Kingdom\n* United States\n |\n| Related | * List of individual cats\n* List of longest-living cats\n* Cats in folklore\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nExtant Carnivora species\n |\n| --- |\n| * Kingdom: Animalia\n* Phylum: Chordata\n* Class: Mammalia\n* Infraclass: Eutheria\n* Superorder: Laurasiatheria\n |\n| \n\n| Feliformia (\"cat-like\" carnivorans)\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world.[46] It is adaptable and now present on all continents except Antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands, even on the isolated Kerguelen Islands.[169][170] Due to its ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat, it is among the world's most invasive species.[171] It lives on small islands with no human inhabitants.[172] Feral cats can live in forests, grasslands, tundra, coastal areas, agricultural land, scrublands, urban areas, and wetlands.[173]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
