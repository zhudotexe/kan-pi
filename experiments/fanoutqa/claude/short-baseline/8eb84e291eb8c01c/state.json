The College of Philadelphia, which became Penn, College of New Jersey, which became Princeton University, and King's College, which later became Columbia College and ultimately Columbia University, all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century with Penn alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the Intercollegiate Commission at the invitation of John J. McCook, a Union Army officer during the American Civil War and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"Presidents of Penn Alumni\". *www.archives.upenn.edu*.

The ideas and intellectual inspiration for the academic institution stem from 1749, with a pamphlet published by Benjamin Franklin (1705/1706\u20131790). When Franklin's institution was established, it inhabited a schoolhouse built on November 14, 1740, for another school, which never came to practical fruition.[2] Penn archivist Mark Frazier Lloyd noted, \"In 1899, UPenn's Trustees adopted a resolution that established 1740 as the founding date, but good cases may be made for 1749, when Franklin first convened the Trustees, or 1751, when the first classes were taught at the affiliated secondary school for boys, Academy of Philadelphia, or 1755, when Penn obtained its collegiate charter to add a post-secondary institution, the College of Philadelphia.\"[3] Princeton's library presents another diplomatically-phrased view.[4]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1750s, roughly 40 percent of Penn students needed lodging since they came from areas in the U.S. that were too far to commute, or were international students.[65] Before the completion of the construction of the first dormitory in 1765, out of town students were typically placed with guardians in the homes of faculty or in suitable boarding houses, such as the one run by widow Rachel Marks Graydon, mother of Penn College Class of 1775 student Alexander Graydon.[66][67]\n\n\nIn 1765, the campus was expanded by opening of the newly completed dormitory run by Benjamin Franklin's collaborator on the study of electricity using electrostatic machines and related technology and Penn professor and chief master Ebenezer Kinnersley.[note 9] Kinnersley was designated steward of the students in the dormitory and he and his wife were given disciplinary powers over the students and supervised the cleanliness of the students with respect to personal hygiene and washing of the students' dirty clothing.[68][69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** \"Histories of Early Penn Fraternities: Earliest Account of Penn Fraternities\".

Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the University of Pennsylvania. The college was to become influential in guiding the founding documents of the United States: in the Continental Congress, for example, over one-third of the college-affiliated men who contributed to the Declaration of Independence between September 4, 1774, and July 4, 1776, were affiliated with the college.[72]\n\n\nIn 1754, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the Albany Congress. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the Board of Trade in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad Plan of Union for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGovernors and presidents of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Presidents(1777\u20131790) | * Wharton\n* Bryan\n* Reed\n* Moore\n* Dickinson\n* Franklin\n* Mifflin\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Governors(since 1790) | * Mifflin\n* McKean\n* Snyder\n* Findlay\n* Hiester\n* Shulze\n* G.

Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the Parliament of Great Britain repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired as the first U.S. ambassador to France and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco\u2013American relations.

In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman; in June 1749, he became a justice of the peace for Philadelphia; and in 1751, he was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly. On August 10, 1753, he was appointed deputy postmaster-general of British North America. His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system, with mail sent out every week.[20]\n\n\nIn 1751, Franklin and Thomas Bond obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital. Pennsylvania Hospital was the first hospital in the colonies.[64] In 1752, Franklin organized the Philadelphia Contributionship, the Colonies' first homeowner's insurance company.[65][66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* American Philosophical Society\n* Library Company of Philadelphia\n* Pennsylvania Hospital\n* Academy and College of Philadelphia\n\t+ University of Pennsylvania\n* Philadelphia Contributionship\n* Union Fire Company\n* Early American currency\n* Continental Currency dollar coin\n* Fugio cent\n* United States Postal Service\n* Street lighting\n* President, Pennsylvania Abolition Society\n* Master, Les Neuf S\u0153urs\n* Gravesite\n |\n| Writings | * The Papers of Benjamin Franklin\n* Founders Online\n* Silence Dogood letters (1722)\n* *A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain* (1725)\n* The Busy-Body columns (1729)\n* *The Pennsylvania Gazette* (1729\u20131790)\n* Early American publishers and printers\n* *Poor Richard's Almanack* (1732\u20131758)\n* The Drinker's Dictionary (1737)\n* \"Advice to a Friend on Choosing a Mistress\" (1745)\n* \"The Speech of Polly Baker\" (1747)\n* *Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind, Peopling of Countries, etc.* (1751)\n* *Experiments and Observations on Electricity* (1751)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe was promoted to deputy postmaster-general for the British colonies on August 10, 1753,[6] having been Philadelphia postmaster for many years, and this enabled him to set up the first national communications network. He was active in community affairs and colonial and state politics, as well as national and international affairs. From 1785 to 1788, he served as governor of Pennsylvania. At some points in his life, he owned slaves and ran \"for sale\" ads for slaves in his newspaper, but by the late 1750s, he began arguing against slavery, became an active abolitionist, and promoted education and the integration of African Americans into U.S. society.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs he matured, Franklin began to concern himself more with public affairs. In 1743, he first devised a scheme for the Academy, Charity School, and College of Philadelphia. However, the person he had in mind to run the academy, Rev. Richard Peters, refused and Franklin put his ideas away until 1749 when he printed his own pamphlet, *Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania.*[59]:\u200a30 He was appointed president of the Academy on November 13, 1749; the academy and the charity school opened in 1751.[60]\n\n\nIn 1743, he founded the American Philosophical Society to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories. He began the electrical research that, along with other scientific inquiries, would occupy him for the rest of his life, in between bouts of politics and moneymaking.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBetween 1750 and 1753, the \"educational triumvirate\"[67] of Franklin, Samuel Johnson of Stratford, Connecticut, and schoolteacher William Smith built on Franklin's initial scheme and created what Bishop James Madison, president of the College of William & Mary, called a \"new-model\"[68] plan or style of American college. Franklin solicited, printed in 1752, and promoted an American textbook of moral philosophy by Samuel Johnson, titled *Elementa Philosophica*,[69] to be taught in the new colleges. In June 1753, Johnson, Franklin, and Smith met in Stratford.[70] They decided the new-model college would focus on the professions, with classes taught in English instead of Latin, have subject matter experts as professors instead of one tutor leading a class for four years, and there would be no religious test for admission.[71] Johnson went on to found King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City in 1754, while Franklin hired Smith as provost of the College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1755. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt this time, many members of the Pennsylvania Assembly were feuding with William Penn's heirs, who controlled the colony as proprietors. After his return to the colony, Franklin led the \"anti-proprietary party\" in the struggle against the Penn family and was elected Speaker of the Pennsylvania House in May 1764. His call for a change from proprietary to royal government was a rare political miscalculation, however: Pennsylvanians worried that such a move would endanger their political and religious freedoms. Because of these fears and because of political attacks on his character, Franklin lost his seat in the October 1764 Assembly elections. The anti-proprietary party dispatched him to England again to continue the struggle against the Penn family proprietorship. During this trip, events drastically changed the nature of his mission.[87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** Kyriakodis, Harry (2011). \"16.
