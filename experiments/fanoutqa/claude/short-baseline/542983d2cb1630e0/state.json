Its membership, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869, consists of the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom constitute a quorum.[1][2] Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the Constitution grants plenary power to the president of the United States to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the United States Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court; justices have life tenure.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Associate justices:** Clarence Thomas\n* Samuel Alito\n* Sonia Sotomayor\n* Elena Kagan\n* Neil Gorsuch\n* Brett Kavanaugh\n* Amy Coney Barrett\n* Ketanji Brown Jackson\n |\n| Retired justices | * Anthony Kennedy\n* David Souter\n* Stephen Breyer\n |\n| History | * Jay Court (1789\u20131795)\n* Rutledge Court (1795)\n* Ellsworth Court (1796\u20131800)\n* Marshall Court (1801\u20131835)\n* Taney Court (1836\u20131864)\n* Chase Court (1864\u20131873)\n* Waite Court (1874\u20131888)\n* Fuller Court (1888\u20131910)\n* White Court (1910\u20131921)\n* Taft Court (1921\u20131930)\n* Hughes Court (1930\u20131941)\n* Stone Court (1941\u20131946)\n* Vinson Court (1946\u20131953)\n* Warren Court (1953\u20131969)\n* Burger Court (1969\u20131986)\n* Rehnquist Court (1986\u20132005)\n* Roberts Court (2005\u2013present)\n |\n| Lists of justicesand nominees | * Chief justices\n* Associate justices\n* All justices\n\t+ court\n\t+ education\n\t+ seat\n\t+ time in office\n* All nominations\n\t+ unsuccessful\n* Justices who served in Congress\n* Burial places of justices\n |\n| Statutes affectingcourt size | * Judiciary Act of 1789\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, 116 people have served on the Court. The length of service on the Court for the 107 non-incumbent justices ranges from William O. Douglas's 36\u00a0years, 209\u00a0days to John Rutledge's 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days as associate justice and, separated by a period of years off the Court, his 138\u00a0days as chief justice. As of June 13, 2024, the length of service for the nine incumbent justices ranges from Clarence Thomas's 32\u00a0years, 234\u00a0days to Ketanji Brown Jackson's 1\u00a0year, 349\u00a0days. Five individuals, who were confirmed for associate justice, were later appointed chief justice separately: John Rutledge,[a] Edward Douglass White,[b] Charles Evans Hughes,[a] Harlan F. Stone[b] and William Rehnquist.[b] While listed twice, each of them has been assigned only one index number. The justices of the Supreme Court are:[9][10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Although Lewis Powell and William H. Rehnquist were both sworn into office as associate justice on the same day, Powell by law took precedence as the more senior associate justice, his judicial commission bearing the date Dec.\u00a09, 1971; Rehnquist's commission bore the date of Dec.\u00a016, 1971.\n15. **^** Acted as chief justice under 62 Stat. 869, September 3\u201329, 2005.\n\n## Timeline of justices[edit]\n\n\nThis graphical timeline depicts the progression of the justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.[9][10] Information regarding each justice's predecessors, successors, and fellow justices, as well as their tenure on the court, can be gleaned (and comparisons between justices drawn) from it. There are no formal names or numbers for the individual seats of the associate justices, which are listed in the table below simply by number. Additionally, the progression of U.S. presidents is shown at the top of the timeline to give a more detailed historical context.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Served on the Supreme Court twice: first as associate justice and then, after a period of years off the Court, as chief justice.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Elevated from associate justice to chief justice while serving on the Supreme Court.

This rule of precedences exists to this day, codified at Title 28, U.S. Code \u00a7\u00a04. The commissions of the first four associate justices bear the following dates: Rutledge, Sept.\u00a026, 1789; Cushing, Sept.\u00a027; Wilson, Sept.\u00a029; and Blair, Sept.\u00a030.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** Recess appointment.

Beginning in the early 20th century, many justices who left the Court voluntarily did so by retiring from the Court without leaving the federal judiciary altogether. A retired justice, according to the United States Code, is no longer a member of the Supreme Court, but remains eligible to serve by designation as a judge of a U.S. Court of Appeals or District Court, and many retired justices have served in these capacities. Historically, the average length of service on the Court has been less than 15 years. However, since 1970 the average length of service has increased to about 26 years.[8]\n\n\n\n## List of justices[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Justice\n | State[c] | Position\n | Succeeded\n | Date confirmed(Vote)\n | Tenure\n | Tenure length[d] | Nominated by\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | John Jay(1745\u20131829) | NY | ChiefJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | October 19, 1789\u2013June 29, 1795(Resigned) | 5\u00a0years, 253\u00a0days\n | George Washington |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | John Rutledge(1739\u20131800) | SC | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 15, 1790[e]\u2013March 5, 1791(Resigned) | 1\u00a0year, 18\u00a0days\n |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | William Cushing(1732\u20131810) | MA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | February 2, 1790[e]\u2013September 13, 1810(Died) | 20\u00a0years, 223\u00a0days\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | James Wilson(1742\u20131798) | PA | AssociateJustice | *Inaugural* | September 26, 1789(Acclamation)\n | October 5, 1789[e]\u2013August 21, 1798(Died) | 8\u00a0years, 320\u00a0days\n |\n| 5\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Chief Justice John Roberts\n- Harvard College (BA in History, 1976)\n\n2. Associate Justice Clarence Thomas\n- College of the Holy Cross (BA in English Literature, 1971)\n\n3. Associate Justice Samuel Alito\n- Princeton University (BA in Public Policy, 1972)\n\n4. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor\n- Princeton University (BA summa cum laude in History, 1976)\n\n5. Associate Justice Elena Kagan\n- Princeton University (BA in History, 1981)\n\n6. Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch\n- Columbia University (BA in Political Science, 1988)\n\n7. Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh\n- Yale University (BA in History, 1987)\n\n8. Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett\n- Notre Dame University (BA in English Literature, 1994)\n\n9. Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\n- Harvard University (BA in Government, 1992)\n\nThese nine justices make up the current Supreme Court, with John Roberts serving as Chief Justice and the others serving as Associate Justices. It's interesting to note that three justices attended Princeton University for their undergraduate studies, and two attended Harvard College. Their undergraduate majors varied, with several studying history, while others focused on English literature, political science, government, and public policy.",
