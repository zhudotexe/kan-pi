While I can help search for Olympic medal counts and specific country statistics, I don't have a direct tool to analyze and compare medal counts across all countries simultaneously.\n\nI can help search for information about specific countries' Olympic performances if you'd like to focus on particular nations, or we could look up the overall Olympic medal table. Would you like me to search for either of those?\n\nTo provide accurate information about medal counts and sport-specific achievements, we would need:\n1. Access to a comprehensive Olympic database\n2. Tools to analyze and sort medal counts\n3. Ability to break down medals by sport for each country\n\nWould you like me to search for information about specific countries or a particular Olympic Games instead?",
