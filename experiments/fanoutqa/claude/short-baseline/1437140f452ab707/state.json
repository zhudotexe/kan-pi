The current mayor of Philadelphia is Jim Kenney, whose term as mayor expires in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe restriction was lifted in the 1940s allowing Bernard Samuel to run for re-election. In 1951, the city's Home Rule Charter established a two-term limit for mayors.[4] The term limit is consecutive, not lifetime. \n\n\nThe mayorship of Philadelphia has been held by Democrats since 1952. The only Republican who has come close to winning the position was Sam Katz, who in 1999 came within half a percentage point of being the first Republican mayor of Philadelphia elected in over 45 years.\n\n\n\n## List of Mayors[edit]\n\n\nParties\n\u00a0\u00a0Democratic (16) \n\u00a0\u00a0Democratic-Republican (4) \n\u00a0\u00a0Federalist (6) \n\u00a0\u00a0Keystone (1) \n\u00a0\u00a0National Republican (2) \n\u00a0\u00a0Republican (19) \n\u00a0\u00a0Whig (5) \n\n\n\n### Colonial mayors elected by the Common Council[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first mayor of Philadelphia was Humphrey Morrey, who was appointed to the position by William Penn, the founder of the city and the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, which became the state of Pennsylvania following the American Revolutionary War. Penn subsequently appointed Edward Shippen under the city charter of 1701. The Philadelphia City Council then elected Shippen to a second term. Subsequent mayors, who held office for one year, were elected by the Philadelphia City Council. The initial mayors of Philadelphia were not compensated and candidates sometimes objected strongly to being selected to the position, sometimes choosing even to pay a fine rather than serve in the position.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMayors of Philadelphia (chronologically)\n |\n| --- |\n| Colonial era(1691\u20131776) | * Morrey\n* Shippen (I)\n* Morris (I)\n* G.

When he could not be located after three days, a new election had to be arranged, and Attwood was re-elected to a second term.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1826, Council could elect any citizen of Philadelphia to the mayoralty. From 1839, mayors were elected by popular vote. If no candidate won a majority of the popular vote, then the joint Councils (Select and Common) would decide between the two leading candidates. John Swift was the first mayor to be elected directly by the people in the 1840 election.\n\n\nThe term of office was extended to two years in 1854, three years in 1861, and four years in 1885. Further, The Act of 1885 prohibited mayors from succeeding themselves.[4]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Resigned to become the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n13. **^** Jones was a Democrat elected with the support of the Know Nothing party.\n14. **^** In 1854, the entire county was consolidated into the city, and the mayoral term was extended to two years.\n15. **^** Conrad was a Whig elected with the Know Nothings' support.\n16. **^** In 1861, the mayoral term was extended to three years.\n17. **^** In 1887, the mayoral term was extended to four years.

In 1706, Alderman Thomas Story was similarly fined for refusing office. In 1745, Alderman Abraham Taylor was fined thirty pounds for refusing the mayoralty; Council then elected Joseph Turner, who also refused and was likewise fined.[2] Others who refused election included Richard Hill (1717), Isaac Norris (1722), John Mifflin, and Alexander Stedman, while William Coxe pleaded illness (1758), Samuel Mifflin (1761), William Coxe and Daniel Benezet (1762), and John Barclay and George Roberts (1792). Robert Wharton declined in 1800 and 1811, amid serving for 14 one-year terms, making him the most-often-elected (16 times, including refusals) and longest-serving (14 years) mayor of Philadelphia.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCity of Philadelphia\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * History\n\t+ Timeline\n* Accent\n* Architecture\n* Bibliography\n* Companies\n* Cuisine\n* Culture\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Media\n* Music\n* Notable people\n* Riots\n* Sites of interest\n\t+ Historic Landmarks\n* Skyscrapers\n* Transportation\n |\n| Government | * City Hall\n* Mayor\n* City Council\n* District Attorney\n* Airport\n* Fire Department\n* Free Library\n* Police Department\n* Public Health\n\t+ COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant 2020-2021\n* School district\n* **Federal:** U.S. Mint\n* U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of PA\n* U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit\n |\n| Neighborhoods | * Center City\n* North Philadelphia\n\t+ Lower North\n\t+ Upper North\n\t+ Olney-Oak Lane\n* Northeast Philadelphia\n\t+ River Wards\n* Northwest Philadelphia\n* South Philadelphia\n* Southwest Philadelphia\n* West Philadelphia\n |\n| Museums | * Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University\n* African American Museum in Philadelphia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| No. | Mayor\n | Term start\n | Term end\n | Mayorship\n | Term[5] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Humphrey Morrey | May 20, 1691 | October 25, 1701 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 2 | Edward Shippen I | October 25, 1701 | October 24, 1702 | 2 | 2\n |\n| October 24, 1702 | October 5, 1703 | 3\n |\n| 3 | Anthony Morris I | October 5, 1703 | October 3, 1704 | 3 | 4\n |\n| 4 | Griffith Jones | October 3, 1704 | October 2, 1705 | 4 | 5\n |\n| 5 | Joseph Willcox | October 2, 1705 | October 1, 1706 | 5 | 6\n |\n| 6 | Nathan Stanbury | October 1, 1706 | October 7, 1707 | 6 | 7\n |\n| 7 | Thomas Masters | October 7, 1707 | October 5, 1708 | 7 | 8\n |\n| October 5, 1708 | October 4, 1709 | 9\n |\n| 8 | Richard Hill | October 4, 1709 | October 3, 1710 | 8 | 10\n |\n| 9 | William Carter | October 3, 1710 | October 2, 1711 | 9 | 11\n |\n| 10 | Samuel Preston | October 2, 1711 | October 7, 1712 | 10 | 12\n |\n| 11 | Jonathan Dickinson | October 7, 1712 | October 6, 1713 | 11 | 13\n |\n| 12 | George Roch | October 6, 1713 | October 5, 1714 | 12 | 14\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 59 |  | Benjamin W.

The state legislature established a fiscal oversight board to monitor the City of Philadelphia's fiscal issues. During his career as mayor, Rendell cut a $250 million deficit, balanced Philadelphia's budget and oversaw five consecutive years of budget surpluses, reduced business and wage taxes for four consecutive years, implemented new revenue-generating initiatives, and dramatically improved services to Philadelphia neighborhoods. He was given the nickname \"Philadelphia's Renaissance or Revival\" because of how well he did with the budget.[13] He also appointed Philadelphia's first ever Latino deputy mayors, Benjamin Ramos and Manuel Ortiz. Rendell's cost-cutting policies brought him strong opposition from labor unions; however, he was re-elected in 1995, defeating Republican Joe Rocks with 80% of the vote.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nElected Mayor of Philadelphia in 1991, he inherited a $250 million deficit and the lowest credit rating of any major city in the country. As mayor, he balanced Philadelphia's budget and generated a budget surplus while cutting business and wage taxes and dramatically improving services to Philadelphia neighborhoods. *The New York Times* stated that Philadelphia under Rendell \"has made one of the most stunning turnarounds in recent urban history.\"[2] Nicknamed \"America's Mayor\" by Al Gore,[3] Rendell served as Chairman of the Democratic National Committee during the 2000 presidential election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs district attorney, Rendell reportedly[7] had a mean temper while doing his job. Once, he yelled in the governor's face for releasing a certain prisoner. It has been said that Rendell would even punch walls or throw furniture when he became upset. In 1980, Rendell received 28 delegate votes for Vice President[8] at the Democratic National Convention, although he was not a candidate. He served two terms as DA before leaving in 1986 to run for Governor of Pennsylvania.[9] He was defeated in the Democratic gubernatorial primary by Bob Casey, Sr.[10]\n\n\nIn 1982, during his second term, Rendell presided over the controversial prosecution of Mumia Abu-Jamal, resulting in a death sentence that was overturned in 2011. The 1985 bombing of the Black religious community MOVE by the Philadelphia police also occurred during Rendell's tenure and killed 6 adults plus 5 children and caused a fire that left hundreds of neighbors homeless.[11]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGovernors and presidents of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Presidents(1777\u20131790) | * Wharton\n* Bryan\n* Reed\n* Moore\n* Dickinson\n* Franklin\n* Mifflin\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Governors(since 1790) | * Mifflin\n* McKean\n* Snyder\n* Findlay\n* Hiester\n* Shulze\n* G.

His parents were Jewish, and all four of his grandparents were immigrants from Russia.[4] He attended Riverdale Country School before the University of Pennsylvania, where he joined the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity[5] in 1962 and earned a BA degree in 1965. In 1968, he earned a JD at Villanova University School of Law. He served as a 2nd Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1968 to 1974.\n\n\n\n## District attorney[edit]\n\n\nRendell was elected district attorney of Philadelphia in 1977, becoming the youngest[6] DA in history, after he defeated the incumbent Democratic district attorney, Emmett Fitzpatrick, in the primary election. Rendell ran a campaign that emphasized that he was new to politics and so was not tainted by its corruption.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rendell as mayor\nIn 1987, Rendell ran for the Democratic nomination against the incumbent mayor, Wilson Goode and lost. Rendell ran successfully four years later, in 1991. His opponent was to be Democrat-turned-Republican former Philadelphia Mayor, Frank Rizzo. Rizzo, however, died in the summer of 1991; in November 1991, Rendell won by more than a 2-1 margin against Joseph M. Egan, Jr., Rizzo's replacement on the Republican ticket.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBorn in New York City to a Jewish family from Russia, Rendell moved to Philadelphia for college, completing his B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania and J.D. from Villanova University School of Law. He was elected District Attorney of Philadelphia for two terms from 1978 to 1986. He developed a reputation for being tough on crime,[1] fueling a run for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986, which Rendell lost in the primary.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2002, Rendell was elected Governor of Pennsylvania. He was a member of the Democratic Governors Association Executive Committee and served as the Chairman of the National Governors Association. He was reelected in a landslide in 2006. He left office in 2011 due to term limits, and released a book, *A Nation of Wusses: How America's Leaders Lost the Guts to Make Us Great* the following year. A Philadelphia Eagles fan, Rendell is also a football analyst on NBC Sports Philadelphia's Eagles Postgame Live, hosted by Michael Barkann.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe would lose similar friendly wagers with the Governor of New York, David Paterson, in supporting the Philadelphia Phillies on their quest to defend their 2008 championship against the New York Yankees in 2009 and again with Governor of Illinois, Pat Quinn, in supporting the Philadelphia Flyers in the quest to win the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks. In 2006, he won a bet with the Governor of Washington, Christine Gregoire in supporting the Pittsburgh Steelers in their quest to win Super Bowl XL over the Seattle Seahawks 21\u201310.[70]\n\n\nAs a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Rendell frequently supports the Penn basketball team and can be seen at games at the Palestra. He has also assisted in finding new corporate sponsorship for Philadelphia International Championship, a 21-year-old Philadelphia bicycle race.[71]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n***as Former Governor*** |  **Order of precedence of the United States**  | Succeeded\u00a0byTom Corbett\n***as Former Governor*** |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCabinet of Governor Ed Rendell (2003\u20132011)\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlso a Philadelphia Phillies fan, he spoke at a memorial service for Hall of Fame announcer Harry Kalas at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia on April 18, 2009.[72]\n\n\nOn December 26, 2010, the Philadelphia Eagles home game against the visiting Minnesota Vikings was postponed before any snow had fallen due to an impending blizzard in Philadelphia. Rendell said of the postponement, \"My biggest beef is that this is part of what's happened in this country. We've become a nation of wusses. The Chinese are kicking our butt in everything. If this was in China do you think the Chinese would have called off the game? People would have been marching down to the stadium, they would have walked and they would have been doing calculus on the way down.\"[73] As a result, the grounds crew piled snow on his reserved seat the following game, and topped it with a sign that said \"This seat reserved for non-wusses\".[74]\n\n\n\n## Gubernatorial electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the November 2002 gubernatorial election, he defeated Republican State Attorney General Mike Fisher, garnering 53 percent of the vote to Fisher's 44 percent.[19] Rendell won not only Philadelphia County, which is heavily Democratic, but also traditionally Republican suburbs of Philadelphia,[20] largely due to his popularity as mayor of Philadelphia. These traditionally Republican voters who backed Rendell were called *Rendellicans* in other parts of the state and were a key part of the success of his campaign.[21]\n\n\nIn a 2002 PoliticsPA feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the \"Most Likely to Succeed.\"[22] His campaign website was described as having \"cutting edge in design for a political site.\"[23]\n\n\n\n## Governor of Pennsylvania (2003\u20132011)[edit]\n\n\n### First term[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhen he announced his intent to run for the Democratic Nomination for Governor of Pennsylvania, he did so without the backing of the state party. The Pennsylvania Democratic Party threw their support behind Bob Casey Jr., son of recently deceased former Governor Bob Casey Sr., whom the party saw as a more electable candidate against the liberal Rendell. In a bitter primary, Rendell won the nomination by winning only 10 out of 67 counties: Philadelphia; its suburbs: Bucks, Chester, Montgomery, and Delaware; its exurbs: Berks, Lancaster, Lehigh, and Northampton; and Centre County, the home of Penn State University.[18]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGovernor of Pennsylvania from 2003 to 2011\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
