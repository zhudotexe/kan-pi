He followed this up with a successful Week 4 performance rushing for 97 yards on 17 carries (5.7 avg.).

He and Cadillac Williams shared carries at running back, while he had 1,008 yards and 13 touchdowns in 2002, 446 yards and five touchdowns in 2003, and 913 yards and eight touchdowns in 2004.

He twice earned second-team All-Southeastern Conference honors in 2002 and 2004.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown was drafted second overall by the Miami Dolphins in the 2005 NFL Draft. Brown started at running back for the Dolphins for the first four weeks of the season while Ricky Williams served a suspension, and shared carries with him when he returned in week five. Brown became the feature back in 2006 due to Williams' full year suspension. Brown sat out three games due to a broken hand suffered on Thanksgiving Day in a game against the Detroit Lions, returning in week 16. He played in the first seven games of the 2007 season before suffering a knee injury which knocked him out for the remainder of the season. Williams started over Brown in the first two games of the 2008 season, but shared carries with him after week two.

In the final game of the season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Benson had 111 yards on 25 carries. In the twelve games he was active during the 2008 season, Benson had 932 yards from scrimmage: 747 rushing and 185 receiving.\n\n\nA free agent after the 2008 season, Benson visited with the Houston Texans before signing a two-year, $7-million contract with the Bengals on March 3, 2009.\n\n\nEntering week 8 of the 2009 season, Benson had 164 carries for an NFL best 720 yards (4.4 per carry average). In week 5, he became the first 100-yard rusher against the Baltimore Ravens in 40 games, when he rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown.[22] In week 7, Benson faced his former team, the Chicago Bears, and rushed for a career-high 189 yards and a touchdown.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe team temporarily made Thomas Jones their featured running back for the beginning of the 2005 season.[10] Jones' performance impressed the Bears' coaching staff, and earned him the top spot on the team's depth-chart for the next two seasons. Benson occasionally received playtime, and he rushed for eighty yards on sixteen carries against the New Orleans Saints during his best game. However, shortly afterwards, he suffered a medial collateral ligament sprain and missed most of the remaining season.[13]\n\n\nAfter the 2005 the Bears considered making Benson the team's starting running back after Jones was unhappy with his current contract status. The team's plans went astray when Benson injured his shoulder after colliding with Brian Urlacher during a routine scrimmage. Although the injury was not serious, it placed Benson on the sidelines for a majority of the preseason.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDoak Walker Award winners\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1990: Lewis\n* 1991: Cobb\n* 1992: Hearst\n* 1993: Morris\n* 1994: Salaam\n* 1995: George\n* 1996: Hanspard\n* 1997: R.

As a senior in 2004, he received the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top running back and was recognized as a consensus All-American. He finished his college career with 5,540 rushing yards to rank tenth all time in NCAA Division I-A history, and second only to Ricky Williams in Longhorns team history.\n\n\nHe has often been compared to Williams, due to their similarities in running style, college choice, legal complications,[2][3] and superficial appearance (roughly the same size and build coming out of college, and both had dreadlocks early in their careers), and the fact that they had both been minor league baseball players.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough Benson fully recovered from his injury, head coach Lovie Smith selected Jones as the Bears' starter. Benson scored his first two touchdowns during week five of the 2006 season, against the Buffalo Bills. In a game against the New England Patriots during week twelve of the season, Benson collided with linebacker Junior Seau, causing Seau to fall down and fracture his forearm.\n\n\nDays later, Benson challenged Smith's coaching by remarking, \"the NFL is not like high school or college, but the best players don't always get on the field.\"[14] The following week, Benson out rushed Jones and scored a vital touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings on 4th down. However, when asked about it after the game, he said he didn't know that it was 4th down. He began to receive more carries as the weeks progressed, and managed to rush for over 100 yards against the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBenson went on to record his first 1,000-yard rushing season and he set a Bengals franchise record with six games with over 100 rushing yards. He finished the season as the NFL's 8th leading rusher with 1,251 yards, despite playing only 13 games. He then set a Bengals postseason record with 169 rushing yards in their 24–14 loss to the New York Jets.\n\n\nThe Bengals declined to resign Benson in 2012. Coach Marvin Lewis later recounted how he explained the decision to Benson: \"'Ced, it's not that I didn't think you could do that on the football field, it was the other [stuff] that I got tired of.

In the final game of the season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Benson had 111 yards on 25 carries. In the twelve games he was active during the 2008 season, Benson had 932 yards from scrimmage: 747 rushing and 185 receiving.\n\n\nA free agent after the 2008 season, Benson visited with the Houston Texans before signing a two-year, $7-million contract with the Bengals on March 3, 2009.\n\n\nEntering week 8 of the 2009 season, Benson had 164 carries for an NFL best 720 yards (4.4 per carry average). In week 5, he became the first 100-yard rusher against the Baltimore Ravens in 40 games, when he rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown.[22] In week 7, Benson faced his former team, the Chicago Bears, and rushed for a career-high 189 yards and a touchdown.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe team temporarily made Thomas Jones their featured running back for the beginning of the 2005 season.[10] Jones' performance impressed the Bears' coaching staff, and earned him the top spot on the team's depth-chart for the next two seasons. Benson occasionally received playtime, and he rushed for eighty yards on sixteen carries against the New Orleans Saints during his best game. However, shortly afterwards, he suffered a medial collateral ligament sprain and missed most of the remaining season.[13]\n\n\nAfter the 2005 the Bears considered making Benson the team's starting running back after Jones was unhappy with his current contract status. The team's plans went astray when Benson injured his shoulder after colliding with Brian Urlacher during a routine scrimmage. Although the injury was not serious, it placed Benson on the sidelines for a majority of the preseason.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDoak Walker Award winners\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1990: Lewis\n* 1991: Cobb\n* 1992: Hearst\n* 1993: Morris\n* 1994: Salaam\n* 1995: George\n* 1996: Hanspard\n* 1997: R.

As a senior in 2004, he received the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top running back and was recognized as a consensus All-American. He finished his college career with 5,540 rushing yards to rank tenth all time in NCAA Division I-A history, and second only to Ricky Williams in Longhorns team history.\n\n\nHe has often been compared to Williams, due to their similarities in running style, college choice, legal complications,[2][3] and superficial appearance (roughly the same size and build coming out of college, and both had dreadlocks early in their careers), and the fact that they had both been minor league baseball players.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough Benson fully recovered from his injury, head coach Lovie Smith selected Jones as the Bears' starter. Benson scored his first two touchdowns during week five of the 2006 season, against the Buffalo Bills. In a game against the New England Patriots during week twelve of the season, Benson collided with linebacker Junior Seau, causing Seau to fall down and fracture his forearm.\n\n\nDays later, Benson challenged Smith's coaching by remarking, \"the NFL is not like high school or college, but the best players don't always get on the field.\"[14] The following week, Benson out rushed Jones and scored a vital touchdown against the Minnesota Vikings on 4th down. However, when asked about it after the game, he said he didn't know that it was 4th down. He began to receive more carries as the weeks progressed, and managed to rush for over 100 yards against the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBenson went on to record his first 1,000-yard rushing season and he set a Bengals franchise record with six games with over 100 rushing yards. He finished the season as the NFL's 8th leading rusher with 1,251 yards, despite playing only 13 games. He then set a Bengals postseason record with 169 rushing yards in their 24–14 loss to the New York Jets.\n\n\nThe Bengals declined to resign Benson in 2012. Coach Marvin Lewis later recounted how he explained the decision to Benson: \"'Ced, it's not that I didn't think you could do that on the football field, it was the other [stuff] that I got tired of. When I would go to you and say we're going to rotate the backs [and Benson would take it poorly]. I don't need that anymore.'\"[24]\n\n\n\n### Green Bay Packers[edit]\n\n\nOn August 12, 2012, Benson signed with the Green Bay Packers.[25] The deal was reportedly a one-year contract worth $825,000.\n\n\nOn October 7, 2012, Benson suffered a Lisfranc injury to his foot and was later placed on injured reserve.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSmith named Benson as the Bears' starting running back after the team traded Jones to the New York Jets.
