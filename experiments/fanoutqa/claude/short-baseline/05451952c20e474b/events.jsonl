In May, Smithsonian Institution Secretary Samuel Langley successfully flew an unmanned steam-powered fixed-wing model aircraft. In mid-year, Chicago engineer and aviation authority Octave Chanute brought together several men who tested various types of gliders over the sand dunes along the shore of Lake Michigan. In August, Lilienthal was killed in the plunge of his glider.[28] These events lodged in the minds of the brothers, especially Lilienthal's death. The Wright brothers later cited his death as the point when their serious interest in flight research began.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFirst powered flight claims are made for Clément Ader, Gustave Whitehead, Richard Pearse, and Karl Jatho for their variously documented tests in years prior to and including 1903. Claims that the first true flight occurred after 1903 are made for Traian Vuia and Alberto Santos-Dumont. Supporters of the post-Wright pioneers argue that techniques used by the Wright brothers disqualify them as first to make successful airplane flights.[141] Those techniques were: A launch rail; skids instead of wheels; a headwind at takeoff; and a catapult after 1903. Supporters of the Wright brothers argue that proven, repeated, controlled, and sustained flights by the brothers entitle them to credit as inventors of the airplane, regardless of those techniques.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Died | May 30, 1912(1912-05-30) (aged 45)Dayton, Ohio, U.S. |\n| Cause of death | Typhoid fever[2] |\n| Education | 4 years high school |\n| Occupation | Editor, bicycle retailer / manufacturer, airplane inventor / manufacturer, pilot trainer |\n| Signature | ![Signature of Wilbur Wright](image) |\n|  |\n\n\nThe **Wright brothers**, **Orville Wright** (August 19, 1871 – January 30, 1948) and **Wilbur Wright** (April 16, 1867 – May 30, 1912), were American aviation pioneers generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful motor-operated airplane.[3][4][5] They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft with the *Wright Flyer* on December 17, 1903, four miles (6 km) south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, at what is now known as Kill Devil Hills. The brothers were also the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Wright brothers always presented a unified image to the public, sharing equally in the credit for their invention. Biographers note that Wilbur took the initiative in 1899–1900, writing of \"my\" machine and \"my\" plans before Orville became deeply involved when the first person singular became the plural \"we\" and \"our\". Author James Tobin asserts, \"it is impossible to imagine Orville, bright as he was, supplying the driving force that started their work and kept it going from the back room of a store in Ohio to conferences with capitalists, presidents, and kings. Will did that. He was the leader, from the beginning to the end.\"[32]\n\n\n\n### Ideas about control[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Library of Congress Prints & Photographs Online Catalog – Wright Brothers Negatives\n* Outer Banks of NC Wright Photographs: 1900–1911(Sourced from Library of Congress)\n* Video clips about the invention of the fixed-wing aircraft\n* The Pioneer Aviation Group Many pictures of early flying machines and a comprehensive chronology of flight attempts\n* Wilbur Wright photo gallery at Corbis (page one)\n* Orville Wright photo gallery at Corbis (page one)\n* Wright Brothers Collection digital images at Wright State University\n* *New Scientist* magazine, Scientific Firsts: Print of Wright Flyer in France 1907\n* Wilbur's world famous Model A Flyer \"France\" sits in a hall of honor on display in a Paris museum after Wilbur donated it to the French.

In May, Smithsonian Institution Secretary Samuel Langley successfully flew an unmanned steam-powered fixed-wing model aircraft. In mid-year, Chicago engineer and aviation authority Octave Chanute brought together several men who tested various types of gliders over the sand dunes along the shore of Lake Michigan. In August, Lilienthal was killed in the plunge of his glider.[28] These events lodged in the minds of the brothers, especially Lilienthal's death. The Wright brothers later cited his death as the point when their serious interest in flight research began.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFirst powered flight claims are made for Clément Ader, Gustave Whitehead, Richard Pearse, and Karl Jatho for their variously documented tests in years prior to and including 1903. Claims that the first true flight occurred after 1903 are made for Traian Vuia and Alberto Santos-Dumont. Supporters of the post-Wright pioneers argue that techniques used by the Wright brothers disqualify them as first to make successful airplane flights.[141] Those techniques were: A launch rail; skids instead of wheels; a headwind at takeoff; and a catapult after 1903. Supporters of the Wright brothers argue that proven, repeated, controlled, and sustained flights by the brothers entitle them to credit as inventors of the airplane, regardless of those techniques.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Died | May 30, 1912(1912-05-30) (aged 45)Dayton, Ohio, U.S. |\n| Cause of death | Typhoid fever[2] |\n| Education | 4 years high school |\n| Occupation | Editor, bicycle retailer / manufacturer, airplane inventor / manufacturer, pilot trainer |\n| Signature | ![Signature of Wilbur Wright](image) |\n|  |\n\n\nThe **Wright brothers**, **Orville Wright** (August 19, 1871 – January 30, 1948) and **Wilbur Wright** (April 16, 1867 – May 30, 1912), were American aviation pioneers generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful motor-operated airplane.[3][4][5] They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft with the *Wright Flyer* on December 17, 1903, four miles (6 km) south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, at what is now known as Kill Devil Hills. The brothers were also the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Wright brothers always presented a unified image to the public, sharing equally in the credit for their invention. Biographers note that Wilbur took the initiative in 1899–1900, writing of \"my\" machine and \"my\" plans before Orville became deeply involved when the first person singular became the plural \"we\" and \"our\". Author James Tobin asserts, \"it is impossible to imagine Orville, bright as he was, supplying the driving force that started their work and kept it going from the back room of a store in Ohio to conferences with capitalists, presidents, and kings. Will did that. He was the leader, from the beginning to the end.\"[32]\n\n\n\n### Ideas about control[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Library of Congress Prints & Photographs Online Catalog – Wright Brothers Negatives\n* Outer Banks of NC Wright Photographs: 1900–1911(Sourced from Library of Congress)\n* Video clips about the invention of the fixed-wing aircraft\n* The Pioneer Aviation Group Many pictures of early flying machines and a comprehensive chronology of flight attempts\n* Wilbur Wright photo gallery at Corbis (page one)\n* Orville Wright photo gallery at Corbis (page one)\n* Wright Brothers Collection digital images at Wright State University\n* *New Scientist* magazine, Scientific Firsts: Print of Wright Flyer in France 1907\n* Wilbur's world famous Model A Flyer \"France\" sits in a hall of honor on display in a Paris museum after Wilbur donated it to the French.
