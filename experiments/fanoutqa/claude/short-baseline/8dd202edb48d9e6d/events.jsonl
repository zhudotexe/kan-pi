During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Moscow**, Russia\n | * **Camp Thunder Cove**, *BIOT* (UK) **\\***\n* **Dhaka**, Bangladesh\n* **Islamabad**, Pakistan\n* **Kabul**, Afghanistan\n* **Kathmandu**, Nepal\n* **Malé**, Maldives\n* **New Delhi**, India\n* **Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte**, Sri Lanka\n* **Thimphu**, Bhutan\n | * **Bandar Seri Begawan**, Brunei\n* **Bangkok**, Thailand\n* **Dili**, East Timor\n* **Flying Fish Cove**, *Christmas Island* (Australia)\n* **Hanoi**, Vietnam\n* **Jakarta**, Indonesia\n* **Kuala Lumpur**, Malaysia\n* **Manila**, Philippines\n* **Naypyidaw**, Myanmar\n* **Phnom Penh**, Cambodia\n* **Singapore**\n* **Vientiane**, Laos\n* **West Island**, *Cocos (Keeling) Islands* (Australia)\n | * **Abu Dhabi**, United Arab Emirates\n* **Amman**, Jordan\n* **Ankara**, Turkey\n* **Baghdad**, Iraq\n* **Baku**, Azerbaijan\n* **Beirut**, Lebanon\n* **Damascus**, Syria\n* **Doha**, Qatar\n* **Episkopi Cantonment**, *Akrotiri and Dhekelia* (UK)\n* **Jerusalem**, Israel **\\***\n* **Kuwait City**, Kuwait\n* **Manama**, Bahrain\n | * **Muscat**, Oman\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −9.3(15.3)\n | −11.6(11.1)\n | −8.1(17.4)\n | −3.8(25.2)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | −2.1(28.2)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −11.6(11.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 49.5(1.95)\n | 45.9(1.81)\n | 88.5(3.48)\n | 106.3(4.19)\n | 118.7(4.67)\n | 163.2(6.43)\n | 205.6(8.09)\n | 217.4(8.56)\n | 270.2(10.64)\n | 215.4(8.48)\n | 68.9(2.71)\n | 43.7(1.72)\n | 1,608(63.31)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 206.5\n | 187.7\n | 173.0\n | 178.4\n | 172.2\n | 104.2\n | 124.8\n | 144.6\n | 104.5\n | 128.7\n | 164.5\n | 186.5\n | 1,874.6\n |\n| Source: Japan Meteorological Agency[82][83] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Peel, M.C., Finlayson, B.L., and McMahon, T.A.: Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification Archived February 10, 2017, at the Wayback Machine, Hydrol.

During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991–2020 normals, extremes 1875–present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Moscow**, Russia\n | * **Camp Thunder Cove**, *BIOT* (UK) **\\***\n* **Dhaka**, Bangladesh\n* **Islamabad**, Pakistan\n* **Kabul**, Afghanistan\n* **Kathmandu**, Nepal\n* **Malé**, Maldives\n* **New Delhi**, India\n* **Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte**, Sri Lanka\n* **Thimphu**, Bhutan\n | * **Bandar Seri Begawan**, Brunei\n* **Bangkok**, Thailand\n* **Dili**, East Timor\n* **Flying Fish Cove**, *Christmas Island* (Australia)\n* **Hanoi**, Vietnam\n* **Jakarta**, Indonesia\n* **Kuala Lumpur**, Malaysia\n* **Manila**, Philippines\n* **Naypyidaw**, Myanmar\n* **Phnom Penh**, Cambodia\n* **Singapore**\n* **Vientiane**, Laos\n* **West Island**, *Cocos (Keeling) Islands* (Australia)\n | * **Abu Dhabi**, United Arab Emirates\n* **Amman**, Jordan\n* **Ankara**, Turkey\n* **Baghdad**, Iraq\n* **Baku**, Azerbaijan\n* **Beirut**, Lebanon\n* **Damascus**, Syria\n* **Doha**, Qatar\n* **Episkopi Cantonment**, *Akrotiri and Dhekelia* (UK)\n* **Jerusalem**, Israel **\\***\n* **Kuwait City**, Kuwait\n* **Manama**, Bahrain\n | * **Muscat**, Oman\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −9.3(15.3)\n | −11.6(11.1)\n | −8.1(17.4)\n | −3.8(25.2)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | −2.1(28.2)\n | −6.9(19.6)\n | −11.6(11.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 49.5(1.95)\n | 45.9(1.81)\n | 88.5(3.48)\n | 106.3(4.19)\n | 118.7(4.67)\n | 163.2(6.43)\n | 205.6(8.09)\n | 217.4(8.56)\n | 270.2(10.64)\n | 215.4(8.48)\n | 68.9(2.71)\n | 43.7(1.72)\n | 1,608(63.31)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 206.5\n | 187.7\n | 173.0\n | 178.4\n | 172.2\n | 104.2\n | 124.8\n | 144.6\n | 104.5\n | 128.7\n | 164.5\n | 186.5\n | 1,874.6\n |\n| Source: Japan Meteorological Agency[82][83] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Peel, M.C., Finlayson, B.L., and McMahon, T.A.: Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification Archived February 10, 2017, at the Wayback Machine, Hydrol.

Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3 °C (5.4 °F) over the past 100 years.

Night temperatures cross the 20 °C (68 °F) mark towards the latter part of April. May is Delhi's hottest month during which temperatures may reach 45 °C (113 °F) or higher.[14] This month is characterized by frequent thunderstorms.[15] Dust storms are another feature of Delhi's summer,[16][17] and can be severe and destructive when accompanied by strong winds, particularly under cumulonimbus formation.[18] These are caused due to fine dust brought along by the hot winds arriving from the desert. They make the surroundings appear pale yellow, bring temperatures slightly down and are usually followed by thunderstorms. Post mid-June, temperatures start falling slowly, while humidity shows a gradual rise.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Source 1: India Meteorological Department (sun 1971–2000);[43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56] Time and Date (dewpoints, 2005–2015)[57] Revised Rainfall data[58] |\n| Source 2: Tokyo Climate Center (mean temperatures 1991–2020);[59] Weather Atlas (UV Index)[60](Daylight)[61] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 27.9(82.2)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 19.9(67.8)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n |\n| Mean minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.6(38.5)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 9.7(49.5)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 24.1(75.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 4.6(40.3)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −2.2(28.0)\n | −1.6(29.1)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 17.8(64.0)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 9.9(49.8)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | −1.3(29.7)\n | −2.2(28.0)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 18.1(0.71)\n | 19.3(0.76)\n | 15.2(0.60)\n | 13.6(0.54)\n | 30.2(1.19)\n | 68.8(2.71)\n | 205.7(8.10)\n | 214.2(8.43)\n | 109.5(4.31)\n | 12.7(0.50)\n | 5.5(0.22)\n | 6.4(0.25)\n | 719.2(28.32)\n |\n| Average rainy days\n | 1.4\n | 1.6\n | 1.4\n | 1.2\n | 2.7\n | 4.0\n | 8.9\n | 9.4\n | 5.0\n | 0.8\n | 0.4\n | 0.4\n | 37.2\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_011G6m1q7jVfPn9zhtVA23p3","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Night temperatures cross the 20 °C (68 °F) mark towards the latter part of April. May is Delhi's hottest month during which temperatures may reach 45 °C (113 °F) or higher.[14] This month is characterized by frequent thunderstorms.[15] Dust storms are another feature of Delhi's summer,[16][17] and can be severe and destructive when accompanied by strong winds, particularly under cumulonimbus formation.[18] These are caused due to fine dust brought along by the hot winds arriving from the desert. They make the surroundings appear pale yellow, bring temperatures slightly down and are usually followed by thunderstorms. Post mid-June, temperatures start falling slowly, while humidity shows a gradual rise.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Source 1: India Meteorological Department (sun 1971–2000);[43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56] Time and Date (dewpoints, 2005–2015)[57] Revised Rainfall data[58] |\n| Source 2: Tokyo Climate Center (mean temperatures 1991–2020);[59] Weather Atlas (UV Index)[60](Daylight)[61] |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 27.9(82.2)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 19.9(67.8)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n |\n| Mean minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.6(38.5)\n | 6.2(43.2)\n | 9.7(49.5)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 24.1(75.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 4.6(40.3)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −2.2(28.0)\n | −1.6(29.1)\n | 3.4(38.1)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 17.8(64.0)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 9.9(49.8)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | −1.3(29.7)\n | −2.2(28.0)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 18.1(0.71)\n | 19.3(0.76)\n | 15.2(0.60)\n | 13.6(0.54)\n | 30.2(1.19)\n | 68.8(2.71)\n | 205.7(8.10)\n | 214.2(8.43)\n | 109.5(4.31)\n | 12.7(0.50)\n | 5.5(0.22)\n | 6.4(0.25)\n | 719.2(28.32)\n |\n| Average rainy days\n | 1.4\n | 1.6\n | 1.4\n | 1.2\n | 2.7\n | 4.0\n | 8.9\n | 9.4\n | 5.0\n | 0.8\n | 0.4\n | 0.4\n | 37.2\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_011G6m1q7jVfPn9zhtVA23p3","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
