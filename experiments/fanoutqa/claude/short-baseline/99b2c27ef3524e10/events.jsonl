Wal-Mart Stores Inc. grew to be the world's largest corporation by revenue as well as the biggest private employer in the world.[1] For a period of time, Walton was the richest person in the United States.[2] His family has remained the richest family in the U.S. for several consecutive years, with a net worth of around US$240.6 billion as of January 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSamuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother's Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for Metropolitan Life Insurance,[3][4] where he foreclosed on farms during the Great Depression.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Estée Lauder\n* William Levitt\n* Lucky Luciano\n* Louis B.

Both he and his son John would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.).[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis remains are interred at the Bentonville Cemetery. He left his ownership in Walmart to his wife and their children: Rob Walton succeeded his father as the Chairman of Walmart, and John Walton was a director until his death in a 2005 plane crash. The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son Jim Walton is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005. Two daughters of Sam's brother Bud Walton—Ann Kroenke and Nancy Laurie—hold smaller shares in the company.[34]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Time 100 Builders & Titans: Sam Walton by John Huey\". *Time Magazine*.

Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam's knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease. He had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal, and reimburse Helen's father. They opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on May 9, 1950.[15]\n\n\nBefore he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.[17]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSam Walton is regarded as one of the greatest project entrepreneurs in the retail chain industry. He had a great passion for learning. He frequently made unannounced visits to Walmarts around the country to learn what local innovations were working that then could be shared with other Walmarts. On one of those visits he was puzzled by a greeter saying “hello” at the entrance of the store and asked the fellow what he was doing. The greeter explained that his main job was to discourage shoplifters from taking unpaid merchandise out of the store through the entrance. Walton was delighted and shared the innovation with “associates” throughout his chain.[21]\n\n\n\n## First Walmart[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Walmart\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01WBiFedHEah93uuKwNteSZr","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. grew to be the world's largest corporation by revenue as well as the biggest private employer in the world.[1] For a period of time, Walton was the richest person in the United States.[2] His family has remained the richest family in the U.S. for several consecutive years, with a net worth of around US$240.6 billion as of January 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSamuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother's Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for Metropolitan Life Insurance,[3][4] where he foreclosed on farms during the Great Depression.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Estée Lauder\n* William Levitt\n* Lucky Luciano\n* Louis B.

Both he and his son John would later become accomplished pilots and log thousands of hours scouting locations and expanding the family business.).[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis remains are interred at the Bentonville Cemetery. He left his ownership in Walmart to his wife and their children: Rob Walton succeeded his father as the Chairman of Walmart, and John Walton was a director until his death in a 2005 plane crash. The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son Jim Walton is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005. Two daughters of Sam's brother Bud Walton—Ann Kroenke and Nancy Laurie—hold smaller shares in the company.[34]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Time 100 Builders & Titans: Sam Walton by John Huey\". *Time Magazine*.

Walton negotiated the purchase of a small discount store, and the title to the building, on the condition that he get a 99-year lease to expand into the shop next door. The owner of the shop next door refused six times, and Walton gave up on Bentonville when his father-in-law, without Sam's knowledge, paid the shop owner a final visit and $20,000 to secure the lease. He had just enough left from the sale of the first store to close the deal, and reimburse Helen's father. They opened for business with a one-day remodeling sale on May 9, 1950.[15]\n\n\nBefore he bought the Bentonville store, it was doing $72,000 in sales and it increased to $105,000 in the first year and then $140,000 and $175,000.[17]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSam Walton is regarded as one of the greatest project entrepreneurs in the retail chain industry. He had a great passion for learning. He frequently made unannounced visits to Walmarts around the country to learn what local innovations were working that then could be shared with other Walmarts. On one of those visits he was puzzled by a greeter saying “hello” at the entrance of the store and asked the fellow what he was doing. The greeter explained that his main job was to discourage shoplifters from taking unpaid merchandise out of the store through the entrance. Walton was delighted and shared the innovation with “associates” throughout his chain.[21]\n\n\n\n## First Walmart[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Walmart\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01WBiFedHEah93uuKwNteSZr","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Bezos rose to be the 5th richest person in the world hours before market close; he gained $7 billion in one hour.[201] By the time the *Forbes* list was calculated in March 2016, his net worth was registered at $45.2 billion.[202] However, just months later in October 2016, his wealth increased by $16.2 billion to $66.5 billion, unofficially ranking him the third-richest person in the world, behind Warren Buffett.[203] After sporadic jumps in Amazon's share price, in July 2017 he briefly unseated Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates as the wealthiest person in the world.[204]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n213. **^** Kroll, Luisa. \"Forbes Billionaires 2018: Meet The Richest People on the Planet\". *Forbes*.
