          "content": "<document>\n<title>Genetic code</title>\n<fragment>\n\nThe codons specify which amino acid will be added next during protein biosynthesis. With some exceptions,[1] a three-nucleotide codon in a nucleic acid sequence specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme is often referred to as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply *the* genetic code, though variant codes (such as in mitochondria) exist.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The genetic codeFurther information: Adaptor hypothesis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMarshall Nirenberg and Heinrich J. Matthaei were the first to reveal the nature of a codon in 1961.[12] They used a cell-free system to translate a poly-uracil RNA sequence (i.e., UUUUU...) and discovered that the polypeptide that they had synthesized consisted of only the amino acid phenylalanine.[13] They thereby deduced that the codon UUU specified the amino acid phenylalanine.\n\n\nThis was followed by experiments in Severo Ochoa's laboratory that demonstrated that the poly-adenine RNA sequence (AAAAA...) coded for the polypeptide poly-lysine[14] and that the poly-cytosine RNA sequence (CCCCC...) coded for the polypeptide poly-proline.[15] Therefore, the codon AAA specified the amino acid lysine, and the codon CCC specified the amino acid proline. Using various copolymers most of the remaining codons were then determined.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn some proteins, non-standard amino acids are substituted for standard stop codons, depending on associated signal sequences in the messenger RNA. For example, UGA can code for selenocysteine and UAG can code for pyrrolysine. Selenocysteine came to be seen as the 21st amino acid, and pyrrolysine as the 22nd.[55] Unlike selenocysteine, pyrrolysine-encoded UAG is translated with the participation of a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.[56] Both selenocysteine and pyrrolysine may be present in the same organism.[55] Although the genetic code is normally fixed in an organism, the achaeal prokaryote *Acetohalobium arabaticum* can expand its genetic code from 20 to 21 amino acids (by including pyrrolysine) under different conditions of growth.[57]\n\n\n\n### Variations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of genetic codes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| AUG | M | 1.00 | 22.0 | 896,005 | ACG | T | 0.11 | 6.1 | 246,105 | AAG | K | 0.57 | 31.9 | 1,295,568 | AGG | R | 0.21 | 12.0 | 486,463\n |\n| GUU | V | 0.18 | 11.0 | 448,607 | GCU | A | 0.27 | 18.4 | 750,096 | GAU | D | 0.46 | 21.8 | 885,429 | GGU | G | 0.16 | 10.8 | 437,126\n |\n| GUC | V | 0.24 | 14.5 | 588,138 | GCC | A | 0.40 | 27.7 | 1,127,679 | GAC | D | 0.54 | 25.1 | 1,020,595 | GGC | G | 0.34 | 22.2 | 903,565\n |\n| GUA | V | 0.12 | 7.1 | 287,712 | GCA | A | 0.23 | 15.8 | 643,471 | GAA | E | 0.42 | 29.0 | 1,177,632 | GGA | G | 0.25 | 16.5 | 669,873\n |\n| GUG | V | 0.46 | 28.1 | 1,143,534 | GCG | A | 0.11 | 7.4 | 299,495 | GAG | E | 0.58 | 39.6 | 1,609,975 | GGG | G | 0.25 | 16.5 | 669,768\n |\n\n |\n\n## Alternative genetic codes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: DNA and RNA codon tables \u00a7\u00a0Alternative codons\n\n### Non-standard amino acids[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into proteins by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl\u00a0\u2013 tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.[22][23]\n\n\nH. Murakami and M. Sisido extended some codons to have four and five bases. Steven A. Benner constructed a functional 65th (*in vivo*) codon.[24]\n\n\nIn 2015 N. Budisa, D. S\u00f6ll and co-workers reported the full substitution of all 20,899 tryptophan residues (UGG codons) with unnatural thienopyrrole-alanine in the genetic code of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*.[25]\n\n\nIn 2016 the first stable semisynthetic organism was created. It was a (single cell) bacterium with two synthetic bases (called X and Y). The bases survived cell division.[26][27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor example, the amino acid leucine is specified by **Y**U**R** or CU**N** (UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, or CUG) codons (difference in the first or third position indicated using IUPAC notation), while the amino acid serine is specified by UC**N** or AG**Y** (UCA, UCG, UCC, UCU, AGU, or AGC) codons (difference in the first, second, or third position).[49] A practical consequence of redundancy is that errors in the third position of the triplet codon cause only a silent mutation or an error that would not affect the protein because the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity is maintained by equivalent substitution of amino acids; for example, a codon of NUN (where N = any nucleotide) tends to code for hydrophobic amino acids. NCN yields amino acid residues that are small in size and moderate in hydropathicity; NAN encodes average size hydrophilic residues. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmino acids that share the same biosynthetic pathway tend to have the same first base in their codons. This could be an evolutionary relic of an early, simpler genetic code with fewer amino acids that later evolved to code a larger set of amino acids.[84] It could also reflect steric and chemical properties that had another effect on the codon during its evolution. Amino acids with similar physical properties also tend to have similar codons,[85][86] reducing the problems caused by point mutations and mistranslations.[83]\n\n\nGiven the non-random genetic triplet coding scheme, a tenable hypothesis for the origin of genetic code could address multiple aspects of the codon table, such as absence of codons for D-amino acids, secondary codon patterns for some amino acids, confinement of synonymous positions to third position, the small set of only 20 amino acids (instead of a number approaching 64), and the relation of stop codon patterns to amino acid coding patterns.[87]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Turanov AA, Lobanov AV, Fomenko DE, Morrison HG, Sogin ML, Klobutcher LA, Hatfield DL, Gladyshev VN (January 2009). \"Genetic code supports targeted insertion of two amino acids by one codon\". *Science*. **323** (5911): 259\u201361. doi:10.1126/science.1164748.

PMID\u00a034751130.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSurprisingly, variations in the interpretation of the genetic code exist also in human nuclear-encoded genes: In 2016, researchers studying the translation of malate dehydrogenase found that in about 4% of the mRNAs encoding this enzyme the stop codon is naturally used to encode the amino acids tryptophan and arginine.[67] This type of recoding is induced by a high-readthrough stop codon context[68] and it is referred to as *functional translational readthrough*.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Natural selection has led to codon assignments of the genetic code that minimize the effects of mutations.[103] A recent hypothesis[104] suggests that the triplet code was derived from codes that used longer than triplet codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than triplet decoding would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate decoding absent complex translational machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Biosynthetic expansion. The genetic code grew from a simpler earlier code through a process of \"biosynthetic expansion\". Primordial life \"discovered\" new amino acids (for example, as by-products of metabolism) and later incorporated some of these into the machinery of genetic coding.[95] Although much circumstantial evidence has been found to suggest that fewer amino acid types were used in the past,[96] precise and detailed hypotheses about which amino acids entered the code in what order are controversial.[97][98] However, several studies have suggested that Gly, Ala, Asp, Val, Ser, Pro, Glu, Leu, Thr may belong to a group of early-addition amino acids, whereas Cys, Met, Tyr, Trp, His, Phe may belong to a group of later-addition amino acids.[99][100][101][102]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe predicted that \"The code is universal (the same in all organisms) or nearly so\".[59] The first variation was discovered in 1979, by researchers studying human mitochondrial genes.[60] Many slight variants were discovered thereafter,[61] including various alternative mitochondrial codes.[62] These minor variants for example involve translation of the codon UGA as tryptophan in *Mycoplasma* species, and translation of CUG as a serine rather than leucine in yeasts of the \"CTG clade\" (such as *Candida albicans*).[63][64][65] Because viruses must use the same genetic code as their hosts, modifications to the standard genetic code could interfere with viral protein synthesis or functioning. However, viruses such as totiviruses have adapted to the host's genetic code modification.[66] In bacteria and archaea, GUG and UUG are common start codons. In rare cases, certain proteins may use alternative start codons.[61]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWhen DNA is double-stranded, six possible reading frames are defined, three in the forward orientation on one strand and three reverse on the opposite strand.[32]:\u200a330 Protein-coding frames are defined by a start codon, usually the first AUG (ATG) codon in the RNA (DNA) sequence.\n\n\nIn eukaryotes, ORFs in exons are often interrupted by introns.\n\n\n\n### Start and stop codons[edit]\n\n\nTranslation starts with a chain-initiation codon or start codon. The start codon alone is not sufficient to begin the process. Nearby sequences such as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in *E. coli* and initiation factors are also required to start translation. The most common start codon is AUG, which is read as methionine or as formylmethionine (in bacteria, mitochondria, and plastids). Alternative start codons depending on the organism include \"GUG\" or \"UUG\"; these codons normally represent valine and leucine, respectively, but as start codons they are translated as methionine or formylmethionine.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** Lobanov AV, Heaphy SM, Turanov AA, Gerashchenko MV, Pucciarelli S, Devaraj RR, et\u00a0al.

Consequently, only a subset of the amino acids used in protein synthesis are essential nutrients.\n\n\n\n## From intermediates of the citric acid cycle and other pathways[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSix other amino acids are considered **conditionally essential** in the human diet, meaning their synthesis can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress.[2] These six are arginine, cysteine, glycine, glutamine, proline, and tyrosine. Six amino acids are non-essential (**dispensable**) in humans, meaning they can be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body. These six are alanine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, serine,[2] and selenocysteine (considered the 21st amino acid). Pyrrolysine (considered the 22nd amino acid),[3] which is proteinogenic only in certain microorganisms, is not used by and therefore non-essential for most organisms, including humans.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf the twenty amino acids common to all life forms (not counting selenocysteine), humans cannot synthesize nine: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine. Additionally, the amino acids arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline and tyrosine are considered **conditionally essential**,[5] which means that specific populations who do not synthesize it in adequate amounts, such as new born infants and people with diseased livers who are unable to synthesize cysteine, must obtain one or more of these conditionally essential amino acids from their diet.[6][7] For example, enough arginine is synthesized by the urea cycle to meet the needs of an adult but perhaps not those of a growing child. Amino acids that must be obtained from the diet are called **essential amino acids**. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNonessential amino acids are produced in the body. The pathways for the synthesis of nonessential amino acids come from basic metabolic pathways. Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reductive amination of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to glutamate. A transamination reaction takes place in the synthesis of most amino acids. At this step, the chirality of the amino acid is established. Alanine and aspartate are synthesized by the transamination of pyruvate and oxaloacetate, respectively. Glutamine is synthesized from NH4+ and glutamate, and asparagine is synthesized similarly. Proline and arginine are both derived from glutamate. Serine, formed from 3-phosphoglycerate, which comes from glycolysis, is the precursor of glycine and cysteine. Tyrosine is synthesized by the hydroxylation of phenylalanine, which is an essential amino acid.\n\n\n\n## Recommended daily intake[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein (nutrient)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEncoded (proteinogenic) amino acids\n |\n| --- |\n| General topics | * Protein\n* Peptide\n* Genetic code\n | ![](image)\n |\n| By properties | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Aliphatic | * Branched-chain amino acids (Valine\n* Isoleucine\n* Leucine)\n* Methionine\n* Alanine\n* Proline\n* Glycine\n |\n| Aromatic | * Histidine\n* Tyrosine\n* Tryptophan\n* Phenylalanine\n |\n| Polar, uncharged | * Asparagine\n* Glutamine\n* Serine\n* Threonine\n |\n| Positive charge (p*K*a) | * Lysine (\u224810.8)\n* Arginine (\u224812.5)\n* Histidine (\u22486.1)\n* Pyrrolysine\n |\n| Negative charge (p*K*a) | * Aspartic acid (\u22483.9)\n* Glutamic acid (\u22484.1)\n* Selenocysteine (\u22485.4)\n* Cysteine (\u22488.3)\n* Tyrosine (\u224810.1)\n |\n\n |\n| * **Amino acids types**: Encoded (proteins)\n* Essential\n* Non-proteinogenic\n* Ketogenic\n* Glucogenic\n* Secondary amino\n* Imino acids\n* D-amino acids\n* Dehydroamino acids\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** F\u00fcrst P, Stehle P (1 June 2004). \"What are the essential elements needed for the determination of amino acid requirements in humans?\". *J.

The sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and homocysteine, can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized *de novo* in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the aromatic amino acid pair, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Likewise arginine, ornithine, and citrulline, which are interconvertible by the urea cycle, are considered a single group.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Effects of deficiency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein-energy malnutrition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEstimating the daily requirement for the indispensable amino acids has proven to be difficult; these numbers have undergone considerable revision over the last 20 years.

Of the 21 amino acids common to all life forms, the nine amino acids humans cannot synthesize are valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, threonine, histidine, and lysine.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nScientists had known since the early 20th century that rats could not survive on a diet whose only protein source was zein, which comes from maize (corn), but recovered if they were fed casein from cow's milk. This led William Cumming Rose to the discovery of the essential amino acid threonine.[24] Through manipulation of rodent diets, Rose was able to show that ten amino acids are essential for rats: lysine, tryptophan, histidine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, valine, and arginine, in addition to threonine. Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants. Longer-term studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans.[25]\n\n\n\n## Interchangeability[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEssential amino acid deficiency should be distinguished from protein-energy malnutrition, which can manifest as marasmus or kwashiorkor. Kwashiorkor was once attributed to pure protein deficiency in individuals who were consuming enough calories (\"sugar baby syndrome\"). However, this theory has been challenged by the finding that there is no difference in the diets of children developing marasmus as opposed to kwashiorkor.[26] Still, for instance in Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) maintained by the USDA, lack of one or more of the essential amino acids is described as protein-energy malnutrition.[2]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biological Value (BV)\n* Essential fatty acid\n* Essential genes\n* List of standard amino acids\n* Low-protein diet\n* Orthomolecular medicine\n* Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score\n* Ketogenic amino acid\n* Glucogenic amino acid\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **limiting amino acid** is the essential amino acid which is furthest from meeting nutritional requirements.[4] This concept is important when determining the selection, number, and amount of foods to consume because even when total protein and all other essential amino acids are satisfied if the limiting amino acid is not satisfied then the meal is considered to be nutritionally limited by that amino acid.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Essentiality in humans[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Young VR (1994). \"Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations\". *J.

Cysteine (or sulfur-containing amino acids), tyrosine (or aromatic amino acids), and arginine are always required by infants and growing children.[11][14] Methionine and cysteine are grouped together because one of them can be synthesized from the other using the enzyme methionine *S*-methyltransferase and the catalyst methionine synthase.[15] Phenylalanine and tyrosine are grouped together because one of them can be synthesized from the other using the enzyme phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia-lyase.[16]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Amino acid requirements and the amino acid content of food[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis table displays the number of Items in each Category with the same limiting Essential Amino Acid [11] [12] [19]\n|  | Based on WHO Requirements\n |  | Based on USDA Requirements\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Category\n | Tryptophan\n | Threonine\n | Isoleucine\n | Leucine\n | Lysine\n | Methionine+Cystine\n | Phenylalanine+Tyrosine\n | Valine\n | Histidine\n |  | Tryptophan\n | Threonine\n | Isoleucine\n | Leucine\n | Lysine\n | Methionine+Cystine\n | Phenylalanine+Tyrosine\n | Valine\n | Histidine\n |\n| American Indian/Alaska Native Foods\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 10\n | 4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 15\n | 0\n |  | 7\n | 2\n | 0\n | 3\n | 6\n | 5\n | 0\n | 0\n | 10\n |\n| Baby Foods\n | 2\n | 1\n | 0\n | 7\n | 35\n | 8\n | 0\n | 11\n | 1\n |  | 5\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 34\n | 13\n | 0\n | 0\n | 7\n |\n| Baked Products\n | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 338\n | 1\n | 0\n | 5\n | 1\n |  | 0\n | 1\n | 0\n | 0\n | 339\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 9\n |\n| Beef Products\n | 276\n | 0\n | 6\n | 2\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 649\n | 2\n |  | 289\n | 1\n | 0\n | 176\n | 6\n | 300\n | 0\n | 159\n | 4\n |\n| Beverages\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 2\n | 11\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe amino acids that are essential in the human diet were established in a series of experiments led by William Cumming Rose. The experiments involved elemental diets to healthy male graduate students. These diets consisted of corn starch, sucrose, butterfat without protein, corn oil, inorganic salts, the known vitamins, a large brown \"candy\" made of liver extract flavored with peppermint oil (to supply any unknown vitamins), and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids. The main outcome measure was nitrogen balance. Rose noted that the symptoms of nervousness, exhaustion, and dizziness were encountered to a greater or lesser extent whenever human subjects were deprived of an essential amino acid.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nModern techniques make use of Ion Exchange Chromatography to determine the actual amino acid content of foods. The USDA used this technique in their own labs to determine the content of 7793 foods across 28 categories and published the final database in 2018 to the public.[19]\n\n\nThe limiting amino acid depends on the human requirements and there are currently two sets of human requirements from authoritative sources: one published by WHO[11] and the other published by USDA.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
