China - Beijing\nMajor river: None directly through the city, but the Yongding River and Chaobai River flow through the greater Beijing area.\n\n2. India - New Delhi\nMajor river: Yamuna River flows through the eastern part of the city.\n\n3. United States - Washington, D.C.\nMajor river: Potomac River flows along the western edge of the city, and the Anacostia River flows through the eastern portion.\n\n4. Indonesia - Jakarta\nMajor river: Several rivers flow through Jakarta, with the Ciliwung River being the most prominent. Other rivers include the Pesanggrahan, Angke, and Sunter rivers.\n\n5. Pakistan - Islamabad\nMajor river: The Soan River flows through the region, though not directly through the center of the city.\n\nIt's worth noting that many of these capital cities face various challenges related to their rivers, including flooding (particularly in Jakarta), pollution (especially the Yamuna in New Delhi), and environmental concerns. Some of these rivers have played important historical roles in the development of these cities and continue to be significant for water supply, transportation, and cultural purposes.",
