Curry and Thompson are generally considered among the greatest backcourts of all time.[11][12] The Warriors have the third most NBA championships and have the third most Finals appearances; only the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics have more. Wilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry have been named the NBA's MVPs while playing for the Warriors, for a total of three MVP awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Golden State Warriors\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe team struggled in the 1980s, then became playoff regulars at the turn of the decade with stars Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin, nicknamed \"Run TMC\". Led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, the team returned to championship glory in 2015, with defensive swingman Andre Iguodala being named Finals MVP. In 2016, the Warriors set the record for best regular season record at 73-9 before losing the Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers (against whom they played a record four straight finals) and becoming the first team to lose a series after leading 3\u20131 in the Finals. After signing former MVP Kevin Durant, the team won back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018 (Durant winning both Finals MVPs). They lost the 2019 Finals to the Toronto Raptors, a series which saw Durant and Thompson suffer serious Achilles and ACL injuries, respectively; Durant left that off-season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Golden State Warriors |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) *2023\u201324 Golden State Warriors season* |\n| ![Golden State Warriors logo](image) |\n| Conference | Western |\n| Division | Pacific |\n| Founded | 1946 |\n| History | **Philadelphia Warriors**1946\u20131962**San Francisco Warriors**1962\u20131971**Golden State Warriors**1971\u2013present[1][2] |\n| Arena | Chase Center |\n| Location | San Francisco, California |\n| Team colors | Royal blue, yellow[3][4]\u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| Main sponsor | Rakuten[5] |\n| President | Brandon Schneider[6] |\n| General manager | Mike Dunleavy Jr.[7] |\n| Head coach | Steve Kerr |\n| Ownership | Joe Lacob (majority)Peter Guber |\n| Affiliation(s) | Santa Cruz Warriors |\n| Championships | **7** (1947, 1956, 1975, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2022) |\n| Conference titles | **7** (1975, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022) |\n| Division titles | **12** (1948, 1951, 1956, 1964, 1967, 1975, 1976, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) |\n| Retired numbers | **6** (13, 14, 16, 17, 24, 42) |\n| Website | www.nba.com/warriors |\n|  |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Association jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Association**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Icon jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Icon**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Statement jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Statement**\n |\n| ![](image)\n\n![City jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**City**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Classic jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Classic**\n |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\nThe **Golden State Warriors** are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city's name, before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971.[a][b] The club plays its home games at the Chase Center.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter missing the playoffs the following two seasons, the Warriors returned to the playoffs with a healthy Thompson and a new supporting cast that included All-Star Andrew Wiggins and key scorer Jordan Poole; they defeated the Boston Celtics in the 2022 Finals, where Curry won his first Finals MVP. The Warriors' dynasty has seen the team win four titles in eight seasons, as well as reach five consecutive Finals from 2015 to 2019 (six Finals in eight years); Curry, Green, Thompson, and Iguodala were on all four 21st century championship teams, Shaun Livingston and Kevon Looney were on three each.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Warriors swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in six games in the second round, and dispatched Houston Rockets in five games in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975. The team's opponent was the Cleveland Cavaliers, who would later go on to face the Warriors in each of the next three consecutive NBA Finals. After Golden State fell behind 2\u20131 in the series, Kerr gave swingman Andre Iguodala his first start of the season, replacing center Andrew Bogut in Game 4. The Warriors' small lineup (which came to be known as the Death Lineup) helped turn the series around.[71] The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, and Iguodala was named Finals MVP.[72] Kerr became the first rookie coach to win a title since Pat Riley in 1981\u201382.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 10, 2022, the Warriors clinched the third seed in the Western conference, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since the 2018\u201319 season. In the first round, they advanced past the Denver Nuggets, and triumphed over the Memphis Grizzlies in the conference semi-finals. On May 26, 2022, the Warriors advanced to their seventh NBA Finals after defeating the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals, 4\u20131. On June 16, 2022, the team won their seventh NBA title, beating the Boston Celtics 4\u20132. Curry, Thompson, Green, and Iguodala all won their fourth championship as members of the Warriors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGolden State Warriors\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in **1946**\n* Played in **Philadelphia** (1946\u20131962) and **Oakland** (1971\u20132019)\n* Based in **San Francisco, California**\n |\n| Franchise | * History\n* All-time roster\n* Draft history\n* Head coaches\n* Seasons\n* **Current season**\n |\n| Arenas | * Philadelphia Arena\n* Philadelphia Convention Hall\n* Cow Palace\n* San Francisco Civic Auditorium\n* USF War Memorial Gymnasium\n* San Diego Sports Arena\n* San Jose Arena\n* Oracle Arena\n* **Chase Center**\n |\n| Personnel | Owner(s)\nJoe Lacob (majority)\nPeter Guber\nPresident\nBrandon Schneider\nGeneral manager\nMike Dunleavy Jr.\nHead coach\nSteve Kerr\n |\n| G League affiliate | * Santa Cruz Warriors\n |\n| Retired numbers | * 13\n* 14\n* 16\n* 17\n* 24\n* 42\n |\n| NBA championships | * 1947\n* 1956\n* 1975\n* 2015\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| Rivalries | * Cleveland Cavaliers\n* Los Angeles Lakers\n* Sacramento Kings\n |\n| Culture and lore | * 73\u20139\n* Dance Cam Mom\n* Death Lineup\n* \"Good Feeling\"\n* *Hangin' with Mr. Cooper*\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors swept the Cavaliers to win their second straight NBA championship; previously, there had not been an NBA Finals sweep since 2007.[112] On August 30, 2018, David West announced his retirement from the NBA after 15 seasons.[113][114] Following the 2018 NBA Finals, writers for *Sports Illustrated*,[115] *USA Today*,[91] *The Wall Street Journal*,[116] and the *New York Daily News*[117] described the Warriors as a dynasty.

On February 27, 2016, Curry also tied the NBA record of twelve three-pointers made in a single game, jointly holding it with Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant.[88]\n\n\nThe Warriors reached the NBA Finals for the second consecutive year, facing a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[89] The Warriors won three of the first four games of the 2016 NBA Finals, but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at three wins apiece.[90] Draymond Green was suspended for Game Five of the series, and Curry was ejected from Game Six.[91] In Game Seven, the Warriors lost the series on their home court, earning the distinction of becoming the first team to lose the NBA Finals after having led three games to one.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors went into the 2018 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference after earning a 2017\u201318 regular season record of 58\u201324.

The team finished the season with a record of 73\u20139.[86] On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes.[87] Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2016 All-Star Game. Green broke the Golden State franchise record of nine triple-doubles in a season. Curry broke numerous three-point records during the season, including his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 286; he finished the season with 402 three-pointers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors ended the season with a record of 51\u201331. The team won more than 50 games for only the fourth time in franchise history, finished 20 games over .500 for the first time in 22 years, and tied the 1991\u201392 squad for the franchise's all-time mark of 24 wins on the road. Even without Bogut, the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game in the first round of the playoffs before their 2013\u201314 season came to an end. It was a season of many thrilling moments; the Warriors played in 17 regular-season games decided by two points or less, six games decided by winning shots in the final three seconds, and seven comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more.[62] Curry also made his first appearance in the All-Star Game in 2014. Curry and Klay Thompson continued to set league records in three-point shooting. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCurry, who finished the season with 261 threes, set an individual record for most three-pointers in a span of two seasons with 533, surpassing the previous mark of 478 set by former Seattle SuperSonics legend Ray Allen in 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306. Together, Thompson and Curry combined for 484 threes on the year, besting by one the NBA record they had set the year before.\n\n\n\n#### 2014\u20132019: The Dynasty[edit]\n\n\nJackson was fired as coach on May 6, 2014,[63] despite a unanimous declaration of support from his players[64] and a three-year 121\u2013109 (.526) record that marked a major turnaround and placed him fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Alvin Attles (557), Don Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263).[65] Over the 17 years before Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had averaged 30.2 wins per season and made the playoffs only once.[66] Jackson became just the third Warriors head coach to notch at least 50 wins in a season, joining Nelson and Attles, who both hit the mark twice.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors posted many notable achievements during the 2016\u201317 regular season. On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13, in a 116\u2013106 win over the Pelicans.[104] On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes, in a 142\u2013106 victory over the Pacers. In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time.[105] Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars.[106] On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points.[107] On March 2, 2017, the Warriors' streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94\u201387 loss to the Chicago Bulls. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cavaliers\u2013Warriors rivalry\n\nWhile the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA in 1970, the two teams' rivalry began to develop in the 2014\u201315 season when they met in the first of four consecutive NBA Finals. Previously, no pair of teams had faced each other in more than two consecutive Finals. The Warriors have won three of the four NBA Finals in which they faced the Cavaliers, losing in 2016, and winning in 2015, 2017, and 2018.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lakers\u2013Warriors rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Warriors completed the 2014\u20132015 regular season with a league-best record of 67\u201315, setting a Warriors record for wins.[70] The team finished with a home record of 39\u20132, second-best in NBA history. The team ranked first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving-led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014\u201315 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

While the Heat had a 224\u201388 record during James' four-year tenure and won NBA titles in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers went 97\u2013215 and missed the playoffs each season.[57] The Cavaliers made several moves to build a championship-contending team around James, most notably acquiring power forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, which created what many fans and media referred to as a \"Big Three\" with James, Love and Irving.[58] The Lebron-led Cavaliers made four consecutive Finals appearances from 2015 to 2018 \u2013 all against the Golden State Warriors \u2013 winning in 2016.[38][59] The 2016 NBA Championship marked the Cavaliers' first title in franchise history, as they became the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 deficit to win the Finals.[59] It was also Cleveland's first championship in major professional sports since the 1964 Browns, signaling the end of the so-called Cleveland sports curse.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational Basketball Association team in Cleveland, Ohio\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Cleveland Cavaliers |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) *2023\u201324 Cleveland Cavaliers season* |\n| ![Cleveland Cavaliers logo](image) |\n| Conference | Eastern |\n| Division | Central |\n| Founded | 1970 |\n| History | **Cleveland Cavaliers**1970\u2013present[1][2] |\n| Arena | Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse |\n| Location | Cleveland, Ohio |\n| Team colors | Wine, gold, black[3][4][5]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| Main sponsor | Cleveland-Cliffs[6] |\n| CEO | Nic Barlage[7] |\n| President | Koby Altman |\n| General manager | Mike Gansey |\n| Head coach | J.

The Cavaliers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Cavaliers began play in the 1970\u201371 season as an expansion team.[9] They set losing records in each of their first five seasons before winning their first division title in 1976.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] The 1976 team was led by Austin Carr, Bobby \"Bingo\" Smith, Jim Chones, Dick Snyder, Nate Thurmond and head coach Bill Fitch.[17] It was remembered for the \"Miracle at Richfield\", in which the Cavaliers defeated the Washington Bullets, 4\u20133, in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[18] They won Game 7, 87\u201385, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go.[18] The Cavaliers moved on to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time,[18] but were without Chones after he broke his toe before the series opener.[19] As a result, the Cavaliers went on to lose, 4\u20132, to the Boston Celtics.[20] They made playoff appearances in the following two seasons before a six-year playoff drought.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Cavaliers' roster went through many changes in the 2017\u201318 season, most notably the trade of Irving to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Isaiah Thomas and other assets.[61][62] Thomas was later traded to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a trade deadline overhaul that saw the Cavaliers add Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. (son of Cavs legend Larry Nance) and others.[63] The following offseason, James declined his player option to rejoin the team, instead signing with the Lakers.[64] In the following two seasons, the team recorded only 19 wins and failed to make the playoffs.[38]\n\n\nIn the first three seasons since James left the second time, the Cavaliers won a total of 60 games, missed the playoffs each season and have had four different head coaches: Tyronn Lue, Larry Drew, John Beilein and current head coach J.B. Bickerstaff.[38][65][66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** \"1982-83 Cleveland Cavaliers Schedule and Results\". *Basketball-Reference.com*.

During the latter half of the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, the Cavs were a regular playoff contender \u2013 led by players such as Mark Price and Brad Daugherty \u2013 and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992. After the team's playoff appearance in the 1997\u201398 season, however, the Cavs had six consecutive losing seasons with no playoff action. Cleveland was awarded with the top overall pick in the 2003 draft, and they selected LeBron James. Behind James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers again became a regular playoff contender by 2005. They made their first appearance in the NBA Finals in 2007 after winning the first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history. After failing to return to the NBA Finals in the ensuing three seasons, James joined the Miami Heat in 2010. As a result, the Cavaliers finished the 2010\u201311 season last in the conference, enduring a 26-game losing streak, the second-longest in NBA history. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **NBA Most Valuable Player**\n* LeBron James\u00a0\u2013 2009, 2010\n\n**NBA Rookie of the Year**\n* LeBron James\u00a0\u2013 2004\n* Kyrie Irving\u00a0\u2013 2012\n\n**NBA Coach of the Year**\n* Bill Fitch\u00a0\u2013 1976\n* Mike Brown\u00a0\u2013 2009\n\n**NBA Executive of the Year**\n* Wayne Embry\u00a0\u2013 1992, 1998\n\n**NBA Sportsmanship Award**\n* Terrell Brandon\u00a0\u2013 1997\n\n**J.

This also marks the team's first postseason basketball since 2017\u201318 and the first time a non-LeBron-led team qualified for postseason play since 1997\u201398. The team, however, didn't make it out of the play-in tournament, losing the 7-seed vs. 8-seed game to the Brooklyn Nets and the 8-seed vs. 9-seed game to the Atlanta Hawks, ending their season.\n\n\nOn March 26, 2023, the Cavaliers clinched a spot in the NBA playoffs, making this the first time since 2018 that the team entered the playoffs, with a 108\u201391 win over the Houston Rockets. This was also the first time since 1998 that the team entered the playoffs without LeBron James.[67] They wound up losing their first round playoff series to the New York Knicks four games to one.[68]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Cavaliers opened their inaugural season by losing their first 15 games and struggled in their early years, placing no better than sixth in the Eastern Conference during their first five seasons. The team won their first Central Division title in 1976, which also marked the first winning season and playoff appearance in franchise history, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses. The Cavs went 66\u2013180 over the course of those three seasons and endured a 24-game losing streak spanning the 1981\u201382 and 1982\u201383 seasons.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
