However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, *Angels with Dirty Faces* and *Four Daughters*, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony.[6] That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for *Erin Brockovich* and *Traffic* in 2000, winning the award for the latter. The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 89 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 68 won the award.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n102. **^** Barnes, Brooks (March 4, 2018). \"'The Shape of Water' Wins Best Picture as Oscars Project Diversity\". *The New York Times*.

It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.\nThe award is traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Director winner.\n\n\nThe 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into \"Dramatic\" and \"Comedy\" categories; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for *7th Heaven* and *Two Arabian Knights*, respectively.[1] However, these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies.[2] Nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the directors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the academy.[3][4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Dirks, Tim. \"1938 Academy Awards Winners and History\".
