The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon invested money in developing a circuit board that would allow IBM PCs to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success.

Liu says that at first he behaved \"like a kind of dictator\" and spent much time yelling. He had five corrupt executives imprisoned. Being late for a meeting could be punished by having to stand in silence before the group, a punishment that Liu accepted three times himself. Lenovo's culture gradually changed and Liu was able to relax his authoritarian style. Lenovo became an employer of choice for Chinese engineers and managers with overseas education.[5]\n\n\n\n### Legend Holdings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Legend Holdings\n\nIn June 2012, Liu stepped down as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo. In the years just prior to his resignation, Liu focused on improving Legend's growth, building-up its core assets, and conducting a public stock offering between 2014 and 2016. Legend's major assets include Lenovo, Legend Capital, a real-estate venture called Raycom, Digital China, and Hony Capital.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Koenig, Neil (20 November 2012). \"CEO Guru: Dreams and ambitions\". *BBC News*.\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"10 most powerful businesspeople in China\".\n11. **^** Salvacion, Manny (8 June 2015). \"Legend Holding's $2B IPO Approved, Investor Listing to Begin\". *Yibada*.

Number three: Would there be potential conflicts between the Chinese management and the Western management?\"[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Chuanzhi Liu: Executive Profile & Biography - Businessweek\".

During this period many Chinese intellectuals felt that commerce was immoral and degrading. The fact that in the 1980s entrepreneurs were drawn from lower classes, and often dishonest as well, made the private sector even more unattractive. This was readily apparent to Liu and his collaborators due to their proximity to Zhongguancun, where the proliferation of fly-by-night electronics traders lead to the area being dubbed \"Swindlers Valley.\"[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLenovo became a publicly traded company after listing in Hong Kong in 1994, raising nearly US$30 million. Prior to Lenovo's IPO, many analysts were optimistic. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. During the first day of trading the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America, and Australia; expand and improve production and research and development; and increase working capital. Lenovo's Hong Kong and Mainland China business units conducted a merger and secondary offering in 1997.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" Lenovo's early difficulties were compounded by the fact that its staff had little business experience. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market,\" Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting—but also very dangerous,\" said Liu.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiu has been named \"Asian Businessman,\" one of the \"Global 25 Most Influential Business Leaders,\" and many other awards. He received Second National Technology Entrepreneurs Gold Award in 1990. He was named a Model Worker and Man of Reform in China, both in 1995. He was named one of the \"Ten Most Influential Men of the Commercial Sector\" in China in 1996. Liu was named one of the \"Stars of Asia\" by *BusinessWeek* magazine in 2000. In 2001, Liu was selected by *Time Magazine* as one of the \"25 Most Influential Global Executives.\" In 2012, *Forbes* named Liu one of the 10 most important business leaders in China.[10]\n\n\nLiu is a member of the China Entrepreneurs Club (CEC). The CEC was founded in 2006. Its purpose is to strengthen the sense of social responsibility among China's young entrepreneurs.[19]\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJoyvio announced on 30 March 2014 that it had acquired a 60 per cent share of Hangzhou Longguan Tea Industrial Company for about 30 million yuan or about US$4.83 million. Longguan was previously a fully state-owned enterprise operating under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Longguan produces Hangzhou's famous Longjing tea. The company had sales of 32.45 million yuan in 2012. According to the company's annual report it has been growing 40 to 50 per cent per year. Joyvio has taken over day-to-day control of Longguan. Liu Chuanzhi said he aims to bring innovation and commercial methods to the tea industry. Liu said that Joyvio would invest in other well-known tea brands and related products.[15]\n\n\n\n### Other positions\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2013, Liu served as a senior advisor at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.\n\n\n\n## Education and early career\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiu is married and has three children.

Impossible.\"[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![file=](image)\n |\n| Workstations | * ThinkStation\n |\n| Desktops | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Business | * ThinkCentre\n\t+ A series\n\t+ M series\n\t+ Edge series\n |\n| Consumerand home office | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Current | * IdeaCentre\n\t+ A series\n\t+ B series\n\t+ Q series\n\t+ K series\n* Essential desktops\n* Legion\n |\n| Discontinued | * Erazer\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Laptops | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Business | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Current | * ThinkPad\n\t+ P series\n\t+ T series\n\t+ X series (X1 series)\n\t+ L series\n\t+ E series\n* ThinkPad Yoga\n* ThinkBook\n |\n| Discontinued | * ThinkPad\n\t+ W series\n\t+ Helix\n\t+ Twist\n |\n\n |\n| Consumerand home office | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Current | * IdeaPad\n\t+ Flex\n* Legion\n* Essential laptops\n* LaVie\n* Yoga\n |\n| Discontinued | * Lenovo 3000\n* IdeaPad\n\t+ S series\n\t+ U series\n\t+ Y series\n\t+ Z series\n\t+ Miix series\n* IdeaPad Yoga\n* Yoga\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Tablets | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiu led an initial public offering for Legend on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2015. The offering received regulatory approval in June of that year. Liu said in an interview that he planned to float Legend's stock on a domestic Chinese exchange before his retirement.[11]\n\n\nIn 2019, Liu Chuanzhi, the 75-year-old founder of Lenovo Group, has resigned as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of the world's largest personal computer supplier.[12]\n\n\n\n### Joyvio\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTheir first significant transaction, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon invested money in developing a circuit board that would allow IBM PCs to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. In 1990, Lenovo started to assemble and sell computers under its original brand name, Legend.[4][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Current | * Tablet 10\n* IdeaPad\n\t+ Miix series\n\t+ Yoga Tab series\n |\n| Discontinued | * ThinkPad\n\t+ ThinkPad 8\n\t+ ThinkPad 10\n\t+ Tablet\n\t+ Tablet 2\n\t+ X1 Tablet\n* WorkPad\n |\n\n |\n| Smartphonesand smartbooks | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Business | * ThinkPhone\n |\n| Consumer | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Current | * Lenovo Vibe\n\t+ K4 Note\n\t+ P1\n\t+ X\n\t+ Z\n\t+ Z2 Pro\n* Lenovo\n\t+ K6 Power\n\t+ K12\n\t\t- Pro\n\t\t- Note\n\t+ K13\n\t\t- Note\n\t+ P2\n\t+ Phab 2 Pro\n\t+ Lenovo Z Series\n\t\t- Z2 Plus\n* IdeaPhone\n\t+ K900\n\t+ A820\n* Legion Duel\n\t+ 2\n* LePhone\n |\n| Discontinued | * Skylight\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Other | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Software | * ThinkShield\n* ThinkVantage\n |\n| Technologies | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Current | * PrivacyGuard\n* ThinkShutter\n |\n| Discontinued | * UltraBay\n* ThinkLight\n |\n\n |\n| Displaysand television sets | * ThinkVision\n* LeTV\n |\n| Smart speakers | * Smart Assistant\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBusiness ethics were a key challenge for Liu in establishing and expanding Lenovo. Liu says that at first he behaved \"like a kind of dictator\" and spent much time yelling. He had five corrupt executives imprisoned. Being late for a meeting could be punished by having to stand in silence before the group, a punishment that Liu accepted three times himself. Lenovo's culture gradually changed and Liu was able to relax his authoritarian style. Lenovo became an employer of choice for Chinese engineers and managers with overseas education.[5]\n\n\n\n### Legend Holdings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Legend Holdings\n\nIn June 2012, Liu stepped down as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo. In the years just prior to his resignation, Liu focused on improving Legend's growth, building-up its core assets, and conducting a public stock offering between 2014 and 2016. Legend's major assets include Lenovo, Legend Capital, a real-estate venture called Raycom, Digital China, and Hony Capital.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Koenig, Neil (20 November 2012). \"CEO Guru: Dreams and ambitions\". *BBC News*.\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"10 most powerful businesspeople in China\".\n11. **^** Salvacion, Manny (8 June 2015). \"Legend Holding's $2B IPO Approved, Investor Listing to Begin\". *Yibada*.

Number one: After the acquisition, would clients buy from the new owner? Number two: Would employees continue to work for the new owner? Number three: Would there be potential conflicts between the Chinese management and the Western management?\"[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Chuanzhi Liu: Executive Profile & Biography - Businessweek\".

During this period many Chinese intellectuals felt that commerce was immoral and degrading. The fact that in the 1980s entrepreneurs were drawn from lower classes, and often dishonest as well, made the private sector even more unattractive. This was readily apparent to Liu and his collaborators due to their proximity to Zhongguancun, where the proliferation of fly-by-night electronics traders lead to the area being dubbed \"Swindlers Valley.\"[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLenovo became a publicly traded company after listing in Hong Kong in 1994, raising nearly US$30 million. Prior to Lenovo's IPO, many analysts were optimistic. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. During the first day of trading the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America, and Australia; expand and improve production and research and development; and increase working capital. Lenovo's Hong Kong and Mainland China business units conducted a merger and secondary offering in 1997.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" Lenovo's early difficulties were compounded by the fact that its staff had little business experience. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market,\" Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting—but also very dangerous,\" said Liu.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiu has been named \"Asian Businessman,\" one of the \"Global 25 Most Influential Business Leaders,\" and many other awards. He received Second National Technology Entrepreneurs Gold Award in 1990. He was named a Model Worker and Man of Reform in China, both in 1995. He was named one of the \"Ten Most Influential Men of the Commercial Sector\" in China in 1996. Liu was named one of the \"Stars of Asia\" by *BusinessWeek* magazine in 2000. In 2001, Liu was selected by *Time Magazine* as one of the \"25 Most Influential Global Executives.\" In 2012, *Forbes* named Liu one of the 10 most important business leaders in China.[10]\n\n\nLiu is a member of the China Entrepreneurs Club (CEC). The CEC was founded in 2006. Its purpose is to strengthen the sense of social responsibility among China's young entrepreneurs.[19]\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJoyvio announced on 30 March 2014 that it had acquired a 60 per cent share of Hangzhou Longguan Tea Industrial Company for about 30 million yuan or about US$4.83 million. Longguan was previously a fully state-owned enterprise operating under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Longguan produces Hangzhou's famous Longjing tea. The company had sales of 32.45 million yuan in 2012. According to the company's annual report it has been growing 40 to 50 per cent per year. Joyvio has taken over day-to-day control of Longguan. Liu Chuanzhi said he aims to bring innovation and commercial methods to the tea industry. Liu said that Joyvio would invest in other well-known tea brands and related products.[15]\n\n\n\n### Other positions\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2013, Liu served as a senior advisor at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.\n\n\n\n## Education and early career\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiu is married and has three children.

Young. He remained chairman of the executive committee until 1983, and then served as vice chairman of the board until 1987.\n\n\nA young Steve Jobs, then age 12,[6] called Hewlett (whose number was in the phone book) and requested any available parts for a frequency counter he was building. Hewlett, impressed with Jobs' initiative, offered him a summer job assembling frequency counters.[7] Jobs then considered HP one of the companies that he admired, regarding it among the handful of companies (Disney and Intel were the others) that were built “to last, not just to make money”.[8] Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple along with Jobs, unsuccessfully attempted five times to sell the Apple I computer to HP while working there. The early Apple computers were built with HP parts, under a legal release from HP.[9] Of the missed opportunity, Hewlett reportedly said, \"You win some, you lose some.\"[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHewlett attended undergraduate classes taught by Fred Terman at Stanford and became acquainted with David Packard. Packard and he began discussing forming a company in August 1937, and founded Hewlett-Packard Company as a partnership on January 1, 1939. A flip of a coin decided the ordering of their names.[3] Their first big breakthrough came when Disney purchased eight audio oscillators designed by Hewlett which were used for the production of the film *Fantasia*.[4]\n\n\nThe company incorporated in 1947 and tendered an initial public offering in 1957.[1] Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were proud of their company culture which came to be known as the HP Way. The HP Way is a corporate culture that claimed to be centered not only on making money but also on respecting and nurturing its employees.

In 1916 the family moved to San Francisco after his father, Albion Walter Hewlett, took a similar position at Stanford Medical School, located at the time in San Francisco. He attended Lowell High School and was the 1929-1930 Battalion Commander of the school's Army JROTC program. He was accepted at Stanford University as a favor to his late father who died of a brain tumor in 1925.[1]\n\n\nHewlett received his bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 1934, a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1936, and a post-masters engineering degree in electrical engineering from Stanford in 1939. He joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity during his time at Stanford. Hewlett also had dyslexia, which caused him to struggle with reading and taking notes.[2]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Hewlett-Packard\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCollections\n* William Hewlett Papers housed at Stanford University Libraries\n* Hewlett Collection at Agilent Technologies Company Archives Office Files, record boxes, speeches and subject files.\n\n\n\n\n| Business positions\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byDavid Packard\n |  **President of Hewlett-Packard** 1964–1977\n | Succeeded byJohn A.

In 1966, William Hewlett and his wife Flora founded the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which became one of the largest private foundations in the United States. Aside from the foundation Hewlett gave millions of dollars to universities, schools, museums, non-profit organizations and other organizations. Stanford University was a large recipient of his philanthropy.[12]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett married Flora Lamson in 1939, and had 5 children with her: Eleanor, Walter, James, William and Mary. They had 12 grandchildren. His wife died in 1977. In 1978, Hewlett married Rosemary Kopmeier Bradford.\n\n\nHe was a committed conservationist and avid outdoorsman. As an amateur photographer and botanist, he took many photographs and samples of wildflowers. Some of these were donated to the California Academy of Sciences.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1960s | 1964\nRoger Adams\n |\n| 1980s | 1982\nF.

Young. He remained chairman of the executive committee until 1983, and then served as vice chairman of the board until 1987.\n\n\nA young Steve Jobs, then age 12,[6] called Hewlett (whose number was in the phone book) and requested any available parts for a frequency counter he was building. Hewlett, impressed with Jobs' initiative, offered him a summer job assembling frequency counters.[7] Jobs then considered HP one of the companies that he admired, regarding it among the handful of companies (Disney and Intel were the others) that were built “to last, not just to make money”.[8] Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple along with Jobs, unsuccessfully attempted five times to sell the Apple I computer to HP while working there. The early Apple computers were built with HP parts, under a legal release from HP.[9] Of the missed opportunity, Hewlett reportedly said, \"You win some, you lose some.\"[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHewlett attended undergraduate classes taught by Fred Terman at Stanford and became acquainted with David Packard. Packard and he began discussing forming a company in August 1937, and founded Hewlett-Packard Company as a partnership on January 1, 1939. A flip of a coin decided the ordering of their names.[3] Their first big breakthrough came when Disney purchased eight audio oscillators designed by Hewlett which were used for the production of the film *Fantasia*.[4]\n\n\nThe company incorporated in 1947 and tendered an initial public offering in 1957.[1] Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were proud of their company culture which came to be known as the HP Way. The HP Way is a corporate culture that claimed to be centered not only on making money but also on respecting and nurturing its employees. Hewlett was president of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1954.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIEEE Founders Medal\n |\n| --- |\n| 1953–1975 | * David Sarnoff (1953)\n* Alfred Norton Goldsmith (1954)\n* *No award* (1955)\n* *No award* (1956)\n* Raymond A.

In 1916 the family moved to San Francisco after his father, Albion Walter Hewlett, took a similar position at Stanford Medical School, located at the time in San Francisco. He attended Lowell High School and was the 1929-1930 Battalion Commander of the school's Army JROTC program. He was accepted at Stanford University as a favor to his late father who died of a brain tumor in 1925.[1]\n\n\nHewlett received his bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 1934, a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1936, and a post-masters engineering degree in electrical engineering from Stanford in 1939. He joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity during his time at Stanford. Hewlett also had dyslexia, which caused him to struggle with reading and taking notes.[2]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Hewlett-Packard\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCollections\n* William Hewlett Papers housed at Stanford University Libraries\n* Hewlett Collection at Agilent Technologies Company Archives Office Files, record boxes, speeches and subject files.\n\n\n\n\n| Business positions\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byDavid Packard\n |  **President of Hewlett-Packard** 1964–1977\n | Succeeded byJohn A.

As an amateur photographer and botanist, he took many photographs and samples of wildflowers. Some of these were donated to the California Academy of Sciences.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1960s | 1964\nRoger Adams\n |\n| 1980s | 1982\nF.
