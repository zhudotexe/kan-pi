The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\n\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\n\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** E.g., in Didier, Robert & al. \"L'Empire de la Chine Archived October 29, 2013, at the Wayback Machine.\" Boudet (Paris), 1751.

The Yellow River's basin is often regarded as the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization.[5][6]\n\n\nThe yellow sediments were carried downstream from the Loess Plateau.[7] There are frequent devastating floods and course changes produced by the continual elevation of the river bed, sometimes above the level of its surrounding farm fields.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)At Lanzhou, Gansu\n![](image)At Shapotou, Ningxia\n![](image)Qiankun bend in Yonghe County\n![](image)At Luoyang, Henan\nThe Ordos Loop formed by an enormous twist of the Yellow River, beginning at Zhongning County in Ningxia and ending with a drastic eastward turn at its confluence with the Wei at Tongguan in Shaanxi.

At elevations over 4,290\u00a0m (14,070\u00a0ft) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide.

The Chinese refer to the river as \"the Mother River\" and \"the cradle of the Chinese civilization\".\nDuring the long history of China, the Yellow River has been considered a blessing as well as a curse and has been nicknamed both \"China's Pride\" and \"China's Sorrow\".[72]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** Elvin, Mark and Su Ninghu (1998). *The Influence of the Yellow River on Hangzhou Bay since AD 1000, chapter 10 in Elvin and Ts'ui-jung, Sediments of Time*.

Maximum demand for irrigation is needed between March and June. In order to capture excess water for use when needed and for flood control and electricity generation, several dams have been built, but their expected life is limited due to the high silt load. A proposed South\u2013North Water Transfer Project involves several schemes to divert water from the Yangtze River: one in the western headwaters of the rivers where they are closest to one another, another from the upper reaches of the Han River, and a third using the route of the old Grand Canal.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe valley section stretches from Longyang Gorge in Qinghai to Qingtong Gorge in Gansu. Steep cliffs line both sides of the river. The water bed is narrow and the average drop is large, so the flow in this section is extremely turbulent and fast. There are 20 gorges in this section, the most famous of these being the Longyang, Jishi, Liujia, Bapan, and Qingtong gorges. The flow conditions in this section makes it the best location for hydroelectric plants. The Yellow River exits Qinghai for the second and final time in these gorges and enters Gansu for the second time just before Liujia Gorge. Downstream from the Yanguo Gorge, the provincial capital of Lanzhou is built upon the Yellow River's banks.

The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\n\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\n\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** E.g., in Didier, Robert & al. \"L'Empire de la Chine Archived October 29, 2013, at the Wayback Machine.\" Boudet (Paris), 1751.

Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 35\u00b027\u203219\u2033N 90\u00b055\u203250\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff35.45528\u00b0N 90.93056\u00b0E\ufeff / 35.45528; 90.93056 |\n|  |\n|  |\n| 4th source | Muluwusu River |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 33\u00b022\u203213\u2033N 91\u00b010\u203229\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff33.37028\u00b0N 91.17472\u00b0E\ufeff / 33.37028; 91.17472 |\n|  |\n|  |\n| 5th source | Bi Qu |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 33\u00b016\u203258\u2033N 91\u00b023\u203229\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff33.28278\u00b0N 91.39139\u00b0E\ufeff / 33.28278; 91.39139 |\n|  |\n| Mouth | East China Sea |\n| \u2022\u00a0location\n | Shanghai and Jiangsu |\n| \u2022\u00a0coordinates\n | 31\u00b023\u203237\u2033N 121\u00b058\u203259\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff31.39361\u00b0N 121.98306\u00b0E\ufeff / 31.39361; 121.98306 |\n| Length | 6,300\u00a0km (3,900\u00a0mi)[1] |\n| Basin size | 1,808,500\u00a0km2 (698,300\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[2] |\n|  |\n| Discharge |  |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0average | 30,146\u00a0m3/s (1,064,600\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)[3] |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0minimum | 2,000\u00a0m3/s (71,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0maximum | 110,000\u00a0m3/s (3,900,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)[4][5] |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Discharge |  |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0location | Datong hydrometric station, Anhui (Uppermost boundary of the ocean tide) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0average | (Period: 1980\u20132020)905.7\u00a0km3/a (28,700\u00a0m3/s)[6]\n30,708\u00a0m3/s (1,084,400\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) (2019\u20132020)[7] |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHydroelectric dams on the Yangtze\n |\n| --- |\n| * Liyuan\n* Ahai\n* Jinanqiao\n* Longkaikou\n* Ludila\n* Guanyinyan\n* Wudongde\n* Baihetan\n* Xiluodu\n* Xiangjiaba\n* Three Gorges\n* Gezhouba\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* VIAF\n |\n| National | * Spain\n* France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Japan\n* Czech Republic\n |\n| Other | * NARA\n* IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The longest river in Asia and Eurasia\n2. The third-longest river in the world\n3. The longest river to flow entirely within one country (China)\n\nKey facts:\n- Length: 6,300 km (3,915 mi)\n- Source: Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau\n- Mouth: East China Sea\n- Average discharge: 30,146 m\u00b3/s\n- Basin size: 1,808,500 km\u00b2\n\nThe river:\n- Flows through 8 provinces: Qinghai, Yunnan, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu\n- Passes through 2 major municipalities: Chongqing and Shanghai\n- Flows through the Tibet Autonomous Region\n- Has over 700 tributaries\n- Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of China's land area\n- Is home to nearly one-third of China's population\n\nMajor features:\n- The Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest power station by installed capacity (22.5 GW), is located on the Yangtze\n- Four of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze\n- The river is traditionally divided into three sections:\n  1. Upstream: Yibin to Yichang\n  2. Middle: Yichang to Hukou County\n  3. Downstream: Hukou to Shanghai\n\nThe river faces environmental challenges, including being one of the major contributors to ocean plastic pollution globally.",
