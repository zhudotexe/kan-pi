In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1.

As a megacity, Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai.[12] It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions by total assets.[13] It is also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic (Asia's busiest) since 2010,[14] and, as of 2016[update], the city's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Beijing** (/be\u026a\u02c8d\u0292\u026a\u014b/ *bay-JING*;[5][6] Chinese: \u5317\u4eac; pinyin: *B\u011bij\u012bng*; Mandarin pronunciation: [pe\u0300\u026a.t\u0255i\u0301\u014b] \u24d8), alternatively romanized as **Peking**[7] (/pi\u02d0\u02c8k\u026a\u014b/ *pee-KING*),[8] is the capital of the People's Republic of China.

The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates.[19] Beijing is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)Definitions from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Textbooks from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)Resources from Wikiversity\n* ![](image)Travel information from Wikivoyage\n\n* Economic profile for Beijing at HKTDC\n* Visit Beijing \u2013 official Facebook page\n* Photograph of *The approach to Peking \u2013 outside the walls* taken in 1890 by Sir Henry Norman\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byLin'an (Song dynasty)\n |  **Capital of China (as Dadu of Yuan)** 1264\u20131368\n | Succeeded\u00a0byNanjing (Ming dynasty)\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byNanjing (Ming dynasty)\n |  **Capital of China** 1420\u20131928\n | Succeeded\u00a0byNanjing (ROC)\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byNanjing (ROC)\n |  **Capital of the People's Republic of China** 1949\u2013present\n | Succeeded\u00a0bypresent capital\n |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBeijing\n |\n| --- |\n| * History\n* Politics\n* Geography\n* Toponym\n |\n| Administration | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Direct-administered municipalities | * Beijing\n* Tianjin\n* Shanghai\n* Chongqing\n |\n| Special administrative regions | * Hong Kong\n* Macau\n |\n\n |\n| *See also:* *List of prefectures in China*, *List of cities in China*\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMetropolitan cities of China\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Major metropolitan regions\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Jing-Jin-Ji (BJ-TJ-HE)\n* Greater Bay Area\n* Yangtze Delta (SH-JS-ZJ)\n* Zhongyuan\n* Chengyu\n* Cross-Strait Western Coast\n* Guanzhong\n* Mid-Southern Liaoning\n* Shandong Peninsula\n* Yangtze River Midstream (Yangtze River Valley)\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Major cities\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2021, Beijing was ranked first globally in terms of \"*Global City Competitiveness*\" in the *2020\u20132021 Global Urban Competitiveness Report* jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the United Nations Programme for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat).[137]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** \"Beijing\". *World Book Encyclopedia*. 2008.
