Humanism was represented at Heidelberg University particularly by the founder of the older German Humanistic School Rudolph Agricola, Conrad Celtes, Jakob Wimpfeling, and Johann Reuchlin. Æneas Silvius Piccolomini was chancellor of the university in his capacity as provost of Worms, and later always favored it with his friendship and good-will as Pope Pius II. In 1482, Pope Sixtus IV permitted laymen and married men to be appointed professors in the ordinary of medicine through a papal dispensation. In 1553, Pope Julius III sanctioned the allotment of ecclesiastical benefices to secular professors.[27]\n\n\n\n### Reformation and modern era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Moritz, Werner (2001). \"Die Aberkennung des Doktortitels an der Universität Heidelberg während der NS- Zeit\".

After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of Liberalism and the movement in favor of German national unity.[28] The historians Friedrich Christoph Schlosser and Georg Gottfried Gervinus were the guides of the nation in political history. The modern scientific schools of medicine and natural science, particularly astronomy, were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school.[31] The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American liberal arts colleges into research universities, in particular for the then-newly established Johns Hopkins University.[32] Heidelberg's professors were important supporters of the Vormärz revolution and many of them were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Runde, Ingo (2018). \"Universitätsreformen in Heidelberg – Überlieferung und Erschließung\". *Universität – Reform.

Humanism was represented at Heidelberg University particularly by the founder of the older German Humanistic School Rudolph Agricola, Conrad Celtes, Jakob Wimpfeling, and Johann Reuchlin. Æneas Silvius Piccolomini was chancellor of the university in his capacity as provost of Worms, and later always favored it with his friendship and good-will as Pope Pius II. In 1482, Pope Sixtus IV permitted laymen and married men to be appointed professors in the ordinary of medicine through a papal dispensation. In 1553, Pope Julius III sanctioned the allotment of ecclesiastical benefices to secular professors.[27]\n\n\n\n### Reformation and modern era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Moritz, Werner (2001). \"Die Aberkennung des Doktortitels an der Universität Heidelberg während der NS- Zeit\".

After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of Liberalism and the movement in favor of German national unity.[28] The historians Friedrich Christoph Schlosser and Georg Gottfried Gervinus were the guides of the nation in political history. The modern scientific schools of medicine and natural science, particularly astronomy, were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school.[31] The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American liberal arts colleges into research universities, in particular for the then-newly established Johns Hopkins University.[32] Heidelberg's professors were important supporters of the Vormärz revolution and many of them were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Runde, Ingo (2018). \"Universitätsreformen in Heidelberg – Überlieferung und Erschließung\". *Universität – Reform.

Its first rector was Johannes Otto von Münsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages).

The *Alma mater Lipsiensis* opened in 1409, after it had been officially chartered by Pope Alexander V in his *Bull of Acknowledgment* on (9 September of that year). Its first rector was Johannes Otto von Münsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bonn\n* Cologne\n* TU Dortmund\n* Duisburg-Essen\n* Düsseldorf\n* Hagen\n* Münster\n* Paderborn\n* Siegen\n* Witten/Herdecke\n* Wuppertal\n |\n| Rhineland-Palatinate | * University of Kaiserslautern-Landau\n* University of Koblenz\n* Mainz\n* Speyer\n* Trier\n |\n| Saarland | * Saarland\n |\n| Saxony | * TU Chemnitz\n* TU Dresden\n* TU Freiberg\n* Leipzig\n |\n| Saxony-Anhalt | * Halle-Wittenberg\n* Magdeburg\n |\n| Schleswig-Holstein | * Flensburg\n* Kiel\n* Lübeck\n |\n| Thuringia | * Erfurt\n* TU Ilmenau\n* Jena\n* Weimar\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGerman U15\n |\n| --- |\n| * Free University of Berlin (FU Berlin)\n* Humboldt University Berlin (HU Berlin)\n* University of Bonn\n* University of Cologne\n* University of Freiburg\n* Goethe University Frankfurt\n* University of Göttingen\n* University of Hamburg (UHH)\n* Heidelberg University\n* Leipzig University\n* University of Mainz\n* Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)\n* University of Münster (WWU)\n* University of Tübingen\n* University of Würzburg\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university was kept open throughout World War II, even after the destruction of its buildings. During the war the acting rector, Erich Maschke, described the continuation of the university in a memo on 11 May 1945, announcing the vote for a new rector:\n\n\n\n\n> Since 4 December 1943 a fixed determination not to abandon the Leipzig University in the most difficult hour of its more than five-hundred-year history has bonded the professors with each other and with the students. The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage. After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone. This is what must be preserved as the great repository of value in the university.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the first centuries, the university grew slowly and was a rather regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world-class institution of higher education and research.[*citation needed*] At the end of the 19th century, important scholars such as Bernhard Windscheid (one of the fathers of the German Civil Code) and Wilhelm Ostwald (viewed as a founder of modern physical chemistry) taught at Leipzig.\n\n\n\n![](image)Formerly organized as a collegiate university, the Red College of Leipzig University was established in the 16th century.\nLeipzig University was one of the first German universities to allow women to register as \"guest students\".[3] At its general assembly in 1873, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein [de] thanked the University of Leipzig and Prague for allowing women to attend as guest students.

In 1948 the freely elected student council was disbanded and replaced by Free German Youth members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, Herbert Belter, was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The German Democratic Republic was created in 1949, and in 1953 for Karl Marx Year the university was renamed by its government the **Karl Marx University, Leipzig** after Karl Marx. In 1968, the partly damaged Augusteum, including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact Paulinerkirche, were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity in Leipzig, Germany\n\n\n\nLeipzig University| Universität Leipzig\n |\n| ![](image)Seal of Leipzig University\n |\n| Latin: *Universitas Lipsiensis* |\n| Motto | Aus Tradition Grenzen überschreiten (German)\n |\n| Motto in English\n | Crossing boundaries out of tradition |\n| Type | Public research university |\n| Established | 2 December 1409; 614 years ago (1409-12-02) |\n| Budget | € 408.9 million[1] |\n| Rector | Eva Inés Obergfell |\n| Academic staff\n | 3,234[1] |\n| Administrative staff\n | 1,962[1] |\n| Students | 29,459[2] |\n| Location | Leipzig\n, Saxony\n, Germany\n51°20′20″N 12°22′43″E﻿ / ﻿51.33889°N 12.37861°E﻿ / 51.33889; 12.37861 |\n| Campus | Urban |\n| Colours |   Red \n   Light Blue |\n| Affiliations | Utrecht NetworkGerman U15 |\n| Website | www.uni-leipzig.de |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website of Leipzig University\n* History of the Leipzig University\n* Herbermann, Charles, ed.
