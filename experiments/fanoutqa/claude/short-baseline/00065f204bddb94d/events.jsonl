If my wounds have no beauty to the beholder's eye, they are, at least, honorable in the estimation of those who know where they were received\".[27]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra** (Spanish: [miˈɣel de θeɾˈβantes saaˈβeðɾa]; 29 September 1547 (assumed) – 22 April 1616 NS)[5] was an Early Modern Spanish writer widely regarded as the greatest writer in the Spanish language and one of the world's pre-eminent novelists. He is best known for his novel *Don Quixote*, a work often cited as both the first modern novel[6][7] and \"the first great novel of world literature\".[8] A 2002 poll of around 100 well-known authors[b] voted it the \"most meaningful book of all time\",[9] from among the \"best and most central works in world literature\".[8]\n\n\nMuch of his life was spent in poverty and obscurity, which led to many of his early works being lost. Despite this, his influence and literary contribution are reflected by the fact that Spanish is often referred to as \"the language of Cervantes\".[10]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled *Exemplary Novels*. This was followed by *Viaje del Parnaso*, *Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes*, and *Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda*, completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\n\nCervantes was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century. The literary editor John Bowle argued that Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.[66] However, *Don Quixote* has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author Carlos Fuentes suggested that Cervantes and his contemporary William Shakespeare form part of a narrative tradition that includes Homer, Dante, Defoe, Dickens, Balzac, and Joyce.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis first significant novel, titled *La Galatea*, was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, and later as a government tax collector. Part One of *Don Quixote* was published in 1605, and Part Two in 1615. Other works include the 12 *Novelas ejemplares* (*Exemplary Novels*); a long poem, the *Viaje del Parnaso* (*Journey to Parnassus*); and *Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses* (*Eight Plays and Eight Interludes*). *Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda* (*The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda*), was published posthumously in 1616.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In *Don Quixote*, he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' chivalric romances.[62] His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of Philip IV on 8 April.[46]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lokos, Ellen (2016).

It has been suggested that not only Cervantes's father but also his mother may have been New Christians.[13][14][15] Anthony Cascardi writes, \"While the family might have had some claim to nobility they often found themselves in financial straits. Moreover, they may have been of converso origin, that is, converts to Catholicism of Jewish ancestry. In the Spain of Cervantes's days, this meant living under clouds of official suspicion and social mistrust, with far more limited opportunities than were enjoyed by members of the 'Old Christian' caste.\"[16]\n\n\nIt is generally accepted Miguel de Cervantes was born around 29 September 1547, in Alcalá de Henares. He was the second son of barber-surgeon Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (c. 1520–1593).[17] Rodrigo came from Córdoba, Andalusia, where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.\n\n\n\n### 1547 to 1566: Early years\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** Chacón y Calvo, José María (1947–1948). \"Retratos de Cervantes\". *Anales de la Academia Nacional de Artes y Letras* (in Spanish). **27**: 5–17.\n2. **^** Ferrari, Enrique Lafuente (1948). *La novela ejemplar de los retratos de Cervantes* (in Spanish).

If my wounds have no beauty to the beholder's eye, they are, at least, honorable in the estimation of those who know where they were received\".[27]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra** (Spanish: [miˈɣel de θeɾˈβantes saaˈβeðɾa]; 29 September 1547 (assumed) – 22 April 1616 NS)[5] was an Early Modern Spanish writer widely regarded as the greatest writer in the Spanish language and one of the world's pre-eminent novelists. He is best known for his novel *Don Quixote*, a work often cited as both the first modern novel[6][7] and \"the first great novel of world literature\".[8] A 2002 poll of around 100 well-known authors[b] voted it the \"most meaningful book of all time\",[9] from among the \"best and most central works in world literature\".[8]\n\n\nMuch of his life was spent in poverty and obscurity, which led to many of his early works being lost. Despite this, his influence and literary contribution are reflected by the fact that Spanish is often referred to as \"the language of Cervantes\".[10]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled *Exemplary Novels*. This was followed by *Viaje del Parnaso*, *Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes*, and *Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda*, completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\n\nCervantes was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century. The literary editor John Bowle argued that Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.[66] However, *Don Quixote* has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author Carlos Fuentes suggested that Cervantes and his contemporary William Shakespeare form part of a narrative tradition that includes Homer, Dante, Defoe, Dickens, Balzac, and Joyce.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis first significant novel, titled *La Galatea*, was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, and later as a government tax collector. Part One of *Don Quixote* was published in 1605, and Part Two in 1615. Other works include the 12 *Novelas ejemplares* (*Exemplary Novels*); a long poem, the *Viaje del Parnaso* (*Journey to Parnassus*); and *Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses* (*Eight Plays and Eight Interludes*). *Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda* (*The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda*), was published posthumously in 1616.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In *Don Quixote*, he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' chivalric romances.[62] His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of Philip IV on 8 April.[46]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lokos, Ellen (2016).

It has been suggested that not only Cervantes's father but also his mother may have been New Christians.[13][14][15] Anthony Cascardi writes, \"While the family might have had some claim to nobility they often found themselves in financial straits. Moreover, they may have been of converso origin, that is, converts to Catholicism of Jewish ancestry. In the Spain of Cervantes's days, this meant living under clouds of official suspicion and social mistrust, with far more limited opportunities than were enjoyed by members of the 'Old Christian' caste.\"[16]\n\n\nIt is generally accepted Miguel de Cervantes was born around 29 September 1547, in Alcalá de Henares. He was the second son of barber-surgeon Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (c. 1520–1593).[17] Rodrigo came from Córdoba, Andalusia, where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.\n\n\n\n### 1547 to 1566: Early years\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** Chacón y Calvo, José María (1947–1948). \"Retratos de Cervantes\". *Anales de la Academia Nacional de Artes y Letras* (in Spanish). **27**: 5–17.\n2. **^** Ferrari, Enrique Lafuente (1948). *La novela ejemplar de los retratos de Cervantes* (in Spanish).

His works have never gone out of print,[216] and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema,[217] with at least 200 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens's works documented.[218] Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime – early productions included *The Haunted Man* which was performed in the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1848 – and, as early as 1901, the British silent film *Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost* was made by Walter R. Booth.[219] Contemporaries such as publisher Edward Lloyd cashed in on Dickens's popularity with cheap imitations of his novels, resulting in his own popular 'penny dreadfuls'.[220]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn the creation of modern mass culture, Nicholas Dames in *The Atlantic* writes, \"'Literature' is not a big enough category for *Pickwick*. It defined its own, a new one that we have learned to call 'entertainment'.\"[53] In November 1836, Dickens accepted the position of editor of *Bentley's Miscellany*, a position he held for three years, until he fell out with the owner.[54] In 1836, as he finished the last instalments of *The Pickwick Papers*, he began writing the beginning instalments of *Oliver Twist* – writing as many as 90 pages a month – while continuing work on *Bentley's* and also writing four plays, the production of which he oversaw. *Oliver Twist*, published in 1838, became one of Dickens's better known stories and was the first Victorian novel with a child protagonist.[55]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis 1843 novella *A Christmas Carol* remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every creative medium. *Oliver Twist* and *Great Expectations* are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel *A Tale of Two Cities* (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.[10] The term *Dickensian* is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dickens family\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n238. **^** \"Dickens on screen: the highs and the lows\". *The Guardian*.

Booth.[219] Contemporaries such as publisher Edward Lloyd cashed in on Dickens's popularity with cheap imitations of his novels, resulting in his own popular 'penny dreadfuls'.[220]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn the creation of modern mass culture, Nicholas Dames in *The Atlantic* writes, \"'Literature' is not a big enough category for *Pickwick*. It defined its own, a new one that we have learned to call 'entertainment'.\"[53] In November 1836, Dickens accepted the position of editor of *Bentley's Miscellany*, a position he held for three years, until he fell out with the owner.[54] In 1836, as he finished the last instalments of *The Pickwick Papers*, he began writing the beginning instalments of *Oliver Twist* – writing as many as 90 pages a month – while continuing work on *Bentley's* and also writing four plays, the production of which he oversaw. *Oliver Twist*, published in 1838, became one of Dickens's better known stories and was the first Victorian novel with a child protagonist.[55]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis 1843 novella *A Christmas Carol* remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every creative medium. *Oliver Twist* and *Great Expectations* are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel *A Tale of Two Cities* (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.[10] The term *Dickensian* is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dickens family\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n238. **^** \"Dickens on screen: the highs and the lows\". *The Guardian*.
