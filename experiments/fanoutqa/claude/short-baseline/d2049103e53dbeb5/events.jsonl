Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics. London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics.

In the first stage, any city in the world may submit an application to become a host city. After 10 months, the Executive Board of the IOC decides which applicant cities will become official candidates as based on the recommendation of a working group that reviews the applications. In a second stage, the candidate cities are investigated thoroughly by an Evaluation Commission, which then submits a final short list of cities to be considered for selection. The host city is then chosen by vote of the IOC session, a general meeting of IOC members.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Olympic Games host cities[edit]\n\n\n### Host cities for Summer and Winter Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\nKey\n  †   Cancelled\n  §   Postponed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nList of cities that hosted multiple editions of the Olympic Games\n| Rank\n | City\n | Country\n | Region\n | Summer Olympics\n | Winter Olympics\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | London | ![](image) United Kingdom | Europe\n | 3 (1908, 1948, 2012)\n |  | 3\n |\n| Paris | ![](image) France | 3 (1900, 1924, *2024*)\n |  |\n| Los Angeles | ![](image) United States | America\n | 3 (1932, 1984, *2028*)\n |  |\n| 4\n | Athens | ![](image) Greece | Europe\n | 2 (1896, 2004)\n |  | 2\n |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | Asia\n | 2 (1964, 2020)\n |  |\n| Beijing | ![](image) China | 1 (2008)\n | 1 (2022)\n |\n| St. Moritz | ![](image)  Switzerland | Europe\n |  | 2 (1928, 1948)\n |\n| Innsbruck | ![](image) Austria |  | 2 (1964, 1976)\n |\n| Lake Placid | ![](image) United States | America\n |  | 2 (1932, 1980)\n |\n| Cortina d'Ampezzo | ![](image) Italy | Europe\n |  | 2 (1956, *2026*)\n |\n\n\n## Number of Olympic Games by country[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of countries ranked by the number of times they hosted the Olympic Games\n| Rank\n | First Year\n | Last Year\n | Country\n | Region\n | Summer Olympics\n | Winter Olympics\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1904 | *2028* | ![](image) United States | North America\n | 5 (1904, 1932, 1984, 1996, *2028*)\n | 4 (1932, 1960, 1980, 2002)\n | 9\n |\n| 2\n | 1900 | *2024* | ![](image) France | Europe\n | 3 (1900, 1924, *2024*)\n | 3 (1924, 1968, 1992)\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | 1956 | *2026* | ![](image) Italy | 1 (1960)\n | 3 (~~1944~~, 1956, 2006, *2026*)\n | 4\n |\n| 1964 | 2020 | ![](image) Japan | Asia\n | 2 (~~1940~~, 1964, 2020)\n | 2 (~~1940~~, 1972, 1998)\n |\n| 5\n | 1956 | *2032* | ![](image) Australia | Oceania\n | 3 (1956, 2000, *2032)* |  | 3\n |\n| 1908 | 2012 | ![](image) United Kingdom | Europe\n | 3 (1908, ~~1944~~, 1948, 2012)\n |  |\n| 1976 | 2010 | ![](image) Canada | North America\n | 1 (1976)\n | 2 (1988, 2010)\n |\n| 1936 | 1972 | ![](image) Germany | Europe\n | 2 (~~1916~~, 1936, 1972)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games, both summer and winter, since the modern Olympics began in 1896. Since then, summer and winter games have usually celebrated a four-year period known as an Olympiad; summer and winter games normally held in staggered even years. There have been 29 Summer Olympic Games held in 21 cities, and 24 Winter Olympic Games held in 21 cities. In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Sapporo–Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) and Tokyo–Helsinki (summer) in 1940; and Cortina d'Ampezzo (winter) and London (summer) in 1944.

Other major geographic regions which have never hosted the Olympics include the Middle East, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, Central America and the Caribbean.

Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics. London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics.

In the first stage, any city in the world may submit an application to become a host city. After 10 months, the Executive Board of the IOC decides which applicant cities will become official candidates as based on the recommendation of a working group that reviews the applications. In a second stage, the candidate cities are investigated thoroughly by an Evaluation Commission, which then submits a final short list of cities to be considered for selection. The host city is then chosen by vote of the IOC session, a general meeting of IOC members.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Olympic Games host cities[edit]\n\n\n### Host cities for Summer and Winter Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\nKey\n  †   Cancelled\n  §   Postponed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nList of cities that hosted multiple editions of the Olympic Games\n| Rank\n | City\n | Country\n | Region\n | Summer Olympics\n | Winter Olympics\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | London | ![](image) United Kingdom | Europe\n | 3 (1908, 1948, 2012)\n |  | 3\n |\n| Paris | ![](image) France | 3 (1900, 1924, *2024*)\n |  |\n| Los Angeles | ![](image) United States | America\n | 3 (1932, 1984, *2028*)\n |  |\n| 4\n | Athens | ![](image) Greece | Europe\n | 2 (1896, 2004)\n |  | 2\n |\n| Tokyo | ![](image) Japan | Asia\n | 2 (1964, 2020)\n |  |\n| Beijing | ![](image) China | 1 (2008)\n | 1 (2022)\n |\n| St. Moritz | ![](image)  Switzerland | Europe\n |  | 2 (1928, 1948)\n |\n| Innsbruck | ![](image) Austria |  | 2 (1964, 1976)\n |\n| Lake Placid | ![](image) United States | America\n |  | 2 (1932, 1980)\n |\n| Cortina d'Ampezzo | ![](image) Italy | Europe\n |  | 2 (1956, *2026*)\n |\n\n\n## Number of Olympic Games by country[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of countries ranked by the number of times they hosted the Olympic Games\n| Rank\n | First Year\n | Last Year\n | Country\n | Region\n | Summer Olympics\n | Winter Olympics\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1904 | *2028* | ![](image) United States | North America\n | 5 (1904, 1932, 1984, 1996, *2028*)\n | 4 (1932, 1960, 1980, 2002)\n | 9\n |\n| 2\n | 1900 | *2024* | ![](image) France | Europe\n | 3 (1900, 1924, *2024*)\n | 3 (1924, 1968, 1992)\n | 6\n |\n| 3\n | 1956 | *2026* | ![](image) Italy | 1 (1960)\n | 3 (~~1944~~, 1956, 2006, *2026*)\n | 4\n |\n| 1964 | 2020 | ![](image) Japan | Asia\n | 2 (~~1940~~, 1964, 2020)\n | 2 (~~1940~~, 1972, 1998)\n |\n| 5\n | 1956 | *2032* | ![](image) Australia | Oceania\n | 3 (1956, 2000, *2032)* |  | 3\n |\n| 1908 | 2012 | ![](image) United Kingdom | Europe\n | 3 (1908, ~~1944~~, 1948, 2012)\n |  |\n| 1976 | 2010 | ![](image) Canada | North America\n | 1 (1976)\n | 2 (1988, 2010)\n |\n| 1936 | 1972 | ![](image) Germany | Europe\n | 2 (~~1916~~, 1936, 1972)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games, both summer and winter, since the modern Olympics began in 1896. Since then, summer and winter games have usually celebrated a four-year period known as an Olympiad; summer and winter games normally held in staggered even years. There have been 29 Summer Olympic Games held in 21 cities, and 24 Winter Olympic Games held in 21 cities. In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Sapporo–Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) and Tokyo–Helsinki (summer) in 1940; and Cortina d'Ampezzo (winter) and London (summer) in 1944. The 1906 Intercalated Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **2014:** ![Russia](image) Sochi\n* **2018:** ![South Korea](image) Pyeongchang\n* **2022:** ![China](image) Beijing\n* ***2026*:** ![Italy](image) *Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo*\n |\n| [c1] Cancelled due to World War II\n![](image) Olympic Games portal\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOlympic Games\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Olympic sports**\n* **Olympism**\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Games have primarily been hosted in the regions of Europe (30 editions) and the Americas (13 editions); eight Games have been hosted in Asia and two have been hosted in Oceania.

Other major geographic regions which have never hosted the Olympics include the Middle East, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, Central America and the Caribbean.
