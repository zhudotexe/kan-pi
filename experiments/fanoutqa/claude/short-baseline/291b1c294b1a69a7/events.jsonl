The 80,000-seat Stade de France, built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, is located just north of Paris in the commune of Saint-Denis.[272] It is used for football, rugby union and track and field athletics. It hosts the France national football team for friendlies and major tournaments qualifiers, annually hosts the French national rugby team's home matches of the Six Nations Championship, and hosts several important matches of the Stade Français rugby team.[272] In addition to Paris Saint-Germain F.C., the city has a number of other professional and amateur football clubs: Paris FC, Red Star, RCF Paris and Stade Français Paris.\n\n\nParis hosted the 1900 and 1924 Summer Olympics and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCities in France by population\n |\n| --- |\n| 2,000,000+ | * Paris\n |\n| 500,000+ | * Marseille\n* Lyon\n* Toulouse\n |\n| 200,000+ | * Nice\n* Nantes\n* Montpellier\n* Strasbourg\n* Bordeaux\n* Lille\n* Rennes\n |\n| 100,000+ | * Toulon\n* Reims\n* Saint-Étienne\n* Le Havre\n* Dijon\n* Grenoble\n* Angers\n* Villeurbanne\n* Saint-Denis, Réunion\n* Nîmes\n* Aix-en-Provence\n* Clermont-Ferrand\n* Le Mans\n* Brest\n* Tours\n* Amiens\n* Annecy\n* Limoges\n* Metz\n* Boulogne-Billancourt\n* Perpignan\n* Besançon\n* Orléans\n* Rouen\n* Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis\n* Montreuil\n* Caen\n* Argenteuil\n* Mulhouse\n* Saint-Paul\n* Nancy\n |\n| * Complete list\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city also hosted the finals of the 1938 FIFA World Cup (at the Stade Olympique de Colombes), as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final (both at the Stade de France).

Eurostat places Paris (6.5 million people) behind London (8 million) and ahead of Berlin (3.5 million), based on the 2012 populations of what Eurostat calls \"urban audit core cities\".[157]\nThe population of Paris today is lower than its historical peak of 2.9 million in 1921.[158] The principal reasons were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included de-industrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss came to a temporary halt at the beginning of the 21st century; the population increased from 2,125,246 in 1999 to 2,240,621 in 2012, before declining again slightly in 2017, 2018, and again in 2021.[159][160]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Répertoire national des élus: les maires\" (in French). data.gouv.fr, Plateforme ouverte des données publiques françaises. 16 December 2022.

According to INSEE, the population has dropped by 122,919, or about five percent, over the past decade. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, declared that this illustrated the \"de-densification\" of the city, creating more green space and less crowding.[153][154] Despite the drop, Paris remains the most densely-populated city in Europe, with 252 residents per hectare, not counting parks.[155] This drop was attributed partly to a lower birth rate, the departure of middle-class residents and the possible loss of housing in the city due to short-term rentals for tourism.[156]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01NqDVLvrE4bp3YMQP2QNshZ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
