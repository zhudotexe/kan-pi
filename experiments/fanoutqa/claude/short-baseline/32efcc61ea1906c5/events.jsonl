After underspending its competition in marketing and product development, Kellogg's US market share hit a low of 36.7% in 1983. A prominent Wall Street analyst called it \"a fine company that's past its prime\" and the cereal market was being regarded as \"mature\". Such comments stimulated Kellogg chairman William E. LaMothe to improve, which primarily involved approaching the demographic of 80 million baby boomers rather than marketing children-oriented cereals. In emphasizing cereal's convenience and nutritional value, Kellogg's helped persuade U.S. consumers aged 25 to 49 to eat 26% more cereal than people of that age ate five years prior.

John, who resented his brother's success, filed suit against Will's company in 1906 for the right to use the family name. The resulting legal battle, which included a trial that lasted an entire month, ended in December 1920 when the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in Will's favor.[11]\n\n\nIn 1931, the Kellogg Company announced that most of its factories would shift towards 30-hour work weeks from the usual 40. W.K. Kellogg stated that he did this so that an additional shift of workers would be employed to support people through the depression era. This practice remained until World War II and continued briefly after the war, although some departments and factories remained locked into 30-hour work weeks until 1980.[12]\n\n\nIn 1964, Kellogg's introduced its first non-cereal product.

Kellogg assisted his brother in research to improve the vegetarian diet of the Battle Creek Sanitarium's patients, especially in the search for wheat-based granola. The Kelloggs are best known for the invention of the famous breakfast cereal corn flakes. The development of the flaked cereal in 1894 has been variously described by those involved: Ella Eaton Kellogg, John Harvey Kellogg, his younger brother Will Keith Kellogg, and other family members. There is considerable disagreement over who was involved in the discovery, and the role that they played.[7] It is generally agreed that upon being called out one night, John Kellogg left a batch of wheat-berry dough behind. Rather than throwing it out the following day, he sent it through the rollers and was surprised to obtain delicate flakes, which could then be baked.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Corn Soya cereal\n* Crunchy Loggs[69]\n* Double Dip Crunch[62]\n* Eggo Waf-Fulls\n* Frosted Krispies\n* Frosted Rice: This was a combination of Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies, using Rice Krispies with frosting on them.

From 1969 to 1977, Kellogg's acquired various small businesses, including Salada Tea, Fearn International, Mrs. Smith's Pies, Eggo, and Pure Packed Foods;[14] however, it was later criticized for not diversifying further like General Mills and Quaker Oats were. After underspending its competition in marketing and product development, Kellogg's US market share hit a low of 36.7% in 1983. A prominent Wall Street analyst called it \"a fine company that's past its prime\" and the cereal market was being regarded as \"mature\". Such comments stimulated Kellogg chairman William E. LaMothe to improve, which primarily involved approaching the demographic of 80 million baby boomers rather than marketing children-oriented cereals. In emphasizing cereal's convenience and nutritional value, Kellogg's helped persuade U.S. consumers aged 25 to 49 to eat 26% more cereal than people of that age ate five years prior.

The marketing strategy that he established has produced thousands of different cereal box prizes that have been distributed by the tens of billions.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Children's premiums[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1909, Kellogg's Corn Flakes had the first cereal premium with *The Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Book.* The book was originally available as a prize that was given to the customer in the store with the purchase of two packages of the cereal.[90] But in 1909, Kellogg's changed the book giveaway to a premium mail-in offer for the cost of a dime.

John, who resented his brother's success, filed suit against Will's company in 1906 for the right to use the family name. The resulting legal battle, which included a trial that lasted an entire month, ended in December 1920 when the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in Will's favor.[11]\n\n\nIn 1931, the Kellogg Company announced that most of its factories would shift towards 30-hour work weeks from the usual 40. W.K. Kellogg stated that he did this so that an additional shift of workers would be employed to support people through the depression era. This practice remained until World War II and continued briefly after the war, although some departments and factories remained locked into 30-hour work weeks until 1980.[12]\n\n\nIn 1964, Kellogg's introduced its first non-cereal product. A pastry which can be heated in a toaster called Pop-Tarts.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Olmo, Guillermo D.

Kellogg assisted his brother in research to improve the vegetarian diet of the Battle Creek Sanitarium's patients, especially in the search for wheat-based granola. The Kelloggs are best known for the invention of the famous breakfast cereal corn flakes. The development of the flaked cereal in 1894 has been variously described by those involved: Ella Eaton Kellogg, John Harvey Kellogg, his younger brother Will Keith Kellogg, and other family members. There is considerable disagreement over who was involved in the discovery, and the role that they played.[7] It is generally agreed that upon being called out one night, John Kellogg left a batch of wheat-berry dough behind. Rather than throwing it out the following day, he sent it through the rollers and was surprised to obtain delicate flakes, which could then be baked.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Corn Soya cereal\n* Crunchy Loggs[69]\n* Double Dip Crunch[62]\n* Eggo Waf-Fulls\n* Frosted Krispies\n* Frosted Rice: This was a combination of Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies, using Rice Krispies with frosting on them.

However, he succeeded and in 1874 built an even larger Washburn \"A\" Mill. The original \"A\" mill complex was destroyed, along with several nearby buildings, in a flour explosion in 1878, but was later rebuilt.[7] In 1877, Washburn teamed with John Crosby to form the Washburn-Crosby Company. At the same time, Washburn sent William Hood Dunwoody to England to open that market for spring wheat.[8] Successful, Dunwoody became a silent partner and went on to become one of the wealthiest millers in the world. Dunwoody became a philanthropist endowing hospitals, educational facilities which became Dunwoody College of Technology, and a charitable home which ultimately became Dunwoody Village.[*citation needed*] The corporation eventually became known as General Mills.[8]\n\n\n\n## Politics and military career\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Cadwallader Colden Washburn** (April 22, 1818 – May 14, 1882) was an American businessman, politician, and soldier who founded a mill that later became General Mills.

In 1871 he formed the La Crosse Lumber Company, which eventually sawed 20,000,000 board feet of lumber annually. He also had the largest shingle mill in the upper Mississippi valley.[6]\n\n\n\n### Flour\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1844, Washburn formed a partnership with land agent Cyrus Woodman. Together the two men developed a number of companies, such as the Wisconsin Mining Company. The most successful business venture undertaken by the men was land acquisition. In May 1855 they established Washburn's and Woodman's Mineral Point Bank. Washburn and Woodman dissolved their partnership amicably in 1855.\n\n\n\n### Minneapolis Mill Company\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1856, the Minneapolis Mill Company was chartered by the Minnesota territorial legislature. Among the incorporators were Washburn's cousin Dorilus Morrison, and Robert Smith, an Illinois congressman who had acquired the rights to the water power at the west side of St. Anthony Falls in Minneapolis. The company struggled initially, and several of the early investors sold out. Washburn bought in and eventually became president. His brother William moved to Minneapolis about that time, and actively managed the company. The company built a dam, a canal and a complex set of water transfer tunnels which were then leased, along with land that the company owned at the foot of the falls, to a variety of mills – cotton mills, woolen mills, sawmills and grist/flour mills. Eventually the work and investment of the two brothers paid off well, and they used their new-found capital to invest in mills themselves.[4]\n\n\n\n### Lumber\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** Paynter 2002, p. 11.\n14. **^** Paynter 2002, p. 4.\n15. **^** \"On This Day in Wisconsin History\".

However, he succeeded and in 1874 built an even larger Washburn \"A\" Mill. The original \"A\" mill complex was destroyed, along with several nearby buildings, in a flour explosion in 1878, but was later rebuilt.[7] In 1877, Washburn teamed with John Crosby to form the Washburn-Crosby Company. At the same time, Washburn sent William Hood Dunwoody to England to open that market for spring wheat.[8] Successful, Dunwoody became a silent partner and went on to become one of the wealthiest millers in the world. Dunwoody became a philanthropist endowing hospitals, educational facilities which became Dunwoody College of Technology, and a charitable home which ultimately became Dunwoody Village.[*citation needed*] The corporation eventually became known as General Mills.[8]\n\n\n\n## Politics and military career\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Cadwallader Colden Washburn** (April 22, 1818 – May 14, 1882) was an American businessman, politician, and soldier who founded a mill that later became General Mills. A member of the Washburn family of Maine, he was a U.S. Congressman and governor of Wisconsin, and served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War.\n\n\n\n\n## Education and early career\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Washburn County Government, Wisconsin\n27. **^** Our Rich History.

In 1871 he formed the La Crosse Lumber Company, which eventually sawed 20,000,000 board feet of lumber annually. He also had the largest shingle mill in the upper Mississippi valley.[6]\n\n\n\n### Flour\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1844, Washburn formed a partnership with land agent Cyrus Woodman. Together the two men developed a number of companies, such as the Wisconsin Mining Company. The most successful business venture undertaken by the men was land acquisition. In May 1855 they established Washburn's and Woodman's Mineral Point Bank. Washburn and Woodman dissolved their partnership amicably in 1855.\n\n\n\n### Minneapolis Mill Company\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1856, the Minneapolis Mill Company was chartered by the Minnesota territorial legislature. Among the incorporators were Washburn's cousin Dorilus Morrison, and Robert Smith, an Illinois congressman who had acquired the rights to the water power at the west side of St. Anthony Falls in Minneapolis. The company struggled initially, and several of the early investors sold out. Washburn bought in and eventually became president. His brother William moved to Minneapolis about that time, and actively managed the company. The company built a dam, a canal and a complex set of water transfer tunnels which were then leased, along with land that the company owned at the foot of the falls, to a variety of mills – cotton mills, woolen mills, sawmills and grist/flour mills. Eventually the work and investment of the two brothers paid off well, and they used their new-found capital to invest in mills themselves.[4]\n\n\n\n### Lumber\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** Paynter 2002, p. 11.\n14. **^** Paynter 2002, p. 4.\n15. **^** \"On This Day in Wisconsin History\".

Founded on the banks of the Mississippi River at Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis, the company originally gained fame for being a large flour miller. Today, the company markets many well-known North American brands, including Gold Medal flour, Annie's Homegrown, Lärabar, Cascadian Farm, Betty Crocker, Yoplait, Nature Valley, Totino's, Pillsbury, Old El Paso, Häagen-Dazs, as well as breakfast cereals under the General Mills name, including Cheerios, Chex, Lucky Charms, Trix, Cocoa Puffs and Count Chocula and the other monster cereals.[3]\n\n\nIt is headquartered in Golden Valley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement, late 1880s\n### Washburn-Crosby Company[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1990, a joint venture with Nestlé S.A. called Cereal Partners was formed[22] which markets cereals (including many existing General Mills cereal brands) outside the US and Canada under the Nestlé name.\n\n\nIn 2001, the company purchased Pillsbury (sans Burger King) from Diageo, although it was officially described as a \"merger\".\n\n\nSince 2004, General Mills has been producing more products targeted to the growing ranks of health-conscious consumers. The company has chosen to switch its entire breakfast cereal line to whole grain. The company also started manufacturing their child-targeted cereals with less sugar.[23][24] General Mills has reduced the level of sugar in all cereals advertised to children to 11 grams per serving.[25]\n\n\nIn April 2011, General Mills announced that it will switch all 1 million eggs it uses each year to cage-free.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"February Openings Set For Theme Restaurants\".

Founded on the banks of the Mississippi River at Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis, the company originally gained fame for being a large flour miller. Today, the company markets many well-known North American brands, including Gold Medal flour, Annie's Homegrown, Lärabar, Cascadian Farm, Betty Crocker, Yoplait, Nature Valley, Totino's, Pillsbury, Old El Paso, Häagen-Dazs, as well as breakfast cereals under the General Mills name, including Cheerios, Chex, Lucky Charms, Trix, Cocoa Puffs and Count Chocula and the other monster cereals.[3]\n\n\nIt is headquartered in Golden Valley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement, late 1880s\n### Washburn-Crosby Company[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1990, a joint venture with Nestlé S.A. called Cereal Partners was formed[22] which markets cereals (including many existing General Mills cereal brands) outside the US and Canada under the Nestlé name.\n\n\nIn 2001, the company purchased Pillsbury (sans Burger King) from Diageo, although it was officially described as a \"merger\".\n\n\nSince 2004, General Mills has been producing more products targeted to the growing ranks of health-conscious consumers. The company has chosen to switch its entire breakfast cereal line to whole grain. The company also started manufacturing their child-targeted cereals with less sugar.[23][24] General Mills has reduced the level of sugar in all cereals advertised to children to 11 grams per serving.[25]\n\n\nIn April 2011, General Mills announced that it will switch all 1 million eggs it uses each year to cage-free.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"February Openings Set For Theme Restaurants\".
