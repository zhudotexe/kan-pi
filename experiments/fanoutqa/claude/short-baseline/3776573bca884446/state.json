The only tool available to me is a Wikipedia search function. \n\nTo help answer your question, I would need:\n1. Access to demographic/income data by zip code\n2. A way to search for landmarks within specific zip codes\n\nHowever, I can share that some well-known wealthy areas in the US include:\n- Beverly Hills, CA\n- Greenwich, CT\n- Atherton, CA\n- Scarsdale, NY\n\nWould you like me to search Wikipedia for information about landmarks in any of these specific locations? Or would you prefer to rephrase your question to focus on something I can search for in Wikipedia?",
