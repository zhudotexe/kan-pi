For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,432,670 (31 March 2023)[1] making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021,[6] significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world's lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4, however there has been a small increase in recent years.[7] Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972,[8] which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** Note: Crude migration change (per 1000) is a trend analysis, an extrapolation based average population change (current year minus previous) minus natural change of the current year (see table statistics). As average population is an estimate of the population in the middle of the year and not end of the year.\n31. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Max Roser (2014), \"Total Fertility Rate around the world over the last centuries\", *Our World In Data, Gapminder Foundation*, archived from the original on 7 August 2018, retrieved 7 August 2018\n32. **^** \"Life expectancy\". *Our World in Data*.
