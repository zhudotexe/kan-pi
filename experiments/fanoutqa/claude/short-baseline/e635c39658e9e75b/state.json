Check official tour websites\n2. Contact the venues directly\n3. Consult specialized entertainment industry databases\n4. Look up venue construction information from architectural or construction industry sources\n\nWould you like me to search Wikipedia for general information about Ed Sheeran or any specific concert venues you're interested in?",
