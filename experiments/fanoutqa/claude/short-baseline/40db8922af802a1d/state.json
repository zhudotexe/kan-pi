In order to qualify for this list, a structure must:\n\n\n\n* be a recognisable building;\n* incorporate features of building work from the claimed date to at least 1.5 metres (4.9\u00a0ft) in height;\n* be largely complete or include building work to this height for most of its perimeter.\n* contain an enclosed area with at least one entry point.\n\n\nThis deliberately excludes ruins of limited height and statues.

The larger and older structure is linked by a low passageway to the other building, which has been interpreted as a workshop or a second house. They were constructed on an earlier midden, and were surrounded by midden material which has protected them. There are no windows; the structures were presumably lit by fire, with a hole in the roof to let out smoke. Though they now stand close to the shore, they would have originally lain inland. \n\n\nThe stone walls of the buildings are preserved and while the roof is missing, it was likely made of wood and thatched or turfed. A hearth and a stone-built cupboard survive inside, and there may have been an external porch.[3] Local stone splits into thin slabs, offering a ready source of construction material.\n\n\n\n![](image)Looking back through the low entrance doorway into the main house, a visitor's knapsack gives an idea of scale.\n![](image)The main house now looks out over the sea.\nThe walls still stand to an eaves height of 1.6 metres (5\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in), and the stone furniture is intact giving a vivid impression of life in the house. Fireplaces, partition screens, beds and storage shelves are almost intact, and post holes were found indicating the roof structure.\n\n\nEvidence from the middens shows that the inhabitants were keeping cattle, sheep and pigs, cultivating barley and wheat and gathering shellfish as well as fishing for species which must have been line caught using boats.\n\n\nFinds of finely-made and decorated Unstan ware pottery link the inhabitants to chambered cairn tombs nearby and to sites far afield including Balbridie and Eilean Domhnuill.\nThe name Howar is believed to be derived from Old Norse word *haugr* meaning mounds or barrows. The site is in the care of Historic Scotland.[4]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Prehistoric Scotland \u00a7\u00a0Farmers and monument builders\n* Oldest buildings in Scotland\n* List of the oldest buildings in the world\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Knap of Howar\" Historic Scotland.
