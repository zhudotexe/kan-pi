Many of the buildings within the list contain primarily bricks, but most importantly maintain their walls and roof. There are numerous extant structures that survive in the Orkney islands of Scotland, some of the best known of which are part of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site.[2] The list also contains many large buildings from the Egyptian Age of the Pyramids.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Aula Palatina | ![](image) | Germany | 306 AD\n | Palace basilica\n | Contains the largest extant hall from antiquity.[125] |\n| Jokhang | ![](image) | Lhasa, Tibet, China | c. 639 AD\n | Buddhist temple\n | Perhaps the world's oldest timber-frame building.[135] |\n| Hōryū-ji | ![](image) | Nara, Japan | 670 AD\n | Buddhist Temple\n | Oldest wooden building still standing.[136] |\n| Nanchan Temple | ![](image) | Wutai, China | 782 AD\n | Buddhist Temple\n | Its Great Buddha Hall is currently China's oldest extant timber building.\n |\n| Greensted Church | ![](image) | United Kingdom (England)\n | c. 1053 AD\n | Church\n | May be the oldest, extant wooden church in the world and the oldest, extant wooden building in Europe.[137][138] |\n| Roykstovan in Kirkjubø | ![](image) | Faroe Islands | No clear date, middle of 11th century AD\n | Farmhouse\n | May be the oldest continuously inhabited wooden building in the world[139] |\n| Ditherington Flax Mill | ![](image) | United Kingdom (England, Shrewsbury)\n | 1797 AD\n | Industrial\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Building\n | Image\n | Country\n | Continent\n | First Built\n | Use\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Göbeklitepe | ![](image) | Turkey | Asia | 9500-7500 BC\n | Unknown/likely temple\n | Oldest temple and oldest structure in the world.\n |\n| Durankulak | ![](image) | Bulgaria | Europe | 5500—4100 BC\n | Settlement\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. **^** \"Oldest Hindu Temple Discovered | OBORGE\".

The larger and older structure is linked by a low passageway to the other building, which has been interpreted as a workshop or a second house. They were constructed on an earlier midden, and were surrounded by midden material which has protected them. There are no windows; the structures were presumably lit by fire, with a hole in the roof to let out smoke. Though they now stand close to the shore, they would have originally lain inland. \n\n\nThe stone walls of the buildings are preserved and while the roof is missing, it was likely made of wood and thatched or turfed. A hearth and a stone-built cupboard survive inside, and there may have been an external porch.[3] Local stone splits into thin slabs, offering a ready source of construction material.\n\n\n\n![](image)Looking back through the low entrance doorway into the main house, a visitor's knapsack gives an idea of scale.\n![](image)The main house now looks out over the sea.\nThe walls still stand to an eaves height of 1.6 metres (5 ft 3 in), and the stone furniture is intact giving a vivid impression of life in the house. Fireplaces, partition screens, beds and storage shelves are almost intact, and post holes were found indicating the roof structure.\n\n\nEvidence from the middens shows that the inhabitants were keeping cattle, sheep and pigs, cultivating barley and wheat and gathering shellfish as well as fishing for species which must have been line caught using boats.\n\n\nFinds of finely-made and decorated Unstan ware pottery link the inhabitants to chambered cairn tombs nearby and to sites far afield including Balbridie and Eilean Domhnuill.\nThe name Howar is believed to be derived from Old Norse word *haugr* meaning mounds or barrows. The site is in the care of Historic Scotland.[4]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Prehistoric Scotland § Farmers and monument builders\n* Oldest buildings in Scotland\n* List of the oldest buildings in the world\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Knap of Howar\" Historic Scotland.

The larger and older structure is linked by a low passageway to the other building, which has been interpreted as a workshop or a second house. They were constructed on an earlier midden, and were surrounded by midden material which has protected them. There are no windows; the structures were presumably lit by fire, with a hole in the roof to let out smoke. Though they now stand close to the shore, they would have originally lain inland. \n\n\nThe stone walls of the buildings are preserved and while the roof is missing, it was likely made of wood and thatched or turfed. A hearth and a stone-built cupboard survive inside, and there may have been an external porch.[3] Local stone splits into thin slabs, offering a ready source of construction material.\n\n\n\n![](image)Looking back through the low entrance doorway into the main house, a visitor's knapsack gives an idea of scale.\n![](image)The main house now looks out over the sea.\nThe walls still stand to an eaves height of 1.6 metres (5 ft 3 in), and the stone furniture is intact giving a vivid impression of life in the house. Fireplaces, partition screens, beds and storage shelves are almost intact, and post holes were found indicating the roof structure.\n\n\nEvidence from the middens shows that the inhabitants were keeping cattle, sheep and pigs, cultivating barley and wheat and gathering shellfish as well as fishing for species which must have been line caught using boats.\n\n\nFinds of finely-made and decorated Unstan ware pottery link the inhabitants to chambered cairn tombs nearby and to sites far afield including Balbridie and Eilean Domhnuill.\nThe name Howar is believed to be derived from Old Norse word *haugr* meaning mounds or barrows. The site is in the care of Historic Scotland.[4]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Prehistoric Scotland § Farmers and monument builders\n* Oldest buildings in Scotland\n* List of the oldest buildings in the world\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Knap of Howar\" Historic Scotland.
