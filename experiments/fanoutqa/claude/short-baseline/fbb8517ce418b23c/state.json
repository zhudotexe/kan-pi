Three of their films have won the Animage Grand Prix award, four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year, and five have received Academy Award nominations. *Spirited Away* won the 2002 Golden Bear and the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[8]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily suspended production following Miyazaki's retirement. In February 2017, Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film, *The Boy and the Heron* (2023).[9][10] In September 2023, Nippon TV announced that Studio Ghibli would become a unit of Nippon Television Holdings in October.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *Pom Poko* | Isao Takahata | Shang Shang Typhoon | July 16, 1994\n | 86%[103] | 77[104] |\n| 1995\n | *Whisper of the Heart* | Yoshifumi Kond\u014d | Hayao Miyazaki | Yuji Nomi | July 15, 1995\n | 94%[105] | 75[106] |\n| 1997\n | *Princess Mononoke* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 12, 1997\n | 93%[107] | 76[108] |\n| 1999\n | *My Neighbors the Yamadas* | Isao Takahata | Akiko Yano | July 17, 1999\n | 78%[109] | 75[110] |\n| 2001\n | *Spirited Away* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 20, 2001\n | 96%[111] | 96[112] |\n| 2002\n | *The Cat Returns* | Hiroyuki Morita | Reiko Yoshida | Toshio SuzukiNozomu Takahashi\n | Yuji Nomi | July 19, 2002\n | 88%[113] | 70[114] |\n| 2004\n | *Howl's Moving Castle* | Hayao Miyazaki | Toshio Suzuki | Joe Hisaishi | November 20, 2004\n | 87%[115] | 82[116] |\n| 2006\n | *Tales from Earthsea* | Gor\u014d Miyazaki | Gor\u014d MiyazakiKeiko Niwa\n | Tamiya Terashima\n | July 29, 2006\n | 38%[117] | 47[118] |\n| 2008\n | *Ponyo* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 19, 2008\n | 91%[119] | 86[120] |\n| 2010\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *Arrietty* | Hiromasa Yonebayashi | Hayao MiyazakiKeiko Niwa\n | C\u00e9cile Corbel | July 17, 2010\n | 94%[121] | 80[122] |\n| 2011\n | *From Up on Poppy Hill* | Gor\u014d Miyazaki | Satoshi Takebe | July 16, 2011\n | 87%[123] | 71[124] |\n| 2013\n | *The Wind Rises* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 20, 2013\n | 88%[125] | 83[126] |\n| *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya* | Isao Takahata | Isao TakahataRiko Sakaguchi\n | Yoshiaki Nishimura | November 23, 2013\n | 100%[127] | 89[128] |\n| 2014\n | *When Marnie Was There* | Hiromasa Yonebayashi | Hiromasa YonebayashiKeiko NiwaMasashi Ando | Takatsugu Muramatsu\n | July 19, 2014\n | 92%[129] | 72[130] |\n| 2016\n | *The Red Turtle* | Micha\u00ebl Dudok de Wit | Micha\u00ebl Dudok de WitPascale Ferran | Toshio SuzukiIsao TakahataVincent MaravalPascal CaucheteuxGr\u00e9goire Sorlat\n | Laurent Perez del Mar\n | May 18, 2016\n | 93%[131] | 86[132] |\n| 2020\n | *Earwig and the Witch* | Gor\u014d Miyazaki | Keiko NiwaEmi Gunji\n | Toshio Suzuki\n | Satoshi Takebe\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Studio Ghibli, Inc.** (Japanese: \u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u30b9\u30bf\u30b8\u30aa\u30b8\u30d6\u30ea, Hepburn: *Kabushiki gaisha Sutajio Jiburi*)[3] is a Japanese animation studio based in Koganei, Tokyo.[4] It has a strong presence in the animation industry and has expanded its portfolio to include various media formats, such as short subjects, television commercials, and two television films. Their work has been well-received by audiences and recognized with numerous awards. Their mascot and most recognizable symbol, the character Totoro, is a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (*tanuki*) and cats[5] from the 1988 film *My Neighbor Totoro*. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are *Spirited Away* (2001), *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004), and *Ponyo* (2008).[6] Studio Ghibli was founded on June 15, 1985, by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after acquiring Topcraft's assets. The studio has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several games.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStudio Ghibli films are mostly hand-drawn using rich water and acrylic paints. The films use traditional methods of making animation where every frame is drawn and colored by hand. Computer animation techniques are used sparingly.[138] All the Studio Ghibli films use bright colors,[139][140] and have a \"whimsical and joyful aesthetic\".[141] Studio Ghibli\u2019s art style tends to be more of a cozy European style that put a lot of undertones on the background and nature in the scene.[142]\n\n\nThe films often focus on the lives of youth, especially school children. Common themes include the risks posed by progress to tradition,[143] environmentalism and the natural world,[143][141] independent female protagonists,[139] the cost of war, and youth.[140]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nRayna Denison argues that, despite the feminist themes of Ghibli films, the studio has been reluctant to promote women within the company and regularly overworks its laborers, including on public holidays.[144]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Screenwriter(s)\n | Producer(s)\n | Composer\n | Original release\n | RT | MC |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1984\n | *Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind* | Hayao Miyazaki | Isao Takahata | Joe Hisaishi | March 11, 1984\n | 90%[87] | 86[88] |\n| 1986\n | *Castle in the Sky* | August 2, 1986\n | 96%[89] | 78[90] |\n| 1988\n | *My Neighbor Totoro* | T\u014dru Hara\n | April 16, 1988\n | 93%[91] | 86[92] |\n| *Grave of the Fireflies* | Isao Takahata | Michio Mamiya | 100%[93] | 94[94] |\n| 1989\n | *Kiki's Delivery Service* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 29, 1989\n | 98%[95] | 83[96] |\n| 1991\n | *Only Yesterday* | Isao Takahata | Toshio Suzuki | Katz Hoshi\n | July 20, 1991\n | 100%[97] | 90[98] |\n| 1992\n | *Porco Rosso* | Hayao Miyazaki | Joe Hisaishi | July 18, 1992\n | 96%[99] | 83[100] |\n| 1993\n | *Ocean Waves* | Tomomi Mochizuki | Seiji OkudaNozomu Takahashi\n | Shigeru Nagata\n | May 5, 1993[A] | 89%[101] | 73[102] |\n| 1994\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n140. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Studio Ghibli Movies \u2013 A Deep Analysis of the Themes\". *Pop Up Tee*.

Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* considered it to be one of the best and most powerful war films and, in 2000, included it on his list of great films.[38] The film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating based on 43 reviews with an average rating of 9.30/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"An achingly sad anti-war film, *Grave of the Fireflies* is one of Studio Ghibli's most profoundly beautiful, haunting works.\"[50] Metacritic assigned the film a score of 94 out of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[51]\n\n\nFilmmaker Akira Kurosawa praised the film and considered it his favourite Ghibli production. He wrote a letter of praise to Hayao Miyazaki, mistakenly believing he directed *Grave of the Fireflies*. Miyazaki himself praised the film as Takahata's masterpiece, but criticized Seita for not behaving how he believes the son of a navy lieutenant should behave.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Feature films | * *Castle in the Sky*\n* *My Neighbor Totoro*\n* *Grave of the Fireflies*\n* *Kiki's Delivery Service*\n* *Only Yesterday*\n* *Porco Rosso*\n* *Ocean Waves*\n* *Pom Poko*\n* *Whisper of the Heart*\n* *Princess Mononoke*\n* *My Neighbors the Yamadas*\n* *Spirited Away*\n* *The Cat Returns*\n* *Howl's Moving Castle*\n* *Tales from Earthsea*\n* *Ponyo*\n* *Arrietty*\n* *From Up on Poppy Hill*\n* *The Wind Rises*\n* *The Tale of the Princess Kaguya*\n* *When Marnie Was There*\n* *Earwig and the Witch*\n* *The Boy and the Heron*\n |\n| Short films | * *Nandar\u014d*\n* *On Your Mark*\n* *Ghiblies*\n* *Ghiblies Episode 2*\n* *Imaginary Flying Machines*\n* *The Whale Hunt*\n* *Koro's Big Day Out*\n* *Mei and the Kittenbus*\n* *Looking for a Home*\n* *The Day I Harvested a Planet*\n* *The Night of Taneyamagahara*\n* *Water Spider Monmon*\n* *Iblard Jikan*\n* *A Sumo Wrestler's Tail*\n* *Giant God Warrior Appears in Tokyo*\n* *Boro the Caterpillar*\n* *Zen - Grogu and Dust Bunnies*\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Animerica Interview: Takahata and Nosaka: Two Grave Voices in Animation\". *Animerica*. **2** (11): 9. 1994.

While the two films were marketed toward children and their parents, the starkly tragic nature of *Grave of the Fireflies* turned away many audiences. However, *Totoro* merchandise, particularly the stuffed animals of Totoro and Catbus, sold extremely well after the film and made overall profits for the company to the extent that it stabilized subsequent productions of Studio Ghibli.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Grave of the Fireflies* is the only theatrical Studio Ghibli feature film prior to *From Up on Poppy Hill* to which Disney never had North American distribution rights, since it was not produced by Ghibli for parent company Tokuma Shoten but for Shinchosha, the publisher of the original short story (although Disney has the Japanese home video distribution rights themselves, thus replacing the film's original Japanese home video distributor, Bandai Visual).[35] It was one of the last Studio Ghibli films to get an English-language premiere by GKIDS.[36]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the international release, it has been noted that different audiences have interpreted the film differently due to differences in culture. For instance, when the film was watched by a Japanese audience, Seita's decision to not come back to his aunt was seen as an understandable decision, as they were able to understand how Seita had been raised to value pride in himself and his country. But American and Australian audiences were more likely to perceive the decision as unwise, due to the cultural differences in order to try to save his sister and himself.[64][65]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\n | Blue Ribbon Awards | Special Award | Isao Takahata | Won\n |\n| 1994\n | Chicago International Children's Film Festival | Animation Jury Award\n | Won\n |\n| Rights of the Child Award\n | Won\n |\n\n\n## Derivative works[edit]\n\n\n### Planned follow-up[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n|  |\n| Directed by | Isao Takahata |\n| Screenplay by | Isao Takahata |\n| Based on | \"Grave of the Fireflies\"by Akiyuki Nosaka |\n| Produced by | Toru Hara |\n| Starring | * Tsutomu Tatsumi\n* Ayano Shiraishi\u00a0[ja]\n* Yoshiko Shinohara\u00a0[ja]\n* Akemi Yamaguchi\u00a0[ja]\n |\n| Cinematography | Nobuo Koyama |\n| Edited by | Takeshi Seyama |\n| Music by | Michio Mamiya |\n| Productioncompanies\n | Studio GhibliShinchosha\n |\n| Distributed by | Toho |\n| Release date\n | * 16\u00a0April\u00a01988\u00a0(1988-04-16)\n |\n| Running time\n | 89 minutes[1] |\n| Country | Japan |\n| Language | Japanese |\n| Box office | * \u00a51.7 billion (Japan)[2]\n* $516,962 (US)[3]\n |\n\n\n***Grave of the Fireflies*** (Japanese: \u706b\u5782\u308b\u306e\u5893, Hepburn: *Hotaru no Haka*) is an animated war drama film written and directed by Isao Takahata, and produced by Studio Ghibli.
