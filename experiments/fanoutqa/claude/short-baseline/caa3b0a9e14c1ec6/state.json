In 2023, a government recount of the islands with digital maps increased the total from 6,852 to 14,125 islands.[9] The five main islands are (from north to south) Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. Three of the four major islands (Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku) are separated by narrow straits of the Seto Inland Sea and form a natural entity. The 6,847 smaller islands are called remote islands.[10][11] This includes the Bonin Islands, Dait\u014d Islands, Minami-Tori-shima, Okinotorishima, the Ryukyu Islands, the Volcano Islands, Nansei Islands, and the Nanp\u014d Islands, as well as numerous islets, of which 430 are inhabited. The Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan but disputed by China. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Shikoku* (\u56db\u56fd) is the second smallest of the five main islands (after Okinawa island), 18,800\u00a0km2 (7,300\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It is located south of Honshu and northeast of Kyushu. It has the second smallest population of 3,845,534 million (2015)[11][124] and the third highest population density of 204.55 persons/km2.\n\n\n\n### Hokkaido[edit]\n\n\n*Hokkaido* (\u5317\u6d77\u9053) is the second largest island of Japan, and the largest and northernmost prefecture. The Tsugaru Strait separates Hokkaido from Honshu.[125] It has the third largest population of the five main islands with 5,383,579 (2015)[11][116] and the lowest population density with just 64.5 persons/km2 (2016). The island area ranks 21st in the world by area. It is 3.6% smaller than the island of Ireland.\n\n\n\n### Okinawa Prefecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Honsh\u016b* (\u672c\u5dde) is the largest island of Japan and the second most populous island in the world. It has a population of 104,000,000 with a population density of 450/km2 (1,200/sq\u00a0mi) (2010).[116] Honshu is roughly 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) long and ranges from 50 to 230\u00a0km (31 to 143\u00a0mi) wide, and the total area is 225,800\u00a0km2 (87,200\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It is the 7th largest island in the world.[117] This makes it slightly larger than the island of Great Britain 209,331\u00a0km2 (80,823\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[117]\n\n\nThe Greater Tokyo Area on Honshu is the largest metropolitan area (megacity) in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).[118][119] The area is 13,500\u00a0km2 (5,200\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[120] and has a population density of 2,642 persons/km2.[121]\n\n\n\n### Kyushu[edit]\n\n\n*Kyushu* (\u4e5d\u5dde) is the third largest island of Japan of the five main islands.[11][122] As of 2016[update], Kyushu has a population of 12,970,479 and covers 36,782\u00a0km2 (14,202\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[123] It has the second highest population density of 307.13 persons/km2 (2016).\n\n\n\n### Shikoku[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 20 | Nakad\u014dri Island | 168.34 | 65.00 | Got\u014d Islands |\n| 21 | Hirado Island | 163.42 | 63.10 |  |\n| 22 | Miyako-jima | 158.87 | 61.34 |  |\n| 23 | Sh\u014ddoshima | 153.30 | 59.19 |  |\n| 24 | Okushiri Island | 142.97 | 55.20 |  |\n| 25 | Iki Island | 138.46 | 53.46 |  |\n| 26 | Su\u014d-\u014cshima | 128.31 | 49.54 |  |\n| 27 | Okinoerabujima | 93.63 | 36.15 |  |\n| 28 | Etajima | 91.32 | 35.26 |  |\n| 29 | Izu \u014cshima | 91.06 | 35.16 | Izu Islands |\n| 30 | Nagashima Island, Kagoshima | 90.62 | 34.99 |  |\n| 31 | Rebun Island | 80 | 31 |  |\n| 32 | Kakeromajima | 77.39 | 29.88 |  |\n| 33 | Kurahashi-jima | 69.46 | 26.82 |  |\n| 34 | Shimokoshiki-jima | 66.12 | 25.53 |  |\n| 35 | \u014cmishima Island, Ehime | 66.12 | 25.53 |  |\n| 36 | Hachij\u014d-jima | 62.52 | 24.14 |  |\n| 37 | Kume Island | 59.11 | 22.82 | Okinawa Islands |\n| 38 | Kikaijima | 56.93 | 21.98 | Amami Islands |\n| 39 | Nishinoshima | 55.98 | 21.61 |  |\n| 40 | Miyake-jima | 55.44 | 21.41 |  |\n| 41 | Notojima | 46.78 | 18.06 |  |\n| 42 | Kamikoshiki-jima | 45.08 | 17.41 |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: List of mountains and hills of Japan by height\n\nThe mountainous islands of the Japanese archipelago form a crescent off the eastern coast of Asia.[27] They are separated from the continent by the Sea of Japan, which serves as a protective barrier.

Japan's highest mountain is Mount Fuji, with an elevation of 3,776\u00a0m (12,388\u00a0ft). Japan's forest cover rate is 68.55% since the mountains are heavily forested. The only other developed nations with such a high forest cover percentage are Finland and Sweden.[14]\n\n\nSince there is little level ground, many hills and mountainsides at lower elevations around towns and cities are often cultivated. As Japan is situated in a volcanic zone along the Pacific deeps, frequent low-intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes occur several times a century. Hot springs are numerous and have been exploited by the leisure industry.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAround 15 million years ago, the volcanic shoreline of the Asian continent was pushed out into a series of volcanic island arcs.[16] This created the \"back-arc basins\" known as the Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk with the formal shaping of the Japanese archipelago.[16] The archipelago also has summits of mountain ridges that were uplifted near the outer edge of the continental shelf.[27] About 73 percent of Japan's area is mountainous, and scattered plains and intermontane basins (in which the population is concentrated) cover only about 27 percent.[27] A long chain of mountains runs down the middle of the archipelago, dividing it into two halves, the \"face\", fronting on the Pacific Ocean, and the \"back\", toward the Sea of Japan.[27] On the Pacific side are steep mountains 1,500 to 3,000 meters high, with deep valleys and gorges.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Three Views of Japan (\u65e5\u672c\u4e09\u666f, *Nihon Sankei*) is the canonical list of Japan's three most celebrated scenic sights, attributed to 1643 and scholar Hayashi Gah\u014d.[108] These are traditionally the pine-clad islands of Matsushima in Miyagi Prefecture, the pine-clad sandbar of Amanohashidate in Kyoto Prefecture, and Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima Prefecture. In 1915, the New Three Views of Japan were selected with a national election by the Jitsugyo no Nihon Sha (\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u5b9f\u696d\u4e4b\u65e5\u672c\u793e).

The seasonal views change throughout the year.[104] In the south, the Yaeyama Islands are in the subtropics with numerous species of subtropical and tropical plants, and mangrove forests.[105][106] Most natural islands have mountain ranges in the center with coastal plains.\n\n\n\n* List of National Parks of Japan\n* List of National Geoparks in Japan\n* Wildlife Protection Areas in Japan\n* List of Ramsar sites in Japan\n* Cultural Landscapes\n\n\n### Places of Scenic Beauty[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Heading\n | Location\n | Prefecture | Bordering entity\n | Coordinates\u2020 | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North\n | Cape S\u014dya | Hokkaid\u014d | La P\u00e9rouse Strait | 45\u00b031\u203222\u2033N 141\u00b056\u203211\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff45.52278\u00b0N 141.93639\u00b0E\ufeff / 45.52278; 141.93639\ufeff (Cape S\u014dya) |  |\n| South\n | Cape Arasaki\n | Okinawa | East China Sea | 26\u00b004\u203230\u2033N 127\u00b040\u203251\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff26.07500\u00b0N 127.68083\u00b0E\ufeff / 26.07500; 127.68083\ufeff (Cape Arasaki) |  |\n| East\n | Cape Nosappu | Hokkaid\u014d | Pacific Ocean\n | 43\u00b023\u203206\u2033N 145\u00b049\u203203\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff43.38500\u00b0N 145.81750\u00b0E\ufeff / 43.38500; 145.81750\ufeff (Cape Nosappu) |  |\n| West\n | Cape Oominezaki\n | Okinawa | East China Sea | 26\u00b011\u203255\u2033N 127\u00b038\u203211\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff26.19861\u00b0N 127.63639\u00b0E\ufeff / 26.19861; 127.63639\ufeff (Cape Oominezaki) |  |\n\n\n### Extreme altitudes[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Heading\n | Location\n | Prefecture | Bordering entity\n | Coordinates\u2020 | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| North (disputed)\n | Cape Kamoiwakka on Etorofu | Hokkaido\u2021 | Sea of Okhotsk | 45\u00b033\u203226\u2033N 148\u00b045\u203209\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff45.55722\u00b0N 148.75250\u00b0E\ufeff / 45.55722; 148.75250\ufeff (Cape Kamoiwakka (Northernmost \u2013 disputed)) | [134] |\n| North (undisputed)\n | Benten-jima | Hokkaid\u014d | La P\u00e9rouse Strait | 45\u00b031\u203238\u2033N 141\u00b055\u203206\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff45.52722\u00b0N 141.91833\u00b0E\ufeff / 45.52722; 141.91833\ufeff (Bentenjima (Northernmost \u2013 undisputed)) | [135] |\n| South\n | Okinotorishima | Tokyo\n | Philippine Sea | 20\u00b025\u203231\u2033N 136\u00b004\u203211\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff20.42528\u00b0N 136.06972\u00b0E\ufeff / 20.42528; 136.06972\ufeff (Okinotorishima (Southernmost)) |  |\n| East\n | Minami Torishima | Tokyo\n | Pacific Ocean\n | 24\u00b016\u203259\u2033N 153\u00b059\u203211\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff24.28306\u00b0N 153.98639\u00b0E\ufeff / 24.28306; 153.98639\ufeff (Minami Torishima (Easternmost)) |  |\n| West\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
