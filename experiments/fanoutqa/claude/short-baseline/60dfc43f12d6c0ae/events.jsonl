Although it originally started tracking song sales the week of October 30, 2004,[2] it officially debuted in the issue dated January 22, 2005, and merged all versions of a song sold from digital music distributors.[3] Its data was incorporated in the Hot 100 three weeks later. Since October 2004, digital sales have been incorporated into many of *Billboard*'s music singles charts.[4] The decision was based on the dramatic increase of the digital market while commercial single sales in a physical format were becoming negligible.[5]\n\n\nThe first number one song on the Digital Songs chart was \"Just Lose It\" by Eminem.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Week Ending June 24, 2012.

Although it originally started tracking song sales the week of October 30, 2004,[2] it officially debuted in the issue dated January 22, 2005, and merged all versions of a song sold from digital music distributors.[3] Its data was incorporated in the Hot 100 three weeks later. Since October 2004, digital sales have been incorporated into many of *Billboard*'s music singles charts.[4] The decision was based on the dramatic increase of the digital market while commercial single sales in a physical format were becoming negligible.[5]\n\n\nThe first number one song on the Digital Songs chart was \"Just Lose It\" by Eminem.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Week Ending June 24, 2012.
