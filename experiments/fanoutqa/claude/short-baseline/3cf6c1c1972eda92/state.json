The only tool available to me is a Wikipedia search function, which may not give us comprehensive or reliable information about specific book deals and their page counts.\n\nTo properly answer this question, we would need:\n1. A database of book deals and their values\n2. Access to bibliographic data that includes page counts for these books\n\nWould you like me to try searching Wikipedia for some general information about notable book deals? Or would you prefer to rephrase your question to focus on something that can be found in Wikipedia articles?",
