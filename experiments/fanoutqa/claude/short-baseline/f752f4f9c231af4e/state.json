Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22121.8\u00a0\u00b0C), and lows of 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from \u221222\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221230\u00a0\u00b0C), on January 19, 1994 to 103\u00a0\u00b0F (39\u00a0\u00b0C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is \u22123\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221219\u00a0\u00b0C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The neighborhoods are Arlington Heights, Bluff, Brighton Heights, Crafton Heights, Duquesne Heights, East Hills, Fineview, Highland Park, Middle Hill, Mount Oliver, Mount Washington, Northview Heights, Perry North (also known as Observatory Hill), Perry South (also known as Perry Hilltop), Polish Hill, Ridgemont, South Side Slopes, Spring Hill-City View, Squirrel Hill, Stanton Heights, Summer Hill, Troy Hill, and Upper Hill.\n2. **^** The warmest daily minimum at the current observation location, Pittsburgh Int'l, is only 77\u00a0\u00b0F (25\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 23, 2010, and July 16, 1980.[74]\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*) if the 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) if the \u22123\u00a0\u00b0C (27\u00a0\u00b0F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature.

As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** \"Cloudiness \u2013 Mean Number of Days\". National Climatic Data Center.

Due to its river valley and urban location as well as elevation, many of the summertime warm minima temperature records set at the WBO have not even come close to being matched at KPIT, which is at-elevation and located in the western suburbs.

Outside of California, Allegheny County is the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[82][83] The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHome rule municipalities in Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Cities | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| First Class | * Philadelphia\n |\n| Second Class | * Pittsburgh\n |\n| Second Class A | * Scranton\n |\n| Third Class | * Allentown\n* Altoona\n* Beaver Falls\n* Carbondale\n* Chester\n* Municipality of Clairton\n* Coatesville\n* Easton\n* Farrell\n* Franklin\n* Greensburg\n* Hermitage\n* Johnstown\n* Lebanon\n* McKeesport\n* Nanticoke\n* New Castle\n* Pittston\n* Reading\n* St. Marys\n* Sharon\n* Warren\n* Wilkes-Barre\n |\n\n |\n| Boroughs | * Bellevue\n* Municipality of Bethel Park\n* Braddock\n* Bradford Woods\n* Bryn Athyn\n* Cambridge Springs\n* Carlisle\n* Chalfont\n* Edinboro\n* Green Tree\n* Town of Greenville\n* Municipality of Kingston\n* City of Latrobe\n* Mahanoy City\n* Malvern\n* Municipality of Monroeville\n* Municipality of Murrysville\n* Municipality of Norristown\n* Portage\n* State College\n* Tyrone\n* West Chester\n* Whitehall\n* Youngsville\n |\n| Townships | \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
