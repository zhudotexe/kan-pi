The investment yields a return that funds a portion of an institution's operational expenses while the principal exists in perpetuity. U.S. colleges and universities maintain some of the largest endowments in the world and make up the vast majority of higher education institutions with endowments greater than $1\u00a0billion.\n\n\nThe National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) maintains information on endowments at U.S. higher education institutions by fiscal year (FY).[1] As of FY2022[update], the total endowment market value of U.S. institutions stood at $807.332 billion, with an average across all institutions of $1.185 billion and a median of $208.735 million.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Enhancements and levies[edit]\n\n\nThe tabulated data below are from NACUBO. Some universities benefit from endowments that are not under their direct control but which are nonetheless dedicated to the welfare of one or several institutions. Examples of these foundations include The Duke Endowment, the Robert A. Welch Foundation, and the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust.\n\n\nIn 2017, a federal endowment tax was enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the form of an excise tax of 1.4% on institutions that have at least 500 tuition-paying students and net assets of at least $500,000 per student. The $500,000 is not adjusted for inflation, so the threshold is effectively lowered over time.[4][5]\n\n\nThe endowment tax provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been criticized as funding tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy at the expense of education. Critics note that the tax could threaten financial aid for low-income students, stifle social mobility, and obstruct life-saving research.[6][7][8] Lobbyists representing wealthy private universities continue to advocate for its repeal.[9][10] The Don't Tax Higher Education Act, which would repeal the endowment tax, was introduced in the 115th United States Congress,[11] 116th United States Congress,[12] and 117th United States Congress[13] but died in the Ways and Means Committee each time.\n\n\n\n## Endowments greater than $1\u00a0billion[edit]\n\n\n### Private schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University has the second-largest endowment of all private colleges and universities in the United States.\n\n\n\n| Institution | State | Endowment[3](billions USD -

Hartzell** is an American economist and the 30th President of The University of Texas at Austin.[1] Additionally, he holds the Centennial Chair in Business Education Leadership and the Trammell Crow Regents Professor in Business at UT Austin.[2][3]\n\n\n\n## Education and career\n\n[edit]\n\nHartzell was born in Kansas and grew up in Oklahoma. He graduated from Trinity University in San Antonio cum laude with a B.S. in business administration and economics. After receiving a doctorate in finance from UT Austin, he served as an assistant professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business.[4]\n\n\n\n### The University of Texas at Austin\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Hartzell returned to UT Austin as a faculty member in the McCombs School of Business. Since then, he has served in various capacities, including as the senior associate dean for academic affairs, the executive director of the business school's Real Estate Finance and Investment Center, and as the chair of UT Austin's finance department.[5] In 2016, he was named dean of the McCombs School of Business. As dean, Hartzell launched the Goff Real Estate Labs, elevated the Canfield Business Honors program and opened Rowling Hall, the home of UT Austin's MBA program. He helped create many significant partnerships with colleges and schools across campus including the Dell Medical School, the College of Fine Arts, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Natural Sciences and the Moody College of Communication. He established the position of Associate Dean of Diversity and Inclusion at the McCombs School and the McCombs Diversity and Inclusion Committee.[6] He also established McCombs\u2019 one-year Master of Science in Finance degree, created the Undergraduate Real Estate Certificate Program and oversaw the completion of the fundraising, construction and opening of Rowling Hall, a 500,000-square-foot graduate business facility.[7]\n\n\nIn April 2020, the University of Texas System's Board of Regents appointed Hartzell to serve as interim president of UT Austin.[7]\n\n\nIn July 2020, in response to concerns raised by student athletes, alumni and other UT Austin community members, Hartzell announced a series of measures designed to create a more diverse and welcoming campus at UT Austin.[8] The measures included: working with a group of students, faculty members, staffers and alumni to allocate a multimillion-dollar investment from Athletics\u2019 revenue to UT Austin programs to recruit, attract, retain and support Black students; renaming the Robert L. Moore Building as the Physics, Math and Astronomy Building; honoring Heman M.

After Chemerinsky signed a contract on September 4, 2007, Drake rescinded the offer because he felt the law professor's commentaries were \"polarizing\"; Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDrake traveled over a weekend to meet with Chemerinsky in Durham, North Carolina, where Chemerinsky was a professor at the Duke University School of Law at the time, and the two reached an agreement.[27] On September 17, Chemerinsky issued a joint press release with Drake indicating that Chemerinsky would head the UCI law school.[28] On September 20, 2007, Chemerinsky's hire was formally approved by the Regents of the University of California.[29] In 2014, Chemerinsky said that he and Drake had since reconciled.[30]\n\n\n\n### Waters firing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Ohio State University Marching Band \u00a7\u00a02014 hazing scandal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDrake's first job was working at Tower Records. He is quoted as saying he has a \"passion for music, which is still a hobby today\".[19] In 2015, Drake was appointed to the board of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc. He has had a lifelong interest in music (notably rock and jazz), plays guitar, and teaches an undergraduate course on the music of the civil rights movement.[20]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Dr. Drake led the establishment of the Ohio State Tuition Guarantee, which freezes tuition, mandatory fees, housing and dining for four years for incoming, in-state freshmen. He also increased the value of Ohio State Land Grant Opportunity Scholarships to cover the full cost of attendance while doubling the size of the program in 2018.[21]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe action was criticized by both liberal and conservative scholars who felt it hindered the academic mission of the law school and violated principles of academic freedom. Few believed Drake's claims that it was not the result of outside influence.[24][25] The issue was the subject of an editorial in *The New York Times* on September 14, 2007.[26] Details emerged revealing that UCI had received criticism on the hire from the California Supreme Court's then-Chief Justice Ronald M. George, who criticized Chemerinsky's grasp of death penalty appeals, as well as a group of prominent local Republicans who wanted to stop the appointment, including Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich. \n</fragment>\n</document>",
