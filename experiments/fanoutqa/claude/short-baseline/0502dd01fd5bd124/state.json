The peregrine achieves its highest velocity not in horizontal level flight, but during its characteristic hunting stoop (vertical flight). While stooping, the peregrine falcon soars to a great height, then dives steeply at speeds of over 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph).[1]Assuming the maximum size at 58\u00a0cm, its relative speed clocks at 186 body lengths per second during its hunting swoop, the equivalent of a human running at 170\u00a0m/s (560\u00a0ft/s).\n |\n| 2\n | Golden eagle | 240\u2013320\u00a0km/h (150\u2013200\u00a0mph)67\u201389\u00a0m/s (220\u2013293\u00a0ft/s)[8] | Flight-diving\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Eland | 55\u201370\u00a0km/h (34\u201343\u00a0mph)[62] | Estimated by observing the odometer when an animal ran at its maximum speed, alongside a vehicle on a road.\n |\n| Coyote | 60\u201365\u00a0km/h (37\u201340\u00a0mph)[m] | Coyotes can easily reach 48\u00a0km/h (30\u00a0mph), and can sprint at 65\u00a0km/h (40\u00a0mph) when hunting.[95] Even without a front foot, a coyote can still run at around 32\u00a0km/h (20\u00a0mph).[94] |\n| Big brown bat(flight) | 56\u201364\u00a0km/h (35\u201340\u00a0mph)\n | Big brown bats are reported to be one of the fastest bats reaching speeds of up to 40\u00a0mph.[97] |\n| Common dolphin(swimming) | 55\u201364\u00a0km/h (34\u201340\u00a0mph)[n] | Common dolphins are the fastest marine mammals.

On this basis the 'fastest' organism on earth, relative to its body length, is the Southern Californian mite, *Paratarsotomus macropalpis*, which has a speed of 322\u00a0body lengths per second.[4] The equivalent speed for a human, running as fast as this mite, would be 1,300\u00a0mph (2,092\u00a0km/h),[5] or approximately Mach 1.7. The speed of the *P. macropalpis* is far in excess of the previous record holder, the Australian tiger beetle *Cicindela eburneola*, which is the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, with a recorded speed of 1.86 metres per second (6.7\u00a0km/h; 4.2\u00a0mph), or 171\u00a0body lengths per second.[6] The cheetah, the fastest land mammal, scores at only 16\u00a0body lengths per second,[4] while Anna's hummingbird has the highest known length-specific velocity attained by any vertebrate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Frigatebird | 153\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph)\n | The frigatebird's high speed is helped by its having the largest wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird.\n |\n| Rock dove (pigeon)\n | 148.9\u00a0km/h (92.5\u00a0mph)[14] | Pigeons have been clocked flying 92.5\u00a0mph (148.9\u00a0km/h) average speed on a 400-mile (640\u00a0km) race.\n |\n| Spur-winged goose | 142\u00a0km/h (88\u00a0mph)\n |  |\n| Red-breasted merganser | 129\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph)[46] |  |\n| Gyrfalcon | 127\u00a0km/h (79\u00a0mph)\n |  |\n| Grey-headed albatross | 127\u00a0km/h (79\u00a0mph)[16][17] |  |\n| Anna's hummingbird | 98.27\u00a0km/h (61.06\u00a0mph)[24] | The stated speed equals 276 body lengths per second, the highest known length-specific velocity attained by any vertebrate.\n |\n| Ostrich(on land) | 80\u201390\u00a0km/h (50\u201356\u00a0mph)[25] | The ostrich is the fastest bird on land, as well as the fastest running animal on two legs.[47][48]\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus)\n- Maximum speed: 389 km/h (242 mph)\n- Achieves this speed during its hunting dive (stoop)\n\n2. Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos)\n- Maximum speed: 240-320 km/h (150-200 mph)\n- Achieves this speed during its hunting stoop\n\n3. White-throated Needletail (Hirundapus caudacutus)\n- Maximum speed: 169 km/h (105 mph)\n- Fastest bird in level (flapping) flight\n\n4. Mexican Free-tailed Bat (Tadarida brasiliensis)\n- Maximum speed: 160 km/h (99 mph)\n- Fastest mammal in level flight\n\n5. Eurasian Hobby (Falco subbuteo)\n- Maximum speed: 160 km/h (100 mph)\n- Can sometimes outfly swifts when hunting\n\nIt's worth noting that if we're considering only land animals, the Cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is the fastest with a reliably measured speed of 104 km/h (64.6 mph), and if we're considering marine animals, the Sailfish (Istiophorus) is reported to reach speeds of about 109 km/h (68 mph), though some of these water speed measurements are debated.",
