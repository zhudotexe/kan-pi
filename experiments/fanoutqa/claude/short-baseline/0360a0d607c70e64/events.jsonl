He associated it with the legend of the wall mentioned in the Qur'an,[42] which Dhul-Qarnayn (commonly associated with Alexander the Great) was said to have erected to protect people near the land of the rising sun from the savages of Gog and Magog. However, Ibn Battuta could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that although there were remnants of the wall at that time, they were not significant.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen China opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the First and Second Opium Wars, the Great Wall became a main attraction for tourists. The travelogues of the later 19th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the Great Wall.[50]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\nA formal definition of what constitutes a \"Great Wall\" has not been agreed upon, making the full course of the Great Wall difficult to describe in its entirety.[51] The defensive lines contain multiple stretches of ramparts, trenches and ditches, as well as individual fortresses.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Wong, Edward (June 29, 2015). \"China Fears Loss of Great Wall, Brick by Brick\". *The New York Times*.

Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTransporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today. The human cost of the construction is unknown, but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands[26] of workers died building the Qin wall. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Yule 1866, p. 579This section is the report of Góis's travel, as reported by Matteo Ricci in *De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas* (published 1615), annotated by Henry Yule).\n48. **^** Waldron 1990, pp. 2–4.\n49. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Waldron 1990, p. 206.\n50. **^** Waldron 1990, p. 209.\n51. **^** Hessler 2007, p. 60.\n52. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Great Wall of China 'even longer'\".

He associated it with the legend of the wall mentioned in the Qur'an,[42] which Dhul-Qarnayn (commonly associated with Alexander the Great) was said to have erected to protect people near the land of the rising sun from the savages of Gog and Magog. However, Ibn Battuta could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that although there were remnants of the wall at that time, they were not significant.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen China opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the First and Second Opium Wars, the Great Wall became a main attraction for tourists. The travelogues of the later 19th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the Great Wall.[50]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\nA formal definition of what constitutes a \"Great Wall\" has not been agreed upon, making the full course of the Great Wall difficult to describe in its entirety.[51] The defensive lines contain multiple stretches of ramparts, trenches and ditches, as well as individual fortresses.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Wong, Edward (June 29, 2015). \"China Fears Loss of Great Wall, Brick by Brick\". *The New York Times*.

Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTransporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult, so builders always tried to use local resources. Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges, while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains. There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls. Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries, and very few sections remain today. The human cost of the construction is unknown, but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands[26] of workers died building the Qin wall. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** Yule 1866, p. 579This section is the report of Góis's travel, as reported by Matteo Ricci in *De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas* (published 1615), annotated by Henry Yule).\n48. **^** Waldron 1990, pp. 2–4.\n49. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Waldron 1990, p. 206.\n50. **^** Waldron 1990, p. 209.\n51. **^** Hessler 2007, p. 60.\n52. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Great Wall of China 'even longer'\".

He then dressed himself up as a local, and only spoke in Arabic, bringing a goat with him with the intent of sacrificing it in honor of Aaron's Tomb. After one day of exploring, he was convinced that he had found the lost city of Petra.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Paradise T.R. & Angel C.C. 2015, Nabatean Architecture and the Sun, ArcUser (Winter) Archived 2015-04-02 at the Wayback Machine.\n61. **^** Negev 11\n62. **^** Gibson, Dan (2017). *Early Islamic Qiblas: A survey of mosques built between 1AH/622 C.E. and 263 AH/876 C.E*.

He explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of Moses, when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the Israelites. Hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city, from rock-cut systems on the canyon rim.[40]\n\n\nNumerous scrolls in Greek and dating to the Byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the Temple of the Winged Lions in Petra in December 1993.[41]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Afro-Eurasia | * Bandiagara Escarpment\n* Ellora Caves\n* Guyaju Caves\n* Petra\n |\n| Americas | * Cuarenta Casas\n* Huápoca\n |\n\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Heritage Sites in Jordan\n |\n| --- |\n| * Al-Maghtas\n* Salt\n* Petra\n* Qusayr 'Amra\n* Umm ar-Rasas\n* Wadi Rum\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nColonies of Ancient Rome\n |\n| --- |\n| With correspondence to modern geography\n |\n| Europe | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Britannia Superior | * Camulodunum\n* Lindum Colonia\n* Londinium\n |\n| Britannia Inferior | * Eboracum\n |\n| Roman Dacia | * Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa\n |\n| Gallia Lugdunensis | * Lugdunum\n |\n| Gallia Narbonensis | * Narbo Martius\n |\n| Germania Inferior | * Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium\n* Mogontiacum\n |\n| Hispania | * Augusta Emerita\n |\n| Italia | * Aelia Augusta Aeclanum\n* Castra Taurinorum\n* Florentia\n* Mediolanum\n* Placentia\n |\n| Moesia | * Singidunum\n |\n\n | ![](image)![](image)\n |\n| Levant | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985.
