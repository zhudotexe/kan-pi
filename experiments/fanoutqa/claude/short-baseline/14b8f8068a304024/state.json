PMID\u00a021378920.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rules for the Nobel Prize in Physics require that the significance of achievements being recognized has been \"tested by time\". In practice, that means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. For example, half of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar for his work on stellar structure and evolution that was done during the 1930s. As a downside of this tested-by-time rule, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a prize, as the discoverers die by the time the impact of their work is appreciated.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\nA Physics Nobel Prize laureate is awarded a gold medal, a diploma bearing a citation, and a sum of money.[19]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nobel Prize medal \u00a7\u00a0Physics and Chemistry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe committee and institution serving as the selection board for the prize typically announce the names of the laureates during the first week of October. The prize is then awarded at formal ceremonies held annually in Stockholm Concert Hall on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The laureates receive a diploma, a medal and a document confirming the prize amount.[30]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Nobel laureates in Physics\n* Fundamental Physics Prize\n* List of physics awards\n* Sakurai Prize, presented by the American Physical Society\n* Wolf Prize in Physics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen (1845\u20131923), the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics\nThe **Nobel Prize in Physics** (Swedish: *Nobelpriset i fysik*) is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who have made the most outstanding contributions for humankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901, the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Physics is traditionally the first award presented in the Nobel Prize ceremony.\n\n\nThe prize consists of a medal along with a diploma and a certificate for the monetary award. The front side of the medal displays the same profile of Alfred Nobel depicted on the medals for Physics, Chemistry, and Literature.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Nobel laureates are selected by the Nobel Committee for Physics, a Nobel Committee that consists of five members elected by The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. During the first stage that begins in September, a group of about 3,000 selected university professors, Nobel Laureates in Physics and Chemistry, and others are sent confidential nomination forms. The completed forms must arrive at the Nobel Committee by 31 January of the following year. The nominees are scrutinized and discussed by experts and are narrowed to approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations on the final candidates to the Academy, where, in the Physics Class, it is further discussed. The Academy then makes the final selection of the Laureates in Physics by a majority vote.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Three Nobel Laureates in Physics. Front row L-R: Albert A. Michelson (1907 laureate), Albert Einstein (1921 laureate), and Robert A. Millikan (1923 laureate).\nA maximum of three Nobel laureates and two different works may be selected for the Nobel Prize in Physics.[12] Compared with other Nobel Prizes, the nomination and selection process for the prize in physics is long and rigorous. This is a key reason why it has grown in importance over the years to become the most important prize in Physics.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Friedman, Robert Marc (2001). *The Politics of Excellence: Behind the Nobel Prize in Science*.

The Genius of Science holds the veil which covers Nature's 'cold and austere face'.[21] It was designed by Erik Lindberg and is manufactured by Svenska Medalj in Eskilstuna.[21] It is inscribed \"Inventas vitam iuvat excoluisse per artes\" (\"It is beneficial to have improved (human) life through discovered arts\") an adaptation of \"inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes\" from line 663 from book 6 of the *Aeneid* by the Roman poet Virgil.[22] A plate below the figures is inscribed with the name of the recipient.

The other prize-awarding organisations followed: the Karolinska Institutet on 7 June, the Swedish Academy on 9 June, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on 11 June.[9][10] The Nobel Foundation then established guidelines for awarding the prizes. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II.[8][11] According to Nobel's will, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences would award the Prize in Physics.[11]\n\n\n\n## Nomination and selection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMajor branches of physics\n |\n| --- |\n| Divisions | * Pure\n* Applied\n\t+ Engineering\n |\n| Approaches | * Experimental\n* Theoretical\n\t+ Computational\n |\n| Classical | * Classical mechanics\n\t+ Newtonian\n\t+ Analytical\n\t+ Celestial\n\t+ Continuum\n* Acoustics\n* Classical electromagnetism\n* Classical optics\n\t+ Ray\n\t+ Wave\n* Thermodynamics\n\t+ Statistical\n\t+ Non-equilibrium\n |\n| Modern | * Relativistic mechanics\n\t+ Special\n\t+ General\n* Nuclear physics\n* Quantum mechanics\n* Particle physics\n* Atomic, molecular, and optical physics\n\t+ Atomic\n\t+ Molecular\n\t+ Modern optics\n* Condensed matter physics\n |\n| Interdisciplinary | * Astrophysics\n* Atmospheric physics\n* Biophysics\n* Chemical physics\n* Geophysics\n* Materials science\n* Mathematical physics\n* Medical physics\n* Ocean physics\n* Quantum information science\n |\n| Related | * History of physics\n* Nobel Prize in Physics\n* Philosophy of physics\n* Physics education\n* Timeline of physics discoveries\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
