In July 2007, the British Advertising Standards Authority attacked L'Oréal for a television advert on its \"Telescopic\" mascara, featuring Penélope Cruz, stating, \"it will make your eyelashes 60% longer.\" In fact, it only made the lashes look 60% bigger, by separating and thickening at the roots and by thickening the tips of the lashes. They also failed to state that the model was wearing false eyelashes.[149]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nL'Oréal got its start in the hair-color business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products.

In July 2007, the British Advertising Standards Authority attacked L'Oréal for a television advert on its \"Telescopic\" mascara, featuring Penélope Cruz, stating, \"it will make your eyelashes 60% longer.\" In fact, it only made the lashes look 60% bigger, by separating and thickening at the roots and by thickening the tips of the lashes.
