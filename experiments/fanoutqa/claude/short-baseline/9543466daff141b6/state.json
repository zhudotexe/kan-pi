Nestl\u00e9 has owned a stake in L'Oreal since 1974, when it bought into the company at the request of Liliane Bettencourt, the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal, who was trying to prevent French state intervention.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decl\u00e9or brands to L'Or\u00e9al for \u20ac227.5 million (US$312.93 million (2014)).[16]\n\n\nIn June 2014, L'Or\u00e9al agreed to acquire NYX Cosmetics for an undisclosed price, bolstering its makeup offerings in North America, where its consumer-products unit has faltered.[17]\n\n\nIn September 2014, L'Or\u00e9al announced it had agreed to purchase Brazilian hair care company Niely Cosmeticos Group for an undisclosed amount.[18]\n\n\nIn September 2014, L'Or\u00e9al acquired the multi-cultural brand Carol's Daughter.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 2007, L'Or\u00e9al was one of several cosmetic manufacturers (along with Clinique, Estee Lauder, Payot, Lanc\u00f4me)[147] ordered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia to withdraw advertising regarding the wrinkle removal capabilities of their products.[148]\n\n\nIn the UK, L'Or\u00e9al has faced criticism from OFCOM regarding the truth of their advertising and marketing campaigns concerning the product performance of one of their mascara brands. In July 2007, the British Advertising Standards Authority attacked L'Or\u00e9al for a television advert on its \"Telescopic\" mascara, featuring Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, stating, \"it will make your eyelashes 60% longer.\" In fact, it only made the lashes look 60% bigger, by separating and thickening at the roots and by thickening the tips of the lashes. They also failed to state that the model was wearing false eyelashes.[149]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nL'Or\u00e9al got its start in the hair-color business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. L'Or\u00e9al currently markets over 500 brands and thousands of individual products in all sectors of the beauty business: hair color, permanents, hair styling, body and skincare, cleansers, makeup, and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide variety of distribution channels, from hair salons and perfumeries to supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies, and direct mail.[5][6]\n\n\n\n### Recent History[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Liliane Bettencourt the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal, passed away and left the business to her daughter, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers.[5]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nIn 1988\u201389, L'Or\u00e9al controlled the film company Paravisi\u00f3n, whose properties included the Filmation and De Laurentiis libraries.
