Elizabeth Magill.\n\n\n\n\n**Elizabeth Magill** (born 1959 in Ontario, Canada) is an Irish painter. She studied at the Belfast College of Art and the Slade School of Fine Art, and now lives and works in London.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography\n\n[edit]\n\nMagill grew up in Northern Ireland but lives and works in London. She began exhibiting in the mid-1980s. She is a painter of prodigious versatility and inventiveness whose work has always drawn from a wide range of visual sources. While she has often integrated photographic materials and processes into her painting, in a number of novel ways, and has recently made an excursion into video, her primary fidelity has been to the medium of painting, in all its bewildering variety. Over the past few years her typically idiosyncratic revisioning of the tradition of the romantic sublime has resulted in a series of hauntingly distressed paintings of the landscape. Her first major solo exhibition was at the Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol, in 1990. In the same year she was included in the seminal 'British Art Show', which first introduced many of the most prominent younger British artists to a wider public.\n\n\nShe has had one-person exhibitions at various venues in Ireland, Britain, Germany, France and Spain, including Southampton City Art Gallery in 1998; Kerlin Gallery in 1999; Wilkinson Gallery London in 2002, 2008; Greenberg Van Doren Gallery in New York, the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery Dublin in 2003 and the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham; Baltic, Gateshead and Milton Keynes Gallery in 2004. She has held fellowships at the Tate Gallery, Liverpool and Saarlandisches Kunstlerhaus, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany. Selected group exhibitions include 'Places in Mind', (with Adam Chodzko and Stan Douglas), Ormeau Baths Gallery, Belfast 2000, and 'Premio Michetti 2000' at Fondazione Michetti, Italy.\n\n\n\u2018Headland\u2019 was a major solo exhibition by Magill in Ireland (2017-18) which was curated and toured by Limerick City Gallery of Art in partnership with the RHA, Dublin, and the Ulster Museum, Belfast, and supported through the Arts Council of Ireland\u2019s Touring and Dissemination of Work Scheme. The exhibition launched at LCGA on 8 September 2017, with an introduction by Dr. Barbara Dawson, Director of the Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin. It was subsequently presented at the RHA from 18 January 2018 and the Ulster Museum from May 2018 onward. [1]\n\n\nMagill is represented in many public and private collections worldwide including those of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Hugh Lane Gallery, Dublin the Arts Council of England, Southampton City Art Gallery, the British Council, and the National Gallery of Australia.\n\n\n\n## Themes and techniques\n\n[edit]\n\nA principal theme of Magill's work is \"hauntingly distressed paintings of the landscape\".[2] For recent work, the creation process begins with a photograph which is scanned and the resulting image sprayed on canvas before being overpainted with oils to add highlights and contrast. The result has been compared stylistically with that of the German Romantic painter Caspar David Friedrich (1774\u20131840).[3] She has described her work as \n\n\n\n\n> \n> \"I'm not so much painting what is there but what I imagine might be there...These works are not landscapes as such, but more like suggested backdrops to how I feel, think and interpret the world.\"[4]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\nApparent influences are the glens and coastline of Northern Ireland, where she spent most of her childhood, but the emptiness of the landscapes themselves is generally tempered by empty houses, electricity pylons, and the like, giving a sense of absence of human life and wistful isolation.\n\n\n## Exhibitions\n\n[edit]\n\nHer first major solo exhibition was at the Arnolfini Gallery, Bristol, in 1990. In the same year she was included in the seminal 'British Art Show', which first introduced many prominent younger British artists to a wider public.\n\n\nShe has had one-person exhibitions at various venues throughout Western Europe including\n\n\n\n* 1998 - Southampton City Art Gallery\n* 1999 - Kerlin Gallery\n* 2002 - Anthony Wilkinson Gallery, London\n* 2003 - Artemis Greenberg Van Doren Gallery, New York\n* 2003 - Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery, Dublin\n\n\nMagill has held fellowships at the Tate Liverpool and Saarlandisches Kunstlerhaus, Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany. Her work has also featured in several group exhibitions, including\n\n\n\n* 2000 - 'Places in Mind', (with Adam Chodzko and Stan Douglas), Ormeau Baths Gallery, Belfast\n* 2000 - 'Premio Michetti 2000' at Fondazione Michetti, Italy.\n\n\nMagill is represented in many public and private collections worldwide including those of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Arts Council of England, Southampton City Art Gallery, the British Council and the National Gallery of Australia.\n\n\nIn 2006 Sotheby's Auction House reported achieving a record price for Magill's work at an auction of Irish Artists.[5]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Interview \u2013 with Elizabeth Magill, 'Biographical Landscapes', The Visual Artist's News Sheet, Sept/Oct 2017\". *Joanne Laws*. 4 September 2017.

In preparation for this expansion in mission, William Smith was hired in 1754 to become the new provost. Neither George Whitefield nor Benjamin Franklin formally held this title.\n2. **^** Benjamin Franklin is the founder of the institution which grew to become the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin first convened a board of trustees for an organizational meeting on November 13, 1749. They opened a secondary school, the Academy of Philadelphia, in 1751. A collegiate charter was obtained for the College of Philadelphia in 1755 and post-secondary instruction began shortly thereafter. It was the College of Philadelphia which ultimately was renamed the University of Pennsylvania in 1791. Penn considered 1749 to be its founding date until 1899, when the board of trustees voted to retroactively revise its founding date to 1740 in order to make the university older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746. The 1740 date was selected because, in that year, a group of Philadelphians joined together to build a large preaching hall for the use of traveling evangelist George Whitefield who toured the American colonies delivering well attended open air sermons. The grand building was erected but, due to a shortage of funding, the interior was not furnished and the hall sat unused until Franklin's group purchased it in 1750. Thus, Whitefield himself was not involved in the school which eventually became Penn, but is listed here as a placeholder to signify the period that the preaching hall raised by his followers sat dormant between 1740 and 1750.\n3. **^** As described in more detail in the appended notes, a charity school was planned by followers of George Whitefield but it never opened before the building was purchased by Benjamin Franklin's group in 1750. The structure itself was known as the \"New Building\" but the associated educational trust itself was never named.\n4. **^** Franklin's formal title was president of the board of trustees, first of the \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania\" until the college was founded, and then of the \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Schools | * Arts and Sciences\n\t+ College\n\t+ Graduate Division\n\t+ Liberal and Professional Studies\n* Communication\n* Dental Medicine\n* Design\n* Education\n* Engineering and Applied Science\n* Law\n* Medicine\n* Nursing\n* Social Policy and Practice\n* Veterinary Medicine\n* Wharton\n | ![Benjamin Franklin (University of Pennsylvania)](image)\n |\n| Programs | * Advanced Judaic Studies\n* Government\n* Global Communication Studies\n* Mediterranean Art and Archaeology\n* International Studies and Business\n* Management and Technology\n* Lauder Institute\n* Health Economics\n* Networked and Social Systems Engineering\n* Molecular Life Science\n* Public Policy\n* Diplomacy and Global Engagement\n |\n| Places | * University City\n* Annenberg Center\n* College Hall\n* College Houses\n* David Rittenhouse Laboratory\n* Fisher Fine Arts Library\n* Historic District\n* Houston Hall\n* Institute of Contemporary Art\n* Irvine Auditorium\n* Kelly Writers House\n* Meyerson Hall\n* Moore School\n* Morris Arboretum\n* Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n* New Bolton Center\n* Penn Park\n* Perelman Quadrangle\n* The Quadrangle\n* Richards Laboratories\n* Van Pelt Library\n |\n| Athletics | * Penn Quakers\n* Band\n* \"Fight on, Pennsylvania!\"\n* Basketball\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Football\n* College Boat Club\n* Lacrosse\n* Penn Relays\n* Soccer\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Men's squash\n* Class of 1923 Arena\n* Franklin Field\n* Meiklejohn Stadium\n* Palestra\n |\n| Media | * *The Daily Pennsylvanian*\n\t+ *34th Street Magazine*\n\t+ *Under the Button*\n* *Pennsylvania Punch Bowl*\n* Penn Press\n* Wharton School Publishing\n* WQHS\n* WXPN\n |\n| Life | * Student life\n* Penn Band\n* Mask and Wig\n* Glee Club\n* Masala\n* MERT\n* Philomathean Society\n* Penn Club of New York\n* \"Hail, Pennsylvania!\"\n* \"The Red and Blue\"\n |\n| People | * **President:** J.

Under her superb leadership, Penn is a stronger and more vibrant institution than at any time in its storied history.\"[53] In November 2016 Cohen, still Board Chairman, announced that Gutmann's contract would be extended until 2022, making her the longest-serving president ever at Penn.[54]\n\n\nIn 2017, Gutmann's total compensation was $2.9 million, making her the highest paid private college president in Pennsylvania and fourth highest in the United States.[55]\n\n\n\n### United States Ambassador to Germany[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### Fundraising and scholarships[edit]\n\n\nAs president, Gutmann oversaw Penn's largest fundraising campaign ever, Power of Penn, which concluded in 2021 with a total of $5.4 billion[26] and included priorities such as a \"Penn First Plus\" initiative, targeted to support first-generation, low-income students.[27] She previously led the Making History campaign, launched in 2007, which raised a record $4.3 billion, exceeding its goal by more than $800 million. It achieved its $3.5-billion target 16 months ahead of its December 31, 2012, conclusion. It was an unusually broad-based campaign, attracting gifts from nearly 327,000 donors.[28] Gutmann is the only Penn president to lead two fundraising campaigns, and since 2004 she has helped raise over $10 billion for Penn.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2017, one out of eight incoming Penn students were the first in their families to attend college, up from one out of 20 in 2004.[30] She and her husband Michael Doyle have also funded an endowed undergraduate scholarship and an undergraduate research fund at Penn.[31][32] In 2017, they committed an additional more than $1 million for scholarships, supporting multiple students and matching funds for other donors.[33] In 2020, Gutmann and Doyle donated $2 million to Penn's nursing school to establish leadership scholarships for undergraduates and graduates who are passionate about making lasting impact in underserved urban and rural communities.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn her 2004 inaugural address, Gutmann launched the Penn Compact.[15] In 2017 she renewed and updated her vision with the Penn Compact 2022,[16] recommitting the university to these ideals and outlining the next steps: First, to increase inclusion at the university with increases in faculty and student diversity.[17] Second, to integrate knowledge across academic disciplines with a strong emphasis on innovation: Penn was named No. 4 in Reuters' Top 100 World Innovative Universities in 2017,[18] 2018,[19] and 2019,[20] and the university is consistently helping to facilitate commercialization agreements, ringing in over 650 in 2017 (up from fewer than 50 just a decade prior).[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** Crimmens, Peter (September 14, 2011). \"Penn Park Opens Vistas and Green Space to all Philadelphians\". *Newsworks.org*.
