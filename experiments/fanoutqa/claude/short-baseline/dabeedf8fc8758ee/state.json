According to the most recent data, Germany's population is 84,432,670 (31 March 2023)[1] making it the most populous country in the European Union and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. The total fertility rate was rated at 1.58 in 2021,[6] significantly below the replacement rate of 2.1. For a long time Germany had one of the world's lowest fertility rates of around 1.3 to 1.4, however there has been a small increase in recent years.[7] Due to the low birth rate Germany has recorded more deaths than births every year since 1972,[8] which means 2021 was the 50th consecutive year the German population would have decreased without immigration. However, due to immigration the population has actually increased during the last half-century. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLanguages spoken at home, 2022 micro census\n| Language\n | Absolute number\n | Percentage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 83,103,000\n | 100.00\n |\n| Only German\n | 65,440,000\n | 78.75\n |\n| Mostly German\n | 4,125,000\n | 4.96\n |\n| Mostly another language\n | 13,538,000\n | 16.29\n |\n| Of which\n | Albanian | 509,000\n | 0.61\n |\n|  | Arabic | 1,348,000\n | 1.62\n |\n| Bosnian | 237,000\n | 0.29\n |\n| Bulgarian | 218,000\n | 0.26\n |\n| Chinese | 145,000\n | 0.17\n |\n| Danish | 15,000\n | 0.02\n |\n| English | 861,000\n | 1.04\n |\n| French | 190,000\n | 0.23\n |\n| Greek | 286,000\n | 0.34\n |\n| Italian | 496,000\n | 0.60\n |\n| Croatian | 384,000\n | 0.46\n |\n| Kurdish | 511,000\n | 0.61\n |\n| Macedonian | 87,000\n | 0.10\n |\n| Dutch | 97,000\n | 0.12\n |\n| Pahto | 36,000\n | 0.04\n |\n| Persian | 391,000\n | 0.47\n |\n| Polish | 937,000\n | 1.13\n |\n| Portuguese | 167,000\n | 0.20\n |\n| Romanian | 670,000\n | 0.81\n |\n| Russian | 1,639,000\n | 1.97\n |\n| Serbian | 252,000\n | 0.30\n |\n| Spanish | 284,000\n | 0.34\n |\n| Turkish | 1,879,000\n | 2.26\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 2 247 196\n | 2 614 043\n | 4 861 239\n | 6.06\n |\n| 75-79\n | 1 413 881\n | 1 856 402\n | 3 270 283\n | 4.08\n |\n| 80-84\n | 878 797\n | 1 449 286\n | 2 328 083\n | 2.90\n |\n| 85-89\n | 369 029\n | 966 047\n | 1 335 076\n | 1.66\n |\n| 90-94\n | 95 074\n | 335 526\n | 430 600\n | 0.54\n |\n| 95-99\n | 17 388\n | 88 656\n | 106 044\n | 0.13\n |\n| 100+\n | 1 679\n | 11 766\n | 13 445\n | 0.02\n |\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | Percent\n |\n| 0\u201314\n | 5 545 201\n | 5 260 090\n | 10 805 291\n | 13.47\n |\n| 15\u201364\n | 26 578 409\n | 26 317 874\n | 52 896 283\n | 65.94\n |\n| 65+\n | 7 022 331\n | 9 495 790\n | 16 518 121\n | 20.59\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
