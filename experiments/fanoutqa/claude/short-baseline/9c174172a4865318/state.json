By 1960 it had surpassed that of Rio de Janeiro, making it Brazil's most populous city. By this time, the urbanized area of S\u00e3o Paulo had extended beyond the boundaries of the municipality proper into neighboring municipalities, making it a metropolitan area with a population of 4.6 million. Population growth has continued since 1960, although the rate of growth has slowed.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2013, S\u00e3o Paulo was the most populous city in Brazil and in South America.[86] According to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 11,244,369 people residing in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo.[87] Portuguese remains the most widely spoken language and S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in the Portuguese speaking world.[88]\n\n\nIn 2010, the city had 2,146,077 opposite-sex couples and 7,532 same-sex couples. The population of S\u00e3o Paulo was 52.6% female and 47.4% male.[89] The census found 6,824,668 White people (60.6%), 3,433,218 Pardo (multiracial) people (30.5%), 736,083 Black people (6.5%), 246,244 Asian people (2.2%) and 21,318 Amerindian people (0.2%).[89]\n\n\n\n### Immigration and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**S\u00e3o Paulo** (/\u02ccsa\u028a \u02c8pa\u028alo\u028a/, Portuguese: [s\u0250\u0303w\u0303 \u02c8pawlu] \u24d8; Portuguese for 'Saint Paul') is the most populous city in Brazil and the capital of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, S\u00e3o Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundia\u00ed, Sorocaba and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos) created the S\u00e3o Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMost populous city in Brazil\n\nThis article is about the city.
