China (Population: ~1.4 billion)\n   Largest city: Shanghai (24.9 million in the city proper, 34 million metro area)\n\n2. India (Population: ~1.4 billion)\n   Largest city: Mumbai (approximately 20 million metro area)\n\n3. United States (Population: ~332 million)\n   Largest city: New York City (approximately 8.8 million city proper, 20 million metro area)\n\n4. Indonesia (Population: ~274 million)\n   Largest city: Jakarta (approximately 10.5 million city proper, over 30 million metro area)\n\n5. Pakistan (Population: ~220 million)\n   Largest city: Karachi (approximately 15 million city proper)\n\nThese population figures are approximate and constantly changing. The metropolitan area populations may vary depending on how the boundaries are defined. It's worth noting that in some cases, there can be debate about which city is the largest, as different measurements (city proper vs. metropolitan area) can yield different results. For example, in China, while Shanghai is generally considered the largest city, Guangzhou-Foshan and Beijing also have very large metropolitan populations.",
