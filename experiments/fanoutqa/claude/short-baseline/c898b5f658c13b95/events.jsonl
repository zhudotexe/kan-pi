After the bear's death in 1911, it was mounted and preserved at the Academy of Sciences at Golden Gate Park.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFlags of the U.S. states and territories, federal district, other political divisions\n |\n| --- |\n| * Flags of cities of the United States\n* Flags of counties of the United States\n* Timeline of U.S. state flags\n |\n| States | * Alabama\n* Alaska\n* Arizona\n* Arkansas\n* California\n* Colorado\n* Connecticut\n* Delaware\n* Florida\n* Georgia\n* Hawaii\n* Idaho\n* Illinois\n* Indiana\n* Iowa\n* Kansas\n* Kentucky\n* Louisiana\n* Maine\n* Maryland\n* Massachusetts\n* Michigan\n* Minnesota\n* Mississippi\n* Missouri\n* Montana\n* Nebraska\n* Nevada\n* New Hampshire\n* New Jersey\n* New Mexico\n* New York\n* North Carolina\n* North Dakota\n* Ohio\n* Oklahoma\n* Oregon\n* Pennsylvania\n* Rhode Island\n* South Carolina\n* South Dakota\n* Tennessee\n* Texas\n* Utah\n* Vermont\n* Virginia\n* Washington\n* West Virginia\n* Wisconsin\n* Wyoming\n |\n| Federal district | Washington, D.C.\n |\n| Territories | * American Samoa\n* Guam\n* Northern Mariana Islands\n* Puerto Rico\n* U.S. Virgin Islands\n |\n| Other | * Associated states\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOfficial flag of the U.S. state of California\n\n\"Bear flag\" redirects here.

It consists of three equal horizontal tribands of red, white, and blue stripes, with the arms from the Great Seal of Missouri in the center. Designed by Mary Elizabeth Oliver, the red and white stripes, as is traditional, represent valor and purity, respectively. The blue represents three things: the permanency, vigilance, and justice of the state. The three colors also highlight the French influence on the state in its early years. The Missouri flag was established on March 22, 1913, when governor Elliot Woolfolk Major signed the State flag act making it official.\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nThe design of the state flag has been modified officially once since 1861. The current version is the longest-used and has been in use for more than 111 years.[1]\n\n\n\n### First flag\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\nMissouri|  |\n| ![Flag of Missouri](image) |\n| Use | State flag ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image)![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) |\n| Proportion | 5:6 |\n| Adopted | June 5, 1861; 163 years ago (1861-06-05) |\n| Relinquished | May 11, 1865; 159 years ago (1865-05-11)[b] |\n| Design | Arms of Missouri in gold centered on a blue field. |\n| Designed by | Robert Wells (arms only) |\n|  |\n\n\nMissouri did not have an official flag until Major-General Sterling Price, commander of the Missouri State Guard,[2] ordered on June 5, 1861:\n\n\n\n\n>  Each regiment will adopt the State flag, made of blue merino, 6 by 5 feet, with the Missouri coat-of-arms in gold gilt on each side.[3]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Flag Act of 1913\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Missouri state flag was designed and stitched in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, by Marie Elizabeth Oliver,[4] the wife of former state senator R. B. Oliver. She began her flag project in 1908 as part of her volunteer activities with the Daughters of the American Revolution when she was appointed chairperson of the Daughters of the American Revolution committee to research and design Missouri's flag. Oliver researched state flags extensively. She wrote each state's secretary of state for information about how their state's flags had been designed and officially adopted. Her original design incorporated Missouri's coat of arms and was rendered as a painted paper flag by her friend Mary Kochitzky.[4]\n\n\nThe flag was brought to the Missouri State Capitol in 1908 and bills to adopt the flag as the official flag of Missouri were introduced by Senator Arthur L. Oliver, her nephew, in 1909 and 1911. Both bills failed to pass in the House. A competing flag design, by G. H. Holcomb and referred to as the \"Holcomb flag\", was opposed due to its resemblance to the flag of the United States and its lack of Missouri symbolism.[1] Oliver's original paper flag was destroyed when the Missouri State Capitol burned in 1911. With Mrs. S. D. MacFarland, Oliver sewed a second flag out of silk. Her design was adopted on March 22, 1913, when governor Elliot Woolfolk Major signed the Oliver Flag Bill.[5] The flag design remains unchanged to this day. The silk flag was kept by Marie Oliver until 1961 when her son Allen gave it to the state of Missouri. The flag was displayed until it began to deteriorate and was put into storage. In 1988, Secretary of State Roy D. Blunt issued a challenge to elementary students to raise money to restore the flag. The campaign was successful and the restored flag has been displayed in the James C. Kirkpatrick State Information Center in Jefferson City ever since.[4]\n\n\nThe Oliver-Leming House, also known as the Home of the Missouri State Flag, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Holcomb flag proposal ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image)\n\n## Design\n\n[edit]\n\nThe flag is a tricolor consisting of three horizontal stripes of red, white and blue which resembles the flag of the Netherlands. These represent valor, purity, vigilance, and justice. The colors also reflect the state's historic status as part of French Louisiana. In the center white stripe is the seal of Missouri, circled by a blue band containing 24 stars, symbolizing Missouri's admission as the 24th U.S. state.[1] The seal itself also contains 24 stars, and incorporates the Great Seal of the United States, which contains a further 13 stars, bringing the flag's grand total to 61 stars. The seal further includes the state motto, *Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto*, which translates from Latin as \"The health (welfare, good, salvation, felicity) of the people should be the supreme law.\" The flag is described in Section 010.020 of Missouri's Revised Statutes. There are no known examples of mass-produced Missouri state flags in compliance with the RSMo due to the 7:12 proportions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIt is one of two U.S. state flags to feature a bear, the other being that of California. It is also one of ten U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wyoming.\n\n\nIn 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial and Canadian provincial flags. The Missouri flag ranked in the bottom 25, 48th out of the 72.[7]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![](image)Heraldry portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of flags by design\n* List of Missouri state symbols\n* List of U.S. state, district, and territorial insignia\n* Flag of Kansas City\n* Flag of St. Louis\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** There are a total of 61 stars on the flag, including the 37 on the state seal: 24 stars in the cloud above the helmet, and 13 stars in the included Great Seal of the United States.\n2. **^** On this date, Missouri Brig.

It consists of three equal horizontal tribands of red, white, and blue stripes, with the arms from the Great Seal of Missouri in the center. Designed by Mary Elizabeth Oliver, the red and white stripes, as is traditional, represent valor and purity, respectively. The blue represents three things: the permanency, vigilance, and justice of the state. The three colors also highlight the French influence on the state in its early years. The Missouri flag was established on March 22, 1913, when governor Elliot Woolfolk Major signed the State flag act making it official.\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nThe design of the state flag has been modified officially once since 1861. The current version is the longest-used and has been in use for more than 111 years.[1]\n\n\n\n### First flag\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\nMissouri|  |\n| ![Flag of Missouri](image) |\n| Use | State flag ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image)![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) |\n| Proportion | 5:6 |\n| Adopted | June 5, 1861; 163 years ago (1861-06-05) |\n| Relinquished | May 11, 1865; 159 years ago (1865-05-11)[b] |\n| Design | Arms of Missouri in gold centered on a blue field. |\n| Designed by | Robert Wells (arms only) |\n|  |\n\n\nMissouri did not have an official flag until Major-General Sterling Price, commander of the Missouri State Guard,[2] ordered on June 5, 1861:\n\n\n\n\n>  Each regiment will adopt the State flag, made of blue merino, 6 by 5 feet, with the Missouri coat-of-arms in gold gilt on each side.[3]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Flag Act of 1913\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Missouri state flag was designed and stitched in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, by Marie Elizabeth Oliver,[4] the wife of former state senator R. B. Oliver. She began her flag project in 1908 as part of her volunteer activities with the Daughters of the American Revolution when she was appointed chairperson of the Daughters of the American Revolution committee to research and design Missouri's flag. Oliver researched state flags extensively. She wrote each state's secretary of state for information about how their state's flags had been designed and officially adopted. Her original design incorporated Missouri's coat of arms and was rendered as a painted paper flag by her friend Mary Kochitzky.[4]\n\n\nThe flag was brought to the Missouri State Capitol in 1908 and bills to adopt the flag as the official flag of Missouri were introduced by Senator Arthur L. Oliver, her nephew, in 1909 and 1911. Both bills failed to pass in the House. A competing flag design, by G. H. Holcomb and referred to as the \"Holcomb flag\", was opposed due to its resemblance to the flag of the United States and its lack of Missouri symbolism.[1] Oliver's original paper flag was destroyed when the Missouri State Capitol burned in 1911. With Mrs. S. D. MacFarland, Oliver sewed a second flag out of silk. Her design was adopted on March 22, 1913, when governor Elliot Woolfolk Major signed the Oliver Flag Bill.[5] The flag design remains unchanged to this day. The silk flag was kept by Marie Oliver until 1961 when her son Allen gave it to the state of Missouri. The flag was displayed until it began to deteriorate and was put into storage. In 1988, Secretary of State Roy D. Blunt issued a challenge to elementary students to raise money to restore the flag. The campaign was successful and the restored flag has been displayed in the James C. Kirkpatrick State Information Center in Jefferson City ever since.[4]\n\n\nThe Oliver-Leming House, also known as the Home of the Missouri State Flag, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Holcomb flag proposal ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image)\n\n## Design\n\n[edit]\n\nThe flag is a tricolor consisting of three horizontal stripes of red, white and blue which resembles the flag of the Netherlands. These represent valor, purity, vigilance, and justice. The colors also reflect the state's historic status as part of French Louisiana. In the center white stripe is the seal of Missouri, circled by a blue band containing 24 stars, symbolizing Missouri's admission as the 24th U.S. state.[1] The seal itself also contains 24 stars, and incorporates the Great Seal of the United States, which contains a further 13 stars, bringing the flag's grand total to 61 stars. The seal further includes the state motto, *Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto*, which translates from Latin as \"The health (welfare, good, salvation, felicity) of the people should be the supreme law.\" The flag is described in Section 010.020 of Missouri's Revised Statutes. There are no known examples of mass-produced Missouri state flags in compliance with the RSMo due to the 7:12 proportions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIt is one of two U.S. state flags to feature a bear, the other being that of California. It is also one of ten U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wyoming.\n\n\nIn 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial and Canadian provincial flags. The Missouri flag ranked in the bottom 25, 48th out of the 72.[7]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![](image)Heraldry portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of flags by design\n* List of Missouri state symbols\n* List of U.S. state, district, and territorial insignia\n* Flag of Kansas City\n* Flag of St. Louis\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** There are a total of 61 stars on the flag, including the 37 on the state seal: 24 stars in the cloud above the helmet, and 13 stars in the included Great Seal of the United States.\n2. **^** On this date, Missouri Brig.

Oregon is the only U.S. State to feature different designs on either side of its flag (the flag of Massachusetts was changed in 1971 to be single-sided).[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nThe current flag of Oregon became official on February 26, 1925.[2] What is believed to be the first flag of Oregon produced was made that year by Meier & Frank, sewn by Marjorie Kennedy and Blanche Cox, employees of the department store.[3] That flag was donated to Eastern Oregon University in 1954 by the grandson of former governor Walter M. Pierce.[3] In 2010, the flag was restored.[3]\n\n\n\n### Proposed change\n\n[edit]\n\nIn anticipation of the Oregon Sesquicentennial in 2009, *The Oregonian* organised a statewide contest in 2008 to redesign the state flag.[4] The newspaper collected and published the entries with the public voting on the winning design. The winning design was created by Randall Gray, a map maker for Clackamas County. In his design, Gray emphasized the beaver found on the current flag's reverse. The star represents Oregon's place in the Union while the green represents the natural wilderness and forests of Oregon.[4] After the contest had started with votes being cast, there were requests for the *Oregonian* to add an 11th option, \"NONE OF THE ABOVE\", meaning, keep the current state flag as it is. In the final tally of votes, \"NONE\" received the most votes.\n\n\n\n#### Finalists\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![Flag A (designed by Gerald H. Black)](image)\n\nFlag A (designed by Gerald H.

In the canton the flag shall bear a representation of the beaver, in gold, facing the hoist. On the fly the flag shall bear a vertical stripe in navy blue, and a white star shall be centered at the vertical halfway point of the stripe. The obverse and reverse of the flag shall be mirror images of each other.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Description\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The flags of the United States and Oregon in Portland, Oregon\nThe flag field is navy blue with all lettering and symbols in gold, representing the state colors of Oregon.[7][8] On the obverse, the legend *STATE OF OREGON* is written above an escutcheon, which also appears in the Oregon state seal. The shield is surrounded by 33 stars, representing Oregon's admission to the Union as the 33rd state.

Pierce.[3] In 2010, the flag was restored.[3]\n\n\n\n### Proposed change\n\n[edit]\n\nIn anticipation of the Oregon Sesquicentennial in 2009, *The Oregonian* organised a statewide contest in 2008 to redesign the state flag.[4] The newspaper collected and published the entries with the public voting on the winning design. The winning design was created by Randall Gray, a map maker for Clackamas County. In his design, Gray emphasized the beaver found on the current flag's reverse. The star represents Oregon's place in the Union while the green represents the natural wilderness and forests of Oregon.[4] After the contest had started with votes being cast, there were requests for the *Oregonian* to add an 11th option, \"NONE OF THE ABOVE\", meaning, keep the current state flag as it is. In the final tally of votes, \"NONE\" received the most votes.\n\n\n\n#### Finalists\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![Flag A (designed by Gerald H. Black)](image)\n\nFlag A (designed by Gerald H.

In the canton the flag shall bear a representation of the beaver, in gold, facing the hoist. On the fly the flag shall bear a vertical stripe in navy blue, and a white star shall be centered at the vertical halfway point of the stripe. The obverse and reverse of the flag shall be mirror images of each other.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Description\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The flags of the United States and Oregon in Portland, Oregon\nThe flag field is navy blue with all lettering and symbols in gold, representing the state colors of Oregon.[7][8] On the obverse, the legend *STATE OF OREGON* is written above an escutcheon, which also appears in the Oregon state seal. The shield is surrounded by 33 stars, representing Oregon's admission to the Union as the 33rd state.

The flag was officially adopted July 1, 1912, and is often referred to as the Pelican flag.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nAs early as 1812 the brown pelican appeared on the Louisiana state seal, various militia company colors, and uniform buttons. \n\n\n\n### First flag\n\n[edit]\n\nOn February 11, 1861, the state adopted a flag with a pale yellow star in a red canton and thirteen blue, white, and red stripes. The first flag was used until the end of the Civil War.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| 1861 state flag proposal ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) | 1861 state flag proposal ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) | State flag (1861–1865) ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) |\n\n |\n\n\n### 1912 Flag\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 1, 1912, the centennial of statehood, the State Legislature adopted the flag design depicting a pelican vulning herself.[3] However, beyond stating that the pelican be rendered \"in white,\" the 1912 law did not specify details about the design of the pelican, its number of chicks, or other details. This led to the bird's appearance varying. \n\n\n\n### 21st Century Standardization\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 19th century it was traditional on the state flag and seal for the pelican in her piety to have three drops of blood on her chest.[4] In later years, however, the tradition (on both the state flag and seal) was haphazardly followed, which was noticed by an eighth-grader at Vandebilt Catholic High School in Houma, who brought this to the attention of his state legislator.[4]\n\n\nOn May 25, 2006, a law was enacted requiring the flag to include \"an appropriate display of three droops of blood\" on the pelican's breast;[5][6] however, it wasn't until November 22, 2010, that a formal redesign of the flag with standardized imagery was formally introduced.[7][8] Baton Rouge artist Curtis Vann Jr., who was hired to design a standardized pelican for the updated flag, used a more realistic depiction of a brown pelican for his design, although rendered in white as required by law, but he also incorporated the brown pelican's yellow–brown crown.

The flag was officially adopted July 1, 1912, and is often referred to as the Pelican flag.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nAs early as 1812 the brown pelican appeared on the Louisiana state seal, various militia company colors, and uniform buttons. \n\n\n\n### First flag\n\n[edit]\n\nOn February 11, 1861, the state adopted a flag with a pale yellow star in a red canton and thirteen blue, white, and red stripes. The first flag was used until the end of the Civil War.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| 1861 state flag proposal ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) | 1861 state flag proposal ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) | State flag (1861–1865) ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) |\n\n |\n\n\n### 1912 Flag\n\n[edit]\n\nOn July 1, 1912, the centennial of statehood, the State Legislature adopted the flag design depicting a pelican vulning herself.[3] However, beyond stating that the pelican be rendered \"in white,\" the 1912 law did not specify details about the design of the pelican, its number of chicks, or other details. This led to the bird's appearance varying. \n\n\n\n### 21st Century Standardization\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 19th century it was traditional on the state flag and seal for the pelican in her piety to have three drops of blood on her chest.[4] In later years, however, the tradition (on both the state flag and seal) was haphazardly followed, which was noticed by an eighth-grader at Vandebilt Catholic High School in Houma, who brought this to the attention of his state legislator.[4]\n\n\nOn May 25, 2006, a law was enacted requiring the flag to include \"an appropriate display of three droops of blood\" on the pelican's breast;[5][6] however, it wasn't until November 22, 2010, that a formal redesign of the flag with standardized imagery was formally introduced.[7][8] Baton Rouge artist Curtis Vann Jr., who was hired to design a standardized pelican for the updated flag, used a more realistic depiction of a brown pelican for his design, although rendered in white as required by law, but he also incorporated the brown pelican's yellow–brown crown. The design also specified an azure field and removed \"and\" from the banner beneath the pelican's nest.[8][9]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| State flag (1912–2006) ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) | State flag (2006–2010) ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) | State flag (2010–present) ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) |\n\n |\n\n\n## Symbolism\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Stained glass depiction of *The Pelican in Her Piety* from a Catholic church in Saint-Bonnet-la-Riviera, France. \nIn medieval lore, pelicans were believed to be attentive to the needs of their chicks to the point of drawing their own blood to feed their chicks when no other food was available.
