Within the park a total of sixteen mountains reach higher than 5,000 feet (1,520\u00a0m).[18]\n\n\nThe wide range of elevations mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern United States. Ascending the mountains is comparable to a trip from Tennessee to Canada. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Great Smoky Mountains National Park has two climate types: humid subtropical (Cfa), and temperate oceanic (Cfb).[*citation needed*] The plant hardiness zone at Clingmans Dome Visitor Center is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of \u221214.3\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221225.7\u00a0\u00b0C).[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** \"New Report Ranks Five Most-Polluted National Parks\".

The park straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The park contains some of the highest mountains in eastern North America, including Clingmans Dome, Mount Guyot, and Mount Le Conte. The border between the two states runs northeast to southwest through the center of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Georgia to Maine. With 14.1 million visitors in 2021, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United States.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nMap Highlighting the Park's Boundaries\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n |\n| List of national parks of the United States (by elevation)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nProtected areas of North Carolina\n |\n| --- |\n| Federal | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Heritage Sites in the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Northeast | * Independence Hall\n* Statue of Liberty\n |\n| Midwest | * Cahokia\n* Hopewell\n |\n| South | * Everglades\n* Great Smoky Mountains\n* Mammoth Cave\n* Monticello and the University of Virginia\n* Poverty Point\n* San Antonio Missions\n |\n| West | * Carlsbad Caverns\n* Chaco Culture\n* Grand Canyon National Park\n* Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park\n* Kluane-Wrangell\u2013St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek1\n* Mesa Verde\n* Olympic National Park\n* Pueblo de Taos\n* Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea\n* Redwood\n* Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park1\n* Yellowstone National Park\n* Yosemite National Park\n |\n| Multiple locations | * The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright\n |\n| Territories | * La Fortaleza and San Juan National Historic Site in Puerto Rico\n |\n| 1 Shared with Canada\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Great Smoky Mountains in United States of America Archived 24 July 2019 at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

It has been the most visited national park for many years, with over 14.1 million recreational visitors (tourists) in 2021.[38] The recreational figure represents nearly twice as many tourists as the Grand Canyon, which received nearly 6 million visitors the same year. Surrounding towns, notably Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Townsend, Tennessee, and Cherokee, Sylva, Maggie Valley, and Bryson City, North Carolina, receive a significant portion of their income from tourism associated with the park.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere are 850 miles (1,370\u00a0km) of trails and unpaved roads in the park for hiking, including 70 miles (110\u00a0km) of the Appalachian Trail.[40] Mount Le Conte is one of the most frequented destinations in the park. Its elevation is 6,593 feet (2,010\u00a0m), the third highest summit in the park and, measured from its base to its highest peak, the tallest mountain east of the Mississippi River. Alum Cave Trail is the most heavily used of the five paths en route to the summit. It provides many scenic overlooks and unique natural attractions such as Alum Cave Bluffs and Arch Rock. Hikers may spend a night at the LeConte Lodge, located near the summit, which provides cabins and rooms for rent (except during the winter season). Accessible solely by trail, it is the only private lodging available inside the park.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** Shadbolt, Ryan; Charney, Joseph; Fromm, Hannah (2019). *A mesoscale simulation of a mountain wave wind event associated with the Chimney Tops 2 fire (2016)*.

The park's waters have long had a reputation for healthy trout activity as well as challenging fishing terrain. Brook trout are native to the waters, while both brown and rainbow were introduced to the area. Partially due to the fact of recent droughts killing off the native fish, there are strict regulations regarding how fishing may be conducted. Horseback riding (offered by the national park and on limited trails), bicycling (available for rent in Cades Cove) and water tubing are all also practiced within the park.\n\n\nFrom late May to early June, the Elkmont area of the park hosts the peak display period for synchronous fireflies (*Photinus carolinus*), one of at least 19 species of fireflies that live in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[41] They are the only species in America whose individuals can synchronize their flashing light patterns.[42]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Established | June 15, 1934 |\n| Visitors | 14,137,812 (in\u00a02020)[4][5] |\n| Governing\u00a0body | National Park Service |\n| Website | Great Smoky Mountains National Park |\n| \n |\n| UNESCO World Heritage Site\n |\n| Criteria | Natural: vii, viii, ix, x |\n| Reference | 259 |\n| Inscription | 1983 (7th Session) |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe park is affected by air pollution because of increased development. In a 2004 report by the National Parks Conservation Association, Great Smoky Mountains National Park was considered the most polluted national park. From 1999 to 2003, the park recorded approximately 150 unhealthy air days, the equivalent of about one month of unhealthy air days per year.[29][30] In 2013, Colorado State University reported that, due to the passing of the United States Clean Air Act in 1970, and the subsequent implementation of the Acid Rain Program, there had been a \"significant improvement\" to the air quality in the Great Smoky Mountains from 1990 to 2010.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Biology and ecology[edit]\n\n\nThe park is almost 95 percent forested, and almost 36 percent of it, 187,000 acres (76,000\u00a0ha), is estimated by the Park Service to be old growth forest with many trees that predate European settlement of the area.[33] It is one of the largest blocks of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe park encompasses 522,419 acres (816.28\u00a0sq\u00a0mi; 211,415.47\u00a0ha; 2,114.15\u00a0km2), making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States.[3] The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) in the towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Cherokee, North Carolina, and also in Townsend, Tennessee. The park is internationally recognized for its mountains, waterfalls, biodiversity, and forests.[7] In addition, the park preserves multiple historical structures that were part of communities occupied by early European-American settlers of the area.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Precipitation is normally heaviest in March.[21] Spring wildflowers bloom from April through June, peaking in May. Fall days are usually clear and mild; nights are often cool. Summer days are hot (95 to 110\u00a0\u00b0F; 35 to 43\u00a0\u00b0C), but overnight lows are usually comfortable (65 to 70\u00a0\u00b0F; 18 to 21\u00a0\u00b0C).[21] Afternoon thunderstorms are common from mid-July through mid-September.[21] Storms may produce waterfalls as well as flash floods. Autumn tree-color displays begin in September in the high country; in Zion Canyon, autumn colors usually peak in late October. Winter in Zion Canyon is fairly mild. Winter storms bring rain or light snow to Zion Canyon and heavier snow to the higher elevations. Clear days may become quite warm, reaching 60\u00a0\u00b0F (16\u00a0\u00b0C); nights are often 20 to 40\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22127 to 4\u00a0\u00b0C).[21] Winter storms can last several days and make roads icy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 30.4(\u22120.9)\n | 33.6(0.9)\n | 38.7(3.7)\n | 43.8(6.6)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 62.2(16.8)\n | 69.5(20.8)\n | 68.7(20.4)\n | 61.3(16.3)\n | 48.8(9.3)\n | 37.3(2.9)\n | 29.3(\u22121.5)\n | 48.0(8.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 14.9(\u22129.5)\n | 18.9(\u22127.3)\n | 24.9(\u22123.9)\n | 29.1(\u22121.6)\n | 37.1(2.8)\n | 46.6(8.1)\n | 59.8(15.4)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 47.8(8.8)\n | 31.4(\u22120.3)\n | 19.7(\u22126.8)\n | 13.5(\u221210.3)\n | 10.7(\u221211.8)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | \u221215(\u221226)\n | 0(\u221218)\n | 10(\u221212)\n | 21(\u22126)\n | 22(\u22126)\n | 35(2)\n | 41(5)\n | 37(3)\n | 33(1)\n | 13(\u221211)\n | 0(\u221218)\n | \u22125(\u221221)\n | \u221215(\u221226)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 1.99(51)\n | 2.06(52)\n | 2.01(51)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 0.77(20)\n | 0.23(5.8)\n | 1.15(29)\n | 1.63(41)\n | 1.17(30)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 1.18(30)\n | 1.64(42)\n | 16.27(413)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.8(2.0)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 1.7(4.3)\n | 4.0(10)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.01 in) | 7.1\n | 7.9\n | 7.4\n | 5.7\n | 4.5\n | 2.0\n | 4.8\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Zion National Park** is an American national park located in southwestern Utah near the town of Springdale. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. The lowest point in the park is 3,666\u00a0ft (1,117\u00a0m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726\u00a0ft (2,660\u00a0m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590\u00a0km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24\u00a0km) long and up to 2,640\u00a0ft (800\u00a0m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"Zion National Park Updated Response to COVID-19 - Zion National Park (U.S. National Park Service)\". *www.nps.gov*.

The record high temperature was 99\u00a0\u00b0F (37\u00a0\u00b0C) in 2002, while the coldest temperature recorded is \u221266\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221254\u00a0\u00b0C) in 1933.[11] During the summer months of June to early September, daytime highs are normally in the 70 to 80\u00a0\u00b0F (21 to 27\u00a0\u00b0C) range, while nighttime lows can go to below freezing (0\u00a0\u00b0C), especially at higher altitudes. Summer afternoons are frequently accompanied by thunderstorms. Spring and fall temperatures range between 30 and 60\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22121 and 16\u00a0\u00b0C) with nights in the teens to single digits (\u22125 to \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C). Winter in Yellowstone is accompanied by high temperatures usually between 0 and 20\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218 and \u22127\u00a0\u00b0C) and nighttime temperatures below 0\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221218\u00a0\u00b0C) for most of the winter.[152]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Yellowstone in United States of America\". *protectedplanet.net*.

Yellowstone Park is the largest and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States. Grizzly bears, cougars, wolves, and free-ranging herds of bison and elk live in this park. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is the oldest and largest public bison herd in the United States. Forest fires occur in the park each year; in the large forest fires of 1988, nearly one-third of the park was burnt. Yellowstone has numerous recreational opportunities, including hiking, camping, boating, fishing, and sightseeing. Paved roads provide close access to the major geothermal areas as well as some of the lakes and waterfalls. During the winter, visitors often access the park by way of guided tours that use either snow coaches or snowmobiles.[19]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"An Act to set apart a certain tract of Land lying near the Head-waters of the Yellowstone River as a Public Park\" (PDF). *Library of Congress*.\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"U.S. Statutes at Large, Vol. 17, Chap. 24, pp. 32\u201333. \"An Act to set apart a certain Tract of Land lying near the Headwaters of the Yellowstone River as a public Park.\" [S. 392]\".

The plateau is bounded on nearly all sides by mountain ranges of the Middle Rocky Mountains, which range from 9,000 to 11,000 feet (2,700 to 3,400\u00a0m) in elevation. The highest point in the park is atop Eagle Peak (11,358 feet or 3,462 metres) and the lowest is along Reese Creek (5,282 feet or 1,610 metres).[11] Nearby mountain ranges include the Gallatin Range to the northwest, the Beartooth Mountains in the north, the Absaroka Range to the east, the Teton Range to the south, and the Madison Range to the west.
