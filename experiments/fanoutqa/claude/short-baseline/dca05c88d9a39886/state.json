Her vocal performance on the show was met with warm reception by the audience, to which Ros\u00e9 commented that she \"didn't know if the audience would like [her] singing\" and that she felt \"happy and relieved\" at the positive result.[8] She later appeared as a performer on the second season of *Fantastic Duo*. The show's production staff stated that her appearance was intended to \"reveal Ros\u00e9's vocal appeal, which is different from Blackpink\".[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2012, Ros\u00e9 attended an audition in Sydney, Australia for YG Entertainment (whose label's music she already liked[11]) at her father's suggestion,[9] she finished first among the 700 participants.[12][13] She had initially presumed her father's idea was a joke due to the distance and difficulty of becoming a singer overseas, and \"she didn't think that there was much of a chance [...] to become a K-pop star [herself].\"[9] Two months later, she had signed with the label as a trainee, and moved to Seoul, South Korea.[14]\n\n\nThe same year, Ros\u00e9 was given an opportunity to feature on labelmate G-Dragon's song \"Without You\" from his extended play (EP) *One of a Kind* (2012). Her name was not publicised at the time of release, her credit was revealed only following her announcement as a member of Blackpink.[15] The song peaked at number ten on South Korea's Gaon Music Chart and at number 15 on the *Billboard Korea* K-pop Hot 100.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### 2016\u2013present: Debut with Blackpink and *R*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Wilder, Gabriel (27 June 2017). \"BlackPink's Rose: How a joke turned into K-pop stardom for an Australian singer\". *The Sydney Morning Herald*.
