It is part of USDA Hardiness zone 8a, with isolated pockets around Puget Sound in zone 8b.[14] Most of western Washington's weather is brought in by weather systems that form near the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. It contains cold moist air, which brings western Washington cold rain, cloudiness, and fog. November through January are Olympia's rainiest months. City streets, creeks, and rivers can flood from November to February. The monthly mean temperature ranges from 38.4 °F (3.6 °C) in December to 64.1 °F (17.8 °C) in August. Seasonal snowfall for 1981–2010 averaged 10.8 inches (27.4 cm)[15] but has historically ranged from trace amounts in 1991–92 to 81.5 in (207 cm) in 1968–69.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Olympia** is the capital of the U.S. state of Washington and the county seat and most populous city of Thurston County.[5][6] It is 60 miles (100 km) southwest of the state's most populous city, Seattle, and is a cultural center of the southern Puget Sound region.\n\n\nThe Squaxin and other Coast Salish peoples inhabited the southern Puget Sound region prior to the arrival of European and American settlers in the 19th century. The Treaty of Medicine Creek was signed in 1854 and followed by the Treaty of Olympia in 1856; these two treaties forced the Squaxin to relocate to an Indian reservation. Olympia was incorporated as a town on January 28, 1859, and as a city in 1882.[7] It had a population of 55,605 at the time of the 2020 census,[3] making it the state's 23rd most populous city. Olympia borders Lacey to the east and Tumwater to the south.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Olympia, Washington\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nState of Washington\n |\n| --- |\n| **Olympia** (capital)\n |\n| Topics | * Outline\n* Climate change\n* Municipalities\n* Census-designated places\n* Federal lands\n\t+ Indian reservations\n* Geography\n* Earthquakes\n* History\n* Highways\n* Music\n* Parks\n* People\n* Symbols\n* Tourist attractions\n |\n| Society | * Abortion\n* Cannabis\n* Crime\n* Culture\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Gun laws\n* Homelessness\n* LGBT rights\n* Politics\n |\n| Politics | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Washington | * Lake Washington\n* Columbia River\n* Cowlitz River\n* Grays Harbor\n* Willapa Bay\n* Columbia River (Wenatchee Reach)\n* Lake Crescent\n |\n| Oregon | * Columbia River\n* Willamette River\n* Oregon Coast\n* Yaquina Bay\n* Coquille River\n* Coos Bay\n |\n| British Columbia | * Upper Fraser River\n* Lakes Route\n* Arrow Lakes\n* Okanagan Lake\n* Upper Columbia and Kootenay Rivers\n* Skeena River\n* Stikine River\n* Peace River\n |\n| Alaska and Yukon | Yukon River\n |\n| Other | Mackenzie River\n |\n\n |\n| Navboxes | * Columbia River\n* British Columbia\n* California\n |\n| Lists of vessels | * List of ships in British Columbia\n* List of steamboats on the Columbia River\n |\n\n |\n| Further information: Washington State Ferries\n |\n\nTemplate:Washington cities and mayors of 100,000 population\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"History of Olympia, Washington\". olympiawa.gov.

It is part of USDA Hardiness zone 8a, with isolated pockets around Puget Sound in zone 8b.[14] Most of western Washington's weather is brought in by weather systems that form near the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. It contains cold moist air, which brings western Washington cold rain, cloudiness, and fog. November through January are Olympia's rainiest months. City streets, creeks, and rivers can flood from November to February. The monthly mean temperature ranges from 38.4 °F (3.6 °C) in December to 64.1 °F (17.8 °C) in August. Seasonal snowfall for 1981–2010 averaged 10.8 inches (27.4 cm)[15] but has historically ranged from trace amounts in 1991–92 to 81.5 in (207 cm) in 1968–69.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Olympia** is the capital of the U.S. state of Washington and the county seat and most populous city of Thurston County.[5][6] It is 60 miles (100 km) southwest of the state's most populous city, Seattle, and is a cultural center of the southern Puget Sound region.\n\n\nThe Squaxin and other Coast Salish peoples inhabited the southern Puget Sound region prior to the arrival of European and American settlers in the 19th century. The Treaty of Medicine Creek was signed in 1854 and followed by the Treaty of Olympia in 1856; these two treaties forced the Squaxin to relocate to an Indian reservation. Olympia was incorporated as a town on January 28, 1859, and as a city in 1882.[7] It had a population of 55,605 at the time of the 2020 census,[3] making it the state's 23rd most populous city. Olympia borders Lacey to the east and Tumwater to the south.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Olympia, Washington\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nState of Washington\n |\n| --- |\n| **Olympia** (capital)\n |\n| Topics | * Outline\n* Climate change\n* Municipalities\n* Census-designated places\n* Federal lands\n\t+ Indian reservations\n* Geography\n* Earthquakes\n* History\n* Highways\n* Music\n* Parks\n* People\n* Symbols\n* Tourist attractions\n |\n| Society | * Abortion\n* Cannabis\n* Crime\n* Culture\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Gun laws\n* Homelessness\n* LGBT rights\n* Politics\n |\n| Politics | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Washington | * Lake Washington\n* Columbia River\n* Cowlitz River\n* Grays Harbor\n* Willapa Bay\n* Columbia River (Wenatchee Reach)\n* Lake Crescent\n |\n| Oregon | * Columbia River\n* Willamette River\n* Oregon Coast\n* Yaquina Bay\n* Coquille River\n* Coos Bay\n |\n| British Columbia | * Upper Fraser River\n* Lakes Route\n* Arrow Lakes\n* Okanagan Lake\n* Upper Columbia and Kootenay Rivers\n* Skeena River\n* Stikine River\n* Peace River\n |\n| Alaska and Yukon | Yukon River\n |\n| Other | Mackenzie River\n |\n\n |\n| Navboxes | * Columbia River\n* British Columbia\n* California\n |\n| Lists of vessels | * List of ships in British Columbia\n* List of steamboats on the Columbia River\n |\n\n |\n| Further information: Washington State Ferries\n |\n\nTemplate:Washington cities and mayors of 100,000 population\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"History of Olympia, Washington\". olympiawa.gov.
