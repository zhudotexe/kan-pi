players.[8] At 11 pounds (5.0\u00a0kg), Yao weighed more than twice as much as the average Chinese newborn.[9] When Yao was nine years old, he began playing basketball and attended a junior sports school.[10] The following year, Yao measured 5\u00a0feet 5\u00a0inches (1.65\u00a0m)[11] and was examined by sports doctors, who predicted he would grow to 7\u00a0feet 3\u00a0inches

He is arguably the tallest player to have ever played in the NBA, at 7\u00a0feet 7\u00a0inches (2.31\u00a0m).[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an was born in Tritenii de Jos,[4][5] Cluj County, Romania. Although his parents' heights were relatively typical, he grew to his remarkable height due to a pituitary gland disorder called acromegaly.[6]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### CS Universitatea Cluj-Napoca (1991\u20131992)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an played competitive basketball at Universitatea Cluj, becoming national champion in 1992.[7][8]\n\n\n\n### \u00c9lan B\u00e9arnais Pau-Orthez (1992\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an played professionally in the French league with Pau-Orthez during the 1992\u201393 season and was an instant hit with fans, also managing to win the French League Cup.[7]\n\n\n\n### Washington Bullets / Wizards (1993\u20131998)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an was selected by the NBA's Washington Bullets in the 1993 NBA draft.[9] He played in the NBA from 1993 to 2000 showing signs of a promising career that was derailed by injuries. His best season came in the 1995\u20131996 campaign, when he averaged 14.5 points per game.\n\n\nMure\u0219an was named the NBA's Most Improved Player for the 1995\u201396 season after averaging 14.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 2.26 blocks per game while making a league-leading 58.4 percent of his field goals. He led in field goal percentage again the following season, with a 60.4% average. Overall, he holds career averages of 9.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, 0.5 assists, 1.48 blocks per game and a .573 field goal percentage.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (1999\u20132000)[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an joined the New Jersey Nets for the final 31 games of his NBA career.\n\n\n\n### Return to Pau-Orthez (2000\u20132001)[edit]\n\n\nAfter ending his NBA career, Mure\u0219an had another stint at Pau-Orthez where he won the French league before returning to the United States with his family.[7] He normally wore number 77, in reference to his height.\n\n\nOn 11 March 2007, Mure\u0219an played a game for the Maryland Nighthawks as part of the tallest lineup in the history of basketball.[10] This was the only basketball game Mure\u0219an played where he was not the tallest person on the court, as Sun Mingming is 7\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.36\u00a0m).\n\n\n\n## Other work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mure\u0219an meeting with Nicholas F. Taubman, the U.S. Ambassador to Romania\nIn 2004, Mure\u0219an founded the Giant Basketball Academy (GBA), a program dedicated to teaching the proper fundamentals of basketball to boys and girls of all ages.[11][6] The Academy is located in Ashburn, Virginia.[12]\n\n\nMure\u0219an is also part of the Washington Wizards marketing and public relations team,[6] serving as an \"ambassador\" for the team.[13]\n\n\nOutside basketball, Mure\u0219an has dabbled in acting, playing the title character in 1998 feature film *My Giant* starring comedian Billy Crystal.[14] He appeared as a ventriloquist in the music video for Eminem's breakthrough single \"My Name Is.\" He has appeared in commercials for Snickers candy bars, and sports television network ESPN. Most recently, Mure\u0219an co-authored two young adult fitness and health books: *The Boy's Fitness Guide* and *The Girl's Fitness Guide*.[15]\n\n\nIn 2013, Mure\u0219an participated in the first annual 3v3 UMTTR (You Matter) Basketball Tournament to increase awareness, prevention and research of teen suicide, the leading cause of death among adults and children between the ages of 15 and 24.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMure\u0219an and his wife Liliana and sons George and Victor have resided in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey,[16] but they relocated to the suburbs of Washington, D.C.[17] Since the 2016\u20132017 season, his oldest son, George, has played for the Georgetown University Hoyas as a walk-on forward. His younger son Victor joined the Hoyas as a walk-on in the 2020\u20132021 season. Victor is 6'10\" and 190 pounds.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n| \u00a0\\*\u00a0\n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993\u201394 | Washington | 54 | 2 | 12.0 | .545 | .000 | .676 | 3.6 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.9 | 5.6\n |\n| 1994\u201395 | Washington | 73 | 58 | 23.6 | .560 | .000 | **.709** | 6.7 | 0.5 | 0.7 | 1.7 | 10.0\n |\n| 1995\u201396 | Washington | **76** | **76** | **29.5** | .584\\* | .000 | .619 | **9.6** | **0.7** | **0.7** | **2.3** | **14.5** |\n| 1996\u201397 | Washington | 73 | 69 | 25.3 | **.604\\*** | .000 | .618 | 6.6 | 0.4 | 0.6 | 1.3 | 10.6\n |\n| 1998\u201399 | New Jersey | 1 | 0 | 1.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\n |\n| 1999\u201300 | New Jersey | 30 | 2 | 8.9 | .456 | .000 | .605 | 2.3 | 0.3 | 0.0 | 0.4 | 3.5\n |\n| **Career** | 307 | 207 | 21.9 | .573 | .000 | .644 | 6.4 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 1.5 | 9.8\n |\n\n\n#### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997 | Washington | 3 | 3 | 23.3 | .444 | \u2013 | .875 | 6.0 | .0 | .0 | 1.3 | 5.0\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* List of tallest players in National Basketball Association history\n* List of tallest people\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Gheorghe Mure\u0219an\".

He said: \"My mother was 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m), my father 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m), and my sister is 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m). And my great-grandfather was even taller\u20147\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.39\u00a0m).\" His ethnic group, the Dinka, and the Nilotic people[8] of which they are a part, are among the tallest populations in the world. Bol's hometown, Turalei, is the origin of other exceptionally tall people, including 7 foot 3\u00bd inches tall (2.22 meters) basketball player Ring Ayuel.[9] \"I was born in a village where you cannot measure yourself,\" Bol reflected. \"I learned I was 7 foot 7 in 1979, when I was grown. I was about 18 or 19.\"[10]\n\n\nBol started playing soccer in 1972 but abandoned the game because he was too tall.[11] During his later teens, Bol started playing basketball in Sudan, for several years with teams in Wau and Khartoum, where he experienced prejudice from the northern Sudanese majority.[12]\n\n\n\n## Early basketball career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNBA annual blocks leaders\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1974: Smith\n* 1975: Abdul-Jabbar\n* 1976: Abdul-Jabbar\n* 1977: Walton\n* 1978: Johnson\n* 1979: Abdul-Jabbar\n* 1980: Abdul-Jabbar\n* 1981: Johnson\n* 1982: Johnson\n* 1983: Rollins\n* 1984: Eaton\n* 1985: Eaton\n* 1986: Bol\n* 1987: Eaton\n* 1988: Eaton\n* 1989: Bol\n* 1990: Olajuwon\n* 1991: Olajuwon\n* 1992: Robinson\n* 1993: Olajuwon\n* 1994: Mutombo\n* 1995: Mutombo\n* 1996: Mutombo\n* 1997: Bradley\n* 1998: Camby\n* 1999: Mourning\n* 2000: Mourning\n* 2001: Ratliff\n* 2002: Wallace\n* 2003: Ratliff\n* 2004: Ratliff\n* 2005: Kirilenko\n* 2006: Camby\n* 2007: Camby\n* 2008: Camby\n* 2009: Howard\n* 2010: Howard\n* 2011: Bogut\n* 2012: Ibaka\n* 2013: Ibaka\n* 2014: Davis\n* 2015: Davis\n* 2016: Whiteside\n* 2017: Gobert\n* 2018: Davis\n* 2019: Turner\n* 2020: Whiteside\n* 2021: Turner\n* 2022: Jackson Jr.\n* 2023: Jackson Jr.\n* 2024: Wembanyama\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Anderson, Kelli (July 2, 2001). \"Manute Bol: Once the NBA's premier shot blocker, the Sudanese Sultan of Swat has tried to bring peace to his homeland\". *Sports Illustrated*.\n39. **^** \"History of the Portland Mountain Cats\".

Bol developed a close friendship with Mullin and named one of his sons after him.\n\n\nNevertheless, Bol was reportedly short-tempered and sensitive to the frequent remarks or questions about his extreme height; on one occasion, when an elderly woman in an airport approached the towering Bol and asked \"how tall are you?\", Bol angrily retorted \"I didn't ask *you* how fat you are!\"[48]\n\n\nAs of 2023[update], Bol remains:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1985 NBA draft\n |\n| --- |\n| First round | * Patrick Ewing\n* Wayman Tisdale\n* Benoit Benjamin\n* Xavier McDaniel\n* Jon Koncak\n* Joe Kleine\n* Chris Mullin\n* Detlef Schrempf\n* Charles Oakley\n* Ed Pinckney\n* Keith Lee\n* Kenny Green\n* Karl Malone\n* Alfredrick Hughes\n* Blair Rasmussen\n* Bill Wennington\n* Uwe Blab\n* Joe Dumars\n* Steve Harris\n* Sam Vincent\n* Terry Catledge\n* Jerry Reynolds\n* A.

Both players faced physical challenges - Mure\u0219an due to his medical condition and Bol due to his extremely thin frame.",
