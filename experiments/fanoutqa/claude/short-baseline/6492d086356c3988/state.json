          "content": "<document>\n<title>Harry Potter (character)</title>\n<fragment>\n\n**Harry James Potter** is a fictional character and the titular protagonist in J. K. Rowling's series of eponymous novels. The majority of the books' plot covers seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who, on his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard. Thus, he attends Hogwarts to practise magic under the guidance of the kindly headmaster Albus Dumbledore and other school professors along with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry also discovers that he is already famous throughout the novel's magical community, and that his fate is tied with that of Lord Voldemort \u2013 the internationally feared Dark Wizard and murderer of his parents, James and Lily Potter. The book and film series revolve around Harry's struggle to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHer own mother's death on 30 December 1990 inspired Rowling to write Harry as a boy longing for his dead parents, his anguish becoming \"much deeper, much more real\" than in earlier drafts because she related to it herself.[2] In a 2000 interview with *The Guardian*, Rowling also established that the character of Wart in T. H. White's novel *The Once and Future King* is \"Harry's spiritual ancestor\".[4] Finally, she established Harry's birth date as 31 July, the same as her own. However, she maintained that Harry was not directly based on any real-life person: \"he came just out of a part of me\".[5]\n\n\nRowling has also maintained that Harry is a suitable real-life role model for children. \"The advantage of a fictional hero or heroine is that you can know them better than you can know a living hero, many of whom you would never meet\u00a0... if people like Harry and identify with him, I am pleased, because I think he is very likeable.\"[6]\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"Couric, Katie.: 'J.K.

According to Rowling, after Voldemort's defeat, Harry joins the \"reshuffled\" Auror Department under Kingsley Shacklebolt's mentoring, and ends up eventually rising to become Head of said department in 2007.[15] Rowling said that his old rival Draco has a grudging gratitude towards Harry for saving his life in the final battle, but the two are not friends.[14]\n\n\n\n## Film appearances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Harry Potter*(cast \u00b7 music) | * *The Philosopher's Stone*\n\t+ soundtrack, \"Hedwig's Theme\"\n* *The Chamber of Secrets*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Prisoner of Azkaban*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Goblet of Fire*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Order of the Phoenix*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Half-Blood Prince*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 1*\n\t+ production\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2*\n\t+ production\n\t+ soundtrack\n\t+ accolades\n |\n| *Fantastic Beasts*(cast \u00b7 characters) | * *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Crimes of Grindelwald*\n\t+ soundtrack\n* *The Secrets of Dumbledore*\n |\n\n |\n| Characters | * Harry Potter\n* Ron Weasley\n* Hermione Granger\n* Lord Voldemort\n* Albus Dumbledore\n* Severus Snape\n* Rubeus Hagrid\n* Minerva McGonagall\n* Draco Malfoy\n* Neville Longbottom\n* Ginny Weasley\n* Fred and George Weasley\n* Sirius Black\n* Remus Lupin\n* Cedric Diggory\n* Bellatrix Lestrange\n* Dolores Umbridge\n* Luna Lovegood\n* Supporting characters\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Vineyard, Jennifer. \"Daniel Radcliffe Talks Harry Potter's First Kiss\".

Rowling made Harry an orphan from the early drafts of her first book. She felt an orphan would be the most interesting character to write about.[3] However, after her mother's death, Rowling wrote Harry as a child longing to see his dead parents again, incorporating her own anguish into him. Harry is categorised as a \"half-blood\" wizard in the series, because although both his parents were magical, Lily was \"Muggle-born\", and James was a pure-blood.\n\n\nHarry's aunt and uncle kept the truth about his parents' deaths from Harry, telling him that they had died in a car crash.[2] James Potter is a descendant of Ignotus Peverell, the third of the three original owners of the Deathly Hallows, and thus so is Harry, a realisation he makes during the course of the final book. The lineage continues at the end of the saga through his three children with Ginny: James Sirius Potter, Albus Severus Potter and Lily Luna Potter.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Victoire Weasley |  | Dominique Weasley |  | Louis Weasley |  |  |  |  |  |  | Fred Weasley, Jr. |  | Roxanne Weasley |  | Rose Granger-Weasley |  | Hugo Granger-Weasley |  | James Sirius Potter |  | Albus Severus Potter |  | Lily Luna Potter |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Molly Weasley |  | Lucy Weasley |\n|\n\n |\n| **Notes:**\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The names \"Thomas\" and \"Mary\" Riddle are taken from the *Harry Potter* film series.\n2. **^** In *Harry Potter and the Cursed Child*, Bellatrix is depicted as having had a secret daughter \u2014 Delphini (Delphi) \"The Augurey\" \u2014 who claims to also be the daughter of Lord Voldemort.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** UGO Team (21 January 2010). \"Best Heroes of All Time\". *UGO Networks*.

John Killinger, have argued that Potter is a Christ figure in the series. Killinger opined in 2002 that \"J.K. Rowling has written *the* Christ story of the 21st century, and it's wonderful that she has attained such a magnificent following worldwide.\" He noted several allusions to Jesus in Potter's character arcs in *Philosopher's Stone* and *Chamber of Secrets*.[40] Rowling herself later admitted that the Gospel story inspired that of Harry Potter, especially with his ultimate sacrifice in *Deathly Hallows* and apparent death before returning to defeat Voldemort once and for all.[41]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHarry is an orphan living with his abusive aunt and uncle, Vernon and Petunia Dursley and their bullying son, Dudley. On his eleventh birthday, Harry discovers he is a wizard when Rubeus Hagrid delivers him an acceptance letter to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He learns that his parents, James and Lily Potter, were murdered by a powerful dark wizard, Lord Voldemort. Harry, instead, survived Voldemort's killing curse, which ended up bouncing back and apparently killing Voldemort, leaving a lightning bolt shaped scar on his forehead. Thus Harry became famous in the wizarding world.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** Petre, Jonathan (20 October 2007). \"J K Rowling: 'Christianity inspired Harry Potter'\". Telegraph.

Rowling states that she was born on 19 September 1979[2] and she was nearly twelve when she first attended Hogwarts.[5] She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by Rowling as a \"very logical, upright and good\" character.[6] Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but \"quite proud of her all the same\".[6] They are well aware of the wizard world and have visited Diagon Alley with her.[7] Hermione is an only child.[6] But Rowling revealed in a 2004 interview that Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, but the planned sibling did not appear since she felt it \"might be too late now\" to introduce the character.[8] Rowling has called the character of Luna Lovegood the \"anti-Hermione\" as they are so very different.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** Blay, Zeba (28 July 2015). \"Black 'Harry Potter' Characters Aren't Just Beautiful -- They're Revolutionary\". *HuffPost*.

After Harry and Ron save her from a mountain troll in the girls' restroom, she becomes best friends with them and often uses her quick wit, deft recall, and encyclopaedic knowledge to lend aid in dire situations. Rowling has stated that Hermione resembles herself as a young girl, with her insecurity and fear of failure.[2]\n\n\nThe character has had immense popularity. The version of Hermione portrayed by Emma Watson in all eight *Harry Potter* films from *Philosopher's Stone* in 2001 to *Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2* in 2011 was voted the best female character of all time in a poll conducted amongst Hollywood professionals by *The Hollywood Reporter* in 2016.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** Foster, Tara (2012). \"\"Books!

After publication of the last book, J.K. Rowling revealed that Hermione's career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very protective of her friends and values them so much that Rowling has suggested that, if Hermione looked in the Mirror of Erised, she would see Harry, Ron, and herself alive and Voldemort defeated.[52] Hermione also learns to ignore what bullies such as Draco Malfoy say to her, often preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart him. She accepts her status as a Muggle-born, and says in *Deathly Hallows* that she is \"a Mudblood and proud of it\".[53]\n\n\n\n### Magical abilities and skills[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Main novels | * *The Philosopher's Stone*\n* *The Chamber of Secrets*\n* *The Prisoner of Azkaban*\n* *The Goblet of Fire*\n* *The Order of the Phoenix*\n* *The Half-Blood Prince*\n* *The Deathly Hallows*\n |\n| Spin-offs | * *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them*\n* *Quidditch Through the Ages*\n* *The Tales of Beedle the Bard*\n |\n| Short stories | * Prequel\n* *Hogwarts: An Incomplete and Unreliable Guide*\n* *Short Stories from Hogwarts of Power, Politics and Pesky Poltergeists*\n* *Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies*\n |\n\n |\n| Feature films | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHermione's most prominent features include her prodigious intellect and cleverness. She is levelheaded, book-smart, and always very logical. Throughout the series, Hermione uses the skills of a librarian and teacher to gather the information needed to defeat Voldemort, the \"Dark Lord\". When in doubt, she always turns to the school library.[47] She is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends\u2014a person who can always be counted on. J.K. Rowling said that Hermione \"never strays off the path; she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done.\"[48] Despite Hermione's intelligence and bossy attitude, Rowling says Hermione has \"quite a lot of vulnerability in her personality,\"[49] as well as a \"sense of insecurity underneath,\" feels, \"utterly inadequate... \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHermione later uses Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Bellatrix when the trio steal Hufflepuff's cup (a Horcrux) from Gringotts. She, Harry, and Ron join Dumbledore's Army in the Battle of Hogwarts, during which Hermione destroys Hufflepuff's cup in the Chamber of Secrets with a basilisk fang. Hermione and Ron also share their first kiss during the battle.[29] In the final battle in the Great Hall, Hermione fights Bellatrix with the help of Ginny Weasley and Luna. However, the three of them are unable to defeat Bellatrix and stop fighting her once Molly Weasley orders them to disengage.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Epilogue[edit]\n\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Hermione and Ron have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo.[DH\u00a0Ch.37] Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Hermione and Ron are married,[31] news articles and other sources treat it as fact.[32][33][34]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Hermione Granger Voice \u2013 Harry Potter franchise\". *Behind the Voice Actors*. 18 December 2019.

Along with Harry and Hermione, he is a member of Gryffindor house and is present for most of the action throughout the series.\n\n\n\n\n## Character development[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Fraser, Lindsay (2001). *Conversations with J.

His middle name, Bilius, is the same as that of a deceased uncle. Ron grew up in the family home, The Burrow, near the village of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon. Ron has six siblings: his five older brothers, Bill, Charlie, Percy, twins Fred and George, and a younger sister, Ginny, each with their own distinct personality trait. Ron is often overshadowed by his siblings' accomplishments, but this is shown to be borne out of a lack of belief in himself, rather than a lack of actual talent or skill. Like his brothers, Percy and Bill he is made a Prefect. Like Fred, George and Ginny, he joins the Quidditch team and eventually grows to be an excellent Keeper.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the epilogue of *Deathly Hallows*, which is set nineteen years after Voldemort's death, Ron and Hermione have two children: Rose Granger-Weasley, whom they are sending off to her first year at Hogwarts, and a younger son named Hugo.[DH\u00a0Ch.37] Though the epilogue does not explicitly say Ron and Hermione are married,[DH\u00a0Ch.37] news articles and other sources treat it as a fact.[4][5][6] Ron has also passed his Muggle driving test, despite Hermione's apparent belief that he could not do so without Confunding the examiner. (Ron secretly reveals to Harry he actually did Confund the examiner.) He and Harry work for the Ministry of Magic as Aurors, and along with Hermione they have helped to revamp the Ministry; it is far different from the one that existed previously.[7] Before becoming an Auror, Ron joins George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, which becomes a very lucrative business.[8]\n\n\n\n## Characterisation[edit]\n\n\n### Outward appearance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRowling first introduces Ron with his family in *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. Harry is lost at King's Cross railway station, and the Weasleys guide him through the barrier at Platform 9\u00be into the wizarding world. Ron and Harry share a compartment on the Hogwarts Express, and they begin their friendship. Ron is fascinated with the famous Harry, and Harry is fascinated with the ordinary Ron. On the train, they both meet Hermione Granger as well, whom they initially dislike but who later becomes their close friend after they save each other during a dangerous encounter with a mountain troll.[PS\u00a0Ch.6] Ron and Harry share the same classes throughout the series and generally have similar academic successes and disappointments. Ron plays a vital part in the quest to save the Philosopher's Stone. His strategy at Wizard's Chess allows Hermione and Harry to proceed safely through a dangerous, life-sized animated chess game. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome of Ron's qualities serve as foils to Harry's. Whereas Harry is an orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron comes from a loving but poor family. Many of his possessions are hand-me-downs. Harry is famous but would prefer to avoid the spotlight; Ron, in comparison, is often perceived as a mere lackey and sometimes becomes jealous of the recognition Harry receives. Overshadowed by his many siblings and the fame and achievements of his friends, Ron's inferiority complex and need to prove himself are the main thrusts of his character arc. As the books progress, he matures from an insecure boy to a competent young man capable of strategy and leadership.\n\n\n\n## Appearances[edit]\n\n\n### *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Weasley family is one of the few remaining pure blood wizarding families, though they were considered \"blood traitors\" for associating with non-pure-bloods. Moreover, they are far from rich, and are looked down upon by snobbish \"old families\" such as the Malfoys. All of the Weasleys have been sorted into Gryffindor House at Hogwarts. All of the Weasley children, except Bill and Percy who both were Head Boy, are known to have played on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, with Charlie being the captain of the team for at least one of his school years. Bill, Charlie, and Ron were also chosen as the prefect of their House. The Weasleys also all work for the Order of the Phoenix, and all are members except for Ron, Percy, and Ginny, who (as of the end of *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows*) are not known to have officially been inducted into the Order. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe character is highly popular. Ron was chosen by IGN as their third favourite *Harry Potter* character, who said that Ron's status as comic relief made him \"instantly endearing\" and that his frustration and flirtation with Hermione Granger was a \"highlight\".[14] His friendship with Harry is listed as among the best portrayed in literature and film[15] and his friends-to-lovers relationship with Hermione Granger is often referred to as a fan favorite and one of the best pairings in the series.[*citation needed*] However, many fans disapproved of the pairing, and Rowling herself has admitted in a 2014 interview that the relationship was \"a form of wish fulfillment\" and \"that Hermione and Ron would probably need relationship counseling\".[16]\n\n\n\n## Portrayals[edit]\n\n\n### Film series[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRowling introduces Ron as \"tall, thin and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.\"[PS\u00a0Ch.6] Ron has the trademark red hair of the Weasleys and is indeed one of Harry's tallest schoolmates, even outgrowing some of his older brothers. Rowling states in the novels that Ron has freckles, though Rupert Grint, the actor who plays Ron, has none. Rowling has also stated that Ron has blue eyes.\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRon is known for his humour, loyalty, readiness to defend his friends and his love of food. Rowling in an interview described Ron as very funny but insensitive and immature, saying \"There's a lot of immaturity about Ron, and that's where a lot of the humor comes from.\"[9] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, who directed the third film in the series, *Prisoner of Azkaban*, assigned them to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuar\u00f3n recalls, \"Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.'\"[10] Commenting on Ron's character development in the final book, Rowling explained that \"Ron is the most immature of the three main characters, but in part seven he grows up. \n</fragment>\n</document>",
