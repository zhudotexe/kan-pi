Though the coastline paradox stipulates that coastlines do not have a well-defined length, there are various methods in use to measure coastlines through ratios and other metrics. A coastline of zero indicates that the country is landlocked.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAn example of the coastline paradox. If measured using an interval of 125\u00a0mi (200\u00a0km), the coast of Great Britain has a length of about 1,500\u00a0mi (2,400\u00a0km). Using an interval of 30\u00a0mi (50\u00a0km), the length is about 2,100\u00a0mi (3,400\u00a0km).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** In 1900, the Dutch coastline measured approximately 1400 km. It has significantly been reduced by the closing of the Zuiderzee by the Afsluitdijk in 1932 (250 km) and the closing of several sea arms by the Delta Works (700 km).\n12. **^** Israel has an additional coastline along the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee (both landlocked), with a total length of 63 km.\n13. **^** Excluding Ascension Island (data unavailable).\n14. **^** Includes Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, and Palmyra Atoll.\n15. **^** Figure represents the coastline of the entire island, including Sint Maarten (administered by the Netherlands).\n16. **^** Jordan has an additional 50 km of coastline along the Dead Sea, which is landlocked.\n17. **^** Coastline included in figure for Saint Martin (administered by France).\n18. **^** Kazakhstan has a coastline with the Caspian Sea, which is landlocked, with a total length of 1,894 km.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The smaller the scale interval mathematically, the more detailed and the \"greater the scale of the map\", in common usage.

Measurements of the length of a coastline behave like a fractal, being different at different scale intervals (distance between points on the coastline at which measurements are taken). The smaller the scale interval (meaning the more detailed the measurement), the longer the coastline will be.[Note 1] This \"magnifying\" effect is greater for convoluted coastlines than for relatively smooth ones.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Data marked World Resources Institute or WRI covers 182 independent countries and 13 dependencies, based on data calculated in 2000 from the World Vector Shoreline, United States Defense Mapping Agency, 1989. It may include territories whose status have changed. According to their technical notes, the \"coastline length was derived from the World Vector Shoreline database at 1:250,000 scale. The estimates (...) were calculated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and an underlying database consistent for the entire world. The methodology used to estimate length is based on the following: 1) A country's coastline is made up of individual lines, and an individual line has two or more vertices and/or nodes. 2) The length between two vertices is calculated on the surface of a sphere. 3) The sum of the lengths of the pairs of vertices is aggregated for each individual line, and 4) the sum of the lengths of individual lines was aggregated for a country. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Data marked The World Factbook or TWF covers 198 countries and 55 territories, from the book published by the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition to coastline lengths, this is the source of the land area used to calculate the \"coast/area ratio\" for both TWF and WRI (see below) coastline measurement. This ratio measures how many metres of coastline correspond to every square kilometer of land area. The ratio illustrates the ease of accessibility to the country's coast from every point in its interior. Therefore, an island country like Maldives, or a country carved by the sea like Greece, is more likely to have a high ratio, while a landlocked country will have a ratio of zero. Note that the scales at which The World Factbook figures were measured are not stated, nor is it known whether the figures are all reported using the same scale, thus the figures are not necessarily comparable across different countries.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *![](image)\u00a0Norfolk Island* | \u2014 | 32 |  |  | 36 | 889 |  | 5.33\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Nauru | 150 | 30 |  |  | 21 |

If recognized, this would make the summit of K2 the highest point in India.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0Equatorial Guinea | Pico Basile on Bioko | 3008\u00a0m9,869\u00a0ft\n | North Atlantic Ocean | sea level\n | 3008\u00a0m9,869\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Eritrea | Emba Soira | 3018\u00a0m9,902\u00a0ft\n | Lake Kulul | \u221275\u00a0m\u2212246\u00a0ft | 3093\u00a0m10,148\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Estonia | Suur Munam\u00e4gi | 318\u00a0m1,043\u00a0ft\n | Baltic Sea | sea level\n | 318\u00a0m1,043\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Eswatini | Emlembe | 1862\u00a0m6,109\u00a0ft\n | Maputo River | 21\u00a0m69\u00a0ft\n | 1841\u00a0m6,040\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Ethiopia | Ras Dejen | 4550\u00a0m14,928\u00a0ft\n | Danakil Depression | \u2212125\u00a0m\u2212410\u00a0ft | 4675\u00a0m15,338\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Falkland Islands | Mount Usborne on East Falkland | 705\u00a0m2,313\u00a0ft\n | South Atlantic Ocean | sea level\n | 705\u00a0m2,313\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Faroe Islands | Sl\u00e6ttaratindur on Eysturoy | 880\u00a0m2,887\u00a0ft\n | North Atlantic Ocean | sea level\n | 880\u00a0m2,887\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Fiji | Tomanivi on Viti Levu | 1324\u00a0m4,344\u00a0ft\n | South Pacific Ocean | sea level\n | 1324\u00a0m4,344\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Finland | Halti | 1324\u00a0m4,344\u00a0ft\n | Baltic Sea | sea level\n | 1324\u00a0m4,344\u00a0ft\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0Solomon Islands | Mount Popomanaseu on Guadalcanal | 2335\u00a0m7,661\u00a0ft\n | South Pacific Ocean | sea level\n | 2335\u00a0m7,661\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Somalia | Shimbiris | 2450\u00a0m8,038\u00a0ft\n | Indian Ocean | sea level\n | 2450\u00a0m8,038\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0South Africa | Mafadi | 3450\u00a0m11,319\u00a0ft\n | South Atlantic OceanIndian Ocean | sea level\n | 3450\u00a0m11,319\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands | Mount Paget[an] | 2934\u00a0m9,626\u00a0ft\n | South Atlantic Ocean | sea level\n | 2934\u00a0m9,626\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0South Sudan | Kinyeti | 3187\u00a0m10,456\u00a0ft\n | White Nile | 350\u00a0m1,148\u00a0ft\n | 2837\u00a0m9,308\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain | Teide[ao] on Tenerife[ap] | 3715\u00a0m12,188\u00a0ft\n | North Atlantic OceanMediterranean Sea | sea level\n | 3715\u00a0m12,188\u00a0ft\n |\n| Spratly Islands[aq] | Unnamed location on Southwest Cay | 4\u00a0m13\u00a0ft\n | South China Sea | sea level\n | 4\u00a0m13\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Sri Lanka | Pidurutalagala on Sri Lanka | 2524\u00a0m8,281\u00a0ft\n | Indian Ocean | sea level\n | 2524\u00a0m8,281\u00a0ft\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Dniester | 2\u00a0m7\u00a0ft\n | 428\u00a0m1,404\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Monaco | along Chemin des R\u00e9voires on Mont Agel | 161\u00a0m528\u00a0ft\n | Mediterranean Sea | sea level\n | 161\u00a0m528\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mongolia | Kh\u00fciten Peak | 4374\u00a0m14,350\u00a0ft\n | Hoh Nuur | 518\u00a0m1,699\u00a0ft\n | 3856\u00a0m12,651\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Montenegro | Zla Kolata | 2534\u00a0m8,314\u00a0ft\n | Adriatic Sea | sea level\n | 2534\u00a0m8,314\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Montserrat | Chances Peak | 915\u00a0m3,002\u00a0ft\n | Caribbean Sea | sea level\n | 915\u00a0m3,002\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Morocco[ae] | Jbel Toubkal | 4167\u00a0m13,671\u00a0ft\n | Sebkha Tah | \u221255\u00a0m\u2212180\u00a0ft | 4222\u00a0m13,852\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mozambique | Monte Binga | 2436\u00a0m7,992\u00a0ft\n | Mozambique Channel | sea level\n | 2436\u00a0m7,992\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Myanmar | Hkakabo Razi | 5881\u00a0m19,295\u00a0ft\n | Indian Ocean | sea level\n | 5881\u00a0m19,295\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Namibia | K\u00f6nigstein | 2573\u00a0m8,442\u00a0ft\n | South Atlantic Ocean | sea level\n | 2573\u00a0m8,442\u00a0ft\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Nauru | Command Ridge | 65\u00a0m213\u00a0ft\n | South Pacific Ocean | sea level\n | 65\u00a0m213\u00a0ft\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMonaco's elevation range is among the greatest relative to surface area.

The mountain was named after Sir William Edmond Logan, a Canadian geologist and founder of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). Mount Logan is located within Kluane National Park Reserve[6] in southwestern Yukon, less than 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) north of the Yukon\u2013Alaska border. Mount Logan is the source of the Hubbard and Logan glaciers. Although many shield volcanoes are much larger in size and mass, Mount Logan is believed to have the largest base circumference of any non-volcanic mountain on Earth,[7] including a massif with eleven peaks over 5,000 metres (16,400\u00a0ft).[8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Barbeau Peak\n\n- San Jacinto Peak\n\n- San Gorgonio Mountain\n\n- Charleston Peak\n\n- Pavlof Volcano\n\n- Mount Veniaminof\n\n- Mount Adams\n\n- Skihist Mountain\n\n- Mount Hubbard\n\n- Mount Ratz\n\n- Mount Odin\n\n- Mount Isto\n\n- Mount Monashee\n\n- Iliamna Volcano\n\n- Mount Olympus\n\n- Mount Columbia\n\n- Mount Queen Bess\n\n- Mount Cook\n\n- Mount Hood\n\n- Mount Sanford\n\n- Mount Tom White\n\n- Mount Cooper\n\n- Wheeler Peak\n\n- Ulysses Mountain\n\n- Glacier Peak\n\n- Mount Kimball\n\n- Blue Mountain Peak\n\n- Wedge Mountain\n\n- Otter Mountain\n\n- Mount Griggs\n\n- Nevado de Toluca\n\n- Kwatna Peak\n\n- Outlook Peak\n\n- Mount Foraker\n\n- Golden Hinde\n\n- White Mountain Peak\n\n- Mount Crillon\n\n- Stauning Alper\n\n- Cerro Teotepec\n\n- Scud Peak\n\n- Keele Peak\n\n- Cloud Peak\n\n- Gannett Peak\n\n- Razorback Mountain\n\n- Mount Vsevidof\n\n- Mount Odin\n\n- Cerro el Nacimiento\n\n- Mount Hesperus\n\n- Picacho del Diablo\n\n- Mount Farnham\n\n- Palup Qaqa HP\n\n- Mount Bona\n\n- Oscar Peak\n\n- Pic Macaya\n\n- Monta\u00f1a de Santa B\u00e1rbara\n\n- Mount Assiniboine\n\n- Mount Jancowski\n\n- Cerro Las Minas\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53.

Its first reported sighting was in 1890 by Israel C. Russell, during an expedition to nearby Mount Saint Elias, from the crest of the Pinnacle Pass Hills (60\u00b09.5\u2032N 140\u00b018\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff60.1583\u00b0N 140.300\u00b0W\ufeff / 60.1583; -140.300). He wrote: \"The clouds parting toward the northeast revealed several giant peaks not before seen... One stranger, rising in three white domes far above the clouds, was especially magnificent\".[26][27] Russell gave the mountain its present name.\n\n\nIn 1894 Mount Logan's elevation was determined to be about 19,500\u00a0ft\u00a0or\u00a05,950\u00a0m, making it the highest known peak in North America at the time.[28] In 1898, Denali was determined to be higher.[29]\n\n\n\n## Ascent attempts[edit]\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Irving, R.

In May 1992, a GSC expedition climbed Mount Logan and fixed the current height of 5,959 metres (19,551\u00a0ft) using GPS.[8][11][12]\n\n\nTemperatures are extremely low on and near Mount Logan. On the 5,000-metre-high (16,000\u00a0ft) plateau, air temperature hovers around \u221245\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221249\u00a0\u00b0F) in the winter and reaches near freezing in summer with the median temperature for the year around \u221227\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221217\u00a0\u00b0F). Minimal snow melt leads to a significant ice cap, almost 300 metres (980\u00a0ft) thick in certain spots.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Peaks of the massif[edit]\n\n\nThe Mount Logan massif is considered to contain all the surrounding peaks with less than 500\u00a0m (1,640\u00a0ft) of prominence, as listed below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut Ultra-Prominences\". *Peaklist.org*.

It is situated in the western part of the Caucasus and is the highest peak of the Caucasus Mountains. The dormant volcano rises 5,642\u00a0m (18,510\u00a0ft) above sea level; it is the highest stratovolcano in Eurasia, as well as the tenth-most prominent peak in the world.[7] The mountain stands in Southern Russia, in the Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria.\n\n\nElbrus has two summits, both of which are dormant volcanic domes. The taller, western summit is 5,642 metres (18,510\u00a0ft);[2] the eastern summit is 5,621 metres (18,442\u00a0ft). The eastern summit was first ascended on 10 July 1829 by a Circassian man named Khillar Khashirov, and the western summit in 1874 by a British expedition led by F. Crauford Grove and including Frederick Gardner, Horace Walker and the Swiss guide Peter Knubel.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Everett-Heath, John (24 October 2019). *The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Place Names*.

The crater, 300 to 400 metres in diameter, located at the top of the eastern peak, was gradually filled with snow and ice. The snowfields of the volcano, covering an area of 138\u00a0km2, feed 22 (or 23 depending on the source) main glaciers and 77 secondary glaciers that give rise to the Baksan rivers: Kuban and Malka. Some of these glaciers can reach 400 metres in thickness but all are receding, having lost between 80 and 500 meters in length. The two main ones are called Bolshoi Azaou (\"the great Azaou\"), with an area of 23\u00a0km2 and a length of 9.28\u00a0km, and Irik, with an area of 10.2\u00a0km2 and a length of 9.31\u00a0km. This glacial activity has formed numerous small but deep lakes.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1997 a team led by the Russian mountaineer Alexander Abramov took a Land Rover Defender to the summit of the East Peak, entering the Guinness Book of Records.[27] The project took 45 days in total. They were able to drive the vehicle as high as the mountain huts at The Barrels (3,800 metres (12,500\u00a0ft)), but above this they used a pulley system to raise it most of the way. On the way down, a driver lost control of the vehicle and had to jump out. Although he survived the accident, the vehicle crashed onto the rocks and remains below the summit to this day.[28]\n\n\nIn 2016, the Russian climbers Artyom Kuimov and Sergey Baranov entered the Guinness Book of World Records by reaching the summit of Elbrus on ATVs.[29]\n\n\n\n### With horses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMount Elbrus is said to be home to the 'world's nastiest' outhouse which is close to being the highest toilet in Europe, at 4,200\u00a0m (13,800\u00a0ft), next to the old, burnt-out Pruitt Hut. The title was conferred by *Outside* magazine following a 1993 search and article.[33] The \"outhouse\" is surrounded by and covered in ice, perched on the end of a rock.[11]\n\n\n\n### Observatory[edit]\n\n\nThe Terskol Observatory, an astronomical observatory with the IAU code B18, is located 2.5\u00a0km north-west of Terskol village at an altitude of 3,090 metres (10,140\u00a0ft).[34][35]\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elbrus climbing routes\n\n![](image)South route.\n### Ski lifts[edit]\n\n\nThree ski lifts take visitors up to an altitude of 3,847 metres.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe name *Elbrus* /\u02c8\u025blbr\u0259s/ seems to have a connection with *Alborz*[8][9] (also called Elburz), which is also the name of a long mountain range in northern Iran.
