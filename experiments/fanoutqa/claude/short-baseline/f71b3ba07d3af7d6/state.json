All soft landings took place on the near side of the Moon until 3 January 2019, when the Chinese Chang'e 4 spacecraft made the first landing on the far side of the Moon.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Uncrewed landings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stamp with a drawing of the first soft landed probe Luna 9, next to the first view of the lunar surface photographed by the probe\nSix national space agencies (Interkosmos, NASA, CNSA, ISRO, JAXA and the European Space Agency) have reached the moon with uncrewed missions that achieved varying degrees of success, as well as two private/commercial missions from Israel and Japan. The Soviet Union (Interkosmos), the United States (NASA), China (CNSA) and India (ISRO) are the only four nations to have successfully achieved soft landings.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Model of Luna 16 Moon soil sample return lander\n![](image)Model of Soviet Lunokhod automatic Moon rover\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February 1966. Airbags protected its 99 kilograms (218\u00a0lb) ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second (54\u00a0km/h; 34\u00a0mph).[25] Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.[26]\n\n\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.[27] It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 28 October 1974\n | Sample return\n | Failure \u2013 Moon landing achieved, but malfunction prevented sample return\n | Mare Crisium\n | 012.00N 062.00E\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 16 October 1975\n | Sample return\n | Failure \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Luna-24 | 5,800\n | Proton\n | 9 August 1976\n | Sample return\n | Success \u2013 returned 0.17\u00a0kg of Moon soil back to Earth\n | Mare Crisium\n | 012.25N 062.20E\n |\n\n\n## U.S. uncrewed soft landings (1966\u20131968)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with uncrewed spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming crewed landers with their much greater weight.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, Lunar Module pilot of the first lunar landing mission, poses for a photograph beside the deployed United States flag during an Apollo 11 Extravehicular Activity (EVA) on the lunar surface.\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of crewed Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.[30]\n\n\n\n### Human Moon landings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a 50-kilometre-per-hour (31\u00a0mph) ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned 160-kilometre-per-hour (99\u00a0mph) impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a crewed flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Failure \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 6 February 1970\n | Sample return\n | Failure \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Luna-16 | 5,600\n | Proton\n | 12 September 1970\n | Sample return\n | Success \u2013 returned 0.10\u00a0kg of Moon soil back to Earth\n | Mare Fecunditatis | 000.68S 056.30E\n |\n| Luna-17 | 5,700\n | Proton\n | 10 November 1970\n | Lunar rover\n | Success \u2013 Lunokhod-1 rover traveled 10.5\u00a0km across lunar surface\n | Mare Imbrium | 038.28N 325.00E\n |\n| Luna-18 | 5,750\n | Proton\n | 2 September 1971\n | Sample return\n | Failure \u2013 lunar crash impact\n | Mare Fecunditatis\n | 003.57N 056.50E\n |\n| Luna-20 | 5,727\n | Proton\n | 14 February 1972\n | Sample return\n | Success \u2013 returned 0.05\u00a0kg of Moon soil back to Earth\n | Mare Fecunditatis\n | 003.57N 056.50E\n |\n| Luna-21 | 5,950\n | Proton\n | 8 January 1973\n | Lunar rover\n | Success \u2013 Lunokhod-2 rover traveled 37.0\u00a0km across lunar surface\n | LeMonnier Crater | 025.85N 030.45E\n |\n| Luna-23 | 5,800\n | Proton\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing their initial hard landings on the Moon, sixteen Soviet, U.S., Chinese and Indian spacecraft have used braking rockets (retrorockets) to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface. In 1966 the Soviet Union accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna 9 and Luna 13 missions. The U.S. followed with five Surveyor soft landings. China's ongoing  \"Chang'e\" program has landed 3 times since 2013, achieving soil sample return and the first landing on the far side of the Moon.\n\n\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first uncrewed lunar soil sample return with Luna 16 on 24 September 1970. Luna 17 was the first successful uncrewed lunar rover mission, in 1970. China's Chang'e 4 made the first uncrewed soft landing on the far side of the Moon on 3 January 2019.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. Apollo spacecraft had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The Apollo 8 mission carried out the first human trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the Saturn V booster for crewed use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. Apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a crewed Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within 47,400 feet (14.4\u00a0km) of the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module too heavy to land. With the failure of the robotic Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna 15 in July 1969, the stage was set for Apollo 11.\n\n\n\n## Human Moon landings (1969\u20131972)[edit]\n\n\n### US strategy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Luna-14 | 1,700\n | Molniya-M\n | 7 April 1968\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success \u2013 870\u00a0km x 160\u00a0km x 42 deg orbit, 160\u00a0m period, unstable orbit, radio calibration test?\n |\n| Luna-19 | 5,700\n | Proton | 28 September 1971\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success \u2013 140\u00a0km x 140\u00a0km x 41 deg orbit, 121\u00a0m period, 388-day science mission\n |\n| Luna-22 | 5,700\n | Proton\n | 29 May 1974\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success \u2013 222\u00a0km x 219\u00a0km x 19 deg orbit, 130\u00a0m period, 521-day science mission\n |\n\n\nLuna 10 became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\n\n\n\n## U.S. lunar orbit satellites (1966\u20131967)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The view through the window of the Lunar Module *Orion* shortly after Apollo 16's landing\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting 20 July 1969, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 with Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last man to step off the lunar surface.\n\n\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the command module. The last three missions included a drivable lunar rover, the Lunar Roving Vehicle, for increased mobility.\n\n\n\n## Scientific background[edit]\n\n\nTo get to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave Earth's gravity well; currently, the only practical means is a rocket. Unlike airborne vehicles such as balloons and jets, a rocket can continue accelerating in the vacuum outside the atmosphere.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Booster\n | Launch date\n | Goal\n | Result\n | Landing zone\n | Lat/Lon |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Luna-9 | 1580\n | Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n | 31 January 1966\n | Landing\n | Success \u2013 first lunar soft landing, numerous photos\n | Oceanus Procellarum | 7.13\u00b0N 64.37\u00b0W\n |\n| Luna-13 | 1580\n | Semyorka \u2013 8K78\n | 21 December 1966\n | Landing\n | Success \u2013 second lunar soft landing, numerous photos\n | Oceanus Procellarum | 18\u00b052'N 62\u00b03'W\n |\n|  |  | Proton | 19 February 1969\n | Lunar rover\n | Failure \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 14 June 1969\n | Sample return\n | Failure \u2013 booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Luna-15 | 5,700\n | Proton\n | 13 July 1969\n | Sample return\n | Failure \u2013 lunar crash impact\n | Mare Crisium | unknown\n |\n| Cosmos-300\n |  | Proton\n | 23 September 1969\n | Sample return\n | Failure \u2013 stranded in low Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Cosmos-305\n |  | Proton\n | 22 October 1969\n | Sample return\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwo organizations have attempted but failed to achieve soft landings: Israeli private space agency SpaceIL with their Beresheet spacecraft, and Japanese company ispace's Hakuto-R Mission 1.\n\n\nOn August 23, 2023, ISRO successfully landed its Chandrayaan-3 module at the lunar south pole, making India the fourth nation to successfully complete a soft landing on the Moon.[7] Chandrayaan-3 saw a successful soft landing of its *Vikram* lander and *Pragyan* rover at 6.04pm IST (1234 GMT), marking the first uncrewed soft landing in the little-explored region.[8]\n\n\n\n## Crewed landings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Apollo program\n\nSee also: List of people who have walked on the Moon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nArrival of a spacecraft on the Moon's surface\n\nThis article is about the general topic of landing on the Moon.

It determined the resident population of the United States to be 248,709,873, an increase of 9.8 percent over the 226,545,805 persons enumerated during the 1980 census.[1]\n\n\nApproximately 16 percent of households received a \"long form\" of the 1990 census, which contained more than 100 questions. Full documentation on the 1990 census, including census forms and a procedural history, is available from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.\n\n\nIt was the first census to designate \"Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\" as a racial group separate from Asians.\n\n\nTo increase black participation in the 1990 United States census, the bureau recruited Bill Cosby, Magic Johnson, Alfre Woodard, and Miss America Debbye Turner as spokespeople.[2] The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series. Aggregate data for small areas, together with electronic boundary files, can be downloaded from the National Historical Geographic Information System. Personally identifiable information will be available in 2062.[3]\n\n\nThis was the first census since 1880 in which Chicago was not the second-largest city, having been overtaken by Los Angeles. As of the 2020 census, Los Angeles has remained the nation's second-largest city.\n\n\n\n\n## State rankings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map showing the population change of each US State by

results of the 1990 census determined the number of seats that each state receives in the United States House of Representatives starting with the 1992 elections. Consequently, this affected the number of votes each state has in the Electoral College for the 1992 presidential election.\n\n\nBecause of population changes, twenty-one states had changes in their number of seats. Eight states gained at least one seat, and thirteen states lost at least one seat. The final result involved 19 seats being switched.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Gained seven seats | Gained four seats | Gained three seats | Gained one seat | Lost one seat | Lost two seats | Lost three seats\n

There was a market relationship between the people and the state as the employer; people were free to choose their job and leave if they wished, although members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union could be ordered to work in certain places, but seldom were.[23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the detailed data series that was ultimately published in the late 1980s showed, the reported IMR for the Soviet Union as a whole increased from 24.7 in 1970 to a peak of 31.4 in 1976. After that the IMR gradually decreased and by 1989 it had fallen to 22.7, which was lower than had been reported in any previous year (though close to the figure of 22.9 in 1971).[13] In 1989, the IMR ranged from a low of 11.1 in the Latvian SSR to a high of 54.7 in the Turkmen SSR.[14]\n\n\nResearch conducted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union revealed that the originally reported mortality rates vary substantially underestimated the actual rates, especially for infant mortality. This has been shown for Transcaucasian and Central Asian republics.[15][16]\n\n\nAfter two decades of declining and stagnating fertility rates, the Soviet TFR rose from 2.27 in 1978-79 to 2.51 in 1986-87. Most Muslim areas of the USSR continued to fall, while non-Muslim regions rose slightly.[17]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** G\u00e9raldine Duth\u00e9, Irina Badurashvili, Karine Kuyumjyan, France Mesl\u00e9, and Jacques Vallin, \"Mortality in the Caucasus: An attempt to re-estimate recent mortality trends in Armenia and Georgia,\" *Demographic Research,* Vol. 22, art. 23, pp. 691-732 (2010).\n16. **^** Michel Guillot, So-jung Lim, Liudmila Torgasheva & Mikhail Denisenko, \"Infant mortality in Kyrgyzstan before and after the break-up of the Soviet Union,\" *Population Studies,* Vol. 67, No. 3: 335-352 (2013).\n17. **^** Aanderson, Barbara A.
