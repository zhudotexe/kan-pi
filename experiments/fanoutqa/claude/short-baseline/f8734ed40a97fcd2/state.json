It received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on.[2][3][4] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his children.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Alyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin, a kindergarten teacher, aspiring artist, and Marshall's wife. She is terrible at keeping secrets and can be manipulative at times. She marries Marshall in season 2 and gives birth to Marvin in season 7. Though appearing sweet and cute, Lily can be quite unexpectedly fierce. Her best girl friend is Robin, whom she met through Ted as he dated Robin. Hannigan's husband Alexis Denisof appeared in ten episodes as Sandy Rivers.\n* Cristin Milioti as The Mother, the titular character who is Ted's future wife. She makes her first official appearance in Season 8, and gradually meets all the characters throughout Season 9 leading up to her meeting Ted.\n\n\n## Season synopsis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *How I Met Your Mother* episodes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*How I Met Your Mother* was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' idea to \"write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York\", where they previously worked as writers for *Late Show with David Letterman*, among others.[1] The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[5][6] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[5] Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived *Freaks and Geeks* and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's follow-up show, *Undeclared*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***How I Met Your Mother*** (often abbreviated as ***HIMYM***) is an American sitcom, created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for CBS. The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*How I Met Your Mother* episodes\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Seasons:** 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n |\n| Season 1 | * \"Pilot\"\n* \"Purple Giraffe\"\n* \"The Pineapple Incident\"\n* \"The Limo\"\n* \"The Wedding\"\n* \"Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.\"\n* \"Mary the Paralegal\"\n |\n| Season 2 | * \"Where Were We?\"\n* \"Ted Mosby, Architect\"\n* \"Swarley\"\n* \"Slap Bet\"\n* \"Single Stamina\"\n* \"How Lily Stole Christmas\"\n* \"First Time in New York\"\n* \"Columns\"\n* \"Monday Night Football\"\n* \"Lucky Penny\"\n* \"Something Blue\"\n |\n| Season 3 | * \"Wait for It\"\n* \"We're Not from Here\"\n* \"Third Wheel\"\n* \"Little Boys\"\n* \"How I Met Everyone Else\"\n* \"I'm Not That Guy\"\n* \"Dowisetrepla\"\n* \"Spoiler Alert\"\n* \"Slapsgiving\"\n* \"The Yips\"\n* \"The Platinum Rule\"\n* \"No Tomorrow\"\n* \"Ten Sessions\"\n* \"The Bracket\"\n* \"The Chain of Screaming\"\n* \"Sandcastles in the Sand\"\n* \"The Goat\"\n* \"Rebound Bro\"\n* \"Everything Must Go\"\n* \"Miracles\"\n |\n| Season 4 | * \"Do I Know You?\"\n* \"I Heart NJ\"\n* \"Intervention\"\n* \"Shelter Island\"\n* \"Happily Ever After\"\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2013, *How I Met Your Mother* was renewed for a ninth season.[44] Carter Bays told *Entertainment Weekly* that season 9 would \"feature some of the most non-linear episodes we've ever done\".[45]\n\n\nThe season 9 premiere episode aired on September 23, 2013, and the one-hour series finale aired on March 31, 2014.[46]\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *How I Met Your Mother* characters\n\n* Main cast\n* ![Josh Radnor Ted Mosby](image)\n\nJosh Radnor   \nTed Mosby\n* ![Jason Segel](image)\n\nJason Segel  \nMarshall Eriksen\n* ![Cobie Smulders](image)\n\nCobie Smulders  \nRobin Scherbatsky\n* ![Neil Patrick Harris](image)\n\nNeil Patrick Harris  \nBarney Stinson\n* ![Alyson Hannigan](image)\n\nAlyson Hannigan  \nLily Aldrin\n* ![Cristin Milioti](image)\n\nCristin Milioti  \nThe Mother\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"TV Summer School: How to Create and Run a Successful Sitcom\". *E!

The narrative deals primarily with his best friends. These include the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes, as well as womanizing playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). All of the characters' lives are entwined. The series explores many storylines, including a \"will they or won't they\" relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** Rome, Emily (September 24, 2012). \"'How I Met Your Mother': Showrunners talk about the (possible) beginning of the end\". *Entertainment Weekly*.

Lily and Marshall have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall finally proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), whom he met in the restroom at a bar four years earlier. Barney is a serial womanizer who concocts elaborate con games, usually involving costumes and fake identities, designed to bed women, only to lose interest in them immediately afterward.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Cobie Smulders as Robin Scherbatsky, a news anchor trying to make it as a journalist who dates both Ted and Barney. Robin emigrated from Canada to take a job at a news station and met Ted at MacLaren's; her Canadian background is a source of many jokes from her friends, for instance, \u2018Robin Sparkles\u2019 which was her stage name as a Canadian teenage pop-star. She is very career-centric and rejects traditional roles, such as getting married and having kids. Robin often drinks scotch and smokes cigars, and is an avid gun fan. She and Barney get engaged and marry in the penultimate episode of the series, but divorce in the first part of the series finale, three years later. Smulders's husband Taran Killam appeared in six episodes as Gary Blauman.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Ryan, Maureen (July 19, 2008). \"Barney writes a book, Barney + Robin, Ted + Stella and other 'How I Met Your Mother' news\". *Chicago Tribune*.
