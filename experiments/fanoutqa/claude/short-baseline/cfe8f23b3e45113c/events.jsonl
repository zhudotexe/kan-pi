AlphaGo won all but the fourth game;[1] all games were won by resignation.[2] The match has been compared with the historic chess match between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov in 1997.\n\n\nThe winner of the match was slated to win $1 million. Since AlphaGo won, Google DeepMind stated that the prize will be donated to charities, including UNICEF, and Go organisations.[3] Lee received $170,000 ($150,000 for participating in the five games and an additional $20,000 for winning one game).[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlphaGo (white) won the first game. Lee appeared to be in control throughout much of the match, but AlphaGo gained the advantage in the final 20 minutes and Lee resigned.[45] Lee stated afterwards that he had made a critical error at the beginning of the match; he said that the computer's strategy in the early part of the game was \"excellent\" and that the AI had made one unusual move that no human Go player would have made.[45] David Ormerod, commenting on the game at Go Game Guru, described Lee's seventh stone as \"a strange move to test AlphaGo's strength in the opening\", characterising the move as a mistake and AlphaGo's response as \"accurate and efficient\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAn Younggil at Go Game Guru concluded that the game was \"a masterpiece for Lee Sedol and will almost certainly become a famous game in the history of Go\".[57] Lee commented after the match that he considered AlphaGo was strongest when playing white (second).[61] For this reason, he requested that he play black in the fifth game, which is considered more risky.\n\n\nDavid Ormerod of Go Game Guru stated that although an analysis of AlphaGo's play around 79–87 was not yet available, he believed it was a result of a known weakness in play algorithms which use Monte Carlo tree search. In essence, the search attempts to prune sequences which are less relevant. In some cases, a play can lead to a very specific line of play which is significant, but which is overlooked when the tree is pruned, and this outcome is therefore \"off the search radar\".[62]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** Byford, Sam (12 March 2016). \"AlphaGo beats Lee Se-dol again to take Google DeepMind Challenge series\". *The Verge*.

Lee stated afterwards that \"AlphaGo played a nearly perfect game\",[49] \"from very beginning of the game I did not feel like there was a point that I was leading\".[50] One of the creators of AlphaGo, Demis Hassabis, said that the system was confident of victory from the midway point of the game, even though the professional commentators could not tell which player was ahead.[50]\n\n\nMichael Redmond (9p) noted that AlphaGo's 19th stone (move 37) was \"creative\" and \"unique\". It was a move that no human would've ever made.[30] Lee took an unusually long time to respond to the move.[30] An Younggil (8p) called AlphaGo's move 37 \"a rare and intriguing shoulder hit\" but said Lee's counter was \"exquisite\". He stated that control passed between the players several times before the endgame, and especially praised AlphaGo's moves 151, 157, and 159, calling them \"brilliant\".[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLee, playing black, opened with a High Chinese formation and generated a large area of black influence, which AlphaGo invaded at move 12. This required the program to defend a weak group, which it did successfully.[54] An Younggil described Lee's move 31 as possibly the \"losing move\"[54] and Andy Jackson of the American Go Association considered that the outcome had already been decided by move 35.[53] AlphaGo had gained control of the game by move 48, and forced Lee onto the defensive. Lee counterattacked at moves 77/79, but AlphaGo's response was effective and its move 90 succeeded in simplifying the position. It then gained a large area of control at the bottom of the board, strengthening its position with moves from 102 to 112 described by An as \"sophisticated\".[54] Lee attacked again at moves 115 and 125, but AlphaGo's responses were again effective. Lee eventually attempted a complex *ko* from move 131, without forcing an error from the program, and he resigned at move 176.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe described AlphaGo's position as favourable in the first part of the game, considering that Lee started to come back with move 81, before making \"questionable\" moves at 119 and 123, followed by a \"losing\" move at 129.[46] Professional Go player Cho Hanseung commented that AlphaGo's game had greatly improved from when it beat Fan Hui in October 2015.[46] Michael Redmond described the computer's game as being more aggressive than against Fan.[47]\n\n\nAccording to 9-dan Go grandmaster Kim Seong-ryong, Lee seemed stunned by AlphaGo's strong play on the 102nd stone.[48] After watching AlphaGo make the game's 102nd move, Lee mulled over his options for more than 10 minutes.[48]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first 11 moves were identical to the second game, where Lee also played white. In the early game, Lee concentrated on taking territory in the edges and corners of the board, allowing AlphaGo to gain influence in the top and centre. Lee then invaded AlphaGo's region of influence at the top with moves 40 to 48, following the *amashi* strategy. AlphaGo responded with a shoulder hit at move 47, subsequently sacrificing four stones elsewhere, and gaining the initiative with moves 47 to 53 and 69. Lee tested AlphaGo with moves 72 to 76 without provoking an error, and by this point in the game commentators had begun to feel Lee's play was a lost cause. However, an unexpected play at white 78, described as \"a brilliant *tesuji*\", turned the game around.[57] The move developed a white wedge at the centre, and increased the game's complexity.[58] Gu Li (9p) described it as a \"divine move\" and stated that the move had been completely unforeseen by him.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Byford, Sam (10 March 2016). \"Google's DeepMind beats Lee Se-dol again to go 2-0 up in historic Go series\". *The Verge*.\n51. **^** Ormerod, David (10 March 2016). \"AlphaGo races ahead 2–0 against Lee Sedol\".

By white 90, AlphaGo had regained equality, and then played a series of moves described by Ormerod as \"unusual... but subtly impressive\" which gained a small advantage. Lee tried a Hail Mary pass with moves 167 and 169 but AlphaGo's defence was successful. An Younggil noted white moves 154, 186 and 194 as being particularly strong, and the program played an impeccable endgame, maintaining its lead until Lee resigned.[64]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\nAlphaGo (white) won the third game.[55]\n\n\n\nAfter the second game, there had still been strong doubts among players whether AlphaGo was truly a strong player in the sense that a human might be. The third game was described as removing that doubt; with analysts commenting that: \n\n\n> AlphaGo won so convincingly as to remove all doubt about its strength from the minds of experienced players. In fact, it played so well that it was almost scary ... In forcing AlphaGo to withstand a very severe, one-sided attack, Lee revealed its hitherto undetected power ... Lee wasn’t gaining enough profit from his attack ... One of the greatest virtuosos of the middle game had just been upstaged in black and white clarity.[54] \n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Moves 100–180 (177 at ![](image), 178 at ![](image))\n |\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\nAlphaGo (white) won the fifth game.[63] The game was described as being close. Hassabis stated that the result came after the program made a \"bad mistake\" early in the game.[63]\n\n\nLee, playing black, opened in a similar fashion to the first game and then began to stake out territory in the right and top left corners – a similar strategy to the one he employed successfully in game 4 – while AlphaGo gained influence in the centre of the board. The game remained even until white moves 48 to 58, which AlphaGo played in the bottom right. These moves unnecessarily lost ko threats and aji, allowing Lee to take the lead.[64] Michael Redmond (9p) speculated that perhaps AlphaGo had missed black's \"tombstone squeeze\" *tesuji*. Humans are taught to recognize the specific pattern, but it is a long sequence of moves if it has to be computed from scratch.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Moves 100–176 (122 at 113,154 at ![](image), 163 at 145, 164 at 151, 166 and 171 at 160, 169 at 145, 175 at ![](image))\n |\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\nLee (white) won the fourth game. Lee chose to play a type of extreme strategy, known as *amashi*, in response to AlphaGo's apparent preference for *Souba Go* (attempting to win by many small gains when the opportunity arises), taking territory at the perimeter rather than the center.[57] By doing so, his apparent aim was to force an \"all or nothing\" style of situation – a possible weakness for an opponent strong at negotiation types of play, and one which might make AlphaGo's capability of deciding slim advantages largely irrelevant.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"Why the Final Game Between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol Is Such a Big Deal for Humanity\". *Wired*. 14 March 2016.

In some cases, a play can lead to a very specific line of play which is significant, but which is overlooked when the tree is pruned, and this outcome is therefore \"off the search radar\".[62]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** Byford, Sam (12 March 2016). \"AlphaGo beats Lee Se-dol again to take Google DeepMind Challenge series\". *The Verge*.

Lee stated afterwards that \"AlphaGo played a nearly perfect game\",[49] \"from very beginning of the game I did not feel like there was a point that I was leading\".[50] One of the creators of AlphaGo, Demis Hassabis, said that the system was confident of victory from the midway point of the game, even though the professional commentators could not tell which player was ahead.[50]\n\n\nMichael Redmond (9p) noted that AlphaGo's 19th stone (move 37) was \"creative\" and \"unique\". It was a move that no human would've ever made.[30] Lee took an unusually long time to respond to the move.[30] An Younggil (8p) called AlphaGo's move 37 \"a rare and intriguing shoulder hit\" but said Lee's counter was \"exquisite\". He stated that control passed between the players several times before the endgame, and especially praised AlphaGo's moves 151, 157, and 159, calling them \"brilliant\".[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLee, playing black, opened with a High Chinese formation and generated a large area of black influence, which AlphaGo invaded at move 12. This required the program to defend a weak group, which it did successfully.[54] An Younggil described Lee's move 31 as possibly the \"losing move\"[54] and Andy Jackson of the American Go Association considered that the outcome had already been decided by move 35.[53] AlphaGo had gained control of the game by move 48, and forced Lee onto the defensive. Lee counterattacked at moves 77/79, but AlphaGo's response was effective and its move 90 succeeded in simplifying the position. It then gained a large area of control at the bottom of the board, strengthening its position with moves from 102 to 112 described by An as \"sophisticated\".[54] Lee attacked again at moves 115 and 125, but AlphaGo's responses were again effective. Lee eventually attempted a complex *ko* from move 131, without forcing an error from the program, and he resigned at move 176.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe described AlphaGo's position as favourable in the first part of the game, considering that Lee started to come back with move 81, before making \"questionable\" moves at 119 and 123, followed by a \"losing\" move at 129.[46] Professional Go player Cho Hanseung commented that AlphaGo's game had greatly improved from when it beat Fan Hui in October 2015.[46] Michael Redmond described the computer's game as being more aggressive than against Fan.[47]\n\n\nAccording to 9-dan Go grandmaster Kim Seong-ryong, Lee seemed stunned by AlphaGo's strong play on the 102nd stone.[48] After watching AlphaGo make the game's 102nd move, Lee mulled over his options for more than 10 minutes.[48]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first 11 moves were identical to the second game, where Lee also played white. In the early game, Lee concentrated on taking territory in the edges and corners of the board, allowing AlphaGo to gain influence in the top and centre. Lee then invaded AlphaGo's region of influence at the top with moves 40 to 48, following the *amashi* strategy. AlphaGo responded with a shoulder hit at move 47, subsequently sacrificing four stones elsewhere, and gaining the initiative with moves 47 to 53 and 69. Lee tested AlphaGo with moves 72 to 76 without provoking an error, and by this point in the game commentators had begun to feel Lee's play was a lost cause. However, an unexpected play at white 78, described as \"a brilliant *tesuji*\", turned the game around.[57] The move developed a white wedge at the centre, and increased the game's complexity.[58] Gu Li (9p) described it as a \"divine move\" and stated that the move had been completely unforeseen by him.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Byford, Sam (10 March 2016). \"Google's DeepMind beats Lee Se-dol again to go 2-0 up in historic Go series\". *The Verge*.\n51. **^** Ormerod, David (10 March 2016). \"AlphaGo races ahead 2–0 against Lee Sedol\".

By white 90, AlphaGo had regained equality, and then played a series of moves described by Ormerod as \"unusual... but subtly impressive\" which gained a small advantage. Lee tried a Hail Mary pass with moves 167 and 169 but AlphaGo's defence was successful. An Younggil noted white moves 154, 186 and 194 as being particularly strong, and the program played an impeccable endgame, maintaining its lead until Lee resigned.[64]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\nAlphaGo (white) won the third game.[55]\n\n\n\nAfter the second game, there had still been strong doubts among players whether AlphaGo was truly a strong player in the sense that a human might be. The third game was described as removing that doubt; with analysts commenting that: \n\n\n> AlphaGo won so convincingly as to remove all doubt about its strength from the minds of experienced players. In fact, it played so well that it was almost scary ... In forcing AlphaGo to withstand a very severe, one-sided attack, Lee revealed its hitherto undetected power ... Lee wasn’t gaining enough profit from his attack ... One of the greatest virtuosos of the middle game had just been upstaged in black and white clarity.[54] \n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Moves 100–180 (177 at ![](image), 178 at ![](image))\n |\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\nAlphaGo (white) won the fifth game.[63] The game was described as being close. Hassabis stated that the result came after the program made a \"bad mistake\" early in the game.[63]\n\n\nLee, playing black, opened in a similar fashion to the first game and then began to stake out territory in the right and top left corners – a similar strategy to the one he employed successfully in game 4 – while AlphaGo gained influence in the centre of the board. The game remained even until white moves 48 to 58, which AlphaGo played in the bottom right. These moves unnecessarily lost ko threats and aji, allowing Lee to take the lead.[64] Michael Redmond (9p) speculated that perhaps AlphaGo had missed black's \"tombstone squeeze\" *tesuji*. Humans are taught to recognize the specific pattern, but it is a long sequence of moves if it has to be computed from scratch.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Moves 100–176 (122 at 113,154 at ![](image), 163 at 145, 164 at 151, 166 and 171 at 160, 169 at 145, 175 at ![](image))\n |\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\nLee (white) won the fourth game. Lee chose to play a type of extreme strategy, known as *amashi*, in response to AlphaGo's apparent preference for *Souba Go* (attempting to win by many small gains when the opportunity arises), taking territory at the perimeter rather than the center.[57] By doing so, his apparent aim was to force an \"all or nothing\" style of situation – a possible weakness for an opponent strong at negotiation types of play, and one which might make AlphaGo's capability of deciding slim advantages largely irrelevant.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"Why the Final Game Between AlphaGo and Lee Sedol Is Such a Big Deal for Humanity\". *Wired*. 14 March 2016.
