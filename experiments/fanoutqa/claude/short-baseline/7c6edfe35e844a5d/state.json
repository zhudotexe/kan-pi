According to the Special Extended Edition DVD of *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, Mortensen was a last-minute replacement for Stuart Townsend, and would not have taken the part of Aragorn had it not been for his son's enthusiasm for the J. R. R. Tolkien novel.[21] He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Aragorn, and was ranked No. 15 on a 2015 survey of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" conducted by *Empire*.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nToronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor\n |\n| --- |\n| * Ian Holm (1997)\n* Ian McKellen (1998)\n* Kevin Spacey (1999)\n* Benicio del Toro (2000)\n* Ed Harris (2001)\n* Nicolas Cage (2002)\n* Bill Murray (2003)\n* Paul Giamatti (2004)\n* Philip Seymour Hoffman (2005)\n* Sacha Baron Cohen (2006)\n* Viggo Mortensen (2007)\n* Mickey Rourke (2008)\n* Nicolas Cage (2009)\n* Jesse Eisenberg (2010)\n* Michael Shannon (2011)\n* Denis Lavant (2012)\n* Oscar Isaac (2013)\n* Tom Hardy (2014)\n* Tom Hardy (2015)\n* Adam Driver (2016)\n* Daniel Day-Lewis (2017)\n* Ethan Hawke (2018)\n* Adam Driver (2019)\n* Riz Ahmed (2020)\n* Denzel Washington (2021)\n* Paul Mescal (2022)\n |\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* United States\n |\n| Artists | * Photographers' Identities\n* RKD Artists\n* ULAN\n |\n| People | * Deutsche Biographie\n |\n| Other | * SNAC\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMortensen gained international attention for playing Aragorn in the fantasy trilogy *The Lord of the Rings* (2001\u20132003). He gained acclaim for his collaborations with filmmaker David Cronenberg in the thrillers *A History of Violence* (2005), *Eastern Promises* (2007), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and *A Dangerous Method* (2011).[4] He gained additional Academy Award nominations for his leading roles as an anarchist father in *Captain Fantastic* (2016) and as Tony Lip in *Green Book* (2018). Mortensen made his directorial debut with *Falling* (2020), in which he also starred.\n\n\nAside from acting, Mortensen has explored fine arts, photography, poetry, and music. In 2002, he founded the Perceval Press to publish both his works and the works of little-known artists and authors. Mortensen sang and composed for part of *The Lord of the Rings* soundtrack and has collaborated with guitarist Buckethead on several albums.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSatellite Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture\n |\n| --- |\n| Drama  (1996\u20132010, 2018\u2013present) | * Geoffrey Rush (1996)\n* Robert Duvall (1997)\n* Edward Norton (1998)\n* Terence Stamp (1999)\n* Geoffrey Rush (2000)\n* Brian Cox (2001)\n* Michael Caine / Daniel Day-Lewis (2002)\n* Sean Penn (2003)\n* Don Cheadle (2004)\n* Philip Seymour Hoffman (2005)\n* Forest Whitaker (2006)\n* Viggo Mortensen (2007)\n* Richard Jenkins (2008)\n* Jeremy Renner (2009)\n* Colin Firth (2010)\n* Willem Dafoe (2018)\n* Christian Bale (2019)\n* Riz Ahmed (2020)\n* Benedict Cumberbatch (2021)\n* Brendan Fraser (2022)\n* Cillian Murphy (2023)\n |\n| Musical or Comedy  (1996\u20132010, 2018\u2013present) | * Tom Cruise (1996)\n* Jack Nicholson (1997)\n* Ian Bannen / David Kelly (1998)\n* Philip Seymour Hoffman (1999)\n* Michael Douglas (2000)\n* Ewan McGregor (2001)\n* Kieran Culkin (2002)\n* Bill Murray (2003)\n* Jamie Foxx (2004)\n* Terrence Howard (2005)\n* Joseph Cross (2006)\n* Ryan Gosling (2007)\n* Ricky Gervais (2008)\n* Michael Stuhlbarg (2009)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn *The Two Towers* DVD extras, the film's swordmaster, Bob Anderson, described Mortensen as \"the best swordsman I've ever trained.\" Mortensen often performed his own stunts, and even the injuries he sustained during several of them, including two broken toes, did not dampen his enthusiasm. At one point during shooting of *The Two Towers*, Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Brett Beattie (stunt double for John Rhys-Davies) all had painful injuries, and during a shoot of them, running in the mountains, Peter Jackson jokingly referred to the three as \"the walking wounded.\"[23] Also, according to the Special Extended Edition DVD of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, Mortensen purchased the two horses, Uraeus and Kenny, whom he had ridden and bonded with over the duration of the films.[24]\n\n\nIn 2004, Mortensen starred as Frank Hopkins in *Hidalgo*, the story of an ex-army courier who travels to Arabia to compete with his horse, Hidalgo, in a dangerous desert race for a contest prize.[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Mortensen together with Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson from *The Lord of the Rings* in May 2020 joined actor Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart*, which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[44]\n\n\nIn 2020 he released his directorial debut *Falling* which he also wrote, produced, composed the score for and starred in alongside Lance Henriksen.[45] Mortensen had based the story on his own family's history, including his parents suffering from dementia.

His nude fight scene in a steam room was applauded by Roger Ebert: \"Years from now, it will be referred to as a benchmark.\"[29] Mortensen's performance in *Eastern Promises* resulted in his winning the Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film award from the British Independent Film Awards.[30] He was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.[31]\n\n\nMortensen appeared as himself in the 2009 film *Reclaiming The Blade*, in which he discussed his passion for the sword and his sword-work in films such as *The Lord of the Rings* and *Alatriste*.

The play is about a man and woman confined either a psychiatric hospital or prison together. During production, Mortensen's mother became ill and he pulled out of the initial premiere date, the first time he had ever done so for a project. The play premiered from November 4 to December 18.[38]\n\n\nDuring production for the 2012 film *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*, Mortensen was offered to reprise his role as Aragorn, but he declined because the character does not appear in the novel the film is based on.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mortensen at the 32nd Genie Awards in March 2012\nIn 2009, Mortensen performed in *The People Speak*, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn's *A People's History of the United States*. While it was reported in April 2009 that Mortensen had, at least temporarily, retired from film acting,[33] Mortensen said he was misquoted. In a 2012 interview, he denied that he ever said he was retiring, only that he didn't have \"plans to do another movie\" at the time and that he was \"taking a little break now. I don't have anything lined up.\"[34] In 2009 he joined the cast of *The Road*, a film adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name,[35] and collaborated with David Cronenberg for a third time on *A Dangerous Method*.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2010s\u2013present: Critical acclaim[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2009: Ian McKellen\n |\n| 2010s | * 2010: Julia Roberts\n* 2011: Glenn Close\n* 2012: Oliver Stone / Ewan McGregor / Tommy Lee Jones / John Travolta / Dustin Hoffman\n* 2013: Carmen Maura / Hugh Jackman\n* 2014: Denzel Washington / Benicio del Toro\n* 2015: Emily Watson\n* 2016: Sigourney Weaver / Ethan Hawke\n* 2017: Ricardo Dar\u00edn / Monica Bellucci / Agn\u00e8s Varda\n* 2018: Hirokazu Kore-eda / Danny DeVito / Judi Dench\n* 2019: Pen\u00e9lope Cruz / Costa-Gavras / Donald Sutherland\n |\n| 2020s | * 2020: Viggo Mortensen\n* 2021: Johnny Depp / Marion Cotillard\n* 2022: Juliette Binoche / David Cronenberg\n* 2023: Javier Bardem / V\u00edctor Erice / Hayao Miyazaki\n* 2024: Cate Blanchett\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNational Board of Review Award for Best Actor\n |\n| --- |\n| 1945\u20131975 | * Ray Milland (1945)\n* Laurence Olivier (1946)\n* Michael Redgrave (1947)\n* Walter Huston (1948)\n* Ralph Richardson (1949)\n* Alec Guinness (1950)\n* Richard Basehart (1951)\n* Ralph Richardson (1952)\n* James Mason (1953)\n* Bing Crosby (1954)\n* Ernest Borgnine (1955)\n* Yul Brynner (1956)\n* Alec Guinness (1957)\n* Spencer Tracy (1958)\n* Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m (1959)\n* Robert Mitchum (1960)\n* Albert Finney (1961)\n* Jason Robards (1962)\n* Rex Harrison (1963)\n* Anthony Quinn (1964)\n* Lee Marvin (1965)\n* Paul Scofield (1966)\n* Peter Finch (1967)\n* Cliff Robertson (1968)\n* Peter O'Toole (1969)\n* George C.
