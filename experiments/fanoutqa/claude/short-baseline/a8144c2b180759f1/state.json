The order was to be chosen based on opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[3] but the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on that date, leaving the fate of the proposed joint ticket in doubt.[4]\n\n\nDomestic issues, such as energy policy, national defense and economic development have featured as campaign issues in the election, coupled by foreign issues mostly concerning Taiwan\u2019s Cross-Strait relations with Mainland China, and relations with the United States.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of 14 November 2023, four presidential candidates have been nominated by a party or qualified as an independent, making the election the most contested since 2000.

He has been the incumbent mayor of New Taipei since 25 December 2018.[2] Previously, he served as Director-General of the National Police Agency from 2006 to 2008 and as acting mayor of New Taipei City from October 2015 to January 2016. He is Kuomintang's official candidate for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential elections. He firstly joined the party during the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n\n\n\n## Law enforcement career[edit]\n\n\nUpon his graduation from the Central Police University, Hou was sent to the Taipei City Police Department. Hou obtained his first leadership role, as captain of the Taipei criminal police, in 1980.[3] In 1992, he became an inspector at the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), a division of the National Police Agency (NPA). Five years later, he led the rescue of the Alexander family.[4] In 1998 Hou was named second in command of the CIB. He was given the concurrent post of Taoyuan County police chief in 2001 and promoted within the NPA in 2003, becoming the leader of the CIB.[5] The next year, Hou was tasked with investigating the 3-19 shooting incident,[6] an assassination attempt on President Chen Shui-bian, a longtime friend.[7] He was named the director-general of the NPA in 2006, becoming the youngest leader of the police force at the time of his appointment.[8] During his tenure, the NPA was criticized for its inadequate response to the 2006 protests led by Shih Ming-teh.[9][10] Multiple Kuomintang politicians also wanted Hou to reopen the investigation on the 3-19 shooting incident. Arms dealer Tang Shou-yi, who had fled to Mainland China by August 2006, had recanted his confession, stating that it was coerced and therefore untrue.[11] Hou was named the president of Central Police University in 2008[12] and was replaced at the NPA by Wang Cho-chiun\u00a0[zh].[13]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nHou originally joined the Kuomintang in 1975, but allowed his membership to lapse during his law enforcement career.[14][15] Hou was recruited to join the Democratic Progressive Party in 2002.[16] Eric Chu asked Hou to serve as deputy mayor of New Taipei in 2010,[17] and Hou rejoined the Kuomintang in 2013.[15] Hou served as deputy mayor alongside Lee Shu-chuan and Hsu Chih-chien who left office on 25 February 2014 and 30 June 2014, respectively.[18][19][20] Later, Chen Shen-hsien was appointed to the deputy mayorship.[21] Hou was promoted from his previous position as deputy mayor on 20 October 2015, as Chu prepared for the 2016 presidential election.[22] Chu lost the election to Tsai Ing-wen, and resumed mayoral duties on 18 January 2016.[23]\n\n\nHou resigned from the deputy mayorship on 28 February 2018, stating that he would contest the Kuomintang mayoral primary.[24][25] On 6 April 2018, the KMT announced that Hou had won the primary.[26][27]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Kuomintang New Taipei City mayoral primary results[28] |\n| --- |\n| Candidates\n | Place\n | Results\n |\n| **Hou Yu-ih** | **Nominated** | **55.596%** |\n| Chou Hsi-wei | 2nd\n | 34.210%\n |\n| Ching Chieh-shou\n | 3rd\n | 10.194%\n |\n\n\n### 2018 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2018 New Taipei mayoralty election result\n\n\n| 2018 New Taipei City mayoral results[29][30] |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Su Tseng-chang | Template:DPP | 873,692\n | 42.85%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,165,130\n | 57.15%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | \u30003,264,128\n |\n| **Valid votes** | \u30002,038,822\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | \u300050,305\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | \u300062.46%\n |\n\n\n### 2022 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, 2022, Hou confirmed that he would run for a second term as mayor of New Taipei.[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2022 New Taipei City mayoral results\n |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Lin Chia-lung | Template:DPP | 693,976\n | 37.58%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,152,555\n | 62.42%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | \u30003,316,517\n |\n| **Valid votes** | \u30001,877,186\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | \u300030,655\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | \u300056.60%\n |\n\n\n### 2024 presidential elections[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the 2024 presidential election, Hou was considered the favorite for the Kuomintang presidential primary.[32] He was drafted by the Kuomintang on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency.[33][34]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, KMT and Taiwan People's Party leadership announced that they would field a single joint presidential ticket made up of Hou and TPP chairman Ko Wen-je. The order was to be determined by opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[35] but the parties were unable to reach an agreement on that date, leaving the possibility of a joint ticket in doubt.[36]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHou was born on 7 June 1957, in Puzi, Chiayi County, where his family owned a pork stall. As a child Hou aided the family business by catching and butchering wild pigs.[3]\n\n\nHou's firstborn son Hou Ni-wei died on 15 May 1992, in a tour bus fire,[37][38][39] which killed 23 people.[40] He and his wife Jen Mei-ling raised three daughters, Hou Yu-fan, Hou Ni-chia, and Hou Yu-chia.[41][42]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Out of office as Mayor of New Taipei since 24 September 2023 for being the Kuomintang candidate in the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election\n2. **^** \"\u5e02\u9577 \u4faf\u53cb\u5b9c\". *New Taipei City Government* (in Chinese).

Ko was thus drawn into the Accounting Act Amendment scandal, but the Control Yuan never brought charges. In June that year, Ko's emergency trauma care student Dr. Tseng Yue-tsee was hit by a drunk driver and sustained major trauma. She was brought to the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital.[13] Ko went to the hospital as soon as he was notified and oversaw her treatment, but she died. As a result of this incident, Ko started a foundation for the prevention of drunk driving. In August, Ko was invited by Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung to attend a conference in Beijing and to visit Yan'an, Shaanxi Province.

She is the director of Pediatrics for Taipei City Hospital, Heping Fuyou Women and Children's Health Branch. Ko and Chen had an arranged marriage, and have three children, one boy and two girls.[82] It is known throughout Taiwan that as a mayor Ko earns less than his wife. He once joked that in order to pay off their home mortgage, his wife still could not retire early.[83] Ko has claimed to have Asperger syndrome,[84][85] but, as of 2014, had not been diagnosed.[86] His son also has the condition.[87]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the DPP primaries, Ko refused to debate DPP candidates Annette Lu and Wellington Koo on numerous occasions.[24][25][26][27] A number of \"slips of the tongue\" made it into the news, for example when Ko said that the \"Lawyer Culture\" of Taiwan should end, when he criticised Koo Lee-hsiung's Facebook posts grieving over the death of Trong Chai as \"too emotional\", and when he possibly unintentionally revealed confidential patient information.[28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38]\n\n\nAfter Pasuya Yao made it through the first round of DPP primaries, Ko agreed to a debate on 12 June, and subsequently won the DPP polls.[39][40] On 16 June, the DPP agreed not to put forward a candidate for the election, and to support Ko as the representative of the Pan-Green Coalition, without forcing Ko to join any political party.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 20 June 2012, Ko organised a small treatment team for Chen Shui-bian, whose condition had worsened since his imprisonment, and issued a public statement signed by many prominent individuals in the medical community to demand Chen be released for medical treatment.[69] Ko has made numerous statements expressing his view that Chen should be released for treatment, and has also expressed his view that Chen's prosecution was purely political.[70][71][72][73][74][75]\n\n\nKo supported Tsai Ing-wen in her Presidential bid in 2012 and helped fundraising efforts for her campaign. He is also a permanent member of the pro-Tsai \u201cFriends of Ing Club\u201d.[76] Nevertheless, he has criticized Tsai's proposal for a Taiwan Consensus over lack of clarity.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 10 November, Ko announced his intention to reject further monetary donations to his campaign, as the amount received by 31 October exceeded the NT$87\u00a0million cap set for Taipei mayoral elections.[41]\n\n\nKo's campaign was managed by Yao Li-ming (general manager), Lee Ying-yuan (political platform), Chi Cheng (civic organisations), and Chiou Yue-yee (\"We Care\" youth organisation). Ko's advisers included political scientist and politician Julian Kuo, political activist and filmmaker Yang Huei-ju, and former DPP secretary Chang Yee-shan. DPP city councillor Chien Yue-yen, neurologist Pan Cheng-chih, and two recruits from youth outreach efforts were the acting spokespeople for the campaign.[42]\n\n\n\n### Organ harvesting controversy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** Gutmann, Ethan (August 2014). *The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting and China's Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem*.
