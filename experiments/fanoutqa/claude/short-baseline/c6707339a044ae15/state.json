However, this number is disputed by obstetrics researcher Yi Fuxian, who argues that data related to population growth is inflated by local governments to obtain financial subsidies from the central government.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Population of China by age and sex (demographic pyramid)[edit]\n\n\n* ![China population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953](image)\n\nChina population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953\n* ![China population pyramid as of 2nd National Census day on July 1, 1964](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChina is the second most populous country in the world and its national population density (137/km2) is very similar to those of countries like Denmark (excluding Greenland) or the Czech Republic. However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the Heihe\u2013Tengchong Line; although this eastern area comprises only 43% of China's total land area, its population density, at roughly 280/km2, is comparable to that of Japan.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains[*which?*] and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley (of which the delta region was the most populous), Sichuan Basin, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Country Comparisons - Infant mortality rate\". *The World Factbook*.
