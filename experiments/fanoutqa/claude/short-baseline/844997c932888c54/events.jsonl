Each architect worked on a theme; Gringo Cardia (from Brazil) focused on “defending human dignity”, Shigeru Ban (from Japan) focused on “refusing fatality” and Kéré selected the theme “reconstructing the family link”.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Diébédo Francis Kéré\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Born |  (1965-04-10) 10 April 1965 (age 59)Gando, Boulgou Province, Upper Volta (modern Burkina Faso)\n |\n| Nationality | Burkinabè, German[1] |\n| Alma mater | Technical University of Berlin |\n| Occupation | Architect |\n| Awards | Pritzker Architecture PrizeAga Khan Award for ArchitectureGlobal Award for Sustainable Architecture |\n|  |\n| Practice | Kéré Architecture |\n| Buildings | Gando Primary SchoolGando School Extension |\n| Projects | Gando Secondary SchoolOpera Village |\n|  |\n| Website | www.kerearchitecture.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Kéré Architecture, official site\n* Kéré Foundation organization homepage\n* Festspielhaus Afrika, site for the festival opera house project\n* Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) talk 2010 'Step by Step: Sustainable Buildings in Africa', Francis Kere (video)\n* Francis Kéré – Lecture: the challenges of sustainable construction in Burkina Faso (video)\n* Diébédo Francis Kéré talk in Cape Town (video)\n* Coverage of Diébédo Francis Kéré's work in Domus\n* Coverage of Diébédo Francis Kéré's work in Pin-Up\n* Coverage of Diébédo Francis Kéré's work in Archdaily\n* Domus coverage of the National Park in Mali\n* Domus feature on Kéré and architecture in Africa\n* Domus Interview with Diébédo Francis Kéré\n* Coverage of Diébédo Francis Kéré's work in ArchiAfrika\n* Winner of the Holcim Prize\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Ballard Bell, Victoria; Rand, Patrick (2014). *Materials for design 2*.
