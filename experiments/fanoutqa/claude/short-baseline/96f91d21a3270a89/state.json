The most well-known NBA awards include:\n\n1. NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP)\n2. NBA Defensive Player of the Year\n3. NBA Rookie of the Year\n4. NBA Sixth Man of the Year\n5. NBA Most Improved Player\n\nCould you please clarify which award you're referring to? Once you specify the correct award, I can help you find the information about the players' career rebounds per game.",
