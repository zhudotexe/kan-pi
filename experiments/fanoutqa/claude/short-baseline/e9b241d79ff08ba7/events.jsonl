This included treehouses built by American treehouse builder Pete Nelson, as well as an elevated outdoor lounge named the Crow's Nest.[22][23] The company also announced plans to demolish 12 buildings on the older East Campus and replace them with 18 new buildings, housing 8,000 additional employees and raising the total number of buildings on the campus to 131.[24] The newer buildings would be arranged like an urban neighborhood, centered around a 2-acre (0.81 ha) open space with sports fields (including a cricket pitch), retail space, and hiking trails.[25][26][27] Demolition of the original buildings, including all of the original X-shaped offices built in the 1980s, began in January 2019 and was completed that September.[28][29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of November 2018, the campus holds 83 buildings.[4][5] Additional offices in the Eastside suburbs of Seattle are located in Bellevue and Issaquah. Building 92 on the campus contains a visitor center (with interactive exhibits) and store that are open to the public.\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nMicrosoft chose to move its headquarters from Bellevue to nearby Redmond in January 1985, selecting a 29-acre (12 ha) plot of land that would be developed by Wright Runstad & Company.[6] Construction began on August 9, and Microsoft moved into the $25 million facility on February 26, 1986, several weeks before the company's initial public offering.[7][8] The move generated some concerns about increased traffic congestion on the unfinished State Route 520 freeway between Bellevue and Redmond;[9] a new freeway interchange at Northeast 40th Street would later be built in 2000 to service the campus, after lobbying and partial funding from Microsoft.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first major expansion of the campus came in 1992, bringing the total amount of office space to 1.7 million square feet (160,000 m2) across 260 acres (110 ha) of land. Microsoft also announced its intention to contain most of its future growth within Redmond, while retaining some offices in Downtown Bellevue and its Factoria district.[15] The Redmond campus was plagued by hundreds of rabbits who spread around the area in the late 1990s.[16]\n\n\nIn January 2006, Microsoft announced the purchase of Safeco's Redmond campus after the company had begun consolidating its offices at the Safeco Tower in Seattle's University District a year earlier.[17] The following month, Microsoft announced that it intended to expand its Redmond campus by 1,100,000 square feet (100,000 m2) at a cost of $1 billion and said that this would create space for between 7,000 and 15,000 new employees over the following three years.[18] The campus expansion also included more prominent branding and additional recreation areas.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hardware | * Azure Kinect\n* HoloLens\n* LifeCam\n* Surface\n\t+ Duo\n\t+ Go\n\t+ Hub\n\t+ Laptop\n\t+ Laptop Go\n\t+ Neo\n\t+ Pro\n\t+ Studio\n* Xbox\n |\n| Software | * Clipchamp\n* Dynamics 365\n* Havok\n* Microsoft 365\n\t+ Office\n\t+ Teams\n* Open source software\n* Power Platform\n* Servers\n* Start\n* Tay\n* Visual Studio\n* Visual Studio Code\n* Windows\n* Xbox OS\n |\n| Programminglanguages | * BASIC\n\t+ VB.NET\n\t+ VBA\n\t+ VBScript\n\t+ Visual Basic\n* C#\n* C/AL a.k.a.

Microsoft partially covered the cost for an overpass over the freeway at NE 36th Street to relieve congestion on other cross-streets in the area.[33]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, a shopping mall called \"The Commons\" was completed on the campus, bringing 1.4 million square feet (130,000 m2) of retail space as well as restaurants, a soccer field and a pub, to the West Campus.[20]\n\n\n\n### Latest expansion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2015, *The Seattle Times* reported that Microsoft had hired architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to begin a multibillion-dollar redesign of the Redmond campus, using an additional 1.4 million square feet (130,000 m2) permitted by an agreement with the City of Redmond.[2] The City of Redmond had also approved a rezone in February that year to raise the height limit for buildings on the campus from six stories to ten.[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Lystra, Tony (March 19, 2021). \"Microsoft's new Redmond utility plant to use earth's heat to slash energy use\". *Puget Sound Business Journal*.

This included treehouses built by American treehouse builder Pete Nelson, as well as an elevated outdoor lounge named the Crow's Nest.[22][23] The company also announced plans to demolish 12 buildings on the older East Campus and replace them with 18 new buildings, housing 8,000 additional employees and raising the total number of buildings on the campus to 131.[24] The newer buildings would be arranged like an urban neighborhood, centered around a 2-acre (0.81 ha) open space with sports fields (including a cricket pitch), retail space, and hiking trails.[25][26][27] Demolition of the original buildings, including all of the original X-shaped offices built in the 1980s, began in January 2019 and was completed that September.[28][29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of November 2018, the campus holds 83 buildings.[4][5] Additional offices in the Eastside suburbs of Seattle are located in Bellevue and Issaquah. Building 92 on the campus contains a visitor center (with interactive exhibits) and store that are open to the public.\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nMicrosoft chose to move its headquarters from Bellevue to nearby Redmond in January 1985, selecting a 29-acre (12 ha) plot of land that would be developed by Wright Runstad & Company.[6] Construction began on August 9, and Microsoft moved into the $25 million facility on February 26, 1986, several weeks before the company's initial public offering.[7][8] The move generated some concerns about increased traffic congestion on the unfinished State Route 520 freeway between Bellevue and Redmond;[9] a new freeway interchange at Northeast 40th Street would later be built in 2000 to service the campus, after lobbying and partial funding from Microsoft.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first major expansion of the campus came in 1992, bringing the total amount of office space to 1.7 million square feet (160,000 m2) across 260 acres (110 ha) of land. Microsoft also announced its intention to contain most of its future growth within Redmond, while retaining some offices in Downtown Bellevue and its Factoria district.[15] The Redmond campus was plagued by hundreds of rabbits who spread around the area in the late 1990s.[16]\n\n\nIn January 2006, Microsoft announced the purchase of Safeco's Redmond campus after the company had begun consolidating its offices at the Safeco Tower in Seattle's University District a year earlier.[17] The following month, Microsoft announced that it intended to expand its Redmond campus by 1,100,000 square feet (100,000 m2) at a cost of $1 billion and said that this would create space for between 7,000 and 15,000 new employees over the following three years.[18] The campus expansion also included more prominent branding and additional recreation areas.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hardware | * Azure Kinect\n* HoloLens\n* LifeCam\n* Surface\n\t+ Duo\n\t+ Go\n\t+ Hub\n\t+ Laptop\n\t+ Laptop Go\n\t+ Neo\n\t+ Pro\n\t+ Studio\n* Xbox\n |\n| Software | * Clipchamp\n* Dynamics 365\n* Havok\n* Microsoft 365\n\t+ Office\n\t+ Teams\n* Open source software\n* Power Platform\n* Servers\n* Start\n* Tay\n* Visual Studio\n* Visual Studio Code\n* Windows\n* Xbox OS\n |\n| Programminglanguages | * BASIC\n\t+ VB.NET\n\t+ VBA\n\t+ VBScript\n\t+ Visual Basic\n* C#\n* C/AL a.k.a.

Microsoft partially covered the cost for an overpass over the freeway at NE 36th Street to relieve congestion on other cross-streets in the area.[33]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2009, a shopping mall called \"The Commons\" was completed on the campus, bringing 1.4 million square feet (130,000 m2) of retail space as well as restaurants, a soccer field and a pub, to the West Campus.[20]\n\n\n\n### Latest expansion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2015, *The Seattle Times* reported that Microsoft had hired architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to begin a multibillion-dollar redesign of the Redmond campus, using an additional 1.4 million square feet (130,000 m2) permitted by an agreement with the City of Redmond.[2] The City of Redmond had also approved a rezone in February that year to raise the height limit for buildings on the campus from six stories to ten.[21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Lystra, Tony (March 19, 2021). \"Microsoft's new Redmond utility plant to use earth's heat to slash energy use\". *Puget Sound Business Journal*.
