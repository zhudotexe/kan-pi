OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil-market and in international relations. Economists have characterized OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel[5]\n(a group whose members cooperate to reduce market competition) but one whose consultations may be protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law.[6]\n\n\nCurrent OPEC members are[ref] Algeria, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. Meanwhile, Ecuador, Indonesia and Qatar are former OPEC members.[7] A larger group called **OPEC+**, consisting of OPEC members plus other oil-producing countries, formed in late 2016 to exert more control on the global crude-oil market.[8] Canada, Egypt, Norway and Oman are observer states.\n\n\n\n\n## Organization and structure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring 1961\u20131975, the five founding nations were joined by Qatar (1961), Indonesia (1962\u20132008, rejoined 2014\u20132016), Libya (1962), United Arab Emirates (originally just the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971), Ecuador (1973\u20131992, 2007\u20132020), and Gabon (1975\u20131994, rejoined 2016).[37] By the early 1970s, OPEC's membership accounted for more than half of worldwide oil production.[38] Indicating that OPEC is not averse to further expansion, Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC's acting secretary general in 2006, urged his African neighbors Angola and Sudan to join,[39] and Angola did in 2007, followed by Equatorial Guinea in 2017.[40] Since the 1980s, representatives from Canada, Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers, as an informal mechanism for coordinating policies.[41]\n\n\n\n### 1973\u20131974: oil embargo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1973 oil crisis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a series of steps in the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC restructured the global system of oil production in favor of oil-producing states and away from an oligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms (the Seven Sisters).[3] Coordination among oil-producing states within OPEC made it easier for them to nationalize oil production and structure oil prices in their favor without incurring punishment by Western governments and firms.[3] Prior to the creation of OPEC, individual oil-producing states were punished for taking steps to alter the governing arrangements of oil production within their borders.[3] States were coerced militarily (e.g. in 1953, the US-UK-sponsored a coup against Mohammad Mosaddegh after he nationalized Iran's oil production) or economically (e.g. the Seven Sisters slowed down oil production in one non-compliant state and ramped up oil production elsewhere) when acted contrary to the interests of the Seven Sisters and their governments.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHeads of state of OPEC member states\n |\n| --- |\n| * Tebboune (Algeria)\n* Louren\u00e7o (Angola)\n* Obiang (Equatorial Guinea)\n* Oligui (Gabon)\n* Khamenei (Iran)\n* Rashid (Iraq)\n* Mishal (Kuwait)\n* al-Menfi (Libya)\n* Tinubu (Nigeria)\n* Sassou Nguesso (Republic of the Congo)\n* Salman (Saudi Arabia)\n* Mohamed (United Arab Emirates)\n* Maduro (Venezuela)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries** (**OPEC**, /\u02c8o\u028ap\u025bk/ *OH-pek*) is an organization enabling the co-operation of leading oil-producing countries in order to collectively influence the global oil market and maximize profit. It was founded on 14 September 1960 in Baghdad by the first five members (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela). The 13\u00a0member countries account for an estimated 30\u00a0percent of global oil production.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![refer to caption](image)Countries by net oil exports (2008)\nThe differing economic needs of OPEC member states often affect the internal debates behind OPEC production quotas. Poorer members have pushed for production cuts from fellow members, to increase the price of oil and thus their own revenues.[98] These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia's stated long-term strategy of being a partner with the world's economic powers to ensure a steady flow of oil that would support economic expansion.[99] Part of the basis for this policy is the Saudi concern that overly expensive oil or unreliable supply will drive industrial nations to conserve energy and develop alternative fuels, curtailing the worldwide demand for oil and eventually leaving unneeded barrels in the ground.[100] To this point, Saudi Oil Minister Yamani famously remarked in 1973: \"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones.\"[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOPEC often has difficulty agreeing on policy decisions because its member countries differ widely in their oil export capacities, production costs, reserves, geological features, population, economic development, budgetary situations, and political circumstances.[19][20] Indeed, over the course of market cycles, oil reserves can themselves become a source of serious conflict, instability and imbalances, in what economists call the \"natural resource curse\".[21][22] A further complication is that religion-linked conflicts in the Middle East are recurring features of the geopolitical landscape for this oil-rich region.[23][24] Internationally important conflicts in OPEC's history have included the Six-Day War (1967), Yom Kippur War (1973), a hostage siege directed by Palestinian militants (1975), the Iranian Revolution (1979), Iran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u20131988), Iraqi occupation of Kuwait (1990\u20131991), September 11 attacks (2001), American occupation of Iraq (2003\u20132011), Conflict in the Niger Delta (2004\u2013present), \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOPEC members strongly prefer to describe their organisation as a modest force for market stabilisation, rather than a powerful anti-competitive cartel. In its defense, the organisation was founded as a counterweight against the previous \"Seven Sisters\" cartel of multinational oil companies, and non-OPEC energy suppliers have maintained enough market share for a substantial degree of worldwide competition.[12] Moreover, because of an economic \"prisoner's dilemma\" that encourages each member nation individually to discount its price and exceed its production quota,[13] widespread cheating within OPEC often erodes its ability to influence global oil prices through collective action.[14][15] Political scientist Jeff Colgan has challenged that OPEC is a cartel, pointing to endemic cheating in the organization: \"A cartel needs to set tough goals and meet them; OPEC sets easy goals and fails to meet even those.\"[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIntergovernmental oil organization\n\nNot to be confused with Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Flag of OPEC](image)\n\nFlag\n |\n| ![OPEC and OPEC+ members](image)OPEC and OPEC+ members\n |\n| Headquarters | Vienna, Austria |\n| Official language | English |\n| Type | Cartel[1] |\n| Membership | * OPEC: 13 members\n* OPEC+: 10 further members\n* Observer state(s): CanadaEgyptNorwayOman\n |\n| Leaders |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Secretary General\n | Haitham al-Ghais |\n|  |\n| Establishment | Baghdad, Iraq |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Statute\n | September 1960 (63 years ago)\u00a0(September 1960) |\n| \u2022\u00a0In effect\n | January 1961 (63 years ago)\u00a0(January 1961) |\n|  |\n| **Website**opec.org\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![refer to caption](image)OPEC Conference delegates at Swissotel, Quito, Ecuador, December 2010\nThe OPEC Conference is the supreme authority of the organisation, and consists of delegations normally headed by the oil ministers of member countries. The chief executive of the organisation is the OPEC secretary general. The conference ordinarily meets at the Vienna headquarters, at least twice a year and in additional extraordinary sessions when necessary. It generally operates on the principles of unanimity and \"one member, one vote\", with each country paying an equal membership fee into the annual budget.[9] However, since Saudi Arabia is by far the largest and most-profitable oil exporter in the world, with enough capacity to function as the traditional swing producer to balance the global market, it serves as \"OPEC's *de facto* leader\".[10]\n\n\n\n### International cartel[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Ross, Michael L.

Since the 1980s, OPEC has had a limited impact on world oil-supply and oil-price stability, as there is frequent cheating by members on their commitments to one another, and as member commitments reflect what they would do even in the absence of OPEC.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the early years of OPEC, the oil-producing countries had a 50/50 profit agreement with the oil companies.[35] OPEC bargained with the dominant oil companies (the Seven Sisters), but OPEC faced coordination problems among its members.[35] If one OPEC member demanded too much from the oil companies, then the oil companies could slow down production in that country and ramp up production elsewhere.[35] The 50/50 agreements were still in place until 1970 when Libya negotiated a 58/42 agreement with the oil company Occidental, which prompted other OPEC members to request better agreements with oil companies.[35] In 1971, an accord was signed between major oil companies and members of OPEC doing business in the Mediterranean Sea region, called the *Tripoli Agreement*. The agreement, signed on 2 April 1971, raised oil prices and increased producing countries' profit shares.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Cohen, Ariel. \"OPEC Is Dead, Long Live OPEC+\". *Forbes*.

Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2\u00a0million membership fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota,[85] although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to suspend membership in January 1995;[86] it rejoined in July 2016.[37] Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was not a part of OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.[87][88]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** \"Switzerland Reduces Her Foreign Population\". *The Telegraph*. 29 June 1965.\n34. **^** \"OPEC\u00a0: Thank you Austria \u2013 thank you Vienna!\". *www.opec.org*.
