It is the sequel to *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017) and *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret again following its public revelation at the end of *Far From Home*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA third MCU Spider-Man film was planned during the production of *Homecoming* in 2017. Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal—in which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019, but a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return, and filming took place from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City and Atlanta. *No Way Home* serves as a crossover between the MCU and the *Spider-Man* films directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, featuring several actors reprising their roles from those films, including previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield. The involvement of both actors was the subject of wide speculation and numerous leaks despite the efforts of Sony, Marvel, and the cast to conceal their involvement.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nActors reprising their roles from earlier *Spider-Man* films include Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx as Electro, Thomas Haden Church as Sandman, Rhys Ifans as Lizard, and J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.\n\nIn April 2021, Molina confirmed that he was appearing in the film, explaining that he had been told not to talk about his role in the film during production but he realized that his appearance had been widely rumored and reported on.[26] Later that month, J. B. Smoove revealed that he was returning as Julius Dell from *Far From Home*,[46] while Cox stated that he was not involved with the film.[115] In early May, Garfield denied that he had been asked to appear in the film, but later said \"never say never\",[116][117] while Angourie Rice was revealed to be returning as Betty Brant.[43] Later that month, Stone denied her involvement in the film.[118]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRhys Ifans reprises his role as Dr. Curt Connors / Lizard, an Oscorp scientist from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012) who transformed into a large reptilian monster while trying to regrow his missing arm. Thomas Haden Church reprises his role as Flint Marko / Sandman, a small-time thief from Raimi's *Spider-Man 3* who received an ability to transform into sand.[22] Both Ifans and Church returned to voice the characters, though footage at the end of the film when they revert to their human forms was archival footage from *The Amazing Spider-Man* and *Spider-Man 3*, respectively.[39] Watts served as a stand-in for Church on-set by providing motion-capture reference to the uncredited body double who physically replaced Church in the role.[40] Charlie Cox reprises his role as Matt Murdock from Marvel Television's Netflix series,[41] and Tom Hardy reprises his roles as Eddie Brock / Venom from Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) in an uncredited cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nA teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[5] The film explores the fallout of *Spider-Man: Far From Home*'s (2019) mid-credits scene, in which Parker's identity as Spider-Man is exposed,[6] and Parker is more pessimistic in contrast to previous Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. Holland said Parker feels defeated and insecure and was excited to explore the darker side of the character.[7] The adjustment back to portraying Parker, including raising his voice pitch and returning to the mindset of a \"naïve, charming teenager\", was strange for Holland after taking on more mature roles such as in *Cherry* (2021).[8]\n* Zendaya as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson:  \nParker's classmate and girlfriend.[9][10][11] The character's full name is revealed in the film, having previously just been known as Michelle Jones, bringing her closer to the comics counterpart Mary Jane Watson.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy December 2020, Alfred Molina was set to reprise his role as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man 2* (2004),[25] with Tobey Maguire reprising his role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Andrew Garfield returning as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* films.[31] A cameo appearance of Maguire and Garfield alongside Holland as their respective Spider-Men had previously been considered for the Sony Pictures Animation film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018), but was cut then because Sony felt at that moment that it would be too risky and confusing.[99] At that time, *Collider* reported that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film alongside Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy from the *Amazing Spider-Man* films.[100] The first draft of the script included other characters from the *Spider-Man* and *Amazing Spider-Man* films, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFans will be in heaven\".[236] Peter Debruge of *Variety* praised Garfield's and Maguire's performances and felt the film \"provides enough resolution for the past two decades of Spider-Man adventures that audiences who've tuned out along the way will be rewarded for giving this one a shot\".[33] Writing for *Den of Geek*, Don Kaye gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, for its action sequences, performances and chemistry of the cast, stating that \"*No Way Home* channels the entire spectrum of Spider-Man movies while setting the character on a course all his own at last\".[237] Jennifer Bisset of *CNET* praised the action sequences, performances, and story, writing: \"A Russo Brothers influence can almost be felt ushering Holland's third Spider-Man movie into new, weightier territory. If the character is to become the next Tony Stark, this is the way to etch a few more scars into a more interesting hero's facade. If you came for the biggest movie of the year, you'll definitely leave satisfied\".[238]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Lead actor Tom Holland and director Jon Watts in 2016\nDuring production on *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017), two sequels were being planned by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures.[53] In June 2017, star Tom Holland explained that each film would take place during a different year of high school for Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the third being set during the character's senior year.[54] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige noted in July 2019 that the third film would feature \"a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film\" due to the ending of the second film, *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), which publicly reveals that Parker is Spider-Man.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2021 Marvel Studios film\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Spider-Man: No Way Home |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Theatrical release poster\n |\n| Directed by | Jon Watts |\n| Based on | Spider-Manby * Stan Lee\n* Steve Ditko\n |\n| Produced by | * Kevin Feige\n* Amy Pascal\n |\n| Starring | * Tom Holland\n* Zendaya\n* Benedict Cumberbatch\n* Jacob Batalon\n* Jon Favreau\n* Jamie Foxx\n* Willem Dafoe\n* Alfred Molina\n* Benedict Wong\n* Tony Revolori\n* Marisa Tomei\n* Andrew Garfield\n* Tobey Maguire\n |\n| Cinematography | Mauro Fiore |\n| Edited by | * Jeffrey Ford\n* Leigh Folsom Boyd\n |\n| Music by | Michael Giacchino |\n| Productioncompanies\n | * Columbia Pictures\n* Marvel Studios\n* Pascal Pictures\n |\n| Distributed by | Sony Pictures Releasing |\n| Release dates\n | * December 13, 2021 (2021-12-13) (Fox Village Theatre)\n* December 17, 2021 (2021-12-17) (United States)\n |\n| Running time\n | 148 minutes[1] |\n| Country | United States |\n| Language | English |\n| Budget | $200 million[2] |\n| Box office | $1.922 billion[3][4] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Thorne, Will (September 5, 2019). \"Sony Pictures Chief on Spider-Man Split: 'For the Moment the Door is Closed'\". *Variety*.

It became the highest-grossing film of 2021, the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest grossing Spider-Man film, and set several other box office records, including those for films released during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 94th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades.

The site's critical consensus reads: \"A bigger, bolder *Spider-Man* sequel, *No Way Home* expands the franchise's scope and stakes without losing sight of its humor and heart.\"[233] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[234] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the first live-action Spider-Man film and the fourth MCU film overall to earn the score after *The Avengers* (2012), *Black Panther* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame*.[213] PostTrak reported 96% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 91% saying they would definitely recommend it.[213]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJeffrey Ford and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as the film's editors.[137] The visual effects were provided by Cinesite, Clear Angle Studios, Crafty Apes, Digital Domain, Folks VFX, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies, Mr. X, Perception, Secret Lab, Sony Pictures Imageworks, and SSVFX.[138]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (soundtrack)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVary of *Variety* noted that these reports were not confirmed and questioned whether the returning actors would be making more than cameo appearances.[104] Shortly after, Holland denied that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film.[86] Many of the actors returning from previous *Spider-Man* films were brought to set in cloaks in order to help prevent their involvements in the film from leaking.[105] Around Christmas 2020, McKenna and Sommers rewrote the introductions of Maguire and Garfield as well as much of the third act in time for those actors to start filming. They had not been able to focus on those scenes earlier because they were busy during filming of much of the first and second acts in the previous months.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n262. **^** Barnes, Brooks (December 17, 2021). \"Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal on the Future of 'Spider-Man' and the M.C.U.\" *The New York Times*.

The existing deal had Marvel and Feige produce the Spider-Man films for Sony and receive 5% of their revenue.

Holland said Parker feels defeated and insecure and was excited to explore the darker side of the character.[7] The adjustment back to portraying Parker, including raising his voice pitch and returning to the mindset of a \"naïve, charming teenager\", was strange for Holland after taking on more mature roles such as in *Cherry* (2021).[8]\n* Zendaya as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson:  \nParker's classmate and girlfriend.[9][10][11] The character's full name is revealed in the film, having previously just been known as Michelle Jones, bringing her closer to the comics counterpart Mary Jane Watson.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy December 2020, Alfred Molina was set to reprise his role as Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man 2* (2004),[25] with Tobey Maguire reprising his role as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Andrew Garfield returning as Peter Parker / Spider-Man from Webb's *The Amazing Spider-Man* films.[31] A cameo appearance of Maguire and Garfield alongside Holland as their respective Spider-Men had previously been considered for the Sony Pictures Animation film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* (2018), but was cut then because Sony felt at that moment that it would be too risky and confusing.[99] At that time, *Collider* reported that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film alongside Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson from Raimi's *Spider-Man* film trilogy and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy from the *Amazing Spider-Man* films.[100] The first draft of the script included other characters from the *Spider-Man* and *Amazing Spider-Man* films, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFans will be in heaven\".[236] Peter Debruge of *Variety* praised Garfield's and Maguire's performances and felt the film \"provides enough resolution for the past two decades of Spider-Man adventures that audiences who've tuned out along the way will be rewarded for giving this one a shot\".[33] Writing for *Den of Geek*, Don Kaye gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, for its action sequences, performances and chemistry of the cast, stating that \"*No Way Home* channels the entire spectrum of Spider-Man movies while setting the character on a course all his own at last\".[237] Jennifer Bisset of *CNET* praised the action sequences, performances, and story, writing: \"A Russo Brothers influence can almost be felt ushering Holland's third Spider-Man movie into new, weightier territory. If the character is to become the next Tony Stark, this is the way to etch a few more scars into a more interesting hero's facade. If you came for the biggest movie of the year, you'll definitely leave satisfied\".[238]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Lead actor Tom Holland and director Jon Watts in 2016\nDuring production on *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017), two sequels were being planned by Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures.[53] In June 2017, star Tom Holland explained that each film would take place during a different year of high school for Peter Parker / Spider-Man, with the third being set during the character's senior year.[54] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige noted in July 2019 that the third film would feature \"a Peter Parker story that has never been done before on film\" due to the ending of the second film, *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), which publicly reveals that Parker is Spider-Man.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2021 Marvel Studios film\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Spider-Man: No Way Home |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Theatrical release poster\n |\n| Directed by | Jon Watts |\n| Based on | Spider-Manby * Stan Lee\n* Steve Ditko\n |\n| Produced by | * Kevin Feige\n* Amy Pascal\n |\n| Starring | * Tom Holland\n* Zendaya\n* Benedict Cumberbatch\n* Jacob Batalon\n* Jon Favreau\n* Jamie Foxx\n* Willem Dafoe\n* Alfred Molina\n* Benedict Wong\n* Tony Revolori\n* Marisa Tomei\n* Andrew Garfield\n* Tobey Maguire\n |\n| Cinematography | Mauro Fiore |\n| Edited by | * Jeffrey Ford\n* Leigh Folsom Boyd\n |\n| Music by | Michael Giacchino |\n| Productioncompanies\n | * Columbia Pictures\n* Marvel Studios\n* Pascal Pictures\n |\n| Distributed by | Sony Pictures Releasing |\n| Release dates\n | * December 13, 2021 (2021-12-13) (Fox Village Theatre)\n* December 17, 2021 (2021-12-17) (United States)\n |\n| Running time\n | 148 minutes[1] |\n| Country | United States |\n| Language | English |\n| Budget | $200 million[2] |\n| Box office | $1.922 billion[3][4] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Thorne, Will (September 5, 2019). \"Sony Pictures Chief on Spider-Man Split: 'For the Moment the Door is Closed'\". *Variety*.

The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $1.9 billion worldwide, surpassing its predecessor as the highest-grossing film released by Sony Pictures. It became the highest-grossing film of 2021, the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time, the highest grossing Spider-Man film, and set several other box office records, including those for films released during the COVID-19 pandemic. The film received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 94th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. An extended version of the film, subtitled *The More Fun Stuff Version*, had a global theatrical release in September 2022. A sequel is in development.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 93%, with an average score of 7.9/10, based on 430 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: \"A bigger, bolder *Spider-Man* sequel, *No Way Home* expands the franchise's scope and stakes without losing sight of its humor and heart.\"[233] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 71 out of 100, based on 60 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[234] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the first live-action Spider-Man film and the fourth MCU film overall to earn the score after *The Avengers* (2012), *Black Panther* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame*.[213] PostTrak reported 96% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 91% saying they would definitely recommend it.[213]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJeffrey Ford and Leigh Folsom Boyd served as the film's editors.[137] The visual effects were provided by Cinesite, Clear Angle Studios, Crafty Apes, Digital Domain, Folks VFX, Framestore, Luma Pictures, Monsters Aliens Robots Zombies, Mr. X, Perception, Secret Lab, Sony Pictures Imageworks, and SSVFX.[138]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (soundtrack)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVary of *Variety* noted that these reports were not confirmed and questioned whether the returning actors would be making more than cameo appearances.[104] Shortly after, Holland denied that Maguire and Garfield would appear in the film.[86] Many of the actors returning from previous *Spider-Man* films were brought to set in cloaks in order to help prevent their involvements in the film from leaking.[105] Around Christmas 2020, McKenna and Sommers rewrote the introductions of Maguire and Garfield as well as much of the third act in time for those actors to start filming. They had not been able to focus on those scenes earlier because they were busy during filming of much of the first and second acts in the previous months.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n262. **^** Barnes, Brooks (December 17, 2021). \"Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal on the Future of 'Spider-Man' and the M.C.U.\" *The New York Times*.

The existing deal had Marvel and Feige produce the Spider-Man films for Sony and receive 5% of their revenue. Sony wanted to expand the deal to include more films while keeping the same terms of the original agreement. Disney expressed concern with Feige's workload producing the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) franchise already and asked for a 25–50% stake in any future films Feige produced for Sony.[56][59][58] Unable to come to an agreement, Sony announced that it would be moving forward on the next Spider-Man film without Feige or Marvel's involvement. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01YJ5ytQuShUobQdXQmWAoXD","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
