Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh. The official websites of the Holy See[119] and of Vatican City[120] are primarily in Italian, with versions of their pages in a large number of languages to varying extents.\n\n\n\n### Citizenship[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Constituent countries | * ***London***,\u00a0England\n* ***Edinburgh***,\u00a0Scotland\n* ***Cardiff***,\u00a0Wales\n* ***Belfast***,\u00a0Northern Ireland\n |\n| Crown Dependencies andOverseas Territories | * ***Douglas***,\u00a0Isle of Man\n* ***Episkopi Cantonment***,\u00a0Akrotiri and Dhekelia\n* ***Gibraltar***,\u00a0Gibraltar\n* ***St Helier***,\u00a0Jersey\n* ***Saint Peter Port***,\u00a0Guernsey\n |\n\n |\n| Other | * ***Longyearbyen**,\u00a0Svalbard\u00a0(Norway)*\n* ***T\u00f3rshavn**,\u00a0Faroe Islands\u00a0(Denmark)*\n |\n\n |\n| Federal states | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Austria | * ***Bregenz***,\u00a0Vorarlberg\n* ***Eisenstadt***,\u00a0Burgenland\n* ***Graz***,\u00a0Styria\n* ***Innsbruck***,\u00a0Tyrol\n* ***Klagenfurt***,\u00a0Carinthia\n* ***Linz***,\u00a0Upper Austria\n* ***Salzburg***,\u00a0Salzburg\n* ***Sankt P\u00f6lten***,\u00a0Lower Austria\n* ***Vienna***,\u00a0Vienna\n |\n| Belgium | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Sarajevo**,\u00a0Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* **Skopje**,\u00a0North Macedonia\n* **Sofia**,\u00a0Bulgaria\n* **Stockholm**,\u00a0Sweden\n* **Tallinn**,\u00a0Estonia\n* **Tbilisi**,\u00a0Georgia3\n* **Tirana**,\u00a0Albania\n* **Vaduz**,\u00a0Liechtenstein\n* **Valletta**,\u00a0Malta\n* **Vatican City**5\n* **Vienna**,\u00a0Austria\n* **Vilnius**,\u00a0Lithuania\n* **Warsaw**,\u00a0Poland\n* **Yerevan**,\u00a0Armenia3\n* **Zagreb**,\u00a0Croatia\n |\n| States withlimited recognition | * ***North Nicosia**,\u00a0Northern Cyprus*3\n* ***Pristina**,\u00a0Kosovo*\n* ***Stepanakert**,\u00a0Republic of Artsakh*3\n* ***Sukhumi**,\u00a0Abkhazia*3\n* ***Tiraspol**,\u00a0Transnistria*\n* ***Tskhinvali**,\u00a0South Ossetia*3\n |\n| Dependencies | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| United Kingdom | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish.

His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City as well as the country's head of government is the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the Governor of Vatican City. Since 2001, the president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of president of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City. The president is Spanish Cardinal Fernando V\u00e9rgez Alzaga, who was appointed on 1 October 2021.\n\n\n\n### Administration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Vatican City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Pope Francis in Vatican City, 2021\nThe government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The Pope is the sovereign of the state, while legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the president of that commission, assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the Pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches over Vatican City,[73]\nand is thus the only absolute monarch in Europe.[74]\n\n\nOperationally, there are departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications and other matters.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Sede vacante[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| * 1\u00a0Also the capital of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\n* 2\u00a0Also the seat of the European Union, see Institutional seats of the European Union and Brussels and the European Union\n* 3\u00a0Continental placement may vary depending on geographic convention being followed\n* 5\u00a0A city-state\n |\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Norway\n* Spain\n* France\n\t+ 2\n* BnF data\n\t+ 2\n* Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Sweden\n* Japan\n* Czech Republic\n* Vatican\n |\n| Geographic | * MusicBrainz area\n |\n| People | * UK Parliament\n |\n| Other | * Encyclopedia of Modern Ukraine\n* NARA\n* IdRef\n* \u0130sl\u00e2m Ansiklopedisi\n |\n\n41\u00b054\u203209\u2033N 12\u00b027\u203209\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff41.90250\u00b0N 12.45250\u00b0E\ufeff / 41.90250; 12.45250\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Vatican City** (/\u02c8v\u00e6t\u026ak\u0259n/ \u24d8), officially **Vatican City State** (Italian: *Stato della Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano*;[f] Latin: *Status Civitatis Vaticanae*),[g][h] is a landlocked independent country,[16][17] city-state, microstate, and enclave within Rome, Italy.[18][19] It became independent from Italy in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty, and it is a distinct territory under \"full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction\" of the Holy See, itself a sovereign entity under international law, which maintains the city-state's temporal power and governance, diplomatic, and spiritual independence.[i][20] With an area of 49 hectares (121 acres)[c] and as of 2023 a population of about 764,[13] it is the smallest state in the world both by area and by population.[21] As governed by the Holy See, Vatican City State is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ruled by the Pope, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** Visitors and tourists are not permitted to drive inside Vatican City without specific permission, which is normally granted only to those on official business in Vatican City.\n5. **^** ITU-T assigned code 379 to Vatican City.

The repatriation was motivated by significant layoffs in phosphate mining.[116]\n\n\nNauru is one of the most densely populated Westernized countries in the South Pacific.[136]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFifty-eight per cent of people in Nauru are ethnically Nauruan, 26 per cent are other Pacific Islander, 8 per cent are European, and 8 per cent are Han Chinese.[3]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauruan language\n\nThe official languages of Nauru are Nauruan and English. Nauruan[1] is a distinct Micronesian language, which is spoken by 96 per cent of ethnic Nauruans at home.[116] English is widely spoken and is the language of government and commerce.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and territories of Oceania\n |\n| --- |\n| * List of Oceanian countries by area\n* List of Oceanian countries by population\n |\n| Sovereign states | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Entire | * Australia\n* Fiji\n* Kiribati\n* Marshall Islands\n* Micronesia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Palau\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Samoa\n* Solomon Islands\n* Tonga\n* Tuvalu\n* Vanuatu\n |\n| In part | * Chile\n\t+ Easter Island\n\t+ Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands\n* Ecuador\n\t+ Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\n* Indonesia\n\t+ Central Papua\n\t+ Highland Papua\n\t+ Papua\n\t+ South Papua\n\t+ Southwest Papua\n\t+ West Papua\n* Japan\n\t+ Dait\u014d Islands\n\t+ Nanp\u014d Islands\n* United States\n\t+ Hawaii\n\t+ Palmyra Atoll\n |\n\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Associated states\n | * Cook Islands\n* Niue\n |\n| Dependencies andother territories\n | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Nauru does not have an official capital but Yaren is the seat of parliament.[1]\n2. **^** English is widely spoken by the majority of the population and it is commonly used in government, legislation and commerce alongside Nauruan.

Its nearest neighbour is Banaba of Kiribati, about 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) to the east.[13] It lies northwest of Tuvalu, 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) northeast of Solomon Islands,[14] east-northeast of Papua New Guinea, southeast of the Federated States of Micronesia and south of the Marshall Islands. With an area of only 21\u00a0km2 (8.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Nauru is the third-smallest country in the world behind Vatican City and Monaco, making it the smallest republic and island nation. Its population of about 10,800 is the world's second-smallest (not including colonies or overseas territories) after Vatican City.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNauru is a republic with a parliamentary system of government.[65] The president is both head of state and head of government and is dependent on parliamentary confidence to remain president. All 19 parliament seats are elected every three years.[79] The parliament elects the president from its members, and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members.[80] As a result of a referendum in 2021, naturalised citizens and their descendants are barred from becoming parliamentarians.\n\n\nNauru does not have any formal structure for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19\u00a0members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed based on extended family ties rather than party affiliation.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Nauru and Elections in Nauru\n\nFurther information: Law of Nauru, List of political parties in Nauru, and Crime in Nauru\n\n![](image)Parliament of Nauru\nThe president of Nauru is David Adeang, who heads a 19-member unicameral parliament. The country is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Asian Development Bank. Nauru also participates in the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. Recently Nauru became a member country of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The Republic of Nauru became the 189th member of the International Monetary Fund in April 2016.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n78. **^** \"Nauru Ecotourism Tours \u2013 Sustainable Tourism & Conservation Laws\".

French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Mon\u00e9gasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Mon\u00e9gasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is also used.\n\n\nItalian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.[159] This was due to the annexation of the surrounding County of Nice to France following the Treaty of Turin (1860).[159]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Communities | * ***Brussels***,\u00a0Flemish Community and French Community\n* ***Eupen***,\u00a0German-speaking Community\n |\n| Regions | * ***Brussels***,\u00a0Brussels-Capital Region and Flanders\n* ***Namur***,\u00a0Wallonia\n |\n\n |\n| Bosnia and Herzegovina | * ***Banja Luka*** (de facto),\u00a0Republika Srpska\n* ***Br\u010dko***,\u00a0Br\u010dko District\n* ***Sarajevo***,\u00a0Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n |\n| Germany | * ***Berlin***,\u00a0Berlin\n* ***Bremen***,\u00a0Bremen\n* ***Dresden***,\u00a0Saxony\n* ***D\u00fcsseldorf***,\u00a0North Rhine-Westphalia\n* ***Erfurt***,\u00a0Thuringia\n* ***Hamburg***,\u00a0Hamburg\n* ***Hanover***,\u00a0Lower Saxony\n* ***Kiel***,\u00a0Schleswig-Holstein\n* ***Magdeburg***,\u00a0Saxony-Anhalt\n* ***Mainz***,\u00a0Rhineland-Palatinate\n* ***Munich***,\u00a0Bavaria\n* ***Potsdam***,\u00a0Brandenburg\n* ***Saarbr\u00fccken***,\u00a0Saarland\n* ***Schwerin***,\u00a0Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\n* ***Stuttgart***,\u00a0Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\n* ***Wiesbaden***,\u00a0Hesse\n |\n| Russia | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| * 1\u00a0Also the capital of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\n* 2\u00a0Also the seat of the European Union, see Institutional seats of the European Union and Brussels and the European Union\n* 3\u00a0Continental placement may vary depending on geographic convention being followed\n* 5\u00a0A city-state\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and territories of the Mediterranean Sea\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Albania\n* Algeria\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Egypt\n* France\n* Greece\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Lebanon\n* Libya\n* Malta\n* Monaco\n* Montenegro\n* Morocco\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Syria\n* Tunisia\n* Turkey\n |\n| States with limited recognition | * Northern Cyprus\n* Palestine\n |\n| Dependencies and other territories | * Akrotiri and Dhekelia (UK)\n* Gibraltar (UK)\n |\n| Marginal seas | * Adriatic Sea\n* Aegean Sea\n* Alboran Sea\n* Balearic Sea\n* Ionian Sea\n* Levantine Sea\n* Libyan Sea\n* Ligurian Sea\n* Sea of Crete\n* Sea of Marmara\n* Sea of Sardinia\n* Thracian Sea\n* Tyrrhenian Sea\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate of Europe\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* \n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n* Vatican City\n |\n| States with limitedrecognition | * Abkhazia\n* Kosovo\n* Northern Cyprus\n* South Ossetia\n* Transnistria\n |\n| Dependencies andother entities | * \u00c5land\n* Faroe Islands\n* Gibraltar\n* Guernsey\n* Isle of Man\n* Jersey\n* Svalbard\n |\n| Other entities | * European Union\n |\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Monaco\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Albert II, Prince of Monaco\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state.[63] The executive branch consists of a Prime Minister as the head of government, who presides over the other five members of the Council of Government.[64] Until 2002, the Prime Minister was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the Government of France; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Prime Minister can be French or Mon\u00e9gasque.[29] On 1 September 2020, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Pierre Dartout, to the office.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFirst-level administrative divisions in European countries\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia2\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan1\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus2\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Georgia1\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan1\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia1\n* San Marino\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey1\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n |\n| States with limitedrecognition\n | * Abkhazia2\n* Kosovo\n* Northern Cyprus2\n* South Ossetia2\n* Transnistria\n |\n| Table of administrative divisions by country* 1 Spans the conventional boundary between Europe and another continent.\n* 2 Considered European for cultural, political and historical reasons but is geographically in Western Asia.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThrough ongoing land reclamation, started in 1861 and accelerating in the 1960s, Monaco's small land mass has expanded by 20 per cent.\n\n\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state, who wields immense political power despite his constitutional status. The prime minister, who is the head of government, can be either a Mon\u00e9gasque or a French citizen; the monarch consults with the Government of France before an appointment. Key members of the judiciary in Monaco are detached French magistrates.[17] The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297.[18] The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France, besides maintenance of two small military units.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** French: *Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco*; Mon\u00e9gasque: *Prin\u00e7ipatu de M\u00f9negu*; Ligurian: *Prin\u00e7ipato de M\u00f3nego*; Occitan: *Principat de M\u00f3negue*; Italian: *Principato di Monaco*.\n2. **^** For further information, see languages of Monaco.\n3. **^** Monetary agreement with the EU to issue euros\n4. **^** Although not a contracting party to the Schengen Agreement, has an open border with France and Schengen laws are administered as if it were a part of France.[224][225]\n5. **^** Through an agreement with France[226]\n6. **^** Through an agreement with France.
