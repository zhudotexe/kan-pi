The family takes its name from the genus *Amaryllis* and is commonly known as the amaryllis family. The leaves are usually linear, and the flowers are usually bisexual and symmetrical, arranged in umbels on the stem. The petals and sepals are undifferentiated as tepals, which may be fused at the base into a floral tube. Some also display a corona. Allyl sulfide compounds produce the characteristic odour of the onion subfamily (Allioideae).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe number of known genera within these families continued to grow, and by the time of the Bentham and Hooker classification (1883), the Amaryllidaceae (Amaryllideae) were divided into four tribes, of which only one (Amarylleae) is still included.[37] The Liliaceae[38] were becoming one of the largest families, and Bentham and Hooker divided it into 20 tribes, of which one was the Allieae,[39] which as Allioideae would eventually become part of Amaryllidaceae as two of its three subfamilies. The Allieae included both Agapantheae,[40] the third of the current subfamilies, and Lindley's Gilliesieae[41] as two of its four subtribes.[42] Bentham and Hooker's scheme was the last major classification using the natural approach.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Post-Darwinian[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe family Amaryllidaceae was formally named as 'Amaryllidées' (Amaryllideae) in 1805, by Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire.[19] In 1810 Brown proposed that a subgroup of Liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of their ovaries (inferior) and be referred to as Amaryllideae[20] and in 1813 de Candolle described Liliacées Juss. and Amaryllidées Brown as two quite separate families.[21] The literature on the organisation of genera into families and higher ranks became available in the English language with Samuel Frederick Gray's *A natural arrangement of British plants* (1821).[22] Gray used a combination of Linnaeus' sexual classification and Jussieu's natural classification to group together a number of families having in common six equal stamens, a single style and a perianth that was simple and petaloid, but did not use formal names for these higher ranks. Within the grouping, he separated families by the characteristics of their fruit and seed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nComplete resolution of infrafamilial (suprageneric) relationships within subfamily Amaryllidoideae (Amaryllidaceae *s.s.*) has proven more difficult.[63] Fay and Chase's study lacked sufficient resolution for further elucidation of this group. Historically a wide variety of infrafamilial classification systems have been proposed for the Amaryllidaceae. In the latter twentieth century there were at least six schemes, including Hutchinson (1926),[31] Traub (1963),[68] Dahlgren (1985),[69] Müller-Doblies and Müller-Doblies (1996),[70] Hickey and King (1997)[71] and Meerow and Snijman (1998).[72] Hutchinson was an early proponent of the larger Amaryllidaceae, transferring taxa from Liliaceae and had three tribes, Agapantheae, Allieae and Gilliesieae. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe family, which was originally created in 1805, now contains about 1600 species, divided into about 70–75 genera,[3][4] 17 tribes and three subfamilies, the Agapanthoideae (*Agapanthus*), Allioideae (onions and chives) and Amaryllidoideae (amaryllis, daffodils, snowdrops). Over time, it has seen much reorganisation and at various times was combined with the related Liliaceae. Since 2009, a very broad view has prevailed based on phylogenetics, and including a number of other former families.\n\n\nThe family is found in tropical to subtropical areas of the world and includes many ornamental garden plants and vegetables.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Floral diversity in Amaryllidaceae.

The perianth (perigonium) consists of six undifferentiated tepals arranged in two whorls of three. The tepals are similar in shape and size, and may be free from each other or fused at the base (connate) to form a floral tube (hypanthium). In some genera, such as Narcissus, this may be surmounted by cup or trumpet-shaped projection, the corona (paraperigonium or false corolla). This may be reduced to a mere disc in some species.\n\n\nThe position of the ovary varies by subfamily. The subfamilies Agapanthoideae and Allioideae have superior ovaries, while the Amaryllidoideae have inferior ovaries. The six stamens are arranged in two whorls of three, occasionally more as in *Gethyllis* (Amaryllidoideae, 9–18).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe treated groups of genera with these characteristics as separate families, such as Amaryllideae, Liliaceae, Asphodeleae, and Asparageae.[23]\n\n\nJohn Lindley (1830, 1846) was the other important British taxonomist of the early 19th century. In his first taxonomic work, *An Introduction to the Natural System of Botany* (1830),[24] he partly followed De Jussieu by describing a subclass he called 'Endogenae, or Monocotyledonous Plants' (preserving de Candolle's *Endogenæ phanerogamæ*)[25] divided into two tribes, the Petaloidea and Glumaceae. He divided the former, often referred to as petaloid monocots, into 32 orders, including the Amaryllideae.[26] He defined the latter as \"Hexapetaloideous bulbous hexandrous monocotyledons, with an inferior ovarium, a six-parted perianthium with equitant sepals, and flat, spongy seeds\" and included *Amaryllis*, *Phycella*, *Nerine*, *Vallota*, and *Calostemma*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cladogram I: Amaryllidaceae*sensu* *s.l.*/APG\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* | |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Subfamily Agapanthoideae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Subfamily Allioideae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Subfamily Amaryllidoideae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe fruit is dry and capsule-shaped, or fleshy and berry-like.\n\n\nThe Allioideae produce allyl sulfide compounds which give them their characteristic smell.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nType species of Amaryllidaceae subfamilies\n![](image)\n*Agapanthus africanus* (Agapanthoideae)\n![](image)\n*Allium sativum* (Allioideae)\n![](image)\n*Amaryllis belladonna* (Amaryllidoideae)\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n#### Pre-Darwinian[edit]\n\n\nLinnaeus described the type genus *Amaryllis*, from which the family derives its name, in his *Species Plantarum* in 1753,[8] with nine species, in the *Hexandria monogynia* (i.e. six stamens and one pistil)[9] containing 51 genera in total[10] in his sexual classification scheme.

He doubted Brown's dictum that the position of the ovary was the distinguishing feature that separated Amaryllidaceae and Liliaceae. He treated Amaryllidaceae as bulbous plants with umbellate inflorescences, the latter characteristic being the defining feature: \"an umbellate inflorescence subtended by an involucre of one or more spathaceous bracts\".[31] His work on this has been upheld by subsequent research and his definition remains valid today.[55] Using this criterion, he removed a number of taxa (Agavaceae, Hypoxidaceae, Alstroemeriaceae) and transferred the Agapantheae, Allieae, and Gilliesieae from Liliaceae to Amaryllidaceae.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Byng, James W.

Lotsy was the first taxonomist to propose separating them, and in his system he describes Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae, and Gilliesiaceae as new and separate families from Liliaceae.[52] This approach was adopted by a number of other authorities, such as Dahlgren (1985)[53] and Rahn (1998).[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith de Jussieu came the formal establishment of organising genera into families (*ordo*) in 1789.[14] De Jussieu established the hierarchical system of taxonomy (phylogeny), placing *Amaryllis* and 15 related genera within a division of monocotyledons, a class (III) of *Stamina Perigynia*[15] and 'order' Narcisse, divided into three subfamilies.[16] This system also formally described the Liliaceae, which were a separate order within the *Stamina perigynia* (Lilia). The use of the term *Ordo* (order) at that time was closer to what we now understand as family, rather than order.[17][18] In creating his scheme, De Jussieu used a modified form of Linnaeus' sexual classification, but with the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn its second iteration (2003), the APG proposed simplifying the higher (core) Asparagales by reducing them to two more broadly circumscribed families, and provisionally proposed the name Alliaceae *sensu lato* (*s.l.*) to include the three sister families (Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae *sensu stricto*, *s.s.*, and Amaryllidaceae), since together they form a monophyletic group. In this respect, they were following Hutchinson's system (see above). Under this proposal, the three families became reduced to subfamilies (and by extension the subfamilies of Alliaceae *s.s.* being reduced to tribes.) At the same time, they appreciated an argument existed for making Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* the formal name of the new and larger family,[61][62] a position subsequently strongly supported by Meerow and colleagues.[63][64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince then, seven of Linnaeus' *Hexandria monogynia* genera have consistently been placed in a common taxonomic unit of amaryllids, based on the inferior position of the ovaries (whether this be as an order, suborder, family, subfamily, tribe or section).[30] Thus, much of what we now consider Amaryllidaceae remained in Liliaceae because the ovary was superior, till 1926 when John Hutchinson transferred them to Amaryllidaceae.[31] This usage of the family entered the English language literature through the work of Samuel Frederick Gray (1821),[32] William Herbert (1837)[33] and John Lindley (1830,[34] 1846[35]). Meanwhile, Lindley had described two Chilean genera which for which he created a new family, Gilliesieae.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01A9eGNqzLXYeP5uvAkzdjYy","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Allyl sulfide compounds produce the characteristic odour of the onion subfamily (Allioideae).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe number of known genera within these families continued to grow, and by the time of the Bentham and Hooker classification (1883), the Amaryllidaceae (Amaryllideae) were divided into four tribes, of which only one (Amarylleae) is still included.[37] The Liliaceae[38] were becoming one of the largest families, and Bentham and Hooker divided it into 20 tribes, of which one was the Allieae,[39] which as Allioideae would eventually become part of Amaryllidaceae as two of its three subfamilies. The Allieae included both Agapantheae,[40] the third of the current subfamilies, and Lindley's Gilliesieae[41] as two of its four subtribes.[42] Bentham and Hooker's scheme was the last major classification using the natural approach.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Post-Darwinian[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe family Amaryllidaceae was formally named as 'Amaryllidées' (Amaryllideae) in 1805, by Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire.[19] In 1810 Brown proposed that a subgroup of Liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of their ovaries (inferior) and be referred to as Amaryllideae[20] and in 1813 de Candolle described Liliacées Juss. and Amaryllidées Brown as two quite separate families.[21] The literature on the organisation of genera into families and higher ranks became available in the English language with Samuel Frederick Gray's *A natural arrangement of British plants* (1821).[22] Gray used a combination of Linnaeus' sexual classification and Jussieu's natural classification to group together a number of families having in common six equal stamens, a single style and a perianth that was simple and petaloid, but did not use formal names for these higher ranks. Within the grouping, he separated families by the characteristics of their fruit and seed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nComplete resolution of infrafamilial (suprageneric) relationships within subfamily Amaryllidoideae (Amaryllidaceae *s.s.*) has proven more difficult.[63] Fay and Chase's study lacked sufficient resolution for further elucidation of this group. Historically a wide variety of infrafamilial classification systems have been proposed for the Amaryllidaceae. In the latter twentieth century there were at least six schemes, including Hutchinson (1926),[31] Traub (1963),[68] Dahlgren (1985),[69] Müller-Doblies and Müller-Doblies (1996),[70] Hickey and King (1997)[71] and Meerow and Snijman (1998).[72] Hutchinson was an early proponent of the larger Amaryllidaceae, transferring taxa from Liliaceae and had three tribes, Agapantheae, Allieae and Gilliesieae. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe family, which was originally created in 1805, now contains about 1600 species, divided into about 70–75 genera,[3][4] 17 tribes and three subfamilies, the Agapanthoideae (*Agapanthus*), Allioideae (onions and chives) and Amaryllidoideae (amaryllis, daffodils, snowdrops). Over time, it has seen much reorganisation and at various times was combined with the related Liliaceae. Since 2009, a very broad view has prevailed based on phylogenetics, and including a number of other former families.\n\n\nThe family is found in tropical to subtropical areas of the world and includes many ornamental garden plants and vegetables.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Floral diversity in Amaryllidaceae.

The perianth (perigonium) consists of six undifferentiated tepals arranged in two whorls of three. The tepals are similar in shape and size, and may be free from each other or fused at the base (connate) to form a floral tube (hypanthium). In some genera, such as Narcissus, this may be surmounted by cup or trumpet-shaped projection, the corona (paraperigonium or false corolla). This may be reduced to a mere disc in some species.\n\n\nThe position of the ovary varies by subfamily. The subfamilies Agapanthoideae and Allioideae have superior ovaries, while the Amaryllidoideae have inferior ovaries. The six stamens are arranged in two whorls of three, occasionally more as in *Gethyllis* (Amaryllidoideae, 9–18).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe treated groups of genera with these characteristics as separate families, such as Amaryllideae, Liliaceae, Asphodeleae, and Asparageae.[23]\n\n\nJohn Lindley (1830, 1846) was the other important British taxonomist of the early 19th century. In his first taxonomic work, *An Introduction to the Natural System of Botany* (1830),[24] he partly followed De Jussieu by describing a subclass he called 'Endogenae, or Monocotyledonous Plants' (preserving de Candolle's *Endogenæ phanerogamæ*)[25] divided into two tribes, the Petaloidea and Glumaceae. He divided the former, often referred to as petaloid monocots, into 32 orders, including the Amaryllideae.[26] He defined the latter as \"Hexapetaloideous bulbous hexandrous monocotyledons, with an inferior ovarium, a six-parted perianthium with equitant sepals, and flat, spongy seeds\" and included *Amaryllis*, *Phycella*, *Nerine*, *Vallota*, and *Calostemma*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cladogram I: Amaryllidaceae*sensu* *s.l.*/APG\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* | |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Subfamily Agapanthoideae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n|  | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Subfamily Allioideae\n |\n|  |\n|  | Subfamily Amaryllidoideae\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe fruit is dry and capsule-shaped, or fleshy and berry-like.\n\n\nThe Allioideae produce allyl sulfide compounds which give them their characteristic smell.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy[edit]\n\n\nType species of Amaryllidaceae subfamilies\n![](image)\n*Agapanthus africanus* (Agapanthoideae)\n![](image)\n*Allium sativum* (Allioideae)\n![](image)\n*Amaryllis belladonna* (Amaryllidoideae)\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n#### Pre-Darwinian[edit]\n\n\nLinnaeus described the type genus *Amaryllis*, from which the family derives its name, in his *Species Plantarum* in 1753,[8] with nine species, in the *Hexandria monogynia* (i.e. six stamens and one pistil)[9] containing 51 genera in total[10] in his sexual classification scheme.

He doubted Brown's dictum that the position of the ovary was the distinguishing feature that separated Amaryllidaceae and Liliaceae. He treated Amaryllidaceae as bulbous plants with umbellate inflorescences, the latter characteristic being the defining feature: \"an umbellate inflorescence subtended by an involucre of one or more spathaceous bracts\".[31] His work on this has been upheld by subsequent research and his definition remains valid today.[55] Using this criterion, he removed a number of taxa (Agavaceae, Hypoxidaceae, Alstroemeriaceae) and transferred the Agapantheae, Allieae, and Gilliesieae from Liliaceae to Amaryllidaceae.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Byng, James W.

Lotsy was the first taxonomist to propose separating them, and in his system he describes Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae, and Gilliesiaceae as new and separate families from Liliaceae.[52] This approach was adopted by a number of other authorities, such as Dahlgren (1985)[53] and Rahn (1998).[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith de Jussieu came the formal establishment of organising genera into families (*ordo*) in 1789.[14] De Jussieu established the hierarchical system of taxonomy (phylogeny), placing *Amaryllis* and 15 related genera within a division of monocotyledons, a class (III) of *Stamina Perigynia*[15] and 'order' Narcisse, divided into three subfamilies.[16] This system also formally described the Liliaceae, which were a separate order within the *Stamina perigynia* (Lilia). The use of the term *Ordo* (order) at that time was closer to what we now understand as family, rather than order.[17][18] In creating his scheme, De Jussieu used a modified form of Linnaeus' sexual classification, but with the respective topography of stamens to carpels rather than just their numbers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn its second iteration (2003), the APG proposed simplifying the higher (core) Asparagales by reducing them to two more broadly circumscribed families, and provisionally proposed the name Alliaceae *sensu lato* (*s.l.*) to include the three sister families (Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae *sensu stricto*, *s.s.*, and Amaryllidaceae), since together they form a monophyletic group. In this respect, they were following Hutchinson's system (see above). Under this proposal, the three families became reduced to subfamilies (and by extension the subfamilies of Alliaceae *s.s.* being reduced to tribes.) At the same time, they appreciated an argument existed for making Amaryllidaceae *s.l.* the formal name of the new and larger family,[61][62] a position subsequently strongly supported by Meerow and colleagues.[63][64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince then, seven of Linnaeus' *Hexandria monogynia* genera have consistently been placed in a common taxonomic unit of amaryllids, based on the inferior position of the ovaries (whether this be as an order, suborder, family, subfamily, tribe or section).[30] Thus, much of what we now consider Amaryllidaceae remained in Liliaceae because the ovary was superior, till 1926 when John Hutchinson transferred them to Amaryllidaceae.[31] This usage of the family entered the English language literature through the work of Samuel Frederick Gray (1821),[32] William Herbert (1837)[33] and John Lindley (1830,[34] 1846[35]). Meanwhile, Lindley had described two Chilean genera which for which he created a new family, Gilliesieae.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01A9eGNqzLXYeP5uvAkzdjYy","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
