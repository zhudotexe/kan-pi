Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nSee also: UEFA European Championship records and statistics \u00a7\u00a0Comprehensive team results by tournament\n\n![](image)Map of winners\n\n\n| Team\n | Winners\n | Runners-up\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Germany1 | 3 (1972, 1980, 1996)\n | 3 (1976, 1992, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 3 (1964\\*, 2008, 2012)\n | 1 (1984)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Italy | 2 (1968\\*, 2020\\*)\n | 2 (2000, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0France | 2 (1984\\*, 2000)\n | 1 (2016\\*)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Russia2 | 1 (1960)\n | 3 (1964, 1972, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic3 | 1 (1976)\n | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 1 (2016)\n | 1 (2004\\*)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 1 (1988)\n | \u2014\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | 1 (1992)\n | \u2014\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Greece | 1 (2004)\n | \u2014\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Serbia4 | \u2014\n | 2 (1960, 1968)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | \u2014\n | 1 (1980)\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0England | \u2014\n | 1 (2020\\*)\n |\n\n\n\\* *hosts*\n\n1 *named West Germany until 1990*\n\n2 *includes results representing the Soviet Union and CIS*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Map of countries' best results. 10 countries have won, counting Germany and West Germany as one\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the 2012 tournament. They were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries at the UEFA European Championship\n |\n| --- |\n| * Team appearances\n |\n| * Albania\n* Austria\n* Belgium\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Czech Republic1\n\t+ Czechoslovakia\n* Denmark\n* England\n* Finland\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany1\n\t+ West Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Italy\n* Latvia\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Northern Ireland\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Republic of Ireland\n* Romania\n* Russia1\n\t+ USSR\n\t+ CIS\n* Scotland\n* Serbia1\n\t+ Yugoslavia\n\t+ FR Yugoslavia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Wales\n |\n| 1 Considered a successor team by FIFA, or have competed under another name(s).\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUEFA Euro 1992 was held in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who were only in the finals after UN sanctions prevented Yugoslavia's participation as some of the states constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other.[36][37] The Danes beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals,[38] then defeated world champion Germany 2\u20130.[39] This was the first tournament in which a unified Germany took part and also the first major tournament to have the players' names printed on their backs.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 16 teams[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2007, the Football Association of Ireland and Scottish Football Association proposed the expansion of the tournament, which was later confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee in September 2008.[57][58] Out of the 54 member associations of UEFA, only three, including England and Germany, opposed the expansion.[59] On 28 May 2010, UEFA announced that UEFA Euro 2016 would be hosted by France. France beat bids of Turkey (7\u20136 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round.[60] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals.[61] This was the third time France have hosted the competition. Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1\u20130 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal's world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| * UEFA men's club competitions\n\t+ Records and statistics\n\t+ Winning teams\n\t+ Winning managers\n\t+ UEFA coefficient\n* FENIX Trophy\n* Policies\n\t+ Bosman ruling\n\t+ Coaching licences\n\t+ Financial Fair Play Regulations\n\t+ Homegrown Player Rule\n\t+ Respect campaign\n\t+ Stadium categories\n* Issues\n\t+ Proposals for a European Super League\n\t+ UEFA\u2013CONMEBOL memorandum of understanding\n\t+ 2009 European football match-fixing scandal\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship winners\n |\n| --- |\n| * **1960:** ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union\n* **1964:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **1968:** ![](image)\u00a0Italy\n* **1972:** ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\n* **1976:** ![](image)\u00a0Czechoslovakia\n* **1980:** ![](image)\u00a0West Germany\n* **1984:** ![](image)\u00a0France\n* **1988:** ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands\n* **1992:** ![](image)\u00a0Denmark\n* **1996:** ![](image)\u00a0Germany\n* **2000:** ![](image)\u00a0France\n* **2004:** ![](image)\u00a0Greece\n* **2008:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **2012:** ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n* **2016:** ![](image)\u00a0Portugal\n* **2020:** ![](image)\u00a0Italy\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 2008 | ![](image)\u00a0Austria![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland |\n| 14\n | 2012 | ![](image)\u00a0Poland![](image)\u00a0Ukraine |\n| 15\n | 2016 | ![](image)\u00a0France | 24\n | 51\n | 6 groups of 4 teams: 36 matches\n | knockout of 16 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up, plus four best third-placed teams): 15 matches\n |\n| 16\n | 2020[s 1] | ![](image)\u00a0Europe[s 2] |\n| *17* | *2024* | *![](image)\u00a0Germany* |\n| *18* | *2028* | *![](image)\u00a0England![](image)\u00a0Northern Ireland![](image)\u00a0Republic of Ireland![](image)\u00a0Scotland![](image)\u00a0Wales* |\n| *19* | *2032* | *![](image)\u00a0Italy![](image)\u00a0Turkey* |\n\n\n1. **^** Postponed to 2021 due to the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic in Europe\n2. **^** Pan\u2013European edition hosted by eleven countries: Azerbaijan, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain\n\nUp to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.\n\n\nNo third place play-off has been played since 1980.\n\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEngland hosted UEFA Euro 1996, the first tournament to use the nomenclature \"Euro [year]\" and would see the number of teams taking part double to 16.[40] The hosts, in a replay of the 1990 FIFA World Cup semi-final, were knocked out on penalties by Germany.[41] The surprise team of the tournament was the newly formed Czech Republic, participating on its first international competition following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which reached the final after beating Portugal and France in the knockout stage. Germany would go on to win the Final 2\u20131 thanks to the first golden goal ever in a major tournament, scored by Oliver Bierhoff five minutes into extra time.[42][43] This was Germany's first title as a unified nation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 was the first tournament to be held by two countries, in the Netherlands and Belgium.[44] France, the reigning World Cup champions, were favoured to win, and they lived up to expectations when they beat Italy 2\u20131 after extra time, having come from being 1\u20130 down: Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the last minute of regular time and David Trezeguet scored the winning golden goal in extra time.[45]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship\n |\n| --- |\n| Tournaments | * France 1960\n* Spain 1964\n* Italy 1968\n* Belgium 1972\n* Yugoslavia 1976\n* Italy 1980\n* France 1984\n* West Germany 1988\n* Sweden 1992\n* England 1996\n* Belgium / Netherlands 2000\n* Portugal 2004\n* Austria / Switzerland 2008\n* Poland / Ukraine 2012\n* France 2016\n* Pan-European 2020\u2020\n* *Germany 2024*\n* *United Kingdom / Ireland 2028*\n* *Italy / Turkey 2032*\n |\n| Qualifying | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Finals | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Squads | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Bids | * 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n* 2028\n* 2032\n |\n| Statistics | * 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n |\n| Broadcasting rights | * 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1992 | ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | **![](image)Denmark** | **2\u20130**Ullevi, Gothenburg | ![](image)Germany | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands and ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | 8\n |\n| 1996 | ![](image)\u00a0England | **![](image)Germany** | **2\u20131** (g.g.)Wembley Stadium, London | ![](image)Czech Republic | ![](image)\u00a0England and ![](image)\u00a0France | 16\n |\n| 2000 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | **![](image)France** | **2\u20131** (g.g.)De Kuip, Rotterdam | ![](image)Italy | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands and ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2004 | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | **![](image)Greece** | **1\u20130**Est\u00e1dio da Luz, Lisbon | ![](image)Portugal | ![](image)\u00a0Czech Republic and ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 16\n |\n| 2008 | ![](image)\u00a0Austria![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | **![](image)Spain** | **1\u20130**Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna | ![](image)Germany | ![](image)\u00a0Russia and ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 16\n |\n| 2012 | ![](image)\u00a0Poland![](image)\u00a0Ukraine | **![](image)Spain** | **4\u20130**Olimpiyskiy, Kyiv | ![](image)Italy | ![](image)\u00a0Germany and ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 16\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2016 | ![](image)\u00a0France | **![](image)Portugal** | **1\u20130** (a.e.t.)

The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of UEFA European Championship finals\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Denmark. On average, immigrant women have 1.76 children, the descendants have an average of 1.75 children, while women of Danish roots have 1.78 children.[9] This is because Ukrainians, who are categorized as non-Western, have come to Denmark in large numbers.\n\n\nIn the same year, immigrant women from Syria had the highest TFR in Denmark, they give birth to an average of 3.7 children. They are followed by women from Somalia and Pakistan, 2020 figures show.[9]\n\n\nDenmark had a total fertility rate of 1.55 children per woman in 2022.[10]\n\n\nIn 2021 the number of childless women in their 50s is the highest in seven years; 12.3 percent of women at that age have never had a child, while the 19.5 percent of 50-year-old men do not have children.[11]\n\n\n\n### Historical fertility rates\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEthnic minorities in Denmark include a handful of groups:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStatistics Denmark also has specific classification bands which it uses to separate different immigrant groups.

With the same definition, the most common countries of origin were Turkey, Poland, Germany, Iraq, Romania, Syria, Somalia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Yugoslavia and its successor states.[*citation needed*]\nMore than 817,438 individuals (14%)[21][22] are migrants and their descendants (199,668 second generation migrants born in Denmark[22]).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The population density is higher in Denmark than in the other Nordic countries.\nData according to Statistics Denmark, which collects the official statistics for Denmark.[27]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Approximately 15,000 people[15] in Denmark belong to a German minority traditionally referred to as ***tysksindet*** meaning \"German-minded\" in Danish, and as ***Nordschleswiger*** in German. This minority of Germans hold Danish citizenship and self-identify as Germans. Many of them speak German or Low German as their home language. There are also several thousand German citizens and other ethnic Germans residing in Denmark with no historical connection to this group.\n* An estimated 23,000 people[16] in Denmark proper are ethnic Faroese, while 19,000 Greenlanders reside permanently in Denmark.[17] Many of these use the Faroese and Greenlandic languages, respectively, as their first language. All residents of the Kingdom (viz. Denmark proper, the Faroe Islands and Greenland) holds Danish citizenship, unless they inherit or otherwise receive a foreign citizenship.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \"World Population Prospects \u2013 Population Division \u2013 United Nations\".
