John Nugent of *Empire* criticised its length (2 hours and 43 minutes), asserting that the plotting and exposition in the middle third \"doesn't justify that heaving runtime\".

Léa Seydoux, Ben Whishaw, Naomie Harris, Jeffrey Wright, Christoph Waltz, Ralph Fiennes, and Rory Kinnear reprise their roles from previous films, with Rami Malek, Lashana Lynch, Billy Magnussen, Ana de Armas, David Dencik and Dali Benssalah also starring.
