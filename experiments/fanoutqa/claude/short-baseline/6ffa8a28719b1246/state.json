In 1951, the city's Home Rule Charter established a two-term limit for mayors.[4] The term limit is consecutive, not lifetime. \n\n\nThe mayorship of Philadelphia has been held by Democrats since 1952. The only Republican who has come close to winning the position was Sam Katz, who in 1999 came within half a percentage point of being the first Republican mayor of Philadelphia elected in over 45 years.\n\n\n\n## List of Mayors[edit]\n\n\nParties\n\u00a0\u00a0Democratic (16) \n\u00a0\u00a0Democratic-Republican (4) \n\u00a0\u00a0Federalist (6) \n\u00a0\u00a0Keystone (1) \n\u00a0\u00a0National Republican (2) \n\u00a0\u00a0Republican (19) \n\u00a0\u00a0Whig (5) \n\n\n\n### Colonial mayors elected by the Common Council[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 96 |  | ![](image) | Ed Rendell | January 6, 1992 | January 1, 1996 | Democratic | 122 | 187\n |\n| January 1, 1996 | January 3, 2000 | 188\n |\n| 97 |  | ![](image) | John F.

Penn subsequently appointed Edward Shippen under the city charter of 1701. The Philadelphia City Council then elected Shippen to a second term. Subsequent mayors, who held office for one year, were elected by the Philadelphia City Council. The initial mayors of Philadelphia were not compensated and candidates sometimes objected strongly to being selected to the position, sometimes choosing even to pay a fine rather than serve in the position.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1747, at the request of retiring Mayor William Attwood, Council resolved to institute an annual salary of 100 pounds for the office.[2] Nevertheless, that same year, Anthony Morris secretly fled to Bucks County to avoid being notified of his election to the mayoralty. When he could not be located after three days, a new election had to be arranged, and Attwood was re-elected to a second term.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1826, Council could elect any citizen of Philadelphia to the mayoralty. From 1839, mayors were elected by popular vote. If no candidate won a majority of the popular vote, then the joint Councils (Select and Common) would decide between the two leading candidates. John Swift was the first mayor to be elected directly by the people in the 1840 election.\n\n\nThe term of office was extended to two years in 1854, three years in 1861, and four years in 1885. Further, The Act of 1885 prohibited mayors from succeeding themselves.[4]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Alexander Taylor and Joseph Turner \nrefused election to the office of mayor.\n2. **^** After Attwood's first term, Anthony Morris II was elected mayor but fled to avoid taking office. Attwood was elected to a second term three days later.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Died in office.\n4. **^** John Mifflin, Alexander Stedman, and William Coxe refused election.\n5. **^** Samuel Mifflin refused election.\n6. **^** William Coxe and Daniel Benezet refused election.\n7. **^** When the American Revolution began, the state abolished the city government, including the office of mayor.\n8. **^** John Barclay and George Roberts declined election.\n9. **^** Wharton declined reelection to a third term in 1800.\n10. **^** As the Federalist Party collapsed in Pennsylvania, many Philadelphia politicians, including Inskeep, identified themselves as \"Federal Republicans\".\n11. **^** Wharton declined reelection to a sixth term in 1811.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 43 | William Fisher | October 5, 1773 | October 4, 1774 | 58 | 76\n |\n| 44 | Samuel Rhoads | October 4, 1774 | October 5, 1775 | 59 | 77\n |\n| 45 | Samuel Powel | October 5, 1775 | July 4, 1776[g] | 60 | 78\n |\n\n\n### Post-independence mayors elected by the common council[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1704, alderman Griffith Jones was elected but declined to serve, for which he was fined twenty pounds. In 1706, Alderman Thomas Story was similarly fined for refusing office. In 1745, Alderman Abraham Taylor was fined thirty pounds for refusing the mayoralty; Council then elected Joseph Turner, who also refused and was likewise fined.[2] Others who refused election included Richard Hill (1717), Isaac Norris (1722), John Mifflin, and Alexander Stedman, while William Coxe pleaded illness (1758), Samuel Mifflin (1761), William Coxe and Daniel Benezet (1762), and John Barclay and George Roberts (1792). Robert Wharton declined in 1800 and 1811, amid serving for 14 one-year terms, making him the most-often-elected (16 times, including refusals) and longest-serving (14 years) mayor of Philadelphia.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCity of Philadelphia\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * History\n\t+ Timeline\n* Accent\n* Architecture\n* Bibliography\n* Companies\n* Cuisine\n* Culture\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Media\n* Music\n* Notable people\n* Riots\n* Sites of interest\n\t+ Historic Landmarks\n* Skyscrapers\n* Transportation\n |\n| Government | * City Hall\n* Mayor\n* City Council\n* District Attorney\n* Airport\n* Fire Department\n* Free Library\n* Police Department\n* Public Health\n\t+ COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant 2020-2021\n* School district\n* **Federal:** U.S. Mint\n* U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of PA\n* U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit\n |\n| Neighborhoods | * Center City\n* North Philadelphia\n\t+ Lower North\n\t+ Upper North\n\t+ Olney-Oak Lane\n* Northeast Philadelphia\n\t+ River Wards\n* Northwest Philadelphia\n* South Philadelphia\n* Southwest Philadelphia\n* West Philadelphia\n |\n| Museums | * Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University\n* African American Museum in Philadelphia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* National Constitution Center\n* National Liberty Museum\n* National Museum of American Jewish History\n* Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts\n* Philadelphia History Museum\n* Philadelphia Museum of Art\n* Philadelphia's Magic Gardens\n* Please Touch Museum\n* Powel House\n* RittenhouseTown\n* Rodin Museum\n* Rosenbach Museum and Library\n* Ryerss Museum and Library\n* Science History Institute\n* Shofuso Japanese House and Garden\n* Stenton\n* Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial\n* Penn Museum\n* Wagner Free Institute of Science\n* Woodmere Art Museum\n* Wyck House\n |\n| Sports | * 76ers\n* Eagles\n* Flyers\n* Freedoms\n* Phillies\n* Union\n |\n| Squares | * Centre\n* Franklin\n* Logan\n* Rittenhouse\n* Washington\n |\n| Related | * Delaware Valley\n* Carpenters' Hall\n* Independence Hall\n* Congress Hall\n* Liberty Bell\n* Syng inkstand\n* SS *United States*\n* 2016 Democratic National Convention\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Portal\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| No. | Image\n | Mayor\n | Term start\n | Term end\n | Party\n | Mayorship\n | Term[t] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 90 |  | ![](image) | Joseph S.

The only exemption being if the individual is being released following a first or second degree felony conviction and federal officials obtain a warrant from a judge[37][38] - effectively making Philadelphia a sanctuary city.[39][40] Nutter indicated that the change in policy supports public safety and will help rebuild the trust between police and the immigrant community.[38] The executive order was highlighted in June 2014 after a previously deported undocumented immigrant from Honduras was accused of raping a woman in Rittenhouse Square with the concern that if acquitted, the accused would not be submitted for deportation due to Philadelphia's new policy.[41][42][43]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the largest 50 US cities\n* History of African Americans in Philadelphia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Michael Anthony Nutter** (born June 29, 1957) is an American politician who served as the 98th Mayor of Philadelphia from 2008 to 2016.

These measures were adopted at the end of 2005. On May 16, 2006, voters approved the Ethics Board ballot question with 81% voting to approve it, and was installed November 27, 2006.[13]\n\n\nNutter sponsored \"The Clean Indoor Air Worker Protection Law,\" expanding the definition of \"public places\" where smoking is not allowed to include restaurants and many bars, which Mayor Street eventually signed into law.[14] Nutter's local bidder preference program, which took effect on July 1, 2004, gives preference to Philadelphia businesses in competitive bidding on City contracts greater than $25,000.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNutter was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in West Philadelphia.

While in office, Nutter occasionally worked as DJ and a singer.\n\n\nAs of 2014, Michael Nutter was a member of Mt.

The ordinance also forced students in off-campus housing to inform their landlords of their student status.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Registered Democrats hold a formidable 7-to-1 ratio over registered Republicans in Philadelphia, giving Democratic candidates a distinct advantage in citywide elections. The mayoral primary elections were held on May 19, 2015. Kenney won the primary in a landslide with 55.83% of the vote, defeating a crowded field of five other Democratic candidates, including Anthony H. Williams and former District Attorney Lynn Abraham. Republican Melissa Murray Bailey, a business executive, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination.

In an address to City Council, Kenney outlined the end of the state-dominated School Reform Commission and a path to local control of the Philadelphia School District by July 1, 2018.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Opioid epidemic[edit]\n\n\nKenney created *The Mayor's Task Force to Combat the Opioid Epidemic in Philadelphia* in 2016. The committee concluded its work and presented a final proposal in May 2017.[27]\n\n\nIn June of that year, Kenney and U.S. Representative Bob Brady negotiated a deal with Conrail, the company that owns abandoned train tracks in Kensington that became a well-known area for open-air heroin use, to clean up the property.[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Kenney successfully introduced legislation that ended arrests for possession of small amounts of marijuana. The bill replaced incarceration with the requirement to pay a fine. In advocating for the bill, Kenney had cited the disproportionate effect of arrests for small amounts of marijuana on African-Americans.[7] Philadelphia became the largest city in the country to decriminalize marijuana.[8]\n\n\nKenney garnered criticism from local and national economic commentators when he proposed bonus pension payments, distributing funds when pension plans exceed target returns in any given year even though solvency depends on retaining above-average earnings to prepare for years with below-average earnings.[9][10]\n\n\nWhile on the Philadelphia City Council, Kenney worked as a consultant at Vitetta Architects and Engineers, served on the Independence Blue Cross board, and was an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.[11] He gave up these positions when he was elected mayor in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
