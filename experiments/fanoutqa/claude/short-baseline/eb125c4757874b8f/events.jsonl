They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the *Customers' Afternoon Letter*. Reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted this into *The Wall Street Journal*, which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones & Company News Service via telegraph.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States ultimately placing its journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Later, the name was changed to Dow Jones Local Media Group.[17]\n\n\nThe period from 1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including \"Factiva\", *The Wall Street Journal Asia*, *The Wall Street Journal Europe*, the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, MarketWatch, and \"WSJ Weekend Edition\". In 2007, News Corp. acquired Dow Jones. *WSJ.*, a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008.[18]\n\n\nA complement to the print newspaper, *The Wall Street Journal Online*, was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning.[19] A weekly (later daily) crossword edited by Mike Shenk was introduced in 1998.[20]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Benton, Joshua (October 5, 2018). \"Here's how much Americans trust 38 major news organizations (hint: not all that much!)\". *Nieman Lab*.
