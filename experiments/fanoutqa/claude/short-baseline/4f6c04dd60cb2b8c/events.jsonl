Established in 1891 and played since 1928 on outdoor red clay courts at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France,[1] the French Open is (since 1925) one of the four Grand Slam tournaments played each year, the other three being the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Organised by the Fédération Française de Tennis (FFT), the French Open is the second of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the year to be played.[2] In 1968, it was the first Grand Slam tournament to open to non-amateur players.\n\n\nThe winner of the men's singles event receives the Coupe des Mousquetaires, named after The Four Musketeers of French tennis: Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet, and René Lacoste.[3] The event was not held from 1915 to 1919 because of the First World War and was held unofficially as the Tournoi de France under German occupation from 1941 to 1944, during the Second World War.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmerican Jim Courier won consecutive titles in 1991 and 1992 before Spaniard Sergi Bruguera repeated the feat in 1993 and 1994.[22][23] Gustavo Kuerten won three titles in 1997, 2000 and 2001.[19] 2005 marked Rafael Nadal's first French Open; he won four consecutive titles from 2005 to 2008.[24] Nadal was beaten in the round of 16 of the 2009 tournament by Robin Söderling who lost to Roger Federer in the final.[25] Nadal regained the title in 2010 and defended his crowns in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. In the 2015 event, he was knocked out in the quarter-finals by Novak Djokovic, who eventually lost in the final to Stan Wawrinka.[26] Nadal would again win four straight titles from 2017 to 2020.\n\n\n\n## Finals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** \"The Origins of the Tournament\".

France's victory in the 1927 Davis Cup increased interest in the tournament and required a new stadium to be built. Previously the tournament had alternated between Racing Club and La Faisanderie, before the Stade Roland Garros was built in 1928.[14] Henri Cochet won the first tournament at the new venue.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1992: Jim Courier\n* 1993: Sergi Bruguera\n* 1994: Sergi Bruguera\n* 1995: Thomas Muster\n* 1996: Yevgeny Kafelnikov\n* 1997: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 1998: Carlos Moyá\n* 1999: Andre Agassi\n* 2000: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 2001: Gustavo Kuerten\n* 2002: Albert Costa\n* 2003: Juan Carlos Ferrero\n* 2004: Gastón Gaudio\n* 2005: Rafael Nadal\n* 2006: Rafael Nadal\n* 2007: Rafael Nadal\n* 2008: Rafael Nadal\n* 2009: Roger Federer\n* 2010: Rafael Nadal\n* 2011: Rafael Nadal\n* 2012: Rafael Nadal\n* 2013: Rafael Nadal\n* 2014: Rafael Nadal\n* 2015: Stan Wawrinka\n* 2016: Novak Djokovic\n* 2017: Rafael Nadal\n* 2018: Rafael Nadal\n* 2019: Rafael Nadal\n* 2020: Rafael Nadal\n* 2021: Novak Djokovic\n* 2022: Rafael Nadal\n* 2023: Novak Djokovic\n* 2024: Carlos Alcaraz\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01TTbEAz1mKN8vtdFPNXovMQ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He held the top spot for two weeks. Later that year, he entered the French Open as defending champion and lost in the fourth round to eventual winner Andre Agassi. At the US Open, Moyá withdrew in the second round with a back injury and only played in two tournaments for the rest of the year.\n\n\nDespite being hampered with a stress fracture in his lower back from the 1999 US Open through the early part of 2000, Moyá still finished in the top 50 in the world for the fifth straight year. He reached the fourth round of the US Open, where he held a match point in the fourth set, but eventually lost to Todd Martin in five sets, 7–6, 7–6, 1–6, 6–7, 2–6. Moyá's best result for the rest of 2000 was winning at the Portugal Open final over his countryman Francisco Clavet.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTennis world No. 1 men's singles players\n |\n| --- |\n| * Current ATP world No. 1 in bold, as of week of 10 June 2024[update]\n* ATP rankings was introduced on August 23, 1973\n |\n| 1–5 | * Ilie Năstase (1973/74 – 40 w)\n* John Newcombe (1974 – 8 w)\n* Jimmy Connors (1974/83 – 268 w)\n* Björn Borg (1977/81 – 109 w)\n* John McEnroe (1980/85 – 170 w)\n |\n| 6–10 | * Ivan Lendl (1983/90 – 270 w)\n* Mats Wilander (1988/89 – 20 w)\n* Stefan Edberg (1990/92 – 72 w)\n* Boris Becker (1991 – 12 w)\n* Jim Courier (1992/93 – 58 w)\n |\n| 11–15 | * Pete Sampras (1993/00 – 286 w)\n* Andre Agassi (1995/03 – 101 w)\n* Thomas Muster (1996 – 6 w)\n* Marcelo Ríos (1998 – 6 w)\n* Carlos Moyá (1999 – 2 w)\n |\n| 16–20 | * Yevgeny Kafelnikov (1999 – 6 w)\n* Pat Rafter (1999 – 1 w)\n* Marat Safin (2000/01 – 9 w)\n* Gustavo Kuerten (2000/01 – 43 w)\n* Lleyton Hewitt (2001/03 – 80 w)\n |\n| 21–25 | * Juan Carlos Ferrero (2003 – 8 w)\n* Andy Roddick (2003/04 – 13 w)\n* Roger Federer (2004/18 – 310 w)\n* Rafael Nadal (2008/20 – 209 w)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2001, Moyá won the title at Umag.

He captured his second career Tennis Masters Series title, and the biggest hard-court title of his career, at Cincinnati, where he defeated world No. 1, Lleyton Hewitt, in the final.\n\n\nMoyá captured three clay-court titles in 2003. He also helped Spain reach the final of the Davis Cup, compiling a 6–0 singles record. In the semifinals, he won the deciding rubber against Gastón Gaudio as Spain beat Argentina, 3–2. He beat Mark Philippoussis on grass in the final.

He held the top spot for two weeks. Later that year, he entered the French Open as defending champion and lost in the fourth round to eventual winner Andre Agassi. At the US Open, Moyá withdrew in the second round with a back injury and only played in two tournaments for the rest of the year.\n\n\nDespite being hampered with a stress fracture in his lower back from the 1999 US Open through the early part of 2000, Moyá still finished in the top 50 in the world for the fifth straight year. He reached the fourth round of the US Open, where he held a match point in the fourth set, but eventually lost to Todd Martin in five sets, 7–6, 7–6, 1–6, 6–7, 2–6. Moyá's best result for the rest of 2000 was winning at the Portugal Open final over his countryman Francisco Clavet.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTennis world No. 1 men's singles players\n |\n| --- |\n| * Current ATP world No. 1 in bold, as of week of 10 June 2024[update]\n* ATP rankings was introduced on August 23, 1973\n |\n| 1–5 | * Ilie Năstase (1973/74 – 40 w)\n* John Newcombe (1974 – 8 w)\n* Jimmy Connors (1974/83 – 268 w)\n* Björn Borg (1977/81 – 109 w)\n* John McEnroe (1980/85 – 170 w)\n |\n| 6–10 | * Ivan Lendl (1983/90 – 270 w)\n* Mats Wilander (1988/89 – 20 w)\n* Stefan Edberg (1990/92 – 72 w)\n* Boris Becker (1991 – 12 w)\n* Jim Courier (1992/93 – 58 w)\n |\n| 11–15 | * Pete Sampras (1993/00 – 286 w)\n* Andre Agassi (1995/03 – 101 w)\n* Thomas Muster (1996 – 6 w)\n* Marcelo Ríos (1998 – 6 w)\n* Carlos Moyá (1999 – 2 w)\n |\n| 16–20 | * Yevgeny Kafelnikov (1999 – 6 w)\n* Pat Rafter (1999 – 1 w)\n* Marat Safin (2000/01 – 9 w)\n* Gustavo Kuerten (2000/01 – 43 w)\n* Lleyton Hewitt (2001/03 – 80 w)\n |\n| 21–25 | * Juan Carlos Ferrero (2003 – 8 w)\n* Andy Roddick (2003/04 – 13 w)\n* Roger Federer (2004/18 – 310 w)\n* Rafael Nadal (2008/20 – 209 w)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2001, Moyá won the title at Umag.

He captured his second career Tennis Masters Series title, and the biggest hard-court title of his career, at Cincinnati, where he defeated world No. 1, Lleyton Hewitt, in the final.\n\n\nMoyá captured three clay-court titles in 2003. He also helped Spain reach the final of the Davis Cup, compiling a 6–0 singles record. In the semifinals, he won the deciding rubber against Gastón Gaudio as Spain beat Argentina, 3–2. He beat Mark Philippoussis on grass in the final.
