As of 2006, it was widely considered the most popular breed in the world.[36] And it is the most popular dog by ownership in Canada, New Zealand[37] and the United Kingdom.[38] In 2006 both the United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over twice as many registered Labradors as the next most popular breed.[39][40] If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3–5 times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the German shepherd dog and Golden retriever.[39][40]\n\n\nThey are the most popular breed of assistance dog in the United States, Australia, and many other countries,[41] as well as being widely used by police and other official bodies for their detection and working abilities. Approximately 60–70% of all guide dogs in the United States are Labradors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDogs\n |\n| --- |\n| Types | * African village dogs\n* Feral dogs\n\t+ Pye-dogs\n\t+ Street dogs\n* Hairless dogs\n* Herding dogs\n\t+ Collies\n\t+ Livestock guardian dogs\n\t+ Sheepdogs\n* Hunting dogs\n\t+ Curs\n\t\t- Feists\n\t\t- Lurchers\n\t+ Gun dogs\n\t\t- Pointers\n\t\t- Retrievers\n\t\t- Setters\n\t\t- Spaniels\n\t\t- Water dogs\n\t+ Hounds\n\t\t- Scenthounds\n\t\t\t* Bassets\n\t\t\t* Coonhounds\n\t\t\t* Foxhounds\n\t\t- Sighthounds\n\t\t\t* Longdogs\n\t+ Terriers\n\t\t- Bull-type terriers\n\t\t- Pinschers\n\t\t- Schnauzers\n* Mastiffs\n\t+ Bulldogs\n* Spitz\n\t+ Huskies\n\t+ Laikas\n\t+ Tugous\n* Toy dogs\n\t+ Bichons\n* Turnspit dogs\n |\n| Breeds | * List of breeds\n* List of crossbreeds\n* Mixed-breed dogs\n* Crossbreeds\n* Extinct breeds\n* Most popular\n |\n| Roles | * Assistance dogs\n\t+ Autism dogs\n\t+ Guide dogs\n\t+ Hearing dogs\n\t+ Medical response dogs\n\t\t- Seizure dogs\n\t+ Mobility assistance dogs\n\t+ Therapy dogs\n\t\t- Psychiatric service dogs\n* Attack dogs\n* Bay dogs\n* Carriage dogs\n* Catch dogs\n* Companion dogs\n* Detection dogs\n* Fighting dogs\n* Guard dogs\n* Lap dogs\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDogs originating in the United Kingdom\n |\n| --- |\n| Hounds | * Beagle\n* Bloodhound\n* English Foxhound\n* Greyhound\n* Harrier\n* Otterhound\n* Scottish Deerhound\n* Welsh Hound\n* West Country Harrier\n* Whippet\n |\n| Gun dogs | * Clumber Spaniel\n* Curly-Coated Retriever\n* English Cocker Spaniel\n* English Setter\n* English Springer Spaniel\n* Field Spaniel\n* Flat-Coated Retriever\n* Golden Retriever\n* Gordon Setter\n* Labrador Retriever\n* Pointer\n* Sussex Spaniel\n* Welsh Springer Spaniel\n |\n| Terriers | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLabradors are somewhat prone to hip and elbow dysplasia,[30] especially in larger dogs.[31] Eye diseases may include progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy[30] and retinal dysplasia.[32] They can suffer from exercise induced collapse, which causes hyperthermia, weakness, collapse, and disorientation after short bouts of exercise,[33] or from obesity, which in some cases may be partly due to the absence of part or all of the proopiomelanocortin gene.[34][35]\n\n\n\n## Demography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of most popular dog breeds\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Meat dogs\n* Mercy dogs\n* Pet dogs\n* Police dogs\n\t+ usage by country\n* Search and rescue dogs\n* Sled dogs\n* War dogs\n |\n| Behavior | * Communication\n\t+ Barking\n\t+ Howling\n* Human–canine bond\n* Intelligence\n* Dog–cat relationship\n |\n| Human–doginteraction | * Animal testing\n* Baiting\n* Breed-specific legislation\n* Dog bite\n* Dog fighting\n* Dog park\n* Dog show\n* Human–canine bond\n* Dog sports\n* Dog walking\n* Dog daycare\n* Dog grooming\n* Therapy\n* Fear of dogs\n* Dog licence\n* Dog meat\n* Dog food\n\t+ dog biscuit\n\t+ 2007 recalls\n* Dogs in religion\n* Dogs in space\n* Origin of the domestic dog\n |\n| Health | * Aging (List of longest-living dogs)\n* Anatomy\n* Breeding\n* Coat\n* Conformation\n* Diseases\n* Dog food\n* Odor\n* Rabies in animals\n* Rage syndrome\n* Reproduction\n* Skin disorders\n* Vaccination\n |\n| Training | * Clicker\n* Crate training\n* Training\n* Housebreaking\n* Socialization\n |\n| Related | * List of individual dogs\n* List of fictional dogs\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** Raffan, Eleanor (10 May 2016). \"A Deletion in the Canine POMC Gene Is Associated with Weight and Appetite in Obesity-Prone Labrador Retriever Dogs\". *Cell Metabolism*. **23** (5): 893–900. doi:10.1016/j.cmet.2016.04.012.
