Many molecular and cellular changes involved in the development of cancer accumulate during the aging process and eventually manifest as cancer.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cancer syndrome\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Irigaray P, Newby JA, Clapp R, Hardell L, Howard V, Montagnier L, Epstein S, Belpomme D (December 2007). \"Lifestyle-related factors and environmental agents causing cancer: an overview\". *Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy*. **61** (10): 640–58. doi:10.1016/j.biopha.2007.10.006.

Many molecular and cellular changes involved in the development of cancer accumulate during the aging process and eventually manifest as cancer.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cancer syndrome\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Irigaray P, Newby JA, Clapp R, Hardell L, Howard V, Montagnier L, Epstein S, Belpomme D (December 2007). \"Lifestyle-related factors and environmental agents causing cancer: an overview\". *Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy*. **61** (10): 640–58. doi:10.1016/j.biopha.2007.10.006.

Studies have shown that individuals that eat red or processed meat have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer.[44] This may be partially explained by the presence of carcinogens in food cooked at high temperatures.[45] Several risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer include high intake of fat, alcohol, red and processed meats, obesity, and lack of physical exercise.[46] A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer.
