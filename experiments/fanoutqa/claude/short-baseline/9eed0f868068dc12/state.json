Usually, a single code corresponds to a single National Olympic Committee (NOC). When different codes are displayed for different years, medal counts are combined in the case of a simple change of IOC code (such as from HOL to NED for the Netherlands) or simple change of country name (such as from Ceylon to Sri Lanka). As the medals are attributed to each NOC, not all totals include medals won by athletes from that country for another NOC, such as before independence of that country. Names in italic are national entities that no longer exist. The totals of NOCs are not combined with those of their predecessors and successors.\n\n\n\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Summer Olympic medals.\n![](image)World map showing nations that have won Winter Olympic medals.\n\n## List of NOCs with medals (sortable & unranked)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Olympic Games\n |\n| --- |\n| Summer | * 1896 Athens\n* 1900 Paris\n* 1904 St. Louis\n* 1908 London\n* 1912 Stockholm\n* 1916[a]\n* 1920 Antwerp\n* 1924 Paris\n* 1928 Amsterdam\n* 1932 Los Angeles\n* 1936 Berlin\n* 1940[b]\n* 1944[b]\n* 1948 London\n* 1952 Helsinki\n* 1956 Melbourne\n* 1960 Rome\n* 1964 Tokyo\n* 1968 Mexico City\n* 1972 Munich\n* 1976 Montreal\n* 1980 Moscow\n* 1984 Los Angeles\n* 1988 Seoul\n* 1992 Barcelona\n* 1996 Atlanta\n* 2000 Sydney\n* 2004 Athens\n* 2008 Beijing\n* 2012 London\n* 2016 Rio de Janeiro\n* 2020 Tokyo[c]\n* *2024 Paris*\n* *2028 Los Angeles*\n* *2032 Brisbane*\n* *2036*\n | ![Olympic rings](image)\n |\n| Winter | * 1924 Chamonix\n* 1928 St. Moritz\n* 1932 Lake Placid\n* 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen\n* 1940[b]\n* 1944[b]\n* 1948 St. Moritz\n* 1952 Oslo\n* 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo\n* 1960 Squaw Valley\n* 1964 Innsbruck\n* 1968 Grenoble\n* 1972 Sapporo\n* 1976 Innsbruck\n* 1980 Lake Placid\n* 1984 Sarajevo\n* 1988 Calgary\n* 1992 Albertville\n* 1994 Lillehammer\n* 1998 Nagano\n* 2002 Salt Lake City\n* 2006 Turin\n* 2010 Vancouver\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Rank\n | Country\n | Number of games\n |\n| 1 | ![](image)\u00a0Norway | 9 times\n |\n| 2 | ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union | 7 times\n |\n| 3 | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 3 times\n |\n| 4 | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 2 times\n |\n| 5 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 1 time\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Sweden |\n| ![](image)\u00a0East Germany |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Canada |\n\n\n### Special Case of Germany[edit]\n\n\nIf results for East and West Germany are combined, German athletes also won the most gold medals in the 1976 Summer Olympics and the 1988 Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Variations[edit]\n\n\n### Early Olympics[edit]\n\n\nFor the 1900 Summer Olympics several countries are credited with appearances that are not considered official by the IOC.

Major infrastructure including sports facilities and Sheremetyevo Terminal 2 airport were built for these Games.\n\n2. Olympic Athletes: By 2005, over 500 Olympic sports champions lived in the city, showing its significant contribution to the Soviet/Russian Olympic medal count.\n\n3. Major Sports Facilities:\n- Luzhniki Stadium: The largest stadium in Moscow and 4th biggest in Europe\n- 63 stadiums in total\n- 40 other sports complexes\n- 24 facilities with artificial ice\n- Olympic Stadium (first indoor arena for bandy)\n- Seven horse racing tracks including Central Moscow Hippodrome\n\n4. Notable Sports Teams & Achievements:\n- HC CSKA Moscow: Most titled ice hockey team in Soviet Union and world\n- PBC CSKA Moscow: Most titled Soviet, Russian, and one of the most titled Euroleague basketball clubs\n- VC CSKA Moscow: Most titled volleyball team in Soviet Union and Europe\n- Moscow produced more USSR and Russian Chess Champions than any other city\n\n5. Failed Olympic Bid: Moscow made a bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics but was eliminated in the first round of voting, with the Games ultimately being awarded to London.\n\nThis sporting infrastructure and history helps explain why Moscow was able to contribute significantly to the Soviet Union's/Russia's total of 440 Olympic gold medals.",
