Meanwhile, Prussian worries about the growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.\n\n\n\n\n## Periodisation[edit]\n\n\nHistorians differ on when the War of the Third Coalition began and when it ended. From the British perspective, the war started when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, but it was still on its own. It was not until December 1804 when Sweden entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom, not until 11 April 1805 when Russia joined the alliance, not until 16 July when Britain and Russia ratified their treaty of alliance, and only thereafter Austria (9 August) and Naples–Sicily (11 September) completed the fully-fledged coalition.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, Bavaria sided with France on 25 August, and Württemberg joined Napoleon on 5 September. No major hostilities between France and any member of the coalition other than Britain (Trafalgar campaign March–November 1805) occurred until the Ulm Campaign (25 September – 20 October 1805). This was in part because Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom was not called off until 27 August 1805, when he decided to use his invasion force camped at Boulogne against Austria instead.[1]\n\n\nLikewise, no major battles occurred after the Battle of Austerlitz and the signing of the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, which forced Austria to leave the Third Coalition and cease hostilities against France. Some historians conclude that Austria's departure \"shattered the fragile Third Coalition\"[1] and \"ended the War of the Third Coalition\".[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* War of the Fourth Coalition\n* List of battles of the War of the Third Coalition\n* List of Napoleonic battles\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** This armed conflict has received various names: \n\n\t* In Russian historiography, it is known as the **Russian-Austro-French War** (Russian: Русско-австро-французская война)\n\t* it is known as the **Austrian campaign of 1805** (French: *Campagne d'Autriche de 1805*) or the **German campaign of 1805** (French: *Campagne d'Allemagne de 1805*)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis narrative leaves out the subsequent French invasion of Naples (February–July 1806), which the occupying Anglo-Russian troops hastily evacuated and the remaining Neapolitan forces relatively quickly surrendered. Other scholars argue the southern Italian campaign should be included into the War of the Second Coalition, and criticise ignoring the Mediterranean front by only focusing on land battles in Central Europe and the Trafalgar campaign.[3]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\nEurope had been embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the armies of the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, but this too was defeated by 1801, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate.[4]\n\n\n\n### From Amiens to the Third Coalition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Austrian Empire:**20,000 killed or wounded70,000 captured**Russia:**25,000 killed or wounded25,000 captured**Naples:**20,000 killed, wounded or captured**Total casualties:**160,000 killed, wounded or captured | **France:**13,500 killed37,000 wounded5,000 captured**Italy:**350 killed1,900 wounded**Spain:**1,200 killed1,600 wounded**Bavaria:**300 killed1,200 wounded\n\n---\n\n**Total casualties:**62,050 killed, wounded or captured |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWar of the Third Coalition\n |\n| --- |\n| German campaign\n* Bavaria\n* **Ulm campaign**\n\t+ Donauwörth\n\t+ Wertingen\n\t+ Günzburg\n\t+ Haslach-Jungingen\n\t+ Memmingen\n\t+ Elchingen\n\t+ Ulm\n* Mehrnbach\n* Lambach\n* Steyr\n* Amstetten\n* Mariazell\n* Dürenstein\n* Dornbirn\n* Schöngrabern\n* Hanover\n* Wischau\n* **Austerlitz**\n\n\nItalian campaign\n* Verona\n* Caldiero\n* Forano\n* Caldiero pursuit\n* Castelfranco Veneto\n\n\nInvasion of Naples\n* Gaeta\n* Campo Tenese\n* Maida\n* Calabria\n* Mileto\n\n\nTrafalgar campaign\n* Diamond Rock\n* Cape Finisterre\n* **Trafalgar**\n* Cape Ortegal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Masséna was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier's II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Masséna had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier. This foreshadowed the same problems the French, and in particular Joseph Bonaparte, would face in Spain during the Peninsular War.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n![](image)All the participants of the War of the Third Coalition.

With Napoleon as their \"Protector\", the confederate states were compelled to leave the Holy Roman Empire, which was dissolved shortly afterward.[67] Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.\n\n\nIn Italy, the political situation would remain unchanged until 1815, with the British and Sicilian troops guarding the Bourbon King Ferdinand in Sicily and the Napoleonic King of Naples controlling the mainland. In 1808, Joachim Murat became the King of Naples, after Joseph Bonaparte became King of Spain. Murat made various attempts to cross the Strait of Messina, which all ended in failure, despite once managing to secure a foothold in Sicily.\n\n\n\n### Casualties and losses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Marshal Murat proved instrumental during the Ulm Campaign.\n![](image)General Mack surrenders his army at Ulm.

Pitt scored a significant coup by securing a burgeoning rival as an ally. The Baltic was dominated by Russia, something Britain had been uncomfortable with since the area provided valuable commodities like timber, tar, and hemp, crucial supplies to its Royal Navy.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)In *The Plumb-pudding in danger* (1805), James Gillray caricatured overtures made by Napoleon in January 1805 for a reconciliation with Britain.\nThe nascent Third Coalition came into being in December 1804 when, in exchange for payment, an Anglo-Swedish agreement was signed allowing the British to use Swedish Pomerania as a military base against France (explicitly, the nearby French-occupied Electorate of Hanover, the homeland of the British monarch). The Swedish government had broken diplomatic ties with France in early 1804 after the arrest and execution of Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, a royalist émigré who had been implicated (on dubious evidence) in an assassination plot against First Consul Bonaparte. The execution of Enghien shocked the aristocrats of Europe, who still remembered the bloodletting of the Revolution and thus lost whatever conditional respect they may have entertained for Napoleon.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Miguel de Álava\n* Maria I of Portugal\n* Prince Regent John of Portugal\n* Count of Feira\n* William, Prince of Orange\n* Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\n* Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden\n* Prince Charles John of Sweden\n* Louis XVIII\n |\n| Relatedconflicts | * Anglo-Russian War\n* Anglo-Spanish War\n* Anglo-Swedish War\n* Anglo-Turkish War\n* Anglo-Danish War\n\t+ Gunboat War\n* Dano-Swedish War\n* Russo-Swedish War (Finnish War)\n* Franco-Swedish War (Pomeranian War)\n* Russo-Persian War\n* Russo-Turkish War\n* Spanish American wars of independence\n* Swedish–Norwegian War\n* War of 1812\n |\n| Treaties | * Campo Formio\n* Lunéville\n* Amiens\n* Artlenburg\n* Pressburg\n* Finckenstein\n* Tilsit\n* Cintra\n* Schönbrunn\n* Paris (1810)\n* Paris (February 1812)\n* Paris (March 1812)\n* Paris (1814)\n* Tauroggen\n* Ried\n* Chaumont\n* Kiel\n* Mantua\n* Casalanza\n* Fontainebleau (1814)\n* Paris (1815)\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Bibliography\n* Bourbon Restoration\n* Casualties\n* Congress of Erfurt\n* Continental System\n* Conference of Dresden\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_016v11U1wkgsscfhb3ueuvoy","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, but this too was defeated by 1801, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate.[4]\n\n\n\n### From Amiens to the Third Coalition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Austrian Empire:**20,000 killed or wounded70,000 captured**Russia:**25,000 killed or wounded25,000 captured**Naples:**20,000 killed, wounded or captured**Total casualties:**160,000 killed, wounded or captured | **France:**13,500 killed37,000 wounded5,000 captured**Italy:**350 killed1,900 wounded**Spain:**1,200 killed1,600 wounded**Bavaria:**300 killed1,200 wounded\n\n---\n\n**Total casualties:**62,050 killed, wounded or captured |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWar of the Third Coalition\n |\n| --- |\n| German campaign\n* Bavaria\n* **Ulm campaign**\n\t+ Donauwörth\n\t+ Wertingen\n\t+ Günzburg\n\t+ Haslach-Jungingen\n\t+ Memmingen\n\t+ Elchingen\n\t+ Ulm\n* Mehrnbach\n* Lambach\n* Steyr\n* Amstetten\n* Mariazell\n* Dürenstein\n* Dornbirn\n* Schöngrabern\n* Hanover\n* Wischau\n* **Austerlitz**\n\n\nItalian campaign\n* Verona\n* Caldiero\n* Forano\n* Caldiero pursuit\n* Castelfranco Veneto\n\n\nInvasion of Naples\n* Gaeta\n* Campo Tenese\n* Maida\n* Calabria\n* Mileto\n\n\nTrafalgar campaign\n* Diamond Rock\n* Cape Finisterre\n* **Trafalgar**\n* Cape Ortegal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Masséna was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier's II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Masséna had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier. This foreshadowed the same problems the French, and in particular Joseph Bonaparte, would face in Spain during the Peninsular War.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n![](image)All the participants of the War of the Third Coalition.

With Napoleon as their \"Protector\", the confederate states were compelled to leave the Holy Roman Empire, which was dissolved shortly afterward.[67] Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.\n\n\nIn Italy, the political situation would remain unchanged until 1815, with the British and Sicilian troops guarding the Bourbon King Ferdinand in Sicily and the Napoleonic King of Naples controlling the mainland.

The Swedish government had broken diplomatic ties with France in early 1804 after the arrest and execution of Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, a royalist émigré who had been implicated (on dubious evidence) in an assassination plot against First Consul Bonaparte. The execution of Enghien shocked the aristocrats of Europe, who still remembered the bloodletting of the Revolution and thus lost whatever conditional respect they may have entertained for Napoleon.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Miguel de Álava\n* Maria I of Portugal\n* Prince Regent John of Portugal\n* Count of Feira\n* William, Prince of Orange\n* Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\n* Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden\n* Prince Charles John of Sweden\n* Louis XVIII\n |\n| Relatedconflicts | * Anglo-Russian War\n* Anglo-Spanish War\n* Anglo-Swedish War\n* Anglo-Turkish War\n* Anglo-Danish War\n\t+ Gunboat War\n* Dano-Swedish War\n* Russo-Swedish War (Finnish War)\n* Franco-Swedish War (Pomeranian War)\n* Russo-Persian War\n* Russo-Turkish War\n* Spanish American wars of independence\n* Swedish–Norwegian War\n* War of 1812\n |\n| Treaties | * Campo Formio\n* Lunéville\n* Amiens\n* Artlenburg\n* Pressburg\n* Finckenstein\n* Tilsit\n* Cintra\n* Schönbrunn\n* Paris (1810)\n* Paris (February 1812)\n* Paris (March 1812)\n* Paris (1814)\n* Tauroggen\n* Ried\n* Chaumont\n* Kiel\n* Mantua\n* Casalanza\n* Fontainebleau (1814)\n* Paris (1815)\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Bibliography\n* Bourbon Restoration\n* Casualties\n* Congress of Erfurt\n* Continental System\n* Conference of Dresden\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_016v11U1wkgsscfhb3ueuvoy","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Although the French were victorious in the initial battles during the campaign in Germany, the entry of Austria into the war led to France's decisive defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in the autumn of 1813, which proved to be a massive victory for the Coalition. Following the battle, the Pro-French Confederation of the Rhine collapsed, thereby ending Napoleon's hold on territory east of the Rhine forever.

Facing them in the theatre were the French forces numbering only about 70,000 men. In spite of being heavily outnumbered, Napoleon defeated the divided Coalition forces in the battles at Brienne and La Rothière, but could not stop the Coalition's advance and triumphant victory over Napoleon. Austrian Emperor Francis I and King Frederick William III of Prussia felt demoralized upon hearing about Napoleon's victories since the start of the campaign. They even considered ordering a general retreat. But Alexander was far more determined than ever to victoriously enter Paris whatever the cost, imposing his will upon Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, and the wavering monarchs.[43] On 28 March, Coalition forces advanced towards Paris and prepared to launch an assault.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the crossing of the Berezina, Napoleon left the army and returned to Paris to protect his position as Emperor and to raise more forces to resist the advancing Russians.

The *Grande Armée*, made up of French and allied forces, was reduced to a fraction of its initial strength.[*citation needed*] These events triggered a major shift in European politics.

Napoleon was in Fontainebleau when he heard that Paris had surrendered. Outraged, he wanted to march on the capital, but his marshals refused to fight for him and repeatedly urged him to surrender. He abdicated in favour of his son on 4 April, but the Allies rejected this out of hand, forcing Napoleon to abdicate unconditionally on 6 April.

In January Alexander had still upheld the ideal of a free confederation of the European states, symbolised by the Holy Alliance, against the policy of a dictatorship of the great powers, symbolised by the Quadruple Treaty; he had still protested against the claims of collective Europe to interfere in the internal concerns of the sovereign states.

The battle started that same morning with intense artillery bombardment from the Coalition positions. Early in the morning the Coalition attack began when the Russians attacked and drove back the French skirmishers near Belleville before being driven back themselves by French cavalry from the city's eastern suburbs. By 7:00 a.m. the Russians attacked the Young Guard near Romainville in the centre of the French lines and after some time and hard fighting, pushed them back. A few hours later the Prussians, under Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, attacked north of the city and carried the French position around Aubervilliers, but did not press their attack. The Württemberg troops seized the positions at Saint-Maur to the southeast, with Austrian troops in support.

While Alexander assisted Napoleon in the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809, he declared plainly that he would not allow the Austrian Empire to be crushed out of existence. Napoleon subsequently complained bitterly of the inactivity of the Russian troops during the campaign. The tsar in turn protested against Napoleon's encouragement of the Poles. In the matter of the French alliance he knew himself to be practically isolated in Russia, and he declared that he could not sacrifice the interest of his people and empire to his affection for Napoleon. \"I don't want anything for myself\", he said to the French ambassador, \"therefore the world is not large enough to come to an understanding on the affairs of Poland, if it is a question of its restoration\".[31][32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe brilliance of these new visions did not, however, blind Alexander to the obligations of friendship, and he refused to retain the Danubian principalities as the price for suffering a further dismemberment of Prussia. \"We have made loyal war\", he said, \"we must make a loyal peace\".[27] It was not long before the first enthusiasm of Tilsit began to wane. The French remained in Prussia, the Russians on the Danube, and each accused the other of breach of faith. Meanwhile, however, the personal relations of Alexander and Napoleon were of the most cordial character, and it was hoped that a fresh meeting might adjust all differences between them. The meeting took place at Erfurt in October 1808 and resulted in a treaty that defined the common policy of the two Emperors. But Alexander's relations with Napoleon nonetheless suffered a change. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prelude | * French Revolution\n* First Coalition\n* Second Coalition\n* 18 Brumaire\n* Planned invasion of the United Kingdom\n* Duc d'Enghien Execution\n* Coronation of Napoleon\n |\n| 1805 | * Diamond Rock\n* Cape Finisterre\n* Wertingen\n* Günzburg\n* Haslach-Jungingen\n* Elchingen\n* Ulm\n* Verona\n* Trafalgar\n* Caldiero\n* Cape Ortegal\n* Amstetten\n* Dürenstein\n* Schöngrabern\n* Austerlitz\n |\n| 1806 | * Gaeta\n* Campo Tenese\n* Maida\n* Schleiz\n* Saalfeld\n* Jena–Auerstedt\n* Erfurt\n* Halle\n* Magdeburg\n* Prenzlau\n* Pasewalk\n* Stettin\n* Waren-Nossentin\n* Lübeck\n* Greater Poland uprising\n* Hamelin\n* Czarnowo\n* Golymin\n* Pułtusk\n |\n| 1807 | * Mohrungen\n* Eylau\n* Ostrołęka\n* Kolberg\n* Danzig\n* Stralsund I\n* Mileto\n* Guttstadt-Deppen\n* Heilsberg\n* Friedland\n* Stralsund II\n* Copenhagen\n* Invasion of Portugal\n |\n| 1808 | * Dos de Mayo\n* Bruch\n* Rosily Squadron\n* Cabezón\n* 1st Zaragoza\n* Valencia\n* Medina de Rioseco\n* Bailén\n* Roliça\n* Vimeiro\n* Zornoza\n* Valmaseda\n* Burgos\n* Espinosa\n* Tudela\n* Somosierra\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nControl of the heights was severely contested, until the French forces surrendered.[44][45]\n\n\nAlexander sent an envoy to meet with the French to hasten the surrender. He offered generous terms to the French and although having intended to avenge Moscow,[46] he declared himself to be bringing peace to France rather than its destruction. On 31 March[47] Talleyrand gave the key of the city to the tsar. Later that day the Coalition armies triumphantly entered the city with Alexander at the head of the army followed by the King of Prussia and Prince Schwarzenberg.

In 1805 he joined Britain in the War of the Third Coalition against Napoleon, but after suffering massive defeats at the battles of Austerlitz and Friedland, he switched sides and formed an alliance with Napoleon by the Treaty of Tilsit (1807) and joined Napoleon's Continental System. He fought a small-scale naval war against Britain between 1807 and 1812 as well as a short war against Sweden (1808–09) after Sweden's refusal to join the Continental System. Alexander and Napoleon hardly agreed, especially regarding Poland, and the alliance collapsed by 1810. Alexander's greatest triumph came in 1812 when Napoleon's invasion of Russia proved to be a catastrophic disaster for the French. As part of the winning coalition against Napoleon, he gained territory in Finland and Poland. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Peter III\n\n- Catherine II\n\n- Paul I\n\n- Alexander I\n\n- Nicholas I\n\n- Alexander II\n\n- Alexander III\n\n- Nicholas II\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** Phillips 1911, p. 558 cites Castlereagh to Liverpool, 2 October 1814.

Although the French were victorious in the initial battles during the campaign in Germany, the entry of Austria into the war led to France's decisive defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in the autumn of 1813, which proved to be a massive victory for the Coalition. Following the battle, the Pro-French Confederation of the Rhine collapsed, thereby ending Napoleon's hold on territory east of the Rhine forever. Alexander, being the supreme commander of the Coalition forces in the theatre and the paramount monarch among the three main Coalition monarchs, ordered all Coalition forces in Germany to cross the Rhine and invade France.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| French and allymilitary andpolitical leaders | * Napoleon\n* Louis-Alexandre Berthier\n* Joachim Murat\n* Louis-Nicolas Davout\n* Jean Lannes\n* Auguste de Marmont\n* André Masséna\n* Michel Ney\n* Jean-de-Dieu Soult\n* Marshal Victor\n* Jean-Baptiste Bessières\n* Pierre-Charles Villeneuve\n* Joseph I\n* Louis Bonaparte\n* Jérôme Bonaparte\n* Prince Poniatowski\n* Prince Eugène\n* Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria\n* Frederick Augustus I of Saxony\n* Frederick I of Württemberg\n* Frederick VI of Denmark\n |\n| Coalitionmilitary andpolitical leaders | * Duke of Wellington\n* Rowland Hill\n* John Moore\n* Horatio Nelson\n* Thomas Cochrane\n* Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor\n* Manuel Lapeña\n* Archduke Charles\n* Prince von Schwarzenberg\n* Archduke John of Austria\n* Alexander I of Russia\n* Mikhail Kutuzov\n* Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly\n* Count Bennigsen\n* Pyotr Bagration\n* Peter Wittgenstein\n* Frederick William III of Prussia\n* Gebhard von Blücher\n* Duke of Brunswick\n* Prince of Hohenlohe\n* Ferdinand VII of Spain\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Coalition forces, divided into three groups, entered northeastern France in January 1814. Facing them in the theatre were the French forces numbering only about 70,000 men. In spite of being heavily outnumbered, Napoleon defeated the divided Coalition forces in the battles at Brienne and La Rothière, but could not stop the Coalition's advance and triumphant victory over Napoleon. Austrian Emperor Francis I and King Frederick William III of Prussia felt demoralized upon hearing about Napoleon's victories since the start of the campaign. They even considered ordering a general retreat. But Alexander was far more determined than ever to victoriously enter Paris whatever the cost, imposing his will upon Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg, and the wavering monarchs.[43] On 28 March, Coalition forces advanced towards Paris and prepared to launch an assault.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the crossing of the Berezina, Napoleon left the army and returned to Paris to protect his position as Emperor and to raise more forces to resist the advancing Russians. The campaign ended on 14 December 1812, with the last French troops finally leaving Russian soil.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe campaign was a turning point in the Napoleonic Wars.[*citation needed*] Napoleon's reputation was severely shaken, and French hegemony in Europe was weakened. The *Grande Armée*, made up of French and allied forces, was reduced to a fraction of its initial strength.[*citation needed*] These events triggered a major shift in European politics. France's ally Prussia, soon followed by Austria, broke their imposed alliance with Napoleon and switched sides, triggering the War of the Sixth Coalition.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### War of the Sixth Coalition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: War of the Sixth Coalition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 2 April, the Sénat conservateur passed the *Acte de déchéance de l'Empereur*, which declared Napoleon deposed. Napoleon was in Fontainebleau when he heard that Paris had surrendered. Outraged, he wanted to march on the capital, but his marshals refused to fight for him and repeatedly urged him to surrender. He abdicated in favour of his son on 4 April, but the Allies rejected this out of hand, forcing Napoleon to abdicate unconditionally on 6 April. The terms of his abdication, which included his exile to the Isle of Elba, were settled in the Treaty of Fontainebleau on 11 April.

In January Alexander had still upheld the ideal of a free confederation of the European states, symbolised by the Holy Alliance, against the policy of a dictatorship of the great powers, symbolised by the Quadruple Treaty; he had still protested against the claims of collective Europe to interfere in the internal concerns of the sovereign states.

The battle started that same morning with intense artillery bombardment from the Coalition positions. Early in the morning the Coalition attack began when the Russians attacked and drove back the French skirmishers near Belleville before being driven back themselves by French cavalry from the city's eastern suburbs. By 7:00 a.m. the Russians attacked the Young Guard near Romainville in the centre of the French lines and after some time and hard fighting, pushed them back. A few hours later the Prussians, under Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, attacked north of the city and carried the French position around Aubervilliers, but did not press their attack. The Württemberg troops seized the positions at Saint-Maur to the southeast, with Austrian troops in support. The Russian forces then assailed the heights of Montmartre in the city's northeast. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA general treaty was to become the main basis of the relations of the states forming \"the European Confederation\".[27] While he believed the effort would not attain universal peace, it would be worthwhile if it established clear principles for the prescriptions of the rights of nations.[27] The body would assure \"the positive rights of nations\" and \"the privilege of neutrality,\" while asserting the obligation to exhaust all resources of mediation to retain peace, and would form \"a new code of the law of nations\".[29]\n\n\n\n#### 1807 loss to French forces[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Meeting of Napoleon and Alexander I in Tilsit, a 19th-century painting by Adolphe Roehn\nEvents were rapidly heading towards the rupture of the Franco-Russian alliance. While Alexander assisted Napoleon in the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809, he declared plainly that he would not allow the Austrian Empire to be crushed out of existence. Napoleon subsequently complained bitterly of the inactivity of the Russian troops during the campaign. The tsar in turn protested against Napoleon's encouragement of the Poles. In the matter of the French alliance he knew himself to be practically isolated in Russia, and he declared that he could not sacrifice the interest of his people and empire to his affection for Napoleon. \"I don't want anything for myself\", he said to the French ambassador, \"therefore the world is not large enough to come to an understanding on the affairs of Poland, if it is a question of its restoration\".[31][32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe brilliance of these new visions did not, however, blind Alexander to the obligations of friendship, and he refused to retain the Danubian principalities as the price for suffering a further dismemberment of Prussia. \"We have made loyal war\", he said, \"we must make a loyal peace\".[27] It was not long before the first enthusiasm of Tilsit began to wane. The French remained in Prussia, the Russians on the Danube, and each accused the other of breach of faith. Meanwhile, however, the personal relations of Alexander and Napoleon were of the most cordial character, and it was hoped that a fresh meeting might adjust all differences between them. The meeting took place at Erfurt in October 1808 and resulted in a treaty that defined the common policy of the two Emperors.

He created eighteen Marshals of the Empire from among his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army on 18 May 1804, the official start of the Empire.[139]\n\n\n\n#### War of the Third Coalition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: War of the Third Coalition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDifferences with the United Kingdom meant France faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with victories in the Ulm campaign and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him. Napoleon defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the *Grande Armée* into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)*Napoleon in his coronation robes* by François Gérard, c. 1805\nGreat Britain had broken the Peace of Amiens by declaring war on France in May 1803.[140] In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement became the first step towards the creation of the Third Coalition.

It collapsed in 1807 when France and Russia formed an unexpected alliance.[78] In the end, Napoleon had made no effective alliances in the Middle East.[161]\n\n\n\n#### War of the Fourth Coalition and Tilsit[edit]\n\n\nMain article: War of the Fourth Coalition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Succeeded byLouis XVIII\n***as King of France and Navarre(Napoleon II** according to his will only**)*** |\n| Titles in pretence |\n| **New title** | **— TITULAR —** ***Emperor of the French*** 11 April 1814 – 20 March 1815\n | **Vacant**Title next held by\n**Napoleon II**  |\n |\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nNapoleonic Wars\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Third Coalition**\n* **Fourth Coalition**\n* **Peninsular War**\n* **Fifth Coalition**\n* **French Invasion of Russia**\n* **Sixth Coalition**\n* **Seventh Coalition**\n |\n| Belli-gerents | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Revolutionary campaigns\n |\n| --- |\n| 1792 | * Verdun\n* Thionville\n* Valmy\n* Royalist Revolts\n\t+ Chouannerie\n\t+ Vendée\n\t+ Dauphiné\n* Lille\n* Siege of Mainz\n* Jemappes\n* Namur [fr]\n |\n| 1793 | * First Coalition\n* War in the Vendée\n* Battle of Neerwinden)\n* Battle of Famars (23 May 1793)\n* Expedition to Sardinia (21 Dec 1792 - 25 May 1793)\n* Battle of Kaiserslautern\n* Siege of Mainz\n* Battle of Wattignies\n* Battle of Hondschoote\n* Siege of Bellegarde\n* Battle of Peyrestortes (Pyrenees)\n* Siege of Toulon (18 Sep – 18 Dec 1793)\n* First Battle of Wissembourg (13 Oct 1793)\n* Battle of Truillas (Pyrenees)\n* Second Battle of Wissembourg (26–27 Dec 1793)\n |\n| 1794 | * Battle of Villers-en-Cauchies (24 Apr 1794)\n* Second Battle of Boulou (Pyrenees) (30 Apr – 1 May 1794)\n* Battle of Tourcoing (18 May 1794)\n* Battle of Tournay (22 May 1794)\n* Glorious First of June (1 Jun 1794)\n* Battle of Fleurus (26 Jun 1794)\n* Chouannerie\n* Battle of Aldenhoven (2 Oct 1794)\n* Siege of Luxembourg (22 Nov 1794 - 7 Jun 1795)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Miguel de Álava\n* Maria I of Portugal\n* Prince Regent John of Portugal\n* Count of Feira\n* William, Prince of Orange\n* Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\n* Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden\n* Prince Charles John of Sweden\n* Louis XVIII\n |\n| Relatedconflicts | * Anglo-Russian War\n* Anglo-Spanish War\n* Anglo-Swedish War\n* Anglo-Turkish War\n* Anglo-Danish War\n\t+ Gunboat War\n* Dano-Swedish War\n* Russo-Swedish War (Finnish War)\n* Franco-Swedish War (Pomeranian War)\n* Russo-Persian War\n* Russo-Turkish War\n* Spanish American wars of independence\n* Swedish–Norwegian War\n* War of 1812\n |\n| Treaties | * Campo Formio\n* Lunéville\n* Amiens\n* Artlenburg\n* Pressburg\n* Finckenstein\n* Tilsit\n* Cintra\n* Schönbrunn\n* Paris (1810)\n* Paris (February 1812)\n* Paris (March 1812)\n* Paris (1814)\n* Tauroggen\n* Ried\n* Chaumont\n* Kiel\n* Mantua\n* Casalanza\n* Fontainebleau (1814)\n* Paris (1815)\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Bibliography\n* Bourbon Restoration\n* Casualties\n* Congress of Erfurt\n* Continental System\n* Conference of Dresden\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Allied disaster at Austerlitz significantly shook the faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands to France in Italy and Bavaria, and lands in Germany to Napoleon's German allies.[157]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Offices and distinctions\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |\n| --- |\n| Napoleon I of France\n**House of Bonaparte**\n**Born:** 15 August 1769 **Died:** 5 May 1821 |\n| Political offices\n |\n| **New title**Directory dissolved\n |  **Provisional Consul of the French Republic** 11 November – 12 December 1799 Served alongside: **Roger Ducos and Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès** | **Became First Consul**  |\n| **New title**Consulate established\n |  **First Consul of the French Republic** 12 December 1799 – 18 May 1804 Served alongside: **Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès (Second Consul)Charles-François Lebrun (Third Consul)** | **Became Emperor**  |\n| **New title**Italian Republic established\n |  **President of the Italian Republic** 26 January 1802 – 17 March 1805\n | **Vacant****(Became King)**\nTitle next held by\n**Enrico De Nicola**  |\n| **New title**Helvetic Republic dissolved\n |  **Mediator of the Swiss Confederation** 19 February 1803 – 19 October 1813\n | **New Confederation established**  |\n| Regnal titles\n |\n| **Vacant**French Revolution\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Napoleon at the Battle of Wagram, 6 July 1809\nAfter four years on the sidelines, Austria sought another war with France to avenge its recent defeats. Austria could not count on Russian support because the latter was at war with Britain, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire in 1809. Frederick William of Prussia initially promised to help the Austrians but reneged before conflict began.[183] A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by the middle of 1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilized.[183] Although Archduke Charles warned that the Austrians were not ready for another showdown with Napoleon, a stance that landed him in the so-called \"peace party\", he did not want to see the army demobilized either.[183] On 8 February 1809, the advocates for war finally succeeded when the Imperial Government secretly decided on another confrontation against the French.[184]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Battle of Castiglione on 5 August 1796 Siege of Mantua (1796–1797) from 27 August 1796 to 2 February 1797 Battle of Rovereto on 4 September 1796 Battle of Bassano on 8 September 1796 Second Battle of Bassano on 6 November 1796 Battle of Caldiero (1796) on 12 November 1796 Battle of Arcole from 15 to 17 November 1796 Battle of Rivoli from 14 to 15 January 1797 Battle of Valvasone (1797) on 16 March 1797 Battle of Tagliamento on 16 March 1797 Battle of Tarvis (1797) from 21 to 23 March 1797](image)\n3\n![Battle of Montenotte from 11 to 12 April 1796 Battle of Millesimo from 13 to 14 April 1796 Second Battle of Dego from 14 to 15 April 1796 Battle of Ceva on 16 April 1796 Battle of Mondovì from 20 to 22 April 1796 Battle of Fombio from 7 to 9 May 1796 Battle of Lodi on 10 May 1796 Battle of Borghetto on 30 May 1796 Battle of Lonato from 3 to 4 August 1796](image)\n\nParis\n2\n![13 Vendémiaire on 5 October 1795](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Foreign Affairs | * Charles-Frédéric Reinhard\n* Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord\n |\n| Justice | * Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès\n* André Joseph Abrial\n* Claude Ambroise Régnier\n |\n| War | * Louis-Alexandre Berthier\n* Lazare Carnot\n* Louis-Alexandre Berthier\n |\n| Finance | Martin-Michel-Charles Gaudin\n |\n| Police | Joseph Fouché\n |\n| Interior | * Pierre-Simon Laplace\n* Lucien Bonaparte\n* Jean-Antoine Chaptal\n |\n| Navy and Colonies | * Marc-Antoine Bourdon de Vatry\n* Pierre-Alexandre-Laurent Forfait\n* Denis Decrès\n |\n| Secretary of State | Hugues-Bernard Maret, duc de Bassano\n |\n| Treasury | François Barbé-Marbois\n |\n| War Administration | Jean François Aimé Dejean\n |\n\n |\n| * Preceded by French Directory\n* Followed by First Cabinet of Napoleon I\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_014cLibnrdVgBcir2ipV2pUq","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
