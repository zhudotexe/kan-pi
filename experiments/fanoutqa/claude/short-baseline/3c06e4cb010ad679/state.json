After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (\u5b89\u5b89; *\u0100n'\u0101n*), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** Bull, Alister; Buckley, Chris (24 January 2012). \"China leader-in-waiting Xi to visit White House next month\". *Reuters*.

He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county.[23] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982\u20131985), Fujian (1985\u20132002), Zhejiang (2002\u20132007), and Shanghai (2007).[24] Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.[b][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n476. **^** Forsythe, Michael (17 June 2012). \"As China's Leader Fights Graft, His Relatives Shed Assets\". *The New York Times*.

His tenure was characterized by collective leadership and consensus-based rule.[2] These traits made Hu a rather enigmatic figure in the public eye. His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping. Following the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu is the only living former paramount leader of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu's birthplace, Jiangyan, Jiangsu.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\n\n### Power transition of Xi Jinping[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party\n\nSee also: 12th National People's Congress\n\nOn 15 November 2012, immediately after the 18th CCP National Congress, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee, succeeding Hu.[57] On 14 March 2013, he was succeeded by Xi as president.[58]\n\n\n\n## After retirement[edit]\n\n\nSince his retirement, Hu has kept a low-profile, rarely making public appearances. In September 2013, Hu visited an ancestral family home in Huangshan, Anhui, though the trip was not covered by state media.[59] In April 2014, he made an appearance in Hunan, visiting Hunan University and other historical sites.[60] He attended the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017.[61] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2019, and the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in July 2021.[62]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** Boehler, Patrick (13 September 2023). \"Social media records rare public appearance of former president Hu Jintao\". *South China Morning Post*.

Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier. However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary.[32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post. Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| First term | * 2002 election as Party general secretary\n* 2003 election as president\n* 2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak\n* Baoxian campaign\n* Anti-Secession Law\n* 2005 Pan\u2013Blue visits to mainland China\n |\n| Second term | * 2007 reelection as Party general secretary\n* 2008 reelection as president\n* 2008 Tibetan unrest\n* 2008 Summer Olympics\n* July 2009 \u00dcr\u00fcmqi riots\n* 2009China 60th National Day grand parade\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
