The couple lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland, an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C., and they have two adopted children: John \"Jack\" and Josephine \"Josie\".[144][17]\n\n\nRoberts is one of 15 Catholic justices—out of 115 justices total—in the history of the Supreme Court.[145] Of those fifteen justices, six (Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett) are currently serving.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** \"Roll call vote on the Nomination (Confirmation Neil M.

As the five other conservative justices could outvote the rest, he supposedly could no longer preside over a moderately conservative course while respecting precedent.[82][83] This view was espoused again after the 2022 *Dobbs* decision, which overturned rulings from 1973 and 1992.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in *Gonzales v. Oregon*, which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChief Justice of the United States since 2005\n\nFor other people named John Roberts, see John Roberts (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Preliminary Inventory\" (PDF). *reaganlibrary.gov*.

The couple lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland, an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C., and they have two adopted children: John \"Jack\" and Josephine \"Josie\".[144][17]\n\n\nRoberts is one of 15 Catholic justices—out of 115 justices total—in the history of the Supreme Court.[145] Of those fifteen justices, six (Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett) are currently serving.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** \"Roll call vote on the Nomination (Confirmation Neil M.

As the five other conservative justices could outvote the rest, he supposedly could no longer preside over a moderately conservative course while respecting precedent.[82][83] This view was espoused again after the 2022 *Dobbs* decision, which overturned rulings from 1973 and 1992.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in *Gonzales v. Oregon*, which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChief Justice of the United States since 2005\n\nFor other people named John Roberts, see John Roberts (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Preliminary Inventory\" (PDF). *reaganlibrary.gov*.

Justices Stevens and Souter agreed 77 percent of the time; so did Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. Thomas and Scalia agreed in only 73 percent of the cases. Thomas regularly breaks with Scalia, disagreeing on points of doctrine, finding a more measured and judicial tone, and calling for the elimination of bad law.

He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01EKTioYE3v2vhteQp7g8Yww","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In that same period, Thomas was the third-most-frequent dissenter on the Court, behind Stevens and Scalia.[179] Scalia's and Thomas's agreement rate peaked in 1996 at 98%.[179] By 2004, other pairs of justices were more closely aligned than Scalia and Thomas.[180]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n180. **^** Baude, William (June 30, 2004). \"Brothers in Law\". *The New Republic*.

Justices Stevens and Souter agreed 77 percent of the time; so did Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. Thomas and Scalia agreed in only 73 percent of the cases. Thomas regularly breaks with Scalia, disagreeing on points of doctrine, finding a more measured and judicial tone, and calling for the elimination of bad law. Unless he is simply a very bad yes-man, Clarence Thomas is a more independent voice than most people give him credit for.\n181. **^** Rossum 2013, p. 214–215.\n182. **^** Greenhouse, Linda (July 1, 2007). \"In Steps Big and Small, Supreme Court, Moved Right\". *The New York Times*.

He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01EKTioYE3v2vhteQp7g8Yww","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
