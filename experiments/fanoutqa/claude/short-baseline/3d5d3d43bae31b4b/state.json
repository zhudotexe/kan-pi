A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served on the Phoenix City Council from 2014 to 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGallego grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[2] Her parents are attorneys who moved to Albuquerque from Chicago after the 1979 Chicago blizzard.[3][4] She grew up with asthma, which made air quality important to her.[5]\n\n\nGallego graduated from Albuquerque Academy, where she served as student body vice president.[3] She earned a bachelor's degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard College and a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[3][6]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nGallego worked for the Arizona Democratic Party, the Arizona Office of Tourism,[5] as well as on economic development and strategic planning for the Salt River Project. On November 5, 2013, Gallego was elected to the Phoenix City Council for the 8th district; she was reelected in 2017. With Greg Stanton, the Mayor of Phoenix, running for the United States House of Representatives in the 2018 elections, Gallego announced she would run in a special election to succeed him.[7] She resigned from the city council effective August 7, 2018.[8]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nThe city of Phoenix has nonpartisan mayoral elections. In the 2018 special election, Kate Gallego and Daniel Valenzuela advanced to a runoff in November of 2018. They defeated Moses Sanchez and Nicholas Sarwark. Although the election was nonpartisan, both candidates were Democrats. Previously on the city council, they had voted similarly. Kate Gallego defeated Daniel Valenzuela in the special general runoff election for the mayor of Phoenix in 2019. She received 58.6% of votes.[9] She assumed office on March 21, 2019. Gallego became the first woman elected to the office in more than three decades. She is only the second female mayor in Phoenix history and one of the youngest big city mayors in the United States.[10] She was backed by progressives, labor unions, the *Arizona Republic* editorial board, and liberal advocacy organizations. Examples of these include Emily's List, Sierra Club, and the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Kate Gallego ran for re-election. In November 2020, she was returned to office with the highest number of votes ever cast in a mayoral election. Merissa Hamilton, a Libertarian write in candidate, was Gallego's closest opponent. Hamilton received 26.29% of votes. Gallego won the election receiving 60.7% of the votes.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gallego tours GateWay Community College with Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nDuring Gallego's tenure as mayor, Phoenix has taken steps to counter the urban heat island effects which are aggravated by climate change.[13] Increasing temperatures in the Phoenix area are projected to cost billions of dollars per year.[14] Among the steps being taken are the creation of \"cool corridors\" through the planting of desert-adapted trees, and the use of lighter-colored sidewalks and streets, particularly in areas with high pedestrian traffic and little shade. Where to plant the trees is determined in part based on \"tree equity.\" The city uses an interactive tool from the nonprofit American Forests that grades shade in neighborhoods based on satellite images.[13][14] Phoenix has also opened one of the first city heat mitigation offices in the United States. It will support climate mitigation in Phoenix and share strategies with individuals and cities worldwide.[15]\n\n\n\n### Policing[edit]\n\n\nThe police department of Phoenix recorded shooting 44 people in 2018, spurring a reassessment from the community on police accountability. In 2020, Gallego suggested a plan for a citizens review board that would balance the police department interests and community interests. City councilman Carlos Garcia, who ran on further police accountability, created a plan focused on empowering a citizens review board from input of the community and groups such as Puente Human Rights and Poder in Action. The city council passed Garcia's model for a review board when Gallego and vice mayor Betty Guardados switched their votes from Gallego's model to the Garcia model with a 5\u20134 vote.[16]\n\n\nA Department of Justice investigation was initiated in August 2021 looking into if the police used excessive force on protestors and sweeping of homeless people and their property. The investigation planned to look at current police practices and its handling of the disabled.[17][18]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nGallego supported legislation that legalized accessory dwelling units on lots that were previously strictly zoned for single-family housing.[19]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGallego is Jewish,[4] celebrating her bat mitzvah in Albuquerque.[3]\n\n\nWhile attending Harvard, Kate met Ruben Gallego at a charity auction following the September 11 attacks.[5] They moved to Phoenix in 2004,[2] and married in 2010. The couple announced their divorce in 2016, prior to the birth of their child, Michael.[20]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Phi Beta Kappa elects 92 seniors to Harvard chapter\". *The Harvard Gazette*.
