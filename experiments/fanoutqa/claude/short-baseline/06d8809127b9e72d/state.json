The current tallest tree is the Hyperion tree, measuring 115.61\u00a0m (379.3\u00a0ft).[37] The tree was discovered in Redwood National Park during mid-2006 by Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor, and is thought to be the world's tallest living organism. The previous record holder was the Stratosphere Giant in Humboldt Redwoods State Park at 112.84\u00a0m (370.2\u00a0ft) (as measured in 2004). Until it fell in March 1991, the \"Dyerville Giant\" was the record holder. It, too, stood in Humboldt Redwoods State Park and was 113.4\u00a0m (372\u00a0ft) high and estimated to be 1,600\u00a0years old. This fallen giant has been preserved in the park.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. ^ ***a*** ***b*** National Park Service (1997). \"The General Sherman Tree\". *Sequoia National Park*.

In 2021 during a meeting presentation titled Redwoods 101 run by Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, an even larger redwood was revealed, allegedly surpassed only by 3 giant sequoias in size.[83] This tree is popularly known as 'Hail Storm', and has a volume of 44,750 cubic feet.[84]\n\n\nDetails of the precise locations for most of the tallest trees were not announced to the general public for fear of causing damage to the trees and the surrounding habitat.[37] The largest coast redwood easily accessible to the public is Iluvatar, which stands prominently about 5 meters (16\u00a0ft) to the southeast of the Foothill Trail of Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park.\n\n\n\n### Canopy Layers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### List of tallest trees[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest trees\n\nHeights of the tallest coast redwoods are measured yearly by experts.[37] Even with recent discoveries of tall coast redwoods above 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft), it is likely that no taller trees will be discovered.[37]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Del Norte Titan\nDiameter is measured at 1.4\u00a0m (4\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) above average ground level (at breast height).

It was felled around 1945.[37][87]\n* The Lindsey Creek tree was documented to have a height of 120\u00a0m (390\u00a0ft) and a trunk volume of at least 2,500 cubic meters (90,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) when it was uprooted and felled by a storm in 1905. If these measurements are to be believed, the Lindsey Creek tree was about 3\u00a0m (10\u00a0ft) taller than Hyperion, the current tallest tree, 213% larger than Grogan's Fault, and 171% larger than General Sherman.[37][88]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** Sillett, Stephen C; et\u00a0al.

Common names include **coast redwood**, **coastal redwood** and **California redwood**. It is an evergreen, long-lived, monoecious tree living 1,200\u20132,200 years or more.[4] This species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to 115.9\u00a0m (380.1\u00a0ft) in height (without the roots) and up to 8.9\u00a0m (29\u00a0ft) in diameter at breast height. These trees are also among the longest-living organisms on Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated 810,000\u00a0ha (2,000,000 acres)[5][6][7] along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. **^** Harris, S.

Reportedly, the tree was once over 435ft tall, and 110ft in circumference, with a minimum height of 365 feet.[69][70] Now, what is left of the tree is a popular tourist attraction.\n\n\n### Tallest[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***Sequoiadendron giganteum***, also known as the **giant sequoia**, **giant redwood** or **Sierra redwood** is a coniferous tree, classified in the family Cupressaceae in the subfamily Sequoioideae. Giant sequoia specimens are the most massive trees on Earth.[3] They occur naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California.\n\n\nThe giant sequoia is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN, with fewer than 80,000 trees remaining. Since its last assessment as an endangered species in 2011, it was estimated that another 13\u201319% of the population (or 9,761\u201313,637 mature trees) were destroyed during the Castle Fire of 2020 and the KNP Complex & Windy Fire in 2021, events attributed to fire suppression and drought. Prescribed burns to reduce available fuel load may be crucial for saving the species.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrowth rates in some areas of Europe are remarkable. One young tree in Italy reached 22\u00a0m (72\u00a0ft) tall and 88\u00a0cm (2.89\u00a0ft) trunk diameter in 17 years (Mitchell, 1972).\n\n\n\n### Northern and Central Europe[edit]\n\n\nGrowth further northeast in Europe is limited by winter cold. In Denmark, where extreme winters can reach \u221232\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221226\u00a0\u00b0F), the largest tree was 35\u00a0m (115\u00a0ft) tall and 1.7\u00a0m (5.6\u00a0ft) diameter in 1976 and is bigger today. One in Poland has purportedly survived temperatures down to \u221237\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221235\u00a0\u00b0F) with heavy snow cover.\n\n\nTwo members of the German Dendrology Society, E. J. Martin and Illa Martin, introduced the giant sequoia into German forestry at the Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen in 1952.[48]\n\n\nTwenty-nine giant sequoias, measuring around 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) in height, grow in Belgrade's municipality of Lazarevac in Serbia.[49]\n\n\nThe oldest *Sequoiadendron* in the Czech Republic, at 44\u00a0m (144\u00a0ft), grows in Ratm\u011b\u0159ice u Votic castle garden.\n\n\n\n### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGrowth in Britain is very fast, with the tallest tree, at Benmore in southwest Scotland, reaching 56.4\u00a0m (185\u00a0ft) in 2014 at age 150 years,[42] and several others from 50\u201353\u00a0m (164\u2013174\u00a0ft) tall; the stoutest is around 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) in girth and 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) in diameter, in Perthshire. The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and in their second campus at Wakehurst, contain multiple large specimens of the species. Biddulph Grange Garden in Staffordshire holds a fine collection of both *Sequoiadendron giganteum* and *Sequoia sempervirens* (coast redwood). The General Sherman of California has a volume of 1,489\u00a0m3 (52,600\u00a0cu\u00a0ft); by way of comparison, the largest giant sequoias in Great Britain have volumes no greater than 90\u2013100\u00a0m3 (3,200\u20133,500\u00a0cu\u00a0ft), one example being the 90\u00a0m3 (3,200\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) specimen in the New Forest.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Opened pollen cones\n![](image)Mature cones and seed\nGiant sequoia specimens are the most massive individual trees in the world.[3] They grow to an average height of 50\u201385\u00a0m (164\u2013279\u00a0ft) with trunk diameters ranging from 6\u20138\u00a0m (20\u201326\u00a0ft). Record trees have been measured at 94.8\u00a0m (311\u00a0ft) tall. Trunk diameters of 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) have been claimed via research figures taken out of context.[9] The specimen known to have the greatest diameter at breast height is the General Grant tree at 8.8\u00a0m (28.9\u00a0ft).[10] Between 2014 and 2016, it is claimed that specimens of coast redwood were found to have greater trunk diameters than all known giant sequoias - though this has not been independently verified or affirmed in any academic literature.[11] The trunks of coast redwoods taper at lower heights than those of giant sequoias which have more columnar trunks that maintain larger diameters to greater heights.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Schmid, R. & Farjon, A.

The trees have since been surrounded by modern real estate development.[46]\n\n\n\n### Italy[edit]\n\n\nNumerous giant sequoia were planted in Italy from 1860 through 1905. Several regions contain specimens that range from 40 to 48 metres (131 to 157\u00a0ft) in height. The largest tree is in Roccavione, in the Piedmont, with a basal circumference of 16 metres (52\u00a0ft). One notable tree survived a 200-metre (660\u00a0ft) tall flood wave in 1963 that was caused by a landslide at Vajont Dam. There are numerous giant sequoia in parks and reserves.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Conifer Specialist Group (1998). \"*Sequoiadendron giganteum*\". *IUCN Red List of Threatened Species*. **1998**.
