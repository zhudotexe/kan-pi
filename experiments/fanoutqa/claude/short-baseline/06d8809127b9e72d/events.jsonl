The current tallest tree is the Hyperion tree, measuring 115.61 m (379.3 ft).[37] The tree was discovered in Redwood National Park during mid-2006 by Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor, and is thought to be the world's tallest living organism. The previous record holder was the Stratosphere Giant in Humboldt Redwoods State Park at 112.84 m (370.2 ft) (as measured in 2004). Until it fell in March 1991, the \"Dyerville Giant\" was the record holder. It, too, stood in Humboldt Redwoods State Park and was 113.4 m (372 ft) high and estimated to be 1,600 years old. This fallen giant has been preserved in the park.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. ^ ***a*** ***b*** National Park Service (1997). \"The General Sherman Tree\". *Sequoia National Park*.

It was felled around 1945.[37][87]\n* The Lindsey Creek tree was documented to have a height of 120 m (390 ft) and a trunk volume of at least 2,500 cubic meters (90,000 cu ft) when it was uprooted and felled by a storm in 1905. If these measurements are to be believed, the Lindsey Creek tree was about 3 m (10 ft) taller than Hyperion, the current tallest tree, 213% larger than Grogan's Fault, and 171% larger than General Sherman.[37][88]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** Sillett, Stephen C; et al.

Common names include **coast redwood**, **coastal redwood** and **California redwood**. It is an evergreen, long-lived, monoecious tree living 1,200–2,200 years or more.[4] This species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to 115.9 m (380.1 ft) in height (without the roots) and up to 8.9 m (29 ft) in diameter at breast height. These trees are also among the longest-living organisms on Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated 810,000 ha (2,000,000 acres)[5][6][7] along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. **^** Harris, S.

The current tallest tree is the Hyperion tree, measuring 115.61 m (379.3 ft).[37] The tree was discovered in Redwood National Park during mid-2006 by Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor, and is thought to be the world's tallest living organism. The previous record holder was the Stratosphere Giant in Humboldt Redwoods State Park at 112.84 m (370.2 ft) (as measured in 2004). Until it fell in March 1991, the \"Dyerville Giant\" was the record holder. It, too, stood in Humboldt Redwoods State Park and was 113.4 m (372 ft) high and estimated to be 1,600 years old. This fallen giant has been preserved in the park.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. ^ ***a*** ***b*** National Park Service (1997). \"The General Sherman Tree\". *Sequoia National Park*.

It is an evergreen, long-lived, monoecious tree living 1,200–2,200 years or more.[4] This species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to 115.9 m (380.1 ft) in height (without the roots) and up to 8.9 m (29 ft) in diameter at breast height. These trees are also among the longest-living organisms on Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated 810,000 ha (2,000,000 acres)[5][6][7] along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. **^** Harris, S.

Reportedly, the tree was once over 435ft tall, and 110ft in circumference, with a minimum height of 365 feet.[69][70] Now, what is left of the tree is a popular tourist attraction.\n\n\n### Tallest[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***Sequoiadendron giganteum***, also known as the **giant sequoia**, **giant redwood** or **Sierra redwood** is a coniferous tree, classified in the family Cupressaceae in the subfamily Sequoioideae. Giant sequoia specimens are the most massive trees on Earth.[3] They occur naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California.\n\n\nThe giant sequoia is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN, with fewer than 80,000 trees remaining. Since its last assessment as an endangered species in 2011, it was estimated that another 13–19% of the population (or 9,761–13,637 mature trees) were destroyed during the Castle Fire of 2020 and the KNP Complex & Windy Fire in 2021, events attributed to fire suppression and drought.

In Denmark, where extreme winters can reach −32 °C (−26 °F), the largest tree was 35 m (115 ft) tall and 1.7 m (5.6 ft) diameter in 1976 and is bigger today.

Giant sequoia specimens are the most massive trees on Earth.[3] They occur naturally only in groves on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California.\n\n\nThe giant sequoia is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN, with fewer than 80,000 trees remaining. Since its last assessment as an endangered species in 2011, it was estimated that another 13–19% of the population (or 9,761–13,637 mature trees) were destroyed during the Castle Fire of 2020 and the KNP Complex & Windy Fire in 2021, events attributed to fire suppression and drought.

In December 2012, Stephen Sillett announced a measurement of the President tree with a total of 54,000 cubic feet (1,500 m3) of wood and 9,000 cubic feet (250 m3) of wood in the branches.[66][67] Ranked according to the total amount of wood in the tree, the General Sherman tree is first, the President tree is second, and the General Grant tree is third.[66][67] General Sherman has 2,000 cubic feet (57 m3) more wood than the President tree.[66]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSpecies of tree found in North America\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| *Sequoiadendron giganteum* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| The \"Grizzly Giant\" in the Mariposa Grove, Yosemite National Park |\n| Conservation status\n |\n| ![](image)Endangered  (IUCN 3.1)[1]\n |\n| ![](image)Vulnerable  (NatureServe)[2]\n |\n| Scientific classification ![Edit this classification](image) |\n| Kingdom:\n | Plantae |\n| *Clade*:\n | Tracheophytes |\n| *Clade*:\n | Gymnospermae |\n| Division:\n | Pinophyta |\n| Class:\n | Pinopsida |\n| Order:\n | Cupressales |\n| Family:\n | Cupressaceae |\n| Genus:\n | *Sequoiadendron* |\n| Species:\n | ***S. giganteum***\n |\n| Binomial name |\n| ***Sequoiadendron giganteum***(Lindl.)

A tree at Blithewold Gardens, in Bristol, Rhode Island, is reported to be 27 metres (89 ft) tall, reportedly the tallest in the New England states.[56][57] The tree at the Tyler Arboretum in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, at 29.1 metres (95 ft) may be the tallest in the northeast.[58] Specimens also grow in the Arnold Arboretum in Boston, Massachusetts (planted 1972, 18 m tall in 1998), at Longwood Gardens near Wilmington, Delaware, in the New Jersey State Botanical Garden at Skylands in Ringwood State Park, Ringwood, New Jersey, and in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Private plantings of giant sequoias around the Middle Atlantic States are not uncommon, and other publicly accessible specimens can be visited at the U.S. National Arboretum in Washington, D.C. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01TSmLFQVdRB8u6cXtWVtG6n","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
