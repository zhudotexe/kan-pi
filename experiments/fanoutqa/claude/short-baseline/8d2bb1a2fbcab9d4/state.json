In 2008, he established Protectinvest, a private foundation in Belgium set up to safeguard the integrity of the LVMH group until 2023; the foundation locked up the Arnault children\u2019s ability to sell shares in Pilinvest until 2023, by which time Arnault\u2019s youngest child turned 25, an age deemed old enough to assume responsibility for LVMH.[67] In December 2011, six months before Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande took office as President of France, he transferred a 31 percent stake in Groupe Arnault \u2013 at the time considered by the newspaper *Lib\u00e9ration* worth \u20ac6.5 billion \u2013 to Pilinvest.[68][69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nArnault's collection includes works by Picasso, Yves Klein, Henry Moore, and Andy Warhol.[52][53] He was also instrumental in establishing LVMH as a significant patron of art in France.[54] The LVMH Young Fashion Designer was created as an international competition open to students from fine arts schools. Every year, the winner is awarded a grant to support the creation of the designer's label and a year of mentorship.[55][56]\n\n\nFrom 1999 to 2003, he owned Phillips de Pury & Company, an art auction house, and bought out the first French auctioneer, Tajan.[57][58] In 2006, Arnault started the building project of the Louis Vuitton Foundation. Dedicated to the creation and contemporary art, the building was designed by the architect Frank Gehry.[59] The Foundation's grand opening at the Jardin d'Acclimatation Paris was held on 20 October 2014.[60]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
