The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5 m (11 ft),[33] which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft). An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.[41] On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 ft).[42][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Chinese plan for a rail tunnel under Mount Everest\n* Everesting\n* The Himalayan Database\n* List of deaths on eight-thousanders\n* List of elevation extremes by country\n* List of Mount Everest death statistics\n* List of Mount Everest summiters by number of times to the summit\n* List of Mount Everest records\n* List of people who died climbing Mount Everest\n* List of ski descents of Eight-Thousanders\n* List of tallest mountains in the Solar System\n* Mount Everest in popular culture\n* Mount Hood climbing accidents\n* Mukhiyapatti Musharniya, the lowest point of Nepal\n* Qomolangma National Park\n* Rongbuk Glacier\n* Sagarmatha National Park\n* Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nEight-thousanders (and major subsidiary peaks)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Everest\n\t+ South Summit\n* K2\n* Kangchenjunga\n* Lhotse\n\t+ Lhotse Middle\n\t+ Lhotse Shar\n* Makalu\n* Cho Oyu\n* Dhaulagiri\n* Manaslu\n* Nanga Parbat\n* Annapurna I\n\t+ Annapurna I East\n\t+ Annapurna I Middle Peak\n* Gasherbrum I\n* Broad Peak\n* Gasherbrum II\n* Shishapangma\n |\n| * List of ski descents of eight-thousanders\n* List of climbers summiting all eight-thousanders\n* List of deaths on eight-thousanders\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Stegman, Charles E; Bellhouse, David; Ehrenberg, A.S.

Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see § 21st-century surveys) surveys.[38]\n\n\nIn 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**This article contains Tibetan script.** Without proper rendering support, you may see very small fonts, misplaced vowels or missing conjuncts instead of Tibetan characters.\n\n![](image)North Face as seen from the path to North Base Camp\n![](image)Everest and Lhotse from the south.

The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point.[2] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m (29,031 ft 8+1⁄2 in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNearby peaks include Lhotse, 8,516 m (27,940 ft); Nuptse, 7,855 m (25,771 ft), and Changtse, 7,580 m (24,870 ft) among others. Another nearby peak is Khumbutse, and many of the highest mountains in the world are near Mount Everest. On the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the Khumbu icefall and glacier, an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouthern and northern climbing routes as seen from the International Space Station.

The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5 m (11 ft),[33] which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft). An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.[41] On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7 ft).[42][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Chinese plan for a rail tunnel under Mount Everest\n* Everesting\n* The Himalayan Database\n* List of deaths on eight-thousanders\n* List of elevation extremes by country\n* List of Mount Everest death statistics\n* List of Mount Everest summiters by number of times to the summit\n* List of Mount Everest records\n* List of people who died climbing Mount Everest\n* List of ski descents of Eight-Thousanders\n* List of tallest mountains in the Solar System\n* Mount Everest in popular culture\n* Mount Hood climbing accidents\n* Mukhiyapatti Musharniya, the lowest point of Nepal\n* Qomolangma National Park\n* Rongbuk Glacier\n* Sagarmatha National Park\n* Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nEight-thousanders (and major subsidiary peaks)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Everest\n\t+ South Summit\n* K2\n* Kangchenjunga\n* Lhotse\n\t+ Lhotse Middle\n\t+ Lhotse Shar\n* Makalu\n* Cho Oyu\n* Dhaulagiri\n* Manaslu\n* Nanga Parbat\n* Annapurna I\n\t+ Annapurna I East\n\t+ Annapurna I Middle Peak\n* Gasherbrum I\n* Broad Peak\n* Gasherbrum II\n* Shishapangma\n |\n| * List of ski descents of eight-thousanders\n* List of climbers summiting all eight-thousanders\n* List of deaths on eight-thousanders\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Stegman, Charles E; Bellhouse, David; Ehrenberg, A.S.

It stands over 3,000 metres (9,840 ft) above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) of horizontal distance. In most directions, it achieves over 2,800 metres (9,200 ft) of vertical relief in less than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft).[28]\n\n\nA 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain in the world.[29] A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by then the claim that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works.[30]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb, due in part to its more northern location, where inclement weather is more common.[12] The summit was reached for the first time by the Italian climbers Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni, on the 1954 Italian expedition led by Ardito Desio. As of February 2021[update], only 377 people have summited K2.[13] There have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs.\n\n\nMost ascents are made during July and August, typically the warmest times of the year.[14] But in January 2021, K2 became the final eight-thousander to be summited in the winter; the mountaineering feat was accomplished by a team of Nepalese climbers, led by Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa.[15][16]\n\n\nK2 has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges, but unlike other eight-thousanders, never from its eastern face.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nK2's height given on maps and encyclopedias is 8,611 metres (28,251 ft). In the summer of 2014, a Pakistani-Italian expedition to K2, named \"K2 60 Years Later\", was organized to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of K2. One of the goals of the expedition was to accurately measure the height of the mountain using satellite navigation.

It stands over 3,000 metres (9,840 ft) above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over 3,200 metres (10,500 ft) above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) of horizontal distance. In most directions, it achieves over 2,800 metres (9,200 ft) of vertical relief in less than 4,000 metres (13,000 ft).[28]\n\n\nA 1986 expedition led by George Wallerstein made an inaccurate measurement showing that K2 was taller than Mount Everest, and therefore the tallest mountain in the world.[29] A corrected measurement was made in 1987, but by then the claim that K2 was the tallest mountain in the world had already made it into many news reports and reference works.[30]\n\n\n\n## Height[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb, due in part to its more northern location, where inclement weather is more common.[12] The summit was reached for the first time by the Italian climbers Lino Lacedelli and Achille Compagnoni, on the 1954 Italian expedition led by Ardito Desio. As of February 2021[update], only 377 people have summited K2.[13] There have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs.\n\n\nMost ascents are made during July and August, typically the warmest times of the year.[14] But in January 2021, K2 became the final eight-thousander to be summited in the winter; the mountaineering feat was accomplished by a team of Nepalese climbers, led by Nirmal Purja and Mingma Gyalje Sherpa.[15][16]\n\n\nK2 has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges, but unlike other eight-thousanders, never from its eastern face.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nK2's height given on maps and encyclopedias is 8,611 metres (28,251 ft).

Previously, K2 had only been summited by individual Pakistanis as part of international expeditions.[69] Another team, consisting of Pasang Lhamu Sherpa Akita, Maya Sherpa, and Dawa Yangzum Sherpa, became the first Nepali women to climb K2.[70]\nOn 27 July 2014, Garrett Madison led a team of three American climbers and six Sherpas to summit K2.[71][72]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**K2**, at 8,611 metres (28,251 ft) above sea level, is the second-highest mountain on Earth, after Mount Everest at 8,849 metres (29,032 ft).[3] It lies in the Karakoram range, partially in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and partially in the China-administered Trans-Karakoram Tract in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang.[4][5][6][a]\n\n\nK2 also became popularly known as the *Savage Mountain* after George Bell—a climber on the 1953 American expedition—told reporters, \"It's a savage mountain that tries to kill you.\"[7] Of the five highest mountains in the world, K2 is the deadliest; approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who reach the summit.[7][8] Also occasionally known as *Mount Godwin-Austen*,[9] other nicknames for K2 are *The King of Mountains* and *The Mountaineers' Mountain*,[10] as well as *The Mountain of Mountains* after prominent Italian climber Reinhold Messner titled his book about K2 the same.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)K2 from the east, photographed during the 1909 expedition\nThe next attempt on K2 was not made until 1938, when the First American Karakoram expedition led by Charles Houston made a reconnaissance of the mountain. They concluded that the Abruzzi Spur was the most practical route and reached a height of around 8,000 meters (26,000 ft) before turning back due to diminishing supplies and the threat of bad weather.[43][44]\n\n\nThe following year, the 1939 American expedition led by Fritz Wiessner came within 200 metres (660 ft) of the summit but ended in disaster when Dudley Wolfe, Pasang Kikuli, Pasang Kitar, and Pintso disappeared high on the mountain.[45][46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Messner, Reinhold. \"K2: Mountain of Mountains\". *Goodreads*.

This would eventually become part of the standard route, but was abandoned at the time due to its steepness and difficulty. After trying and failing to find a feasible alternative route on the West Ridge or the North East Ridge, the Duke declared that K2 would never be climbed, and the team switched its attention to Chogolisa, where the Duke came within 150 metres (490 ft) of the summit before being driven back by a storm.[42]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe K2 Gneiss was exposed as the entire K2-Broad Peak-Gasherbrum range experienced rapid uplift with which erosion rates have been unable to keep pace.[33][36]\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\n### Early attempts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The west face of K2 taken from the Savoia Glacier, on the 1909 expedition\nThe mountain was first surveyed by a British team in 1856. Team member Thomas Montgomerie designated the mountain \"K2\" for being the second peak of the Karakoram range. The other peaks were originally named K1, K3, K4, and K5, but were eventually renamed Masherbrum, Gasherbrum IV, Gasherbrum II, and Gasherbrum I, respectively.[37] In 1892, Martin Conway led a British expedition that reached \"Concordia\" on the Baltoro Glacier.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nK2\n |\n| --- |\n| Topography and landmarks | * K2\n* Bottleneck couloir\n* House's Chimney\n* The Black Pyramid\n* Gilkey Memorial\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Expeditions | * 1938 American\n* 1939 American\n* 1953 American\n* 1954 Italian\n\t+ controversy\n |\n| Disasters and fatalities | * 1986 K2 disaster\n* 1995 K2 disaster\n* 2008 K2 disaster\n* List of deaths on K2\n |\n| In media | * List of books about K2\n* *K2* (board game)\n* *K2* (film)\n* *K2: Siren of the Himalayas*\n* *The Summit* (2012 film)\n* *Vertical Limit*\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nSwenson, Steven J.
