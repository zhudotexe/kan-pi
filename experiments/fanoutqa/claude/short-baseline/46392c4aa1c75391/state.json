It is mainly a polar desert, with annual precipitation of over 200\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in) along the coast and far less inland. About 70% of the world's freshwater reserves are frozen in Antarctica, which, if melted, would raise global sea levels by almost 60 metres (200\u00a0ft). Antarctica holds the record for the lowest measured temperature on Earth, \u221289.2\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212128.6\u00a0\u00b0F). The coastal regions can reach temperatures over 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer. Native species of animals include mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Where vegetation occurs, it is mostly in the form of lichen or moss.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMost species in Antarctica seem to be the descendants of species that lived there millions of years ago. As such, they must have survived multiple glacial cycles. The species survived the periods of extremely cold climate in isolated warmer areas, such as those with geothermal heat or areas that remained ice-free throughout the colder climate.[115]\n\n\n\n### Animals\n\n[edit]\n\n![penguins with young](image)Emperor penguins with juveniles\nInvertebrate life of Antarctica includes species of microscopic mites such as *Alaskozetes antarcticus*, lice, nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, krill and springtails. The few terrestrial invertebrates are limited to the sub-Antarctic islands.[116] The flightless midge *Belgica antarctica*, the largest purely terrestrial animal in Antarctica, reaches 6\u00a0mm (1\u20444\u00a0in) in size.[117]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThroughout its history, Antarctica has seen a wide variety of plant life. In the Cretaceous, it was dominated by a fern-conifer ecosystem, which changed into a temperate rainforest by the end of that period. During the colder Neogene (17\u20132.5\u00a0Ma), a tundra ecosystem replaced the rainforests. The climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation to form.[130] A combination of freezing temperatures, poor soil quality, and a lack of moisture and sunlight inhibit plant growth, causing low species diversity and limited distribution. The flora largely consists of bryophytes (25 species of liverworts and 100 species of mosses). There are three species of flowering plants, all of which are found in the Antarctic Peninsula: *Deschampsia antarctica* (Antarctic hair grass), *Colobanthus quitensis* (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native *Poa annua* (annual bluegrass).[131]\n\n\n\n### Other organisms\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | * **Prehistoric supercontinents**Columbia\n* Gondwana\n* Kenorland\n* Laurasia\n* Nena\n* Pangaea\n* Pannotia\n* Rodinia\n* Ur\n* Vaalbara\n | * **Other prehistoric continents**Amazonia\n* Arctica\n* Asiamerica\n* Atlantica\n* Avalonia\n* Baltica\n* Chilenia\n* Cimmeria\n* Congo Craton\n* Cuyania\n* East Antarctica\n* Euramerica\n* Kalaharia\n* Kazakhstania\n* Laramidia\n* Laurentia\n* North China\n* Pampia\n* Sahul\n* Siberia\n* South China\n |\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | * **Submerged continent/lands and microcontinents**Beringia\n* Cathaysia\n* Doggerland\n* Great Australian Bight\n* Jan Mayen\n* Kerguelen Plateau\n* Madagascar\n* Mauritia\n* Sahul\n* Seychelles\n* Sunda\n* Zealandia\n | * **Possible future supercontinents**Amasia\n* Aurica\n* Novopangaea\n* Pangaea Proxima\n | * **Mythical, lost, and hypothesised continents**Atlantis\n* Hyperborea\n* Kumari Kandam\n* Lemuria\n* Meropis\n* Mu\n* *Terra Australis*\n | * **Subcontinents**Alaska\n* Arabia\n* Central America\n* Eastern Africa\n* Eastern Siberia\n* Greenland\n* Indian Subcontinent\n |\n |\n\n |\n| * See also: **![](image) World portal**\n* Regions of the world\n* Continental fragment\n* ![](image) Category\n* Chronology of continents\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ![](image)Africa\n | ![](image)Antarctica\n | ![](image)Asia\n | ![](image)Australia\n | ![](image)Europe\n | ![](image)North America\n | ![](image)South America\n |\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ![](image)Afro-Eurasia\n | ![](image)Americas\n | ![](image)Eurasia\n | ![](image)Oceania\n |\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAntarctica is a polar desert with little precipitation; the continent receives an average equivalent to about 150\u00a0mm (6\u00a0in) of water per year, mostly in the form of snow. The interior is dryer and receives less than 50\u00a0mm (2\u00a0in) per year, whereas the coastal regions typically receive more than 200\u00a0mm (8\u00a0in).[71] In a few blue-ice areas, the wind and sublimation remove more snow than is accumulated by precipitation.[72] In the dry valleys, the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a barren and desiccated landscape.[73] Antarctica is colder than the Arctic region, as much of Antarctica is over 3,000\u00a0m (9,800\u00a0ft) above sea level, where air temperatures are colder. The relative warmth of the Arctic Ocean is transferred through the Arctic sea ice and moderates temperatures in the Arctic region.[74]\n\n\n\n### Regional differences\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** Chung, Eui-Seok; Kim, Seong-Joong; Timmermann, Axel; Ha, Kyung-Ja; et\u00a0al.

Antarctica covers more than 14.2\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (5,500,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), making it the fifth-largest continent, slightly less than 1.5\u00a0times the area of the United States. Its coastline is almost 18,000\u00a0km (11,200\u00a0mi) long:[1] as of 1983[update], of the four coastal types, 44% of the coast is floating ice in the form of an ice shelf, 38% consists of ice walls that rest on rock, 13% is ice streams or the edge of glaciers, and the remaining 5% is exposed rock.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nContinent\n\nThis article is about the continent.

It covers 50\u00a0million\u00a0km2 (19\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and completely surrounds the Antarctic continent. All commercial whaling is banned in the zone, though Japan has continued to hunt whales in the area, ostensibly for research purposes.[145]\n\n\nDespite these protections, the biodiversity in Antarctica is still at risk from human activities. Specially protected areas cover less than 2% of the area and provide better protection for animals with popular appeal than for less visible animals.[139] There are more terrestrial protected areas than marine protected areas.[146] Ecosystems are impacted by local and global threats, notably pollution, the invasion of non-native species, and the various effects of climate change.[139]\n\n\n\n## History of exploration\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOf the 700 species of algae in Antarctica, around half are marine phytoplankton. Multicoloured snow algae are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer.[132] Bacteria have been found as deep as 800\u00a0m (0.50\u00a0mi) under the ice.[133] It is thought to be likely that there exists a native bacterial community within the subterranean water body of Lake Vostok.[134] The existence of life there is thought to strengthen the argument for the possibility of life on Jupiter's moon Europa, which may have water beneath its water-ice crust.[135] There exists a community of extremophile bacteria in the highly alkaline waters of Lake Untersee.[136][137] The prevalence of highly resilient creatures in such inhospitable areas could further bolster the argument for extraterrestrial life in cold, methane-rich environments.[138]\n\n\n\n### Conservation and environmental protection\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Cantrill, David J.; Poole, Imogen (2012). *The Vegetation of Antarctica through Geological Time*.

Because of its qualities of endurance and speed, the dromedary is the favourite animal used by nomads.\n\n\nHuman activities are more likely to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water (oases) or where water comes close to the surface. Here, the local pressure on natural resources can be intense. The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation. In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers. These schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization.\n\n\nResearchers from Hacettepe University have reported that Saharan soil may have bio-available iron and also some essential macro and micro nutrient elements suitable for use as fertilizer for growing wheat.[58]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** \"Saharan halophytics\". *Terrestrial Ecoregions*.

Plants such as acacia trees, palms, succulents, spiny shrubs, and grasses have adapted to the arid conditions, by growing lower to avoid water loss by strong winds, by storing water in their thick stems to use it in dry periods, by having long roots that travel horizontally to reach the maximum area of water and to find any surface moisture, and by having small thick leaves or needles to prevent water loss by evapotranspiration. Plant leaves may dry out totally and then recover.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The Sahara desert ecoregion covers the hyper-arid central portion of the Sahara where rainfall is minimal and sporadic. Vegetation is rare, and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes (*erg, chech, raoui*), stone plateaus (*hamadas*), gravel plains (*reg*), dry valleys (*wadis*), and salt flats. It covers 4,639,900 square kilometres (1,791,500\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of: Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Sudan.[12]\n* The South Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion is a narrow band running east and west between the hyper-arid Sahara and the Sahel savannas to the south. Movements of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) bring summer rains during July and August which average 100 to 200\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) but vary greatly from year to year. These rains sustain summer pastures of grasses and herbs, with dry woodlands and shrublands along seasonal watercourses. This ecoregion covers 1,101,700 square kilometres (425,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Algeria, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Sudan.[46]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Cook, Kerry H.; Vizy, Edward K.

There are also small desert crocodiles in Mauritania and the Ennedi Plateau of Chad.[56]\n\n\nThe deathstalker scorpion can be 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) long. Its venom contains large amounts of agitoxin and scyllatoxin and is very dangerous; however, a sting from this scorpion rarely kills a healthy adult.
