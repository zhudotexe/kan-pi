In May 1884 Koechlin, working at his home, made an outline drawing of their scheme, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".[23] Initially Eiffel showed little enthusiasm, although he did sanction further study of the project, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre to add architectural embellishments. Sauvestre added the decorative arches to the base, a glass pavilion to the first level and the cupola at the top. The enhanced idea gained Eiffel's support for the project, and he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier and Sauvestre had taken out. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1886 Eiffel also designed the dome for the Astronomical Observatory in Nice. This was the most important building in a complex designed by Charles Garnier, later among the most prominent critics of the Tower. The dome, with a diameter of 22.4 m (73 ft), was the largest in the world when built and used an ingenious bearing device: rather than running on wheels or rollers, it was supported by a ring-shaped hollow girder floating in a circular trough containing a solution of magnesium chloride in water. This had been patented by Eiffel in 1881.\n\n\n\n### The Eiffel Tower\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Eiffel Tower\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Mercado Adolpho Lisboa, Manaus, Brazil (1883)[43]\n* Basilica of San Sebastian, Manila, Philippines (1891)\n* Malleco Viaduct, Chile (1890)\n* Estación Central (railway station) Santiago, Chile, (1897)[44]\n* Dam on Great Bačka Canal, Bečej, Serbia (1900)\n* Santa Justa Lift (Carmo Lift), in Lisbon, Portugal (1901)\n* Santa Efigênia Viaduct, São Paulo, Brazil (1913)\n* La Paz Train Station, La Paz, Bolivia (now La Paz Bus Station) (1917) - different style than the Eiffel's and built more than 20 years after he left the company and construction business\n* \"Vuelta al Mundo\", Córdoba, Argentina\n* Puente de hierro sobre el río Conlara, Tilquicho, Córdoba, Argentina\n* Watermill, Villa Dolores, Córdoba, Argentina\n* Casa del Cura (also called Casa Eiffel), in Ulea, Spain (1912)\n* Palácio de Ferro (Iron Palace), Angola\n* Shunting Station, Novi Sad, Serbia (1921)[45]\n\n\n### Unrealized projects\n\n[edit]\n\n* Trinity Bridge, Saint Petersburg—Eiffel entered a project into the contest, but his project was not realized.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Alexandre Gustave Eiffel** (/ˈaɪfəl/ *EYE-fəl*, French: [alɛksɑ̃dʁ ɡystav ɛfɛl]; né **Bonickhausen dit Eiffel**;[5] 15 December 1832 – 27 December 1923) was a French civil engineer. A graduate of École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, he made his name with various bridges for the French railway network, most famously the Garabit Viaduct. He is best known for the world-famous Eiffel Tower, designed by his company and built for the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris, and his contribution to building the Statue of Liberty in New York. After his retirement from engineering, Eiffel focused on research into meteorology and aerodynamics, making significant contributions in both fields.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nStatue of Liberty\n |\n| --- |\n| *Liberty Enlightening the World*\n |\n| Creators | * Édouard René de Laboulaye, originator\n* Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, sculptor\n* Gustave Eiffel, builder\n\t+ company\n* Eugène Secrétan, donated copper\n* Richard Morris Hunt, pedestal\n* Joseph Pulitzer, pedestal funding\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Engineers | * Eugène Viollet-le-Duc\n* Maurice Koechlin\n* Joachim Giæver\n |\n| Location | * Liberty Island\n\t+ Statue of Liberty National Monument\n\n\n* Original torch: Statue of Liberty Museum\n\n\n* Original statue: Musée des Arts et Métiers\n |\n| Formerlocations | * Right arm and torch: Centennial Exposition (1876)\n* Madison Square Park (1876–1882)\n\n\n* Head: Paris World's Fair (1878)\n |\n| Replicas | * United States: Las Vegas\n* Strengthen the Arm of Liberty\n\t+ Austin, Texas\n\t+ Fayetteville, Arkansas\n\t+ Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n\t+ Overland Park, Kansas\n\t+ Pine Bluff, Arkansas\n\t+ Seattle\n\n\n* France: Île aux Cygnes, Paris\n* *Flame of Liberty*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Interior structural elements of the Statue of Liberty designed by Gustave Eiffel\nThe same year Eiffel started work on a system of standardised prefabricated bridges, an idea that was the result of a conversation with the governor of Cochin-China. These used a small number of standard components, all small enough to be readily transportable in areas with poor or non-existent roads, and were joined using bolts rather than rivets, reducing the need for skilled labour on site. A number of different types were produced, ranging from footbridges to standard-gauge railway bridges.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884, and on 30 March 1885 Eiffel read a paper on the project to the Société des Ingénieurs Civils. After discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying that the tower would symbolise[24]\n\n\n> \"not only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.\"\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Edward Moran's 1886 painting, *The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World*, depicts the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty.\nGustave Eiffel's career was a result of the Industrial Revolution. For a variety of economic and political reasons, this had been slow to make an impact in France,[40] and Eiffel had the good fortune to be working at a time of rapid industrial development in France. Eiffel's importance as an engineer was twofold. Firstly he was ready to adopt innovative techniques first used by others, such as his use of compressed-air caissons and hollow cast-iron piers, and secondly he was a pioneer in his insistence on basing all engineering decisions on thorough calculation of the forces involved, combining this analytical approach with an insistence on a high standard of accuracy in drawing and manufacture.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Heritage protection efforts\n\n[edit]\n\nA number of works of Gustave Eiffel are in danger today. Some have already been destroyed, like in Vietnam.\nA proposal to demolish the railway bridge of Bordeaux (also known as the \"passerelle St Jean\"), the first major work of Gustave Eiffel, resulted in a large response from the public. Actions to protect the bridge were taken as early as 2002 by the \"Association of the Descendants of Gustave Eiffel\",[46] joined from 2005 onwards by the Association \"Sauvons la Passerelle Eiffel\" (*Save the Eiffel Bridge*). They led, in 2010, to the decision to list Eiffel's Bordeaux bridge as a French Historical Monument.[47]\n\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1881 Eiffel was contacted by Auguste Bartholdi who was in need of an engineer to help him to realise the Statue of Liberty. Some work had already been carried out by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, but he had died in 1879. Eiffel was selected because of his experience with wind stresses. Eiffel devised a structure consisting of a four legged pylon to support the copper sheeting which made up the body of the statue. The entire statue was erected at the Eiffel works in Paris before being dismantled and shipped to the United States.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis was less than a quarter of the estimated cost of six and a half million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation during the exhibition and for the following twenty years.[25] Eiffel later established a separate company to manage the tower.\n\n\n\nThe tower had been a subject of some controversy, attracting criticism both from those who did not believe it feasible and from those who objected on artistic grounds. Just as work began at the Champ de Mars, the \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the French arts establishment, including Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet: a petition was sent to Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, the Minister of Works, and was published by *Le Temps*.[26] \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** État-civil de la Côte-d'Or, Dijon, Registres d'état civil 1832, p. 249\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Harvie 2006 p. 1\n3. **^** Charles Braibant, Histoire de la Tour Eiffel, Paris 1964, p. 35\n4. **^** Harvie 2006 p. 124\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gobillot, Emmanuel (15 September 2016). *Follow the Leader*.

Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from *Le Figaro* and *Le Monde Illustré* completed the climb. At 2.35 Eiffel hoisted a large tricolour, to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level.[30]\n\n\n\n### The Panama Scandal\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Caricature of Eiffel, published 1887 in *Le Temps* at the time of \"The Artist's Protest\"\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg but the other two, being closer to the river Seine were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[27] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a limestone block, each with an inclined top to bear the supporting shoe for the ironwork. These shoes were anchored by bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Eiffel in 1910\nAfter his retirement from the Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel, Eiffel went on to do important work in meteorology and aerodynamics.[37] Eiffel's interest in these areas was a consequence of the problems he had encountered with the effects of wind forces on the structures he had built.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \"To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream.

A budget for the Exposition was passed and on 1 May Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition which was being held for a centerpiece for the exposition, which effectively made the choice of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion: all entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars. On 12 May a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals and on 12 June it presented its decision, which was that only Eiffel's proposal met their requirements. After some debate about the exact site for the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him one and a half million francs toward the construction costs. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01MeThZa3zuJnF7JKpfK7fjC","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

This had been patented by Eiffel in 1881.\n\n\n\n### The Eiffel Tower\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Eiffel Tower\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Mercado Adolpho Lisboa, Manaus, Brazil (1883)[43]\n* Basilica of San Sebastian, Manila, Philippines (1891)\n* Malleco Viaduct, Chile (1890)\n* Estación Central (railway station) Santiago, Chile, (1897)[44]\n* Dam on Great Bačka Canal, Bečej, Serbia (1900)\n* Santa Justa Lift (Carmo Lift), in Lisbon, Portugal (1901)\n* Santa Efigênia Viaduct, São Paulo, Brazil (1913)\n* La Paz Train Station, La Paz, Bolivia (now La Paz Bus Station) (1917) - different style than the Eiffel's and built more than 20 years after he left the company and construction business\n* \"Vuelta al Mundo\", Córdoba, Argentina\n* Puente de hierro sobre el río Conlara, Tilquicho, Córdoba, Argentina\n* Watermill, Villa Dolores, Córdoba, Argentina\n* Casa del Cura (also called Casa Eiffel), in Ulea, Spain (1912)\n* Palácio de Ferro (Iron Palace), Angola\n* Shunting Station, Novi Sad, Serbia (1921)[45]\n\n\n### Unrealized projects\n\n[edit]\n\n* Trinity Bridge, Saint Petersburg—Eiffel entered a project into the contest, but his project was not realized.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Alexandre Gustave Eiffel** (/ˈaɪfəl/ *EYE-fəl*, French: [alɛksɑ̃dʁ ɡystav ɛfɛl]; né **Bonickhausen dit Eiffel**;[5] 15 December 1832 – 27 December 1923) was a French civil engineer. A graduate of École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, he made his name with various bridges for the French railway network, most famously the Garabit Viaduct. He is best known for the world-famous Eiffel Tower, designed by his company and built for the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris, and his contribution to building the Statue of Liberty in New York. After his retirement from engineering, Eiffel focused on research into meteorology and aerodynamics, making significant contributions in both fields.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nStatue of Liberty\n |\n| --- |\n| *Liberty Enlightening the World*\n |\n| Creators | * Édouard René de Laboulaye, originator\n* Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, sculptor\n* Gustave Eiffel, builder\n\t+ company\n* Eugène Secrétan, donated copper\n* Richard Morris Hunt, pedestal\n* Joseph Pulitzer, pedestal funding\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Engineers | * Eugène Viollet-le-Duc\n* Maurice Koechlin\n* Joachim Giæver\n |\n| Location | * Liberty Island\n\t+ Statue of Liberty National Monument\n\n\n* Original torch: Statue of Liberty Museum\n\n\n* Original statue: Musée des Arts et Métiers\n |\n| Formerlocations | * Right arm and torch: Centennial Exposition (1876)\n* Madison Square Park (1876–1882)\n\n\n* Head: Paris World's Fair (1878)\n |\n| Replicas | * United States: Las Vegas\n* Strengthen the Arm of Liberty\n\t+ Austin, Texas\n\t+ Fayetteville, Arkansas\n\t+ Oklahoma City, Oklahoma\n\t+ Overland Park, Kansas\n\t+ Pine Bluff, Arkansas\n\t+ Seattle\n\n\n* France: Île aux Cygnes, Paris\n* *Flame of Liberty*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Interior structural elements of the Statue of Liberty designed by Gustave Eiffel\nThe same year Eiffel started work on a system of standardised prefabricated bridges, an idea that was the result of a conversation with the governor of Cochin-China. These used a small number of standard components, all small enough to be readily transportable in areas with poor or non-existent roads, and were joined using bolts rather than rivets, reducing the need for skilled labour on site. A number of different types were produced, ranging from footbridges to standard-gauge railway bridges.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884, and on 30 March 1885 Eiffel read a paper on the project to the Société des Ingénieurs Civils. After discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying that the tower would symbolise[24]\n\n\n> \"not only the art of the modern engineer, but also the century of Industry and Science in which we are living, and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the Revolution of 1789, to which this monument will be built as an expression of France's gratitude.\"\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Edward Moran's 1886 painting, *The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World*, depicts the unveiling of the Statue of Liberty.\nGustave Eiffel's career was a result of the Industrial Revolution. For a variety of economic and political reasons, this had been slow to make an impact in France,[40] and Eiffel had the good fortune to be working at a time of rapid industrial development in France. Eiffel's importance as an engineer was twofold. Firstly he was ready to adopt innovative techniques first used by others, such as his use of compressed-air caissons and hollow cast-iron piers, and secondly he was a pioneer in his insistence on basing all engineering decisions on thorough calculation of the forces involved, combining this analytical approach with an insistence on a high standard of accuracy in drawing and manufacture.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Heritage protection efforts\n\n[edit]\n\nA number of works of Gustave Eiffel are in danger today. Some have already been destroyed, like in Vietnam.\nA proposal to demolish the railway bridge of Bordeaux (also known as the \"passerelle St Jean\"), the first major work of Gustave Eiffel, resulted in a large response from the public. Actions to protect the bridge were taken as early as 2002 by the \"Association of the Descendants of Gustave Eiffel\",[46] joined from 2005 onwards by the Association \"Sauvons la Passerelle Eiffel\" (*Save the Eiffel Bridge*). They led, in 2010, to the decision to list Eiffel's Bordeaux bridge as a French Historical Monument.[47]\n\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1881 Eiffel was contacted by Auguste Bartholdi who was in need of an engineer to help him to realise the Statue of Liberty. Some work had already been carried out by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, but he had died in 1879. Eiffel was selected because of his experience with wind stresses. Eiffel devised a structure consisting of a four legged pylon to support the copper sheeting which made up the body of the statue. The entire statue was erected at the Eiffel works in Paris before being dismantled and shipped to the United States.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis was less than a quarter of the estimated cost of six and a half million francs. Eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation during the exhibition and for the following twenty years.[25] Eiffel later established a separate company to manage the tower.\n\n\n\nThe tower had been a subject of some controversy, attracting criticism both from those who did not believe it feasible and from those who objected on artistic grounds. Just as work began at the Champ de Mars, the \"Committee of Three Hundred\" (one member for each metre of the tower's height) was formed, led by Charles Garnier and including some of the most important figures of the French arts establishment, including Adolphe Bouguereau, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Gounod and Jules Massenet: a petition was sent to Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, the Minister of Works, and was published by *Le Temps*.[26] \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** État-civil de la Côte-d'Or, Dijon, Registres d'état civil 1832, p. 249\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Harvie 2006 p. 1\n3. **^** Charles Braibant, Histoire de la Tour Eiffel, Paris 1964, p. 35\n4. **^** Harvie 2006 p. 124\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gobillot, Emmanuel (15 September 2016). *Follow the Leader*.

Since the lifts were not yet in operation, the ascent was made by foot, and took over an hour, Eiffel frequently stopping to make explanations of various features. Most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels, but a few, including Nouguier, Compagnon, the President of the City Council and reporters from *Le Figaro* and *Le Monde Illustré* completed the climb. At 2.35 Eiffel hoisted a large tricolour, to the accompaniment of a 25-gun salute fired from the lower level.[30]\n\n\n\n### The Panama Scandal\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Caricature of Eiffel, published 1887 in *Le Temps* at the time of \"The Artist's Protest\"\nWork on the foundations started on 28 January 1887. Those for the east and south legs were straightforward, each leg resting on four 2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of each leg but the other two, being closer to the river Seine were more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[27] to support the concrete slabs, which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a limestone block, each with an inclined top to bear the supporting shoe for the ironwork. These shoes were anchored by bolts 10 cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Eiffel in 1910\nAfter his retirement from the Compagnie des Etablissements Eiffel, Eiffel went on to do important work in meteorology and aerodynamics.[37] Eiffel's interest in these areas was a consequence of the problems he had encountered with the effects of wind forces on the structures he had built.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \"To bring our arguments home, imagine for a moment a giddy, ridiculous tower dominating Paris like a gigantic black smokestack, crushing under its barbaric bulk Notre Dame, the Tour Saint-Jacques, the Louvre, the Dome of les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe, all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream. And for twenty years ... we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal\"\n> \n> \n\n\n* ![18 July 1887](image)\n\n18 July 1887\n* ![7 December 1887](image)\n\n7 December 1887\n* ![20 March 1888](image)\n\n20 March 1888\n* ![15 May 1888](image)\n\n15 May 1888\n* ![21 August 1888](image)\n\n21 August 1888\n* ![26 December 1888](image)\n\n26 December 1888\n* ![March 1889](image)\n\nMarch 1889\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLittle happened until the beginning of 1886, but with the re-election of Jules Grévy as president and his appointment of Edouard Lockroy as Minister for Trade decisions began to be made. A budget for the Exposition was passed and on 1 May Lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition which was being held for a centerpiece for the exposition, which effectively made the choice of Eiffel's design a foregone conclusion: all entries had to include a study for a 300 m (980 ft) four-sided metal tower on the Champ de Mars. On 12 May a commission was set up to examine Eiffel's scheme and its rivals and on 12 June it presented its decision, which was that only Eiffel's proposal met their requirements. After some debate about the exact site for the tower, a contract was signed on 8 January 1887. This was signed by Eiffel acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company, and granted him one and a half million francs toward the construction costs. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01MeThZa3zuJnF7JKpfK7fjC","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In 1957, he won an international design competition for his design of the Sydney Opera House in Australia. Utzon's revised design, which he completed in 1961, was the basis for the landmark, although it was not completed until 1973.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"Utzon Center\" Archived 24 June 2011 at the Wayback Machine.

Emory Kemp's consulting career began at Ove Arup, where, he conducted analytical calculations for the roof, noting this was no simple task, as Utzon's sketches were designed to embellish the beauty of the international landmark, not necessarily for simple mathematics.[15] Concerned that delays would lead to lack of public support, the Cahill government of New South Wales nonetheless gave the go-ahead for work to begin in 1958. The British engineering consultancy Ove Arup and Partners put out tenders without adequate working drawings and construction work began on 2 March 1959. As a result, the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof and had to be rebuilt. The situation was complicated by Cahill's death in October 1959.[12][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe extraordinary structure of the shells themselves represented a puzzle for the engineers. This was not resolved until 1961, when Utzon himself finally came up with the solution. He replaced the original elliptical shells with a design based on complex sections of a sphere. Utzon says his design was inspired by the simple act of peeling an orange: the 14 shells of the building, if combined, would form a perfect sphere.[9]\n\n\nAlthough Utzon had spectacular, innovative plans for the interior of these halls, he was unable to realise this part of his design. In mid-1965, the New South Wales Liberal government of Robert Askin was elected. Askin had been a 'vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office.'[17] His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic.

In 1957, he won an international design competition for his design of the Sydney Opera House in Australia. Utzon's revised design, which he completed in 1961, was the basis for the landmark, although it was not completed until 1973.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"Utzon Center\" Archived 24 June 2011 at the Wayback Machine.

Emory Kemp's consulting career began at Ove Arup, where, he conducted analytical calculations for the roof, noting this was no simple task, as Utzon's sketches were designed to embellish the beauty of the international landmark, not necessarily for simple mathematics.[15] Concerned that delays would lead to lack of public support, the Cahill government of New South Wales nonetheless gave the go-ahead for work to begin in 1958. The British engineering consultancy Ove Arup and Partners put out tenders without adequate working drawings and construction work began on 2 March 1959. As a result, the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof and had to be rebuilt. The situation was complicated by Cahill's death in October 1959.[12][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe extraordinary structure of the shells themselves represented a puzzle for the engineers. This was not resolved until 1961, when Utzon himself finally came up with the solution. He replaced the original elliptical shells with a design based on complex sections of a sphere. Utzon says his design was inspired by the simple act of peeling an orange: the 14 shells of the building, if combined, would form a perfect sphere.[9]\n\n\nAlthough Utzon had spectacular, innovative plans for the interior of these halls, he was unable to realise this part of his design. In mid-1965, the New South Wales Liberal government of Robert Askin was elected. Askin had been a 'vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office.'[17] His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic.
