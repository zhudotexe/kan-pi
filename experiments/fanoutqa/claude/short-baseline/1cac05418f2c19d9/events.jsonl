The first official census took place in 1872. From that year, every 8 years (with some exceptions) the population is counted. The Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica has postponed the next census until 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n\nBrazil is the seventh most populated country in the world.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **1550** – 15,000\n* **1600** – 100,000\n* **1660** – 184,000\n* **1700** – 300,000\n* **1766** – 1,500,000\n* **1800** – 3,250,000\n* **1820** – 4,717,000\n* **1850** – 7,256,000\n* **1872** – 9,930,478\n* **1890** – 14,333,915\n* **1900** – 17,438,434\n* **1920** – 30,635,605\n* **1940** – 41,236,315\n* **1950** – 51,944,397\n* **1960** – 70,119,071\n* **1970** – 93,139,037\n* **1980** – 119,070,865\n* **1991** – 146,917,459\n* **1996** – 157,079,573\n* **2000** – 169,544,443\n* **2010** – 192,755,799[11]\n* **2022** – 203,062,512[12]\n\n\n![](image)Map of Brazilian states by population\nPopulation distribution in Brazil is very uneven. The majority of Brazilians live within 300 km (190 mi) of the coast, while the interior in the Amazon Basin is highly remote.
