The maximum recorded weight was 190 tonnes for a specimen measuring 27.6 metres (91 ft), whereas longer ones, up to 33.6 metres (110 ft), have been recorded but not weighed.[1][2][3] It is estimated, this individual could have a mass of 250 tonnes.[4][5] The longest non-colonial animal is the lion's mane jellyfish (36.6m / 120 ft).[6]\n\n\nIn 2023, paleontologists estimated that the extinct whale *Perucetus*, discovered in Peru, may have outweighed the blue whale, with a mass of 85-340 t (84-335 long tons; 94-375 short tonnes.)[7] While controversial, estimates for the weight of the sauropod *Bruhathkayosaurus* suggest it was around 110-170 tons, with the highest estimate being 240 tons, if scaled with *Patagotitan*, although actual fossil remains no longer exist, and that estimation is based on described dimensions in 1987.[8] The upper estimates of weight for these two prehistoric animals would have easily rivaled or exceeded the blue whale. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest land mammal extant today is the African bush elephant.

At the highest estimates, this would make *Perucetus* the heaviest known animal in history.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInsects, a class of Arthropoda, are easily the most numerous class of organisms, with over one million identified species, and probably many undescribed species. The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of beetle, which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms. Although heavyweight giant wetas (*Deinacrida heteracantha*) are known, the elephant beetles of Central and South America, (*Megasoma elephas*) and (*M. actaeon*), the Titan beetle (*Titanus giganteus*) of the neotropical rainforest or the Goliath beetles, (*Goliathus goliatus*) and (*G. regius*), of Africa's rainforest are thought to reach a higher weight.[245] The most frequently crowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least 100 g (3.5 oz) and 11.5 cm (4.5 in).[1] The elephant beetles and titan beetle can reach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to 13.1 and 15.2 cm (5.2 and 6.0 in), respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 11 | Aldabra giant tortoise | 205 (450)[103] | 360 (790)[1] | 1.4 (4.6)[104] |\n| 12 | Loggerhead sea turtle | 200 (441)[*citation needed*] | 545 (1,202)[*citation needed*] | 0.95 (3.2)[104] |\n| 13 | Green sea turtle | 190 (418.9)[105] | 395 (870.8)[82] | 1.12 (3.67)[82] |\n| 14 | Slender-snouted crocodile | 180 (400)[106] | 325 (720)[106] | 3.3 (10.8)[106] |\n| 15 | Galapagos tortoise | 175 (390)[107] | 417 (919)[108] | 1.5 (4.9)[109] |\n\n\n### Dinosaurs (Dinosauria)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dinosaur size\n\nSee also: Largest prehistoric animals\n\n![](image)*Bruhathkayosaurus matleyi*, potentially the largest animal to have walked the earth.\n![](image)A human and the longest known dinosaurs of the five major clades.

The maximum recorded weight was 190 tonnes for a specimen measuring 27.6 metres (91 ft), whereas longer ones, up to 33.6 metres (110 ft), have been recorded but not weighed.[1][2][3] It is estimated, this individual could have a mass of 250 tonnes.[4][5] The longest non-colonial animal is the lion's mane jellyfish (36.6m / 120 ft).[6]\n\n\nIn 2023, paleontologists estimated that the extinct whale *Perucetus*, discovered in Peru, may have outweighed the blue whale, with a mass of 85-340 t (84-335 long tons; 94-375 short tonnes.)[7] While controversial, estimates for the weight of the sauropod *Bruhathkayosaurus* suggest it was around 110-170 tons, with the highest estimate being 240 tons, if scaled with *Patagotitan*, although actual fossil remains no longer exist, and that estimation is based on described dimensions in 1987.[8] The upper estimates of weight for these two prehistoric animals would have easily rivaled or exceeded the blue whale. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest land mammal extant today is the African bush elephant.

The heaviest insect is almost certainly a species of beetle, which incidentally is the most species-rich order of organisms. Although heavyweight giant wetas (*Deinacrida heteracantha*) are known, the elephant beetles of Central and South America, (*Megasoma elephas*) and (*M. actaeon*), the Titan beetle (*Titanus giganteus*) of the neotropical rainforest or the Goliath beetles, (*Goliathus goliatus*) and (*G. regius*), of Africa's rainforest are thought to reach a higher weight.[245] The most frequently crowned are the Goliath beetles, the top known size of which is at least 100 g (3.5 oz) and 11.5 cm (4.5 in).[1] The elephant beetles and titan beetle can reach greater lengths than the Goliath, at up to 13.1 and 15.2 cm (5.2 and 6.0 in), respectively, but this is in part thanks to their rather large horns. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 11 | Aldabra giant tortoise | 205 (450)[103] | 360 (790)[1] | 1.4 (4.6)[104] |\n| 12 | Loggerhead sea turtle | 200 (441)[*citation needed*] | 545 (1,202)[*citation needed*] | 0.95 (3.2)[104] |\n| 13 | Green sea turtle | 190 (418.9)[105] | 395 (870.8)[82] | 1.12 (3.67)[82] |\n| 14 | Slender-snouted crocodile | 180 (400)[106] | 325 (720)[106] | 3.3 (10.8)[106] |\n| 15 | Galapagos tortoise | 175 (390)[107] | 417 (919)[108] | 1.5 (4.9)[109] |\n\n\n### Dinosaurs (Dinosauria)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dinosaur size\n\nSee also: Largest prehistoric animals\n\n![](image)*Bruhathkayosaurus matleyi*, potentially the largest animal to have walked the earth.\n![](image)A human and the longest known dinosaurs of the five major clades.
