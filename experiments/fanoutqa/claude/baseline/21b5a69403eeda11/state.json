The population of the city proper is the third largest in the world, with 24.89 million inhabitants in 2021, while the urban area is the most populous in China, with 39.3 million residents. As of 2018, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area was estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (nominal) of nearly 9.1 trillion RMB ($1.33 trillion). Shanghai is one of the world's major centers for finance, business and economics, research, science and technology, manufacturing, transportation, tourism, and culture, and the Port of Shanghai is the world's busiest container port.\n\n\nOriginally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to both domestic and foreign trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five treaty ports forced to open to European trade after the First Opium War. The Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the city was the site of the major Battle of Shanghai. After the war, with the CCP takeover of the mainland in 1949, trade was limited to other socialist countries and the city's global influence declined.\n\n\nBy the 1990s, economic reforms introduced by Deng Xiaoping a decade earlier resulted in an intense redevelopment of the city, especially the Pudong New Area, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance; it is the home of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world by market capitalization and the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone, the first free-trade zone in mainland China. Shanghai has been classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. As of 2022, it is home to 12 companies of the *Fortune* Global 500 and is ranked 4th on the Global Financial Centres Index. The city is also a global major center for research and development and home to many highly ranked Double First-Class Universities. The Shanghai Metro, first opened in 1993, is the largest metro network in the world by route length. \n\n\nShanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the booming economy of China. Featuring several architectural styles such as Art Deco and shikumen, the city is renowned for its Lujiazui skyline, museums and historic buildings including the City God Temple, Yu Garden, the China Pavilion and buildings along the Bund, which includes Oriental Pearl TV Tower. Shanghai is also known for its sugary cuisine, distinctive local language and vibrant international flair.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Shanghai |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)\"Shanghai\" in regular Chinese characters\n |\n| Chinese | \u4e0a\u6d77 |\n|  |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei |\n| Wu | Zaon22 he44\u24d8 |\n|  |\n| Postal | Shanghai |\n| Literal meaning | \"Upon the Sea\" |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei |\n| Bopomofo | \u3115\u3124\u02cb\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u310f\u311e\u02c7 |\n| Gwoyeu Romatzyh | Shanqhae |\n| Wade\u2013Giles | Shang4-hai3 |\n| IPA | [\u0282a\u0302\u014b.xa\u0300\u026a] \u24d8 |\n| Wu |\n| Romanization | Zaon22 he44\u24d8 |\n| ShanghaineseRomanization | Z\u00e5nhae |\n| Hakka |\n| Romanization | S\u00f4ng-h\u00f3i |\n| Yue: Cantonese |\n| Yale Romanization | Seuhngh\u00f3i |\n| Jyutping | Soeng6hoi2 |\n| IPA | [s\u0153\u02d0\u014b\u02e8.h\u0254\u02d0i\u02e7\u02e5] |\n| Southern Min |\n| Hokkien POJ | Si\u014dng-h\u00e1i |\n| Eastern Min |\n| Fuzhou BUC | Si\u00f4ng-h\u0101i |\n\n |\n|  |\n\nThe two Chinese characters in the city's name are \u4e0a (*sh\u00e0ng*/*zan*, \"upon\") and \u6d77 (*h\u01cei*/*hae*, \"sea\"), together meaning \"On the Sea\". The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century Song dynasty, when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the Tang dynasty, the area of modern-day Shanghai was under sea level, so the land appeared to be literally \"on the sea\".[20]\n\n\nShanghai is officially abbreviated \u6caa[b] (*H\u00f9*/*Vu*2) in Chinese, a contraction of \u6caa\u6e0e[c] (*H\u00f9 D\u00fa*/*Vu Doh*, \"Harpoon Ditch\"), a 4th- or 5th-century Jin name for the mouth of Suzhou Creek when it was the main conduit into the ocean.[23] This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.[24]\n\n\n\n### Alternative names[edit]\n\n\n\u7533 (*Sh\u0113n*) or \u7533\u57ce (*Sh\u0113nch\u00e9ng*, \"Shen City\") was an early name originating from Lord Chunshen, a 3rd-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the state of Chu, whose fief included modern Shanghai.[23] Shanghai-based sports teams and newspapers often use Shen in their names, such as Shanghai Shenhua and *Shen Bao*.\n\n\n\u534e\u4ead[d] (*Hu\u00e1t\u00edng*) was another early name for Shanghai. In AD\u00a0751 during the mid-Tang dynasty, Huating County was established by Zhao Juzhen, the governor of Wu Commandery, at modern-day Songjiang, the first county-level administration within modern-day Shanghai. The first five-star hotel in the city was named after Huating.[25]\n\n\n\u9b54\u90fd (*M\u00f3d\u016b*, \"Magical City\"), a contemporary nickname for Shanghai, is widely known among the youth.[26] The name was first mentioned in Sh\u014dfu Muramatsu's 1924 novel *Mato*, which portrayed Shanghai as a dichotomic city where both light and darkness existed.[27]\n\n\nThe city has various nicknames in English, including \"Pearl of the Orient\" and \"Paris of the East\".[28][29] This is similar to Ho Chi Minh City (also known as Saigon), in Vietnam, which has also been nicknamed as \"Paris of the Orient\", due to Vietnam's historical French status.[30]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Shanghai\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Shanghai.\n\n### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\nThe western part of modern-day Shanghai was inhabited 6000 years ago.[31] During the Spring and Autumn period (approximately 771 to 476 BC), it belonged to the Kingdom of Wu, which was conquered by the Kingdom of Yue, which in turn was conquered by the Kingdom of Chu.[32] During the Warring States period (475 BC), Shanghai was part of the fief of Lord Chunshen of Chu, one of the Four Lords of the Warring States. He ordered the excavation of the Huangpu River. Its former or poetic name, the Chunshen River, gave Shanghai its nickname of \"Sh\u0113n\".[32] Fishermen living in the Shanghai area then created a fish tool called the *h\u00f9*, which lent its name to the outlet of Suzhou Creek north of the Old City and became a common nickname and abbreviation for the city.[33]\n\n\n\n### Imperial era[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Tang and Song dynasties, Qinglong Town (\u9752\u9f99\u9547[e]) in modern Qingpu District was a major trading port. Established in 746 (the fifth year of the Tang Tianbao era), it developed into what was historically called a \"giant town of the Southeast\", with thirteen temples and seven pagodas. Mi Fu, a scholar and artist of the Song dynasty, served as its mayor. The port experienced thriving trade with provinces along the Yangtze and the Chinese coast, as well as with foreign countries such as Japan and Silla.[2] By the end of the Song dynasty, the center of trading had moved downstream of the Wusong River to Shanghai.[34] It was upgraded in status from a village to a market town in 1074, and in 1172, a second sea wall was built to stabilize the ocean coastline, supplementing an earlier dike.[35] From the Yuan dynasty in 1292 until Shanghai officially became a municipality in 1927, central Shanghai was administered as a county under Songjiang Prefecture, which had its seat in the present-day Songjiang District.[36]\n\n\n\n![](image)Seventeenth century map of the Old City of Shanghai\nTwo important events helped promote Shanghai's developments in the Ming dynasty. A city wall was built for the first time in 1554 to protect the town from raids by Japanese pirates. It measured 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) high and 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) in circumference.[37] A City God Temple was built in 1602 during the Wanli reign. This honor was usually reserved for prefectural capitals and not normally given to a mere county seat such as Shanghai. Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.[37]\n\n\nDuring the Qing dynasty, Shanghai became one of the most important sea ports in the Yangtze Delta region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the Kangxi Emperor reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels\u2014a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the Qianlong Emperor moved the customs office for Jiangsu province (\u6c5f\u6d77\u5173;[f] see Customs House, Shanghai) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade. As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.[38]\n\n\n\n* ![Songjiang Square Pagoda, built in the 11th century](image)\n\nSongjiang Square Pagoda, built in the 11th century\n* ![The Mahavira Hall at Zhenru Temple, built in 1320](image)\n\nThe Mahavira Hall at Zhenru Temple, built in 1320\n* ![The walled Old City of Shanghai in the 17th century](image)\n\nThe walled Old City of Shanghai in the 17th century\n\n\n### Rise and golden age[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of Shanghai in 1884; Chinese area are in yellow, French in red, British in blue, American in orange.\nIn the 19th century, international attention to Shanghai grew due to European recognition of its economic and trade potential at the Yangtze. During the First Opium War (1839\u20131842), British forces occupied the city.[39] The war ended in 1842 with the Treaty of Nanking, which opened Shanghai as one of the five treaty ports for international trade.[40] The Treaty of the Bogue, the Treaty of Wanghia, and the Treaty of Whampoa (signed in 1843, 1844, and 1844, respectively) forced Chinese concession to European and American desires for visitation and trade on Chinese soil. Britain, France, and the United States all established a presence outside the walled city of Shanghai, which remained under the direct administration of the Chinese.[41]\n\n\nThe Chinese-held Old City of Shanghai fell to rebels from the Small Swords Society in 1853, but was recovered by the Qing government in February 1855.[42] In 1854, the Shanghai Municipal Council was created to manage the foreign settlements. Between 1860 and 1862, the Taiping rebels twice attacked Shanghai and destroyed the city's eastern and southern suburbs, but failed to take the city.[43] In 1863, the British settlement to the south of Suzhou Creek (northern Huangpu District) and the American settlement to the north (southern Hongkou District) joined in order to form the Shanghai International Settlement. The French opted out of the Shanghai Municipal Council and maintained its own concession to the south and southwest.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)The dismantlement of Old City walls, 1911\nThe First Sino-Japanese War concluded with the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, which elevated Japan to become another foreign power in Shanghai. Japan built the first factories in Shanghai, which was soon copied by other foreign powers. All this international activity gave Shanghai the nickname \"the Great Athens of China\".[45] In 1914, the Old City walls were dismantled because they blocked the city's expansion. In July 1921, the Chinese Communist Party was founded in the French Concession.[41] On 30 May 1925, the May Thirtieth Movement broke out when a worker in a Japanese-owned cotton mill was shot and killed by a Japanese foreman.[46] Workers in the city then launched general strikes against imperialism, which became nationwide protests that gave rise to Chinese nationalism.[47]\n\n\nThe golden age of Shanghai began with its elevation to municipality after it was separated from Jiangsu on 7 July 1927.[41][48] This new Chinese municipality covered an area of 494.69\u00a0km2 (191.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), including the modern-day districts of Baoshan, Yangpu, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong, but excluded the foreign concessions territories.[48] Headed by a Chinese mayor and municipal council, the new city government's first task\u2014the Greater Shanghai Plan\u2014was to create a new city center in Jiangwan town of Yangpu district, outside the boundaries of the foreign concessions. The plan included a public museum, library, sports stadium, and city hall, which were partially constructed before being interrupted by the Japanese invasion.[49] In the 1920s, *shidaiqu* became a new form of entertainment and was popularised in Shanghai.[50]\n\n\nThe city flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the Asia-Pacific region in the 1930s.[51] During the ensuing decades, citizens of many countries and all continents came to Shanghai to live and work; those who stayed for long periods\u2060\u2060\u2014some for generations\u2060\u2014called themselves \"Shanghailanders\".[52] In the 1920s and 1930s, almost 20,000 White Russians fled the newly established Soviet Union to reside in Shanghai.[53] These Shanghai Russians constituted the second-largest foreign community. By 1932, Shanghai had become the world's fifth largest city and home to 70,000 foreigners.[54] In the 1930s, some 30,000 Jewish refugees from Europe arrived in the city.[55]\n\n\n\n* ![Skyline of Shanghai Pudong at night, September 2021](image)\n\nSkyline of Shanghai Pudong at night, September 2021\n* Shanghai, filmed in 1937\n* ![The Bund in the late 1920s seen from the French Concession](image)\n\nThe Bund in the late 1920s seen from the French Concession\n* ![Nanking Road (modern-day East Nanjing Road) in the 1930s](image)\n\nNanking Road (modern-day East Nanjing Road) in the 1930s\n* ![Shanghai Park Hotel was the tallest building in Asia for decades](image)\n\nShanghai Park Hotel was the tallest building in Asia for decades.\n* ![Former Shanghai Library](image)\n\nFormer Shanghai Library\n* ![The HSBC Building, built in 1923, and the Customs House, built in 1927](image)\n\nThe HSBC Building, built in 1923, and the Customs House, built in 1927\n\n\n### Japanese invasion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zhabei District on fire, 1937\nOn 28 January 1932, Japanese forces invaded Shanghai while the Chinese resisted. More than 10,000 shops and hundreds of factories and public buildings[56] were destroyed, leaving Zhabei district ruined. About 18,000 civilians were either killed, injured, or declared missing.[41] A ceasefire was brokered on 5 May.[57] In 1937, the Battle of Shanghai resulted in the occupation of the Chinese-administered parts of Shanghai outside of the International Settlement and the French Concession. People who stayed in the occupied city suffered on a daily basis, experiencing hunger, oppression, or death.[58] The foreign concessions were ultimately occupied by the Japanese on 8 December 1941 and remained occupied until Japan's surrender in 1945; multiple war crimes were committed during that time.[59]\n\n\nA side-effect of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai was the Shanghai Ghetto. Japanese consul to Kaunas, Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara issued thousands of visas to Jewish refugees who were escaping the Nazi's Final Solution to the Jewish Question. They traveled from Keidan, Lithuania across Russia by railroad to the Vladivostok from where they traveled by ship to Kobe, Japan. Their stay in Kobe was short as the Japanese government transferred them to Shanghai by November 1941. Other Jewish refugees found haven in Shanghai, not through Sugihara, but came on ships from Italy. The refugees from Europe were interned into a cramped ghetto in the Hongkou District, and after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, even the Iraqi Jews who had been living in Shanghai from before the outbreak of WWII were interned. Among the refugees in the Shanghai Ghetto was the Mirrer Yeshiva, including its students and faculty. On 3 September 1945, the Chinese Army liberated the Ghetto and most of the Jews left over the next few years.[60]\n\n\nOn 27 May 1949, the People's Liberation Army took control of Shanghai through the Shanghai Campaign. Under the new People's Republic of China (PRC), Shanghai was one of only three municipalities not merged into neighboring provinces (the others being Beijing and Tianjin).[61] Most foreign firms moved their offices from Shanghai to Hong Kong, as part of a foreign divestment due to the PRC's victory.[62]\n\n\n\n### Modernity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nanjing Road, 1967, during the Cultural Revolution\nAfter the war, Shanghai's economy was restored\u2014from 1949 to 1952, the city's agricultural and industrial output increased by 51.5% and 94.2%, respectively.[41] There were 20 urban districts and 10 suburbs at the time.[63] On 17 January 1958, Jiading, Baoshan, and Shanghai County in Jiangsu became part of Shanghai Municipality, which expanded to 863\u00a0km2 (333.2\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The following December, the land area of Shanghai was further expanded to 5,910\u00a0km2 (2,281.9\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) after more surrounding suburban areas in Jiangsu were added: Chongming, Jinshan, Qingpu, Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui.[64] In 1964, the city's administrative divisions were rearranged to 10 urban districts and 10 counties.[63]\n\n\nAs the industrial center of China with the most skilled industrial workers, Shanghai became a center for radical leftism during the 1950s and 1960s. The radical leftist Jiang Qing and her three allies, together the Gang of Four, were based in the city.[65] During the Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976), Shanghai's society was severely damaged. The majority of the workers in the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China were Red Guards and they formed a group called the Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters within the branch.[66]:\u200a38 The Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters dismantled economic organizations in Shanghai, investigated bank withdrawals, and disrupted regular bank service in the city.[66]:\u200a38The Shanghai People's Commune was established in the city during the January Storm of 1967. Despite the disruptions of the Cultural Revolutions, Shanghai maintained economic production with a positive annual growth rate.[41]\n\n\nDuring the Third Front campaign to develop basic industry and heavy industry in China's hinterlands in case of invasion by the Soviet Union or the United States, 354,900 Shanghainese were sent to work on Third Front projects.[67]:\u200axvi The centerpiece of Shanghai's Small Third Front project was the \"rear base\" in Anhui rear base which served as \"a multi-function manufacturing base for anti-aircraft and anti-tank weaponry.[67]:\u200axvi\n\n\nSince 1949, Shanghai has been a comparatively heavy contributor of tax revenue to the central government; in 1983, the city's contribution in tax revenue was greater than investment received in the past 33 years combined.[68] Its importance to the fiscal well-being of the central government also denied it from economic liberalizations begun in 1978. \n\n\nIn 1990, Deng Xiaoping permitted Shanghai to initiate economic reforms, which reintroduced foreign capital to the city and developed the Pudong district, resulting in the birth of Lujiazui.[69] That year, the China's central government designated Shanghai as the \"Dragon Head\" of economic reform.[70] As of 2020, Shanghai is classified as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[71]\n\n\nIn early 2022, Shanghai experienced a large outbreak of COVID-19 cases. After localized lockdowns failed to stem the rise in cases, the Chinese government locked down the entire city on 5 April. This resulted in widespread food shortages across the city emerged as food-supply chains were severely disrupted by the government's lockdown measures, which was not lifted until 1 June.[72]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Shanghai\n\n![](image)The urban area of Shanghai in 2016, along with its major islands. From northwest to southeast: Chongming, Changxing, Hengsha, and the Jiuduansha shoals off Pudong. The Yangtze's natural sediment discharge can be seen.\nShanghai is located on the Yangtze Estuary of China's east coast, with the Yangtze River to the north and Hangzhou Bay to the south, with the East China Sea to the east. The land is formed by the Yangtze's natural deposition and modern land reclamation projects. As such, it has sandy soil, and skyscrapers have to be built with deep concrete piles to avoid sinking into the soft ground.[73] The provincial-level Municipality of Shanghai administers both the estuary and many of its surrounding islands. It borders the provinces of Zhejiang to the south and Jiangsu to the west and north.[74] The municipality's northernmost point is on Chongming Island, which is the second-largest island in mainland China after its expansion during the 20th century.[75] It does not administratively include an exclave of Jiangsu on northern Chongming or the two islands forming Shanghai's Yangshan Port, which are parts of Zhejiang's Shengsi County.\n\n\nShanghai is located on an alluvial plain. As such, the vast majority of its 6,340.5\u00a0km2 (2,448.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) land area is flat, with an average elevation of 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft).[8] Tidal flat ecosystems exist around the estuary, however, they have long been reclaimed for agricultural purposes.[76] The city's few hills, such as She Shan, lie to the southwest, and its highest point is the peak of Dajinshan Island (103\u00a0m or 338\u00a0ft) in Hangzhou Bay.[8] Shanghai has many rivers, canals, streams, and lakes, and it is known for its rich water resources as part of the Lake Tai drainage basin.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  Shanghai\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 49\n\n\n\n8\n\n1\n | 59\n\n\n\n9\n\n2\n | 90\n\n\n\n13\n\n5\n | 97\n\n\n\n19\n\n11\n | 112\n\n\n\n24\n\n16\n | 169\n\n\n\n27\n\n21\n | 151\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 146\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 141\n\n\n\n28\n\n21\n | 57\n\n\n\n23\n\n15\n | 50\n\n\n\n17\n\n9\n | 38\n\n\n\n11\n\n3\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0C |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in mm |\n| Source: The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 1.9\n\n\n\n46\n\n33\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n48\n\n36\n | 3.6\n\n\n\n55\n\n42\n | 3.8\n\n\n\n66\n\n51\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n75\n\n61\n | 6.6\n\n\n\n81\n\n69\n | 6\n\n\n\n90\n\n77\n | 5.8\n\n\n\n89\n\n77\n | 5.6\n\n\n\n82\n\n69\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n73\n\n59\n | 2\n\n\n\n63\n\n48\n | 1.5\n\n\n\n52\n\n37\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0F |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nDowntown Shanghai is bisected by the Huangpu River, a man-made tributary of the Yangtze created by order of Lord Chunshen during the Warring States period.[32] The historic center of the city was located on the west bank of the Huangpu (Puxi), near the mouth of Suzhou Creek, connecting it with Lake Tai and the Grand Canal. The central financial district, Lujiazui, has been established on the east bank of the Huangpu (Pudong). Along Shanghai's eastern shore, the destruction of local wetlands due to the construction of Pudong International Airport has been partially offset by the protection and expansion of a nearby shoal, Jiuduansha, as a nature preserve.[77]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nShanghai has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with an average annual temperature of 15.8\u00a0\u00b0C (60.4\u00a0\u00b0F) for urban districts and 15.2\u201315.7\u00a0\u00b0C (59.4\u201360.3\u00a0\u00b0F) for suburbs.[73] The city experiences four distinct seasons. Winters are temperate to cold and damp\u2014northwesterly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing. Each year, there are an average of 6.2 days with snowfall and 2.8 days with snow cover.[73] Summers are hot and humid, and occasional downpours or freak thunderstorms can be expected. On average, 8.7 days exceed 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) annually. In summer and the beginning of autumn, the city is susceptible to typhoons.[78]\n\n\nThe most pleasant seasons are generally spring, although changeable and often rainy, and autumn, which is usually sunny and dry. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 28% in June to 47% in August, the city receives 1,763 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221210.1\u00a0\u00b0C (14\u00a0\u00b0F) on 31 January 1977 (unofficial record of \u221212.1\u00a0\u00b0C (10\u00a0\u00b0F) was set on 19 January 1893) to 40.9\u00a0\u00b0C (106\u00a0\u00b0F) on 13 July 2022 at a weather station in Xujiahui.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Shanghai (Minhang District), 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1951\u2013present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 37.5(99.5)\n | 40.9(105.6)\n | 39.9(103.8)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 40.9(105.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 11.5(52.7)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 4.9(40.8)\n | 6.6(43.9)\n | 10.4(50.7)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 3.9(39.0)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u221210.1(13.8)\n | \u22127.9(17.8)\n | \u22125.4(22.3)\n | \u22120.5(31.1)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 1.7(35.1)\n | \u22124.2(24.4)\n | \u22128.5(16.7)\n | \u221210.1(13.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 70.4(2.77)\n | 65.4(2.57)\n | 95.4(3.76)\n | 82.5(3.25)\n | 93.2(3.67)\n | 207.3(8.16)\n | 148.0(5.83)\n | 187.1(7.37)\n | 118.1(4.65)\n | 68.4(2.69)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 50.3(1.98)\n | 1,245.5(49.04)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.1 mm) | 10.9\n | 10.2\n | 12.9\n | 11.3\n | 11.2\n | 14.5\n | 11.7\n | 12.4\n | 9.8\n | 7.4\n | 9.1\n | 8.3\n | 129.7\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 1.8\n | 1.4\n | 0.4\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0.1\n | 0.7\n | 4.4\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74\n | 73\n | 72\n | 71\n | 73\n | 80\n | 78\n | 78\n | 76\n | 73\n | 74\n | 72\n | 75\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 114.8\n | 117.9\n | 143.8\n | 168.1\n | 176.8\n | 131.2\n | 209.4\n | 202.3\n | 163.7\n | 162.1\n | 131.1\n | 129.7\n | 1,850.9\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 36\n | 37\n | 39\n | 43\n | 41\n | 31\n | 49\n | 50\n | 45\n | 46\n | 42\n | 41\n | 42\n |\n| Source: China Meteorological Administration[79][80] |\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nView of Lujiazui from The Bund during the day\n\n![](image)\nView of Pudong from Waibaidu Bridge\n\n![](image)\nNight view of Lujiazui in Pudong.\n\nThe Bund, located by the bank of the Huangpu River, is home to a row of early 20th-century architecture, ranging in style from the neoclassical HSBC Building to the Art Deco Sassoon House (now part of the Peace Hotel). Many areas in the former foreign concessions are also well-preserved, the most notable being the French Concession.[81] Shanghai is also home to many architecturally distinctive and even eccentric buildings, including the Shanghai Museum, the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Shanghai Oriental Art Center, and the Oriental Pearl Tower. Despite rampant redevelopment, the Old City still retains some traditional architecture and designs, such as the Yu Garden, an elaborate Jiangnan style garden.[82]\n\n\nAs a result of its construction boom during the 1920s and 1930s, Shanghai has among the most Art Deco buildings in the world.[81] One of the most famous architects working in Shanghai was L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Hudec, a Hungarian-Slovak who lived in the city between 1918 and 1947.[83] His most notable Art Deco buildings include the Park Hotel, the Grand Cinema, and the Paramount.[84] Other prominent architects who contributed to the Art Deco style are Clement Palmer and Arthur Turner, who together designed the Peace Hotel, the Metropole Hotel, and the Broadway Mansions;[85] and Austrian architect C.H. Gonda, who designed the Capitol Theatre. The Bund has been revitalized several times. The first was in 1986, with a new promenade by the Dutch architect Paulus Snoeren.[86] The second was before the 2010 Expo, which includes restoration of the century-old Waibaidu Bridge and reconfiguration of traffic flow.[87]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bund\nOne distinctive cultural element is the shikumen (\u77f3\u5e93\u95e8, \"stone storage door\") residence, typically two- or three-story gray brick houses with the front yard protected by a heavy wooden door in a stylistic stone arch.[88] Each residence is connected and arranged in straight alleys, known as longtang[g] (\u5f04\u5802). The house is similar to western-style terrace houses or townhouses, but distinguished by the tall, heavy brick wall and archway in front of each house.[90]\n\n\nThe shikumen is a cultural blend of elements found in Western architecture with traditional Jiangnan Chinese architecture and social behavior.[88] Like almost all traditional Chinese dwellings, it has a courtyard, which reduces outside noise. Vegetation can be grown in the courtyard, and it can also allow for sunlight and ventilation to the rooms.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai World Financial Center (left) and Jin Mao Tower (right)\nSome of Shanghai's buildings feature Soviet neoclassical architecture or Stalinist architecture, though the city has fewer such structures than Beijing. These buildings were mostly erected between the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 and the Sino-Soviet Split in the late 1960s. During this time period, large numbers of Soviet experts, including architects, poured into China to aid the country in the construction of a communist state. An example of Soviet neoclassical architecture in Shanghai is the modern-day Shanghai Exhibition Center.[92]\n\n\nShanghai\u2014Lujiazui in particular\u2014has numerous skyscrapers, making it the fifth city in the world with the most skyscrapers.[93] Among the most prominent examples are the 421\u00a0m (1,381\u00a0ft) high Jin Mao Tower, the 492\u00a0m (1,614\u00a0ft) high Shanghai World Financial Center, and the 632\u00a0m (2,073\u00a0ft) high Shanghai Tower, which is the tallest building in China and the third tallest in the world.[94] Completed in 2015, the tower takes the form of nine twisted sections stacked atop each other, totaling 128 floors.[95] It is featured in its double-skin facade design, which eliminates the need for either layer to be opaqued for reflectivity as the double-layer structure has already reduced the heat absorption.[96] The futuristic-looking Oriental Pearl Tower, at 468\u00a0m (1,535\u00a0ft), is located nearby at the northern tip of Lujiazui.[97] Skyscrapers outside of Lujiazui include the White Magnolia Plaza in Hongkou, the Shimao International Plaza in Huangpu, and the Shanghai Wheelock Square in Jing'an.\n\n\n\n* ![The Shanghai Museum](image)\n\nThe Shanghai Museum\n* ![The Shanghai Grand Theater](image)\n\nThe Shanghai Grand Theater\n* ![The Shanghai Exhibition Center, an example of Stalinist architecture](image)\n\nThe Shanghai Exhibition Center, an example of Stalinist architecture\n* ![The Oriental Pearl Tower at night](image)\n\nThe Oriental Pearl Tower at night\n* ![Shanghai Tower](image)\n\nShanghai Tower\n* ![Glass facades of two skyscrapers](image)\n\nGlass facades of two skyscrapers\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Shanghai and Shanghai Municipal People's Government\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCurrent leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Government\n|  | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Title\n | **CCP Committee Secretary** | **SMPC Chairman** | **Mayor** | **Shanghai CPPCC Chairman** |\n| Name\n | Chen Jining | Jiang Zhuoqing | Gong Zheng | Dong Yunhu\n |\n| Ancestral home | Lishu, Jilin | Cixi, Zhejiang | Suzhou, Jiangsu | Taizhou, Zhejiang |\n| Born\n | February\u00a01964 (age\u00a060) | August\u00a01959 (age\u00a064) | March\u00a01960 (age\u00a064) | November\u00a01962 (age\u00a061)\n |\n| Assumed office\n | October 2022[98] | January 2020[99] | March 2020[100] | January 2018[101] |\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Municipal Government building\nLike all governing institutions in mainland China, Shanghai has a parallel party-government system,[102] in which the CCP Committee Secretary, officially termed the Chinese Communist Party Shanghai Municipal Committee Secretary, outranks the Mayor.[103] The CCP committee acts as the top policy-formulation body, and is typically composed of 12 members (including the secretary), and has control over the Shanghai Municipal People's Government.[104][105]\n\n\nPolitical power in Shanghai has frequently been a stepping stone to higher positions in the central government. Since Jiang Zemin became the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in June 1989, all former Shanghai party secretaries but one were elevated to the Politburo Standing Committee, the *de facto* highest decision-making body in China,[102] including Jiang himself (Party General Secretary),[106] Zhu Rongji (Premier),[107] Wu Bangguo (NPC Chairman),[108] Huang Ju (Vice Premier),[109] Xi Jinping (current General Secretary),[110] Yu Zhengsheng (CPPCC Chairman),[111] Han Zheng (Vice Premier and Vice President),[112] and Li Qiang (Premier). Zeng Qinghong, a former deputy party secretary of Shanghai, also rose to the Politburo Standing Committee and became the Vice President and an influential power broker.[113] The only exception is Chen Liangyu, who was fired in 2006 and later convicted of corruption.[114]\n\n\nOfficials with ties to the Shanghai administration collectively form a powerful faction in the central government known as the Shanghai Clique, which has often been viewed to compete against the rival Youth League Faction over personnel appointments and policy decisions.[115] However, Xi Jinping, successor to Hu Jintao as General Secretary and President, was largely an independent leader and took anti-corruption campaigns on both factions.[116]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of administrative divisions of Shanghai and List of township-level divisions of Shanghai\n\nShanghai is one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of the Government of the People's Republic of China,[117] and is divided into 16 county-level districts.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Administrative divisions of Shanghai\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n**Huangpu**\n\n**Xuhui**\n\n**Changning**\n\n**Jing'an**\n\n**Putuo**\n\n**Hongkou**\n\n**Yangpu**\n\n**Minhang**\n\n**Baoshan**\n\n**Jiading**\n\n**Pudong**\n\n**Jinshan**\n\n**Songjiang**\n\n**Qingpu**\n\n**Fengxian**\n\n**Chongming**\n |\n| Division code[118] | Division\n | Area (km2)[119] | Total population 2020[119] | Seat\n | Postal code\n |\n| 310000 | Shanghai\n | 6,340.50 | 24,870,895 | Huangpu | 200000\n |\n| 310101 | Huangpu | 20.46 | 662,030 | Waitan Subdistrict | 200001\n |\n| 310104 | Xuhui | 54.76 | 1,113,078 | Xujiahui Subdistrict | 200030\n |\n| 310105 | Changning | 38.30 | 693,051 | Jiangsu Road Subdistrict | 200050\n |\n| 310106 | Jing'an | 36.88 | 975,707 | Jiangning Road Subdistrict | 200040\n |\n| 310107 | Putuo | 54.83 | 1,239,800 | Zhenru Town Subdistrict | 200333\n |\n| 310109 | Hongkou | 23.46 | 757,498 | Jiaxing Road Subdistrict | 200080\n |\n| 310110 | Yangpu | 60.73 | 1,242,548 | Pingliang Road Subdistrict | 200082\n |\n| 310112 | Minhang | 370.75 | 2,653,489 | Xinzhuang town | 201100\n |\n| 310113 | Baoshan | 270.99 | 2,235,218 | Youyi Road Subdistrict | 201900\n |\n| 310114 | Jiading | 464.20 | 1,834,258 | Xincheng Road Subdistrict | 201800\n |\n| 310115 | Pudong | 1,210.41 | 5,681,512 | Huamu Subdistrict | 200135\n |\n| 310116 | Jinshan | 586.05 | 822,776 | Shanyang town | 201500\n |\n| 310117 | Songjiang | 605.64 | 1,909,713 | Fangsong Subdistrict | 201600\n |\n| 310118 | Qingpu | 670.14 | 1,271,424 | Xiayang Subdistrict | 201700\n |\n| 310120 | Fengxian | 687.39 | 1,140,872 | Nanqiao town | 201400\n |\n| 310151 | Chongming | 1,185.49 | 637,921 | Chengqiao town | 202100\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Divisions in Chinese and varieties of romanizations\n |\n| --- |\n| English\n | Chinese\n | Pinyin\n | Shanghainese Romanization\n |\n| Shanghai Municipality\n | \u4e0a\u6d77\u5e02 | Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei Sh\u00ec\n | zaon he zy\n |\n| Huangpu District | \u9ec4\u6d66\u533a | Hu\u00e1ngp\u01d4 Q\u016b\n | waon phu chiu\n |\n| Xuhui District | \u5f90\u6c47\u533a | X\u00fahu\u00ec Q\u016b\n | zi we chiu\n |\n| Changning District | \u957f\u5b81\u533a | Ch\u00e1ngn\u00edng Q\u016b\n | zan nyin chiu\n |\n| Jing'an District | \u9759\u5b89\u533a | J\u00ecng'\u0101n Q\u016b\n | zin oe chiu\n |\n| Putuo District | \u666e\u9640\u533a | P\u01d4tu\u00f3 Q\u016b\n | phu du chiu\n |\n| Hongkou District | \u8679\u53e3\u533a | H\u00f3ngk\u01d2u Q\u016b\n | ghon kheu chiu\n |\n| Yangpu District | \u6768\u6d66\u533a | Y\u00e1ngp\u01d4 Q\u016b\n | yan phu chiu\n |\n| Minhang District | \u95f5\u884c\u533a | M\u01d0nh\u00e1ng Q\u016b\n | min ghaon chiu\n |\n| Baoshan District | \u5b9d\u5c71\u533a | B\u01ceosh\u0101n Q\u016b\n | pau sae chiu\n |\n| Jiading District | \u5609\u5b9a\u533a | Ji\u0101d\u00ecng Q\u016b\n | ka din chiu\n |\n| Pudong New Area | \u6d66\u4e1c\u65b0\u533a | P\u01d4d\u014dng X\u012bnq\u016b\n | phu ton sin chiu\n |\n| Jinshan District | \u91d1\u5c71\u533a | J\u012bnsh\u0101n Q\u016b\n | cin se chiu\n |\n| Songjiang District | \u677e\u6c5f\u533a | S\u014dngji\u0101ng Q\u016b\n | son kaon chiu\n |\n| Qingpu District | \u9752\u6d66\u533a | Q\u012bngp\u01d4 Q\u016b\n | tsin phu chiu\n |\n| Fengxian District | \u5949\u8d24\u533a | F\u00e8ngxi\u00e1n Q\u016b\n | von yi chiu\n |\n| Chongming District | \u5d07\u660e\u533a | Ch\u00f3ngm\u00edng Q\u016b\n | dzon min chiu\n |\n\n\nAlthough every district has its own urban core, the city hall and major administrative units are located in Huangpu District, which also serves as a commercial area, including the famous Nanjing Road.

Currently, two port chain centers have been approved for construction in Waigaoqiao and Yangshan.[167] Several preferential policies have been implemented to attract foreign investment in various industries to the zone. Because the zone is not technically considered Chinese territory for tax purposes, commodities entering the zone are exempt from duty and customs clearance.[168]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Shanghai\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1954[169] | 6,204,400 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1964[169] | 10,816,500 | +5.72% |\n| 1982[169] | 11,859,700 | +0.51% |\n| 1990[169] | 13,341,900 | +1.48% |\n| 2000[169] | 16,407,700 | +2.09% |\n| 2010[169] | 23,019,200 | +3.44% |\n| 2015[170] | 24,152,700 | +0.97% |\n| 2016[170] | 24,197,000 | +0.18% |\n| 2017[170] | 24,183,300 | \u22120.06% |\n| 2018[141] | 24,237,800 | +0.23% |\n| 2019[142] | 24,281,400 | +0.18% |\n| Population size may be affected by changes to administrative divisions. |\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], Shanghai had a total population of 24,758,900, including 14,693,630 (59.3%) hukou holders (registered locally).[142] As of 2021[update], 89.3% of Shanghai's population live in urban areas, and 10.7% live in rural areas.[11] Based on the population of its total administrative area, Shanghai is the second largest of the four municipalities of China, behind Chongqing, but is generally considered the largest Chinese city because the urban population of Chongqing is much smaller.[171] According to the OECD, Shanghai's metropolitan area has an estimated population of 34 million.[172]\n\n\nAccording to the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau, about 157,900 residents in Shanghai are foreigners, including 28,900 Japanese, 21,900 Americans and 20,800 Koreans.[173] The actual number of foreign citizens in the city is probably much higher.[174] Shanghai is also a domestic immigration city\u201440.3% (9.8 million) of the city's residents are from other regions of China.[142]\n\n\nShanghai has a life expectancy of 83.18 years for the city's registered population,[175] the highest life expectancy of all cities in mainland China. This has also caused the city to experience population aging\u2014in 2021, 17.4% (4.3 million) of the city's registered population was aged 65 or above.[142] In 2017, the Chinese government implemented population controls for Shanghai, resulting in a population decline of 10,000 people by the end of the year.[176]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article on Chinese Wikipedia: \u4e0a\u6d77\u5b97\u6559\n\nSee also: Religion in China\n\n![](image)Bird's-eye view of the golden pagoda of Jing'an Temple\nDue to its cosmopolitan history, Shanghai has a blend of religious heritage; religious buildings and institutions are scattered around the city. According to a 2012 survey, only 13.1% of the city's population belongs to organized religions, including Buddhists with 10.4%, Protestants with 1.9%, Catholics with 0.7%, and other faiths with 0.1% while the remaining 86.9% of the population could be either atheists or involved in worship of nature deities and ancestors or folk religious sects.[177]\n\n\n\n<div style=\"border:solid transparent;background-color:initial;position:absolute;width:100px;line-height:0;<div style=\"border:solid transparent;background-color:initial;position:absolute;width:100px;line-height:0;\n\nReligion in Shanghai (2012):\n\n\n\nChinese folk religion, or atheist (86.9%)\nBuddhism (10.4%)\nProtestantism (1.9%)\nCatholicism (0.7%)\nOther (0.1%)\n\nBuddhism, in its Chinese varieties, has had a presence in Shanghai since the Three Kingdoms period, during which the Longhua Temple\u2014the largest temple in Shanghai\u2014and the Jing'an Temple were founded.[178] Another significant temple is the Jade Buddha Temple, which was named after a large statue of Buddha carved out of jade in the temple.[179] As of 2014[update], Buddhism in Shanghai had 114 temples, 1,182 clergical staff, and 453,300 registered followers.[178] The religion also has its own college, the Shanghai Buddhist College\u00a0[zh], and its own press, Shanghai Buddhological Press\u00a0[zh].[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)The St. Ignatius Cathedral\nCatholicism was brought into Shanghai in 1608 by Italian missionary Lazzaro Cattaneo.[181] The Apostolic Vicariate of Shanghai was erected in 1933, and was further elevated to the Diocese of Shanghai in 1946.[182] Notable Catholic sites include the St. Ignatius Cathedral in Xujiahui\u2014the largest Catholic church in the city,[183] the St. Francis Xavier Church, and the She Shan Basilica.[184] Other forms of Christianity in Shanghai include Eastern Orthodox minorities and, since 1996, registered Christian Protestant churches.\n\n\nAlthough currently making up a fraction of the religious population in Shanghai, Jewish people have played an influential role in the city's history. After the Treaty of Nanking ended the First Opium War in 1842, the city was opened up to western populations and merchants traveled to Shanghai for its rich business potential, including many prominent Jewish families. The Sassoons amassed great wealth in the opium and textile trades, cementing their status by funding many of the buildings that have become iconic in Shanghai's skyline, such as the Cathay Hotel in 1929.[185] The Hardoons were another prominent Baghdadi Jewish family that used their business success to define Shanghai in the 20th century. The head of the family, Silas Hardoon, one of the richest people in the world during the 1800s, financed Nanjing Road, which then housed departmental stores in the International Settlement, that is now one of the busiest shopping centers in the world.[185]\n\n\nDuring World War II, thousands of Jews emigrated to Shanghai in an effort to flee Nazi Germany. They lived in a designated area called the Shanghai Ghetto and formed a community centered on the Ohel Moishe Synagogue, which is now the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum.[186] In 1939, Horace Kadoorie, the head of the powerful philanthropic Sephardic Jewish family in Shanghai, founded the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association to support Jewish refugees through English education so they would be prepared to emigrate from Shanghai when the time came.[187]\n\n\nIslam came into Shanghai during the Yuan dynasty. The city's first mosque, Songjiang Mosque, was built during the Zhizheng (\u81f3\u6b63) era under Emperor Huizong (reigned 1333 \u2013 1368). Shanghai's Muslim population increased in the 19th and early 20th centuries (when the city was a treaty port), during which time many mosques\u2014including the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque, the Huxi Mosque, and the Pudong Mosque\u2014were built. The Shanghai Islamic Association is located in the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque in Huangpu.[188]\n\n\nShanghai has several folk religious temples, including the City God Temple at the heart of the Old City, the Dajing Ge Pavilion dedicated to the Three Kingdoms general Guan Yu, the Confucian Temple of Shanghai, and a major Taoist center Shanghai White Cloud Temple\u00a0[zh] where the Shanghai Taoist Association locates.[189]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shanghainese\n\n| Ability to speak the following dialects/languages in Shanghai (2013)[190] |\n| --- |\n| Languages |  | % | Can Speak |\n| Mandarin |  | 97.0% |\n| Shanghainese |  | 81.4% |\n| English |  | 47.5% |\n| Other Chinese |  | 29.7% |\n| Other foreign languages |  | 7.8% |\n| Sampled among residents \u2265 13 years old. |\n\nThe vernacular language spoken in the city is Shanghainese, part of the Taihu Wu subgroup of the Wu Chinese language family. This is different from the national language, Mandarin, which is mutually unintelligible with Wu Chinese.[191] Modern Shanghainese derives from the indigenous Wu spoken in the former Songjiang prefecture but has been influenced by other dialects of Taihu Wu, most notably Suzhounese, and Ningbonese[192]\n\n\nPrior to its expansion, the language spoken in Shanghai was not as prominent as those spoken around Jiaxing and later Suzhou,[192] and was known as \"the local tongue\" (\u672c\u5730\u9591\u8a71), a name which is now used in suburbs only.[193] In the late 19th century, downtown Shanghainese (\u5e02\u5340\u9591\u8a71 or simply \u4e0a\u6d77\u9591\u8a71) appeared, undergoing rapid changes and quickly replacing Suzhounese as the prestige dialect of the Yangtze River Delta region. At the time, most of the immigration into the city came from the two adjacent provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the local dialects of which had the greatest influence on Shanghainese. After 1949, Putonghua (Standard Mandarin) has also had a great impact on Shanghainese as a result of being rigorously promoted by the government.[192] Since the 1990s, many migrants outside of the Wu-speaking region have come to Shanghai for education and jobs. They often cannot speak the local language and therefore use Putonghua (Mandarin) as a lingua franca. Because Putonghua and English were more favored, Shanghainese began to decline, and fluency among young speakers weakened. In recent years, there have been movements within the city to promote the local language and protect it from fading out.[194][195]\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Shanghai\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of universities and colleges in Shanghai.\n\n![](image)Shanghai Jiao Tong University Library\nShanghai is an international center of research and development and as of 2022, it was ranked third globally and second in the whole Asia & Oceania region (after Beijing) by scientific research outputs, as tracked by the Nature Index.[196] It is also a major center of higher education in China. As of 2022, Shanghai had 64 universities and colleges, ranking first in East China region as a city with most higher education institutions.[197]\n\n\nShanghai has many highly ranked educational institutions,[198][199] with 15 universities listed in 147 Double First-Class Universities ranking second nationwide among all cities in China (after Beijing). A number of China's most prestigious universities appearing in the global university rankings are based in Shanghai, including Fudan University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tongji University, East China Normal University, Shanghai University, East China University of Science and Technology, Donghua University, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai International Studies University, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Shanghai University of Electric Power, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai Maritime University, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Ocean University, Shanghai University of Engineering Science, Shanghai Institute of Technology, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and Shanghai University of Sport.[199][200][201][202] Some of these universities were selected as \"985 universities\" or \"211 universities\" since the 90s by the Chinese government in order to build world-class universities.[203][204]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fudan University\nShanghai is a seat of two members (Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education,[205] and these two universities are ranked consistently in the Asia top 10, [206][207] and in the global top 100 research comprehensive universities according to the most influential university rankings in the world such as QS Rankings, Shanghai Rankings, Times Higher Education Rankings and *U.S. News & World Report* Best Global Universities Ranking.[201][208][209][199] Fudan University established a joint EMBA program with Washington University in St. Louis in 2002 which has since consistently been ranked as one of the best in the world.[210][211]\n\n\nThe other two members of the \"Project 985\", Tongji University and East China Normal University, are also based in Shanghai and internationally; they are regarded as one of the most reputable Chinese universities by the *Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings* where they ranked 150\u2013175th globally.[212] The city is also home to the Shanghai University of Sport, which consistently ranks the best in China among universities specialized in sports.[213] As of 2022, Shanghai University of Sport ranks #1 in Asia and #43 globally according to the \"Global Ranking of Sport Science Schools and Departments 2022\" released by Shanghai Ranking.[214]\n\n\nThe city has many Chinese\u2013foreign joint education institutes\u00a0[zh], such as the Shanghai University\u2013University of Technology Sydney Business School since 1994, the University of Michigan\u2013Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute since 2006, and New York University Shanghai\u2014the first China\u2013U.S. joint venture university\u2014since 2012.[215][216] In 2013, the Shanghai Municipality and the Chinese Academy of Sciences founded the ShanghaiTech University in the Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in Pudong.[217] Shanghai is also home to the cadre school China Executive Leadership Academy in Pudong and the China Europe International Business School. The city government's education agency is the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission.\n\n\nThe city is also a seat of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, China's oldest think tank for the humanities and social sciences. It is the largest one outside the capital of Beijing after the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).[218]\n\n\nBy the end of 2019, the city also had 929 secondary schools, 698 primary schools, and 31 special schools.[142] In Shanghai, the nine years of compulsory education\u2014including five years of primary education and four years of junior secondary education\u2014are free, with a gross enrollment ratio of over 99.9%.[142] The city's compulsory education system is among the best in the world: in 2009 and 2012, 15-year-old students from Shanghai ranked first in every subject (math, reading, and science) in the Program for International Student Assessment, a worldwide study of academic performance conducted by the OECD.[219][220] The consecutive three-year senior secondary education is priced and uses the Senior High School Entrance Examination (*Zhongkao*) as a selection process, with a gross enrollment ratio of 98%.[221] Among all senior high schools, the four with the best teaching quality\u2014Shanghai High School, No. 2 High School Attached to East China Normal University, High School Affiliated to Fudan University, and High School Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University\u2014are termed \"The Four Schools\" (\u201c\u56db\u6821\u201d) of Shanghai.[222] As of October 2019[update], the city's National College Entrance Examination (*Gaokao*) is structured under the \"3+3\" system, in which all general senior high school students study three compulsory subjects (Chinese, English, and math) and three subjects chosen from six options (physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography, and politics).[223]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Shanghai\n\n### Public[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Shanghai Metro is the longest metro system in the world.\n![](image)Shanghai Metro Network\nShanghai has an extensive public transportation system comprising metros, buses, ferries, and taxis, all of which can be accessed using a Shanghai Public Transport Card.[224]\n\n\nShanghai's rapid transit system, the Shanghai Metro, incorporates both subway and light metro lines and extends to every core urban district as well as neighboring suburban districts. As of 2021[update], there are 19 metro lines (excluding the Shanghai maglev train and Jinshan Railway), 515 stations, and 803\u00a0km (499\u00a0mi) of lines in operation, making it the longest network in the world.[142] On 8 March 2019, it set the city's daily metro ridership record with 13.3 million.[225] The average fare ranges from CN\u00a53 (US$0.48) to CN\u00a59 (US$1.28), depending on the travel distance.[226]\n\n\n\n![](image)A maglev train leaving Pudong International Airport\nOpened in 2004, the Shanghai maglev train is the first and the fastest commercial high-speed maglev in the world, with a maximum operation speed of 430\u00a0km/h (267\u00a0mph).[227] The train can complete the 30-kilometer (19\u00a0mi) journey between Longyang Road Station and Pudong International Airport in 7 minutes 20 seconds,[228] comparing to 32 minutes by Metro Line 2[229] and 30 minutes by car.[230] A one-way ticket costs CN\u00a550 (US$8), or CN\u00a540 (US$6.40) for those with airline tickets or public transportation cards. A round-trip ticket costs CN\u00a580 (US$12.80), and VIP tickets cost double the standard fare.[231]\n\n\nWith the first tram line been in service in 1908, trams were once popular in Shanghai in the early 20th century. By 1925, there were 328 tramcars and 14 routes operated by Chinese, French, and British companies collaboratively,[232] all of which were nationalized after the PRC's victory in 1949. Since the 1960s, many tram lines were either dismantled or replaced by trolleybus or motorbus lines;[233] the last tram line was demolished in 1975.[234] Shanghai reintroduced trams in 2010, as a modern rubber-tire Translohr system in Zhangjiang area of East Shanghai as Zhangjiang Tram.[235] In 2018, the steel wheeled Songjiang Tram started operating in Songjiang District.[236] Additional tram lines are under planning in Hongqiao Subdistrict and Jiading District as of 2019[update].[237]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Shanghai Trolleybus network is currently the oldest in the world.\nShanghai also has the world's most extensive bus network, including the world's oldest continuously operating trolleybus system, with 1,575 lines covering a total length of 8,997\u00a0km (5,590\u00a0mi) by 2019.[142] The system is operated by multiple companies.[238] Bus fares generally cost CN\u00a52 (US$0.32).[239] Shanghai also has three bus rapid transit systems, namely the Yan'an Road Medium Capacity Bus Transit System, Fengpu Express and Nantuan Express.\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], a total of 40,000 taxis were in operation in Shanghai.[142] The base fare for taxis is CN\u00a514 (US$2.24), which covers the first 3\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi) and includes a CN\u00a51 (US$0.14) fuel surcharge. The base fare is CN\u00a518 (US$2.55) between 11:00\u00a0pm and 5:00\u00a0am. Each additional kilometer costs CN\u00a52.7 (US$0.45), or CN\u00a54.05 (US$0.67) between 11:00\u00a0pm and 5:00\u00a0am.[240] Taxicabs and DiDi play major roles in urban transportation and DiDi is often cheaper than taxis.[241]\n\n\nAs of January 2021, Shanghai Metro has 459 stations and 772\u00a0km. The scale of operation is the first in the world. in 2017, the average daily passenger traffic of the Shanghai metro was 9.693 million, and the total passenger traffic reached 3.538 billion. It is one of the busiest metro cities in the world. The metro lines cover the central city densely and connect most districts and counties.[242]\n\n\n\n### Roads and expressways[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Expressways of Shanghai\n\n![](image)Interchange between Yan'an Elevated Road and North\u2013South Elevated Road\nShanghai is a major hub of China's expressway network. Many national expressways (prefixed with the letter G) pass through or end in Shanghai, including Jinghu Expressway (overlaps with Hurong Expressway), Shenhai Expressway, Hushaan Expressway, Huyu Expressway, Hukun Expressway (overlaps with Hangzhou Bay Ring Expressway), and Shanghai Ring Expressway.[243] There are also numerous municipal expressways prefixed with the letter S.[243] As of 2019, Shanghai has a total of 12 bridges and 14 tunnels crossing the Huangpu River.[244][245] The Shanghai Yangtze River Bridge is the city's only bridge\u2013tunnel complex across Yangtze River.\n\n\nThe expressway network within the city center consists of North\u2013South Elevated Road, Yan'an Elevated Road, and Inner Ring Road. Other ring roads in Shanghai include Middle Ring Road, Outer Ring Expressway, and Shanghai Ring Expressway.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bicycle-sharing systems, such as ofo (yellow) and Mobike (orange), are common in Shanghai.\nBicycle lanes are common in Shanghai, separating non-motorized traffic from car traffic on most surface streets. However, on some main roads, including all expressways, bicycles and motorcycles are banned. In recent years, cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity due to the emergence of a large number of dockless app-based bicycle-sharing systems, such as Mobike, Bluegogo, and ofo.[246] As of December\u00a02018[update], bicycle-sharing systems had an average of 1.15 million daily riders within the city.[247]\n\n\nPrivate car ownership in Shanghai is rapidly increasing: in 2019, there were 3.40 million private cars in the city, a 12.5% increase from 2018.[142] New private cars cannot be driven without a license plate, which are sold in monthly license plate auctions. Around 9,500 license plates are auctioned each month, and the average price is about CN\u00a589,600 (US$12,739) in 2019.[248] According to the city's vehicle regulations introduced in June 2016, only locally registered residents and those who have paid social insurance or individual income taxes for over three years are eligible to be in the auction. The purpose of this policy is to limit the growth of automobile traffic and alleviate congestion.[249]\n\n\n\n### Railways[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai railway station\nShanghai has four major railway stations: Shanghai railway station, Shanghai South railway station, Shanghai West railway station, and Shanghai Hongqiao railway station.[250] All are connected to the metro network and serve as hubs in the railway network of China. And now Shanghai has around twenty railway lines running under this city, which largely facilitate people's life in Shanghai.\n\n\nBuilt in 1876, the Woosung railway was the first railway in Shanghai and the first railway in operation in China[251] By 1909, Shanghai\u2013Nanjing railway and Shanghai\u2013Hangzhou railway were in service.[252][253] As of October\u00a02019[update], the two railways have been integrated into two main railways in China: Beijing\u2013Shanghai railway and Shanghai\u2013Kunming railway, respectively.[254]\n\n\nShanghai has four high-speed railways (HSRs): Beijing\u2013Shanghai HSR (overlaps with Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Chengdu passenger railway), Shanghai\u2013Nanjing intercity railway, Shanghai\u2013Kunming HSR, and Shanghai\u2013Nantong railway. One HSR is under construction: Shanghai\u2013Suzhou\u2013Huzhou HSR.[255][256]\n\n\nShanghai also has four commuter railways: Pudong railway (passenger service is currently suspended) and Jinshan railway operated by China Railway, and Line 16 and Line 17 operated by Shanghai Metro.[257][258] As of January\u00a02022[update], four additional lines\u2014Chongming line, Jiamin line, Airport link line and Lianggang Express line\u2014are under construction.[258][259]\n\n\n\n### Air and sea[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Port of Shanghai\n\n![](image)Inside Shanghai Pudong International Airport Terminal 1\n![](image)Due to Yangshan Port, Shanghai has become the world's busiest container port.\nShanghai is one of the largest air transportation hubs in Asia.[260] The city has two commercial airports: Shanghai Pudong International Airport and Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport.[261] Pudong International Airport is the primary international airport, while Hongqiao International Airport mainly operates domestic flights with limited short-haul international flights. In 2018, Pudong International Airport served 74.0 million passengers and handled 3.8 million tons of cargo, making it the ninth-busiest airport by passenger volume and third-busiest airport by cargo volume.[262][263] The same year, Hongqiao International Airport served 43.6 million passengers, making it the 19th-busiest airport by passenger volume.[262]\n\n\nSince its opening, the Port of Shanghai has rapidly grown to become the largest port in China.[264] Yangshan Port was built in 2005 because the river was unsuitable for docking large container ships. The port is connected with the mainland through the 32-kilometer (20\u00a0mi) long Donghai Bridge. Although the port is run by the Shanghai International Port Group under the government of Shanghai, it administratively belongs to Shengsi County, Zhejiang.[265]\n\n\nOvertaking the Port of Singapore in 2010,[266] the Port of Shanghai has become world's busiest container port with an annual TEU transportation of 42 million in 2018.[267] Besides cargo, the Port of Shanghai handled 259 cruises and 1.89 million passengers in 2019.[142]\n\n\nShanghai is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the south via the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and the Eastern Europe.[268][269][270][271][272]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Shanghai\n\n![](image)Shanghai Citi Bank Building operates a light show, shining the phrase \"I love Shanghai\".\nThe culture of Shanghai was formed by a combination of the nearby Wuyue culture and the \"East Meets West\" Haipai culture. Wuyue culture's influence is manifested in Shanghainese language\u2014which comprises dialectal elements from nearby Jiaxing, Suzhou, and Ningbo\u2014and Shanghai cuisine, which was influenced by Jiangsu cuisine and Zhejiang cuisine.[273] Haipai culture emerged after Shanghai became a prosperous port in the early 20th century, with numerous foreigners from Europe, America, Japan, and India moving into the city.[274] The culture fuses elements of Western cultures with the local Wuyue culture, and its influence extends to the city's literature, fashion, architecture, music, and cuisine.[275] The term Haipai\u2014originally referring to a painting school in Shanghai\u2014was coined by a group of Beijing writers in 1920 to criticize some Shanghai scholars for admiring capitalism and Western culture.[275][276] In the early 21st century, Shanghai has been recognized as a new influence and inspiration for cyberpunk culture.[277]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of museums in China \u00a7\u00a0Shanghai\n\n![](image)The China Art Museum, located in Pudong\nCultural curation in Shanghai has seen significant growth since 2013, with several new museums having been opened in the city.[278] This is in part due to the city's 2018 development plans, which aim to make Shanghai \"an excellent global city\".[279] As such, Shanghai has several museums of regional and national importance.[280][281] The Shanghai Museum has one of the largest collections of Chinese artifacts in the world, including a large collection of ancient Chinese bronzes and ceramics.[282] The China Art Museum, located in the former China Pavilion of Expo 2010, is one of the largest museums in Asia and displays an animated replica of the 12th century painting Along the River During the Qingming Festival.[283] The Shanghai Natural History Museum and the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum are notable natural history and science museums. In addition, there are numerous smaller, specialist museums housed in important archeological and historical sites, such as the Songze Museum,[284] the Museum of the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the site of the former Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea,[285] the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum, and the Shanghai Post Office Museum (located in the General Post Office Building).[286]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Shanghainese cuisine\n\n![](image)Xiaolongbao in Shanghai\nBenbang cuisine (\u672c\u5e2e\u83dc)[287] is cooking style that originated in the 1600s, with influences from surrounding provinces. It emphasizes the use of condiments while retaining the original flavors of the raw ingredients. Sugar is an important ingredient in Benbang cuisine, especially when used in combination with soy sauce. Signature dishes of Benbang cuisine include Xiaolongbao, Red braised pork belly, and Shanghai hairy crab.[288] Haipai cuisine, on the other hand, is a Western-influenced cooking style that originated in Shanghai. It absorbed elements from French, British, Russian, German, and Italian cuisines and adapted them to suit the local taste according to the features of local ingredients.[289] Famous dishes of Haipai cuisine include Shanghai-style borscht (\u7f57\u5b8b\u6c64, \"Russian soup\"), crispy pork cutlets, and Shanghai salad derived from Olivier salad.[290] Both Benbang and Haipai cuisine make use of a variety of seafood, including freshwater fish, shrimps, and crabs.[291]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\u5341\u4e07\u56fe\u4e4b\u56db (*No. 4 of a Hundred Thousand Scenes*) by Ren Xiong, a pioneer of the Shanghai School of Chinese art, c.\u20091850\nThe Songjiang School (\u6dde\u6c5f\u6d3e), containing the Huating School (\u534e\u4ead\u6d3e) founded by Gu Zhengyi,[292] was a small painting school in Shanghai during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.[293] It was represented by Dong Qichang.[294] The school was considered an expansion of the Wu School in Suzhou, the cultural center of the Jiangnan region at the time.[295] In the mid 19th century, the Shanghai School movement commenced, focusing less on the symbolism emphasized by the Literati style but more on the visual content of painting through the use of bright colors. Secular objects like flowers and birds were often selected as themes.[296] Western art was introduced to Shanghai in 1847 by Spanish missionary Joannes Ferrer (\u8303\u5ef7\u4f50), and the city's first Western atelier was established in 1864 inside the Tushanwan orphanage\u00a0[zh; fr].[297] During the Republic of China, many famous artists including Zhang Daqian, Liu Haisu, Xu Beihong, Feng Zikai, and Yan Wenliang settled in Shanghai, allowing it to gradually become the art center of China. Various art forms\u2014including photography, wood carving, sculpture, comics (Manhua), and Lianhuanhua\u2014thrived. Sanmao was created to dramatize the chaos created by the Second Sino-Japanese War.[298] Today, the most comprehensive art and cultural facility in Shanghai is the China Art Museum. In addition, the Chinese Painting Academy features traditional Chinese painting,[299] while the Power Station of Art displays contemporary art.[300] The city also has many art galleries, many of which are located in the M50 Art District and Tianzifang. First held in 1996, the Shanghai Biennale has become an important place for Chinese and foreign arts to interact.[301]\n\n![](image)Mei Lanfang performing the Peking opera \"Resisting the Jin Army\" at Tianchan Theatre\nTraditional Chinese opera (Xiqu) became a popular source of public entertainment in the late 19th century. In the early 20th century, monologue and burlesque in Shanghainese appeared, absorbing elements from traditional dramas. The Great World opened in 1912 and was a significant stage at the time.[302] In the 1920s, Pingtan expanded from Suzhou to Shanghai.[303] Pingtan art developed rapidly to 103 programs every day by the 1930s because of the abundant commercial radio stations in the city. Around the same time, a Shanghai-style Beijing Opera was formed. Led by Zhou Xinfang and Gai Jiaotian\u00a0[zh], it attracted many Xiqu masters, like Mei Lanfang, to the city.[304] A small troupe from Shengxian (now Shengzhou) also began to promote Yue opera on the Shanghainese stage.[305] A unique style of opera, Shanghai opera, was formed when local folksongs were fused with modern operas.[306] As of 2012, prominent troupes in Shanghai include Shanghai Jingju Theatre Company, Shanghai Kunqu Opera Troupe\u00a0[zh], Shanghai Yue Opera House, and Shanghai Huju Opera House.[307]\n\n\nDrama appeared in missionary schools in Shanghai in the late 19th century. At the time, it was mainly performed in English. *Scandals in Officialdom* (\u5b98\u573a\u4e11\u53f2), staged in 1899, was one of the earliest-recorded plays.[308] In 1907, *Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly* (\u9ed1\u5974\u5401\u5929\u5f55) was performed at the Lyceum Theatre\u00a0[zh].[309] After the New Culture Movement, drama became a popular way for students and intellectuals to express their views. The city has several major institutes of theater training, including the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre, the Shanghai Opera House, and the Shanghai Theatre Academy. Notable theaters in Shanghai include the Shanghai Grand Theatre, the Oriental Art Center, and the People's Theatre.\n\n\n\n![](image)In this Shanghainese soap advertisement from the 1930s, two women are wearing Shanghai-styled *qipao* while playing golf.\nShanghai is considered to be the birthplace of Chinese cinema.[310] China's first short film, *The Difficult Couple* (1913), and the country's first fictional feature film, *An Orphan Rescues His Grandfather* (\u5b64\u513f\u6551\u7956\u8bb0, 1923)[311] were both produced in Shanghai. Shanghai's film industry grew during the early 1930s, generating stars such as Hu Die, Ruan Lingyu, Zhou Xuan, Jin Yan, and Zhao Dan. Another film star, Jiang Qing, went on to become Madame Mao Zedong. The exile of Shanghainese filmmakers and actors as a result of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Communist revolution contributed enormously to the development of the Hong Kong film industry.[312] The movie *In the Mood for Love* directed by Wong Kar-wai, a Shanghai native, depicts a slice of the displaced Shanghainese community in Hong Kong and the nostalgia for that era, featuring 1940s music by Zhou Xuan.[313]\n\n\nShanghai's cultural festivals include Shanghai International Television Festival, Shanghai International Film Festival, Shanghai International Art Festival, Shanghai International Tourism Festival, Shanghai Spring International Music Festival, etc. Shanghai TV Festival is the earliest international TV festival founded in China. It was founded in 1986. The Shanghai International Film Festival was founded in 1993 and is one of the nine major international film festivals in the A category. The highest award is the \"Golden Goblet Award\"[314]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\nSince 2001, Shanghai has held its own fashion week called Shanghai Fashion Week twice every year in April and October. The main venue is in Fuxing Park, and the opening and closing ceremonies are held in the Shanghai Fashion Center. The April session is also part of the one-month Shanghai International Fashion Culture Festival.[315] Shanghai Fashion Week is considered to be an event of national significance featuring both international and Chinese designers. The international presence has included many promising young British fashion designers.[316] The event is hosted by the Shanghai Municipal Government and supported by the People's Republic Ministry of Commerce.[317]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)F1 Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai\nShanghai is home to several football teams, including two in the Chinese Super League: Shanghai Shenhua[318] and Shanghai Port.[319] China's top-tier basketball team, the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association, developed Yao Ming before he entered the NBA.[320][321] Shanghai's baseball team, the Shanghai Golden Eagles, plays in the China Baseball League.[322]\n\n\nThe Shanghai Cricket Club dates back to 1858 when the first recorded cricket match was played between a team of British Naval officers and a Shanghai 11. Following a 45-year dormancy after the founding of the PRC in 1949, the club was re-established in 1994 by expatriates living in the city and has since grown to over 300 members. The Shanghai cricket team played various international matches between 1866 and 1948. With cricket in the rest of China almost non-existent, for that period they were the de facto China national cricket team.[323]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yao Ming was born in Shanghai. He started his career with the Shanghai Sharks.\nShanghai is home to many prominent Chinese professional athletes, such as basketball player Yao Ming,[321] 110 metres hurdles Liu Xiang,[324] table tennis player Wang Liqin,[325] and badminton player Wang Yihan.[326]\n\n\n\n![](image)Shanghai Masters in Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena\nShanghai is the host of several international sports events. Since 2004, it has hosted the Chinese Grand Prix, a round of the Formula One World Championship. The race is staged annually at the Shanghai International Circuit.[327] It hosted the 1000th Formula One race on 14 April 2019. In 2010, Shanghai became the host city of Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters, which raced in a street circuit in Pudong. In 2012, Shanghai began hosting 4 Hours of Shanghai as one round from the inaugural season of the FIA World Endurance Championship. The city also hosts the Shanghai Masters tennis tournament, which is part of ATP World Tour Masters 1000, as well as golf tournaments including the BMW Masters and WGC-HSBC Champions.[328]\n\n\nOn 21 September 2017, Shanghai hosted a National Hockey League (NHL) ice hockey exhibition game in an effort to increase fan interest for the 2017\u201318 NHL season.[329]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\n### Parks and resorts[edit]\n\n\nShanghai has an extensive public park system; by 2018, the city had 300 parks, of which 281 had free admission, and the per capita park area was 8.2\u00a0m2 (88\u00a0sq\u00a0ft).[330] Some of the parks also have become popular tourist attractions due to their unique location, history, or architecture.\n\n\n\n![](image)People's Square\nThe People's Square park, located in the heart of downtown Shanghai, is especially well known for its proximity to other major landmarks in the city. Fuxing Park, located in the former French Concession, features formal French-style gardens and is surrounded by high-end bars and cafes.[331]\n\n\nZhongshan Park, in western central Shanghai, is famous for its monument of Chopin, the tallest statue dedicated to the composer in the world.[332] Built in 1914 as Jessfield Park, it once contained the campus of St. John's University, Shanghai's first international college; today, the park features sakura and peony gardens and a 150-year-old platanus,[333] and it also serves as an interchange hub in the metro system.[334]\n\n\nOne of Shanghai's newer parks is the Xujiahui Park, which was built in 1999, on the former grounds of the Great Chinese Rubber Works Factory and the EMI Recording Studio (now La Villa Rouge restaurant). The park has an artificial lake with a sky bridge running across the park.[335] Shanghai Botanical Garden is located 12\u00a0km (7\u00a0mi) southwest of the city center and was established in 1978. In 2011, the largest botanical garden in Shanghai\u2014Shanghai Chen Shan Botanical Garden\u2014opened in Songjiang District.[336]\n\n\n\n![](image)Enchanted Storybook Castle of Shanghai Disneyland\nOther notable parks in Shanghai include Lu Xun Park, Century Park, Gucun Park, Gongqing Forest Park, and Jing'an Park.\n\n\nThe Shanghai Disney Resort Project was approved by the government on 4 November 2009[337] and opened in 2016.[338]\nThe $4.4\u00a0billion theme park and resort in Pudong features a castle that is the biggest among Disney's resorts.[339] More than 11 million people visited the resort in its first year of operation.[340]\n\n\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pollution in China \u00a7\u00a0Air pollution\n\n![](image)Huangpu District during the 2013 Eastern China smog\nAir pollution in Shanghai is not as severe as in many other Chinese cities, but is still considered substantial by world standards.[341] During the December 2013 Eastern China smog, air pollution rates reached between 23 and 31 times the international standard.[342][343] On 6 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter in Shanghai rose above 600 micrograms per cubic meter and in the surrounding area, above 700 micrograms per cubic meter.[343] Levels of PM2.5 in Putuo District reached 726 micrograms per cubic meter.[344][345] As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Education Commission received orders to suspend students' outdoor activities. Authorities pulled nearly one-third of government vehicles from the roads, while much construction work was halted. Most inbound flights were canceled, and more than 50 flights at Pudong International Airport were diverted.[346]\n\n\nOn 23 January 2014, Yang Xiong, the mayor of Shanghai, announced that three main measures would be taken to manage the air pollution in Shanghai, along with surrounding Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces.[347] The measures involved implementing the 2013 air-cleaning program, establishing a linkage mechanism with the three surrounding provinces, and improving the city's early-warning systems.[347] On 12 February 2014, China's cabinet announced that a CN\u00a510 billion (US$1.7 billion) fund will be set up to help companies meet the new environmental standards.[348] The effect of the policy was significant. From 2013 to 2018, more than 3,000 treatment facilities for industrial waste gases were installed, and the city's annual smoke, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide emission decreased by 65%, 54%, and 95%, respectively.[349][350]\n\n\n\n### Environmental protection[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A residual waste truck and a kitchen waste truck on Zhonghua Road\nPublic awareness of the environment is growing, and the city is investing in a number of environmental protection projects. A 16-year rehabilitation of Suzhou Creek, which runs through the city, was finished in 2012, clearing the creek of barges and factories and removing 1.3 million cubic meters of sludge.[351][352] Additionally, the government has moved almost all the factories within the city center to either the outskirts or other provinces,[353] and provided incentives for transportation companies to invest in LPG buses and taxis.\n\n\nOn 1 July 2019, Shanghai adopted a new garbage-classification system that sorts out waste into residual waste, kitchen waste, recyclable waste, and hazardous waste.[354] The wastes are collected by separate vehicles and sent to incineration plants, landfills, recycling centers, and hazardous-waste-disposal facilities, respectively.[355]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nMedia in Shanghai\u00a0[zh] covers newspapers, publisher, broadcast, television, and Internet, with some media having influence over the country. In regard to foreign publications in Shanghai, Hartmut Walravens of the IFLA Newspapers Section said that when the Japanese controlled Shanghai in the 1940s \"it was very difficult to publish good papers \u2013 one either had to concentrate on emigration problems, or cooperate like the *Chronicle*\".[356]\n\n\nAs of March\u00a02020[update], newspapers publishing in Shanghai include:\n\n\n\n* *Jiefang Daily*\n* *Oriental Sports Daily*\n* *Shanghai Review of Books*\n* *Shanghai Daily*\n* *Shanghai Star*\n* *Xinmin Evening News*\n* *Wen Hui Bao*\n* *Wenhui Book Review*\n\nNewspapers formerly

Mumbai is the *de facto* financial centre and the most populous city of India with an estimated city proper population of 12.5\u00a0million (1.25\u00a0crore).[19] Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23 million (2.3 crore) living within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.[20] Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city.[21][22]\n\n\nThe seven islands that constitute Mumbai were earlier home to communities of Marathi language-speaking Koli people.[23][24][25] For centuries, the seven islands of Bombay were under the control of successive indigenous rulers before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire, and subsequently to the East India Company in 1661, through the dowry of Catherine Braganza when she was married off to Charles II of England.[26] Beginning in 1782, Mumbai was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project,[27] which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea.[28] Along with the construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Mumbai into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Mumbai in the 19th century was characterized by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Mumbai as the capital.[29]\n\n\nMumbai is the financial, commercial,[30] and the entertainment capital of India. It is also one of the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow,[31] generating 6.16% of India's GDP,[32] and accounting for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai Port Trust, Dharamtar Port and JNPT),[33] and 70% of capital transactions to India's economy.[34][35] The city houses important financial institutions and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is also home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes. The city is also home to the Bollywood and Marathi cinema industries. Mumbai's business opportunities attracts migrants from all over India.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Mumbai* (Marathi: \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908, Gujarati: \u0aae\u0ac1\u0a82\u0aac\u0a88) is derived from *Mumb\u0101* or *Mah\u0101-Amb\u0101*\u2014the name of the patron Hindu goddess (kuladevata) Mumbadevi of the native Koli community[36]\u2014and from *\u0101'\u012b*, meaning \"mother\" in the Marathi language, which is the mother tongue of the Koli people and the official language of Maharashtra.[23][37] According to certain accounts, the Koli community, which hails from Kathiawar and Central Gujarat, is believed to have introduced their deity Mumba from Kathiawar (Gujarat), where her worship continues to this day.[24][25] However, other sources disagree that Mumbai's name was derived from the goddess Mumba.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Mumba Devi Temple, from whom the city of Mumbai may derive its name.\nThe oldest known names for the city are *Kakamuchee* and *Galajunkja*; these are sometimes still used.[38][39] Portuguese writer Gaspar Correia recorded the name \"Bombaim\" after 1512 in his *Lendas da \u00cdndia* (*Legends of India*).[40][41] While some anglophone authors have suggested this name possibly originated as an alleged Galician-Portuguese phrase *bom baim*, meaning \"good little bay\",[42] such suggestions lack any scientific basis.[43] Portuguese linguist Jos\u00e9 Pedro Machado attributes that interpretation to a deficient knowledge of the Portuguese language of these authors, mixing up the Portuguese word \"bom\" with the English \"bay\", from the English version of the name.[43] In 1516, Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa used the name *Tana-Maiambu*: *Tana* appears to refer to the adjoining town of Thane and *Maiambu* to *Mumbadevi*.[44] The form *Bombaim* is still commonly used in Portuguese.[45]\n\n\nOther variations recorded in the 16th and the 17th centuries include: *Mombayn* (1525), *Bombay* (1538), *Bombain* (1552), *Bombaym* (1552), *Monbaym* (1554), *Mombaim* (1563), *Mombaym* (1644), *Bambaye* (1666), *Bombaiim* (1666), *Bombeye* (1676), *Boon Bay* (1690)[45][46] and *Bon Bahia*.[47] After the English gained possession of the city in the 17th century, the Portuguese name was anglicised as *Bombay*.[48] Ali Muhammad Khan, imperial dewan or revenue minister of the Gujarat province, in the *Mirat-i Ahmedi* (1762) referred to the city as *Manbai*.[49]\n\n\nThe French traveller Louis Rousselet, who visited in 1863 and 1868, states in his book *L'Inde des Rajahs*, which was first published in 1877: \"Etymologists have wrongly derived this name from the Portuguese B\u00f4a Bahia, or (French: \"bonne bai\", English: \"good bay\"), not knowing that the tutelar goddess of this island has been, from remote antiquity, Bomba, or Mumba Devi, and that she still ... possesses a temple\".[50]\n\n\nBy the late 20th century, the city was referred to as *Mumbai* or *Mambai* in Marathi, Konkani, Gujarati, Kannada and Sindhi, and as *Bambai* in Hindi.[51] The Government of India officially changed the English name to *Mumbai* in November 1995.[52] This came at the insistence of the Marathi nationalist Shiv Sena party, which had just won the Maharashtra state elections, and mirrored similar name changes across the country and particularly in Maharashtra.[53] According to *Slate* magazine, \"they argued that 'Bombay' was a corrupted English version of 'Mumbai' and an unwanted legacy of British colonial rule.\"[54] *Slate* also said \"The push to rename Bombay was part of a larger movement to strengthen Marathi identity in the Maharashtra region.\"[55] While Mumbai is still referred to as Bombay by some of its residents and by some Indians from other regions,[56][57] mention of the city by a name other than *Mumbai* has been controversial.[58][59]\n\n\n\n### People from Mumbai[edit]\n\n\nA resident of Mumbai is called *Mumbaikar* (pronounced [mumb\u0259ik\u0259\u027e]) in Marathi, in which the suffix *-kar* means a *resident of*. The term had been in use for quite some time but it gained popularity after the official name change to Mumbai.[60] Older terms such as *Bombayite* are also used.[61][62]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Mumbai\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Mumbai.\n\nHistorical affiliations\n\n\n> \n> ![](image) Bombay Presidency 1843\u20131947  \n> ![](image) Bombay State 1947\u20131960  \n> ![](image) Maharashtra 1960\u2013Present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![A white Buddhist stupa.](image)Kanheri Caves contain Buddhist sculptures and paintings dating from the 1st century CE to the 10th century CE.\nMumbai is built on what was once an archipelago of seven islands: Isle of Bombay, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as *Little Colaba*).[63] It is not exactly known when these islands were first inhabited. Pleistocene sediments found along the coastal areas around Kandivali in northern Mumbai suggest that the islands were inhabited since the South Asian Stone Age.[64] Perhaps at the beginning of the Common Era, or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the Koli fishing community.[65][66]\n\n\nIn the 3rd century BCE, the islands formed part of the Maurya Empire, during its expansion in the south, ruled by the Buddhist emperor Ashoka of Magadha.[67] The Kanheri Caves in Borivali were excavated from basalt rock in the first century CE,[68] and served as an important centre of Buddhism in Western India during ancient Times.[69] The city then was known as *Heptanesia* (Ancient Greek: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek geographer Ptolemy in 150\u00a0CE.[70] The Mahakali Caves in Andheri were cut out between the 1st century BCE and the 6th century CE.[71][72]\n\n\nBetween the 2nd century BCE and 9th century CE, the islands came under the control of successive indigenous dynasties: Satavahanas, Western Satraps, Abhira, Vakataka, Kalachuris, Konkan Mauryas, Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas,[73] before being ruled by the Shilaharas from 810 to 1260.[74] Some of the oldest edifices in the city built during this period are the Jogeshwari Caves (between 520 and 525),[75] Elephanta Caves (between the sixth to seventh century),[76] Walkeshwar Temple (10th century),[77][78] and Banganga Tank (12th century).[79][80]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Haji Ali Dargah was built in 1431, when Mumbai was under the rule of the Gujarat Sultanate.\nKing Bhimdev founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century and established his capital in *Mahikawati* (present day Mahim).[81] The Pathare Prabhus, among the earliest known settlers of the city, were brought to *Mahikawati* from Saurashtra in Gujarat around 1298 by Bhimdev.[82] The Delhi Sultanate annexed the islands in 1347\u201348 and controlled it until 1407. During this time, the islands were administered by the Muslim Governors of Gujarat, who were appointed by the Delhi Sultanate.[83][84]\n\n\nThe islands were later governed by the independent Gujarat Sultanate, which was established in 1407. As a result of the Sultanate's support, numerous mosques were built, with one notable example being the Haji Ali Dargah in Worli. Erected in 1431, this magnificent structure pays homage to the revered Muslim saint, Haji Ali.[85] From 1429 to 1431, the islands were a source of contention between the Gujarat Sultanate and the Bahmani Sultanate of Deccan.[86][87] In 1493, Bahadur Khan Gilani of the Bahmani Sultanate attempted to conquer the islands but was defeated.[88]\n\n\n\n### Portuguese and British rule[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Bombay under Portuguese rule (1534\u20131661) and History of Bombay under British rule\n\n![](image)The Madh Fort, built by the Portuguese, was one of the most important forts in Salsette.\nThe Mughal Empire, founded in 1526, was the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent during the mid-16th century.[89] Growing apprehensive of the power of the Mughal emperor Humayun, Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat was obliged to sign the Treaty of Bassein with the Portuguese Empire on 23 December 1534. According to the treaty, the Seven Islands of Bombay, the nearby strategic town of Bassein and its dependencies were offered to the Portuguese. The territories were later surrendered on 25 October 1535.[90]\n\n\n\n![](image)Flora Fountain, built in Neo Classical and Gothic Revival style in 1864, depicts the Roman goddess Flora.\nThe Portuguese were actively involved in the foundation and growth of their Roman Catholic religious orders in Bombay.[91] They called the islands by various names, which finally took the written form *Bombaim*. The islands were leased to several Portuguese officers during their regime. The Portuguese Franciscans and Jesuits built several churches in the city, prominent being the St. Michael's Church at Mahim (1534),[92] St. John the Baptist Church at Andheri (1579),[93] St. Andrew's Church at Bandra (1580),[94] and Gloria Church at Byculla (1632).[95] The Portuguese also built several fortifications around the city like the Bombay Castle, *Castella de Aguada* (Castelo da Aguada or Bandra Fort), and Madh Fort. The English were in constant struggle with the Portuguese vying for hegemony over Mumbai, as they recognised its strategic natural harbour and its natural isolation from land attacks. By the middle of the 17th century the growing power of the Dutch Empire forced the English to acquire a station in western India. On 11 May 1661, the marriage treaty of Charles II of England and Catherine of Braganza, daughter of King John IV of Portugal, placed the islands in possession of the English Empire, as part of Catherine's dowry to Charles.[96] However, Salsette, Bassein, Mazagaon, Parel, Worli, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala still remained under Portuguese possession. From 1665 to 1666, the English managed to acquire Mahim, Sion, Dharavi, and Wadala.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Two views of the English fort in Bombay, c.\u20091665\nIn accordance with the Royal Charter of 27 March 1668, England leased these islands to the English East India Company in 1668 for a sum of \u00a310 per annum.[98] The population quickly rose from 10,000 in 1661, to 60,000 in 1675.[99] The islands were subsequently attacked by Yakut Khan, the Muslim Koli[100][101][102][103] admiral of the Mughal Empire, in October 1672,[104] Rickloffe van Goen, the Governor-General of Dutch India on 20 February 1673,[105] and Siddi admiral Sambal on 10 October 1673.[104]\n\n\nIn 1687, the English East India Company transferred its headquarters from Surat to Mumbai. The city eventually became the headquarters of the Bombay Presidency.[106] Following the transfer, Mumbai was placed at the head of all the company's establishments in India.[107] Towards the end of the 17th century, the islands again suffered incursions from Yakut Khan in 1689\u201390.[108] The Portuguese presence ended in Mumbai when the Marathas under *Peshwa* Baji Rao I captured Salsette in 1737, and Bassein in 1739.[109]\nBy the middle of the 18th century, Mumbai began to grow into a major trading town, and received a huge influx of migrants from across India.[110] Later, the British occupied Salsette on 28 December 1774. With the Treaty of Surat (1775), the British formally gained control of Salsette and Bassein, resulting in the First Anglo-Maratha War.[111] The British were able to secure Salsette from the Marathas without violence through the Treaty of Purandar (1776),[112] and later through the Treaty of Salbai (1782), signed to settle the outcome of the First Anglo-Maratha War.[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ships in Mumbai Harbour (c. 1731). Mumbai emerged as a significant trading town during the mid-18th century.\nFrom 1782 onwards, the city was reshaped with large-scale civil engineering projects aimed at merging all the seven islands of Bombay into a single amalgamated mass by way of a causeway called the Hornby Vellard, which was completed by 1784.[27][114] In 1817, the British East India Company under Mountstuart Elphinstone defeated Baji Rao II, the last of the Maratha *Peshwa* in the Battle of Khadki.[115] Following his defeat, almost the whole of the Deccan Plateau came under British suzerainty, and was incorporated into the Bombay Presidency. The success of the British campaign in the Deccan marked the end of all attacks by native powers.[116]\n\n\nBy 1845, the seven islands coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard project via large scale land reclamation.[28][117] On 16 April 1853, India's first passenger railway line was established, connecting Mumbai to the neighbouring town of Thana (now Thane).[118] During the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), the city became the world's chief cotton-trading market, resulting in a boom in the economy that subsequently enhanced the city's stature.[119]\n\n\nThe opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 transformed Mumbai into one of the largest seaports on the Arabian Sea.[120] In September 1896, Mumbai was hit by a bubonic plague epidemic where the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week.[121] About 850,000 people fled Mumbai and the textile industry was adversely affected.[122] While the city was the capital of the Bombay Presidency, the Indian independence movement fostered the Quit India Movement in 1942 and the Royal Indian Navy mutiny in 1946.[123][124]\n\n\n\n### Independent India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Bombay in Independent India\n\n![](image)Municipal Corporation Building, Mumbai in 1950 (Victoria Terminus partly visible on far right)\nAfter India's independence in 1947, the territory of the Bombay Presidency retained by India was restructured into Bombay State. The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into the state. Subsequently, the city became the capital of Bombay State.[125] In April 1950, Municipal limits of Mumbai were expanded by merging the Mumbai Suburban District and Mumbai City to form the Greater Mumbai Municipal Corporation.[126]\n\n\nThe Samyukta Maharashtra movement to create a separate Maharashtra state including Mumbai was at its height in the 1950s. In the *Lok Sabha* discussions in 1955, the Congress party demanded that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state.[127] The States Reorganisation Committee recommended a bilingual state for Maharashtra\u2013Gujarat with Mumbai as its capital in its 1955 report. Bombay Citizens' Committee, an advocacy group of leading Gujarati industrialists lobbied for Mumbai's independent status.[128]\n\n\n\nFollowing protests during the movement in which 105 people died in clashes with the police, Bombay State was reorganised on linguistic lines on 1 May 1960.[129] Gujarati-speaking areas of Bombay State were partitioned into the state of Gujarat.[130] Maharashtra State with Mumbai as its capital was formed with the merger of Marathi-speaking areas of Bombay State, eight districts from Central Provinces and Berar, five districts from Hyderabad State, and numerous princely states enclosed between them.[131] As a memorial to the martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, Flora Fountain was renamed as *Hutatma Chowk* (Martyr's Square) and a memorial was erected.[132] \n\n![A stone statue of torch-bearers as seen at night. A fountain with a white base is in the background](image)The Hutatma Chowk memorial, built to honour the martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement (Flora Fountain on its left in the background)The following decades saw massive expansion of the city and its suburbs. In the late 1960s, Nariman Point and Cuffe Parade were reclaimed and developed.[133] The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (BMRDA) was established on 26 January 1975 by the Government of Maharashtra as an apex body for planning and co-ordination of development activities in the Mumbai metropolitan region.[134] In August 1979, a sister township of New Mumbai was founded by the City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) across the Thane and Raigad districts to help the dispersal and control of Mumbai's population. The textile industry in Mumbai largely disappeared after the widespread 1982 Great Bombay Textile Strike, in which nearly 250,000 workers in more than 50 textile mills went on strike.[135] Mumbai's defunct cotton mills have since become the focus of intense redevelopment.[136][137] Industrial development began in Mumbai when its economy started focusing on the petrochemical, electronic, and automotive sectors. In 1954 Hindustan Petroleum comissoned Mumbai Refinery at Trombay and BPCL Refinery.[138]\n\n\nThe Jawaharlal Nehru Port, which handles 55\u201360% of India's containerized cargo, was commissioned on 26 May 1989 across the creek at Nhava Sheva with a view to de-congest Mumbai Harbour and to serve as a hub port for the city.[139] The geographical limits of Greater Mumbai were coextensive with municipal limits of Greater Mumbai. On 1 October 1990, the Greater Mumbai district was bifurcated to form two revenue districts namely, Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban, though they continued to be administered by same Municipal Administration.[140]\n\n\nThe years from 1990 to 2010 saw an increase in violence and terrorism activities. Following the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the city was rocked by the Hindu-Muslim riots of 1992\u201393 in which more than 1,000\u00a0people were killed. In March 1993, a series of 13 coordinated bombings at several city landmarks by Islamic extremists and the Mumbai underworld resulted in 257 deaths and over 700 injuries.[141] In 2006, 209 people were killed and over 700 injured when seven bombs exploded on the city's commuter trains.[142] In 2008, a series of ten coordinated attacks by armed terrorists for three days resulted in 173 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several heritage landmarks and prestigious hotels.[143] The three coordinated bomb explosions in July 2011 that occurred at the Opera house, Zaveri Bazaar and Dadar were the latest in the series of terrorist attacks in Mumbai which resulted in 26 deaths and 130 injuries.[144][145]\n\n\nMumbai is the commercial capital of India and has evolved into a global financial hub.[146] For several decades it has been the home of India's main financial services companies, and a focus for both infrastructure development and private investment.[147] From being an ancient fishing community and a colonial centre of trade, Mumbai has become South Asia's largest city and home of the world's most prolific film industry.[148]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Mumbai\n\nSee also: South Mumbai, Western Suburbs (Mumbai), Eastern Suburbs (Mumbai), and List of neighbourhoods in Mumbai\n\n![](image)Satellite image of Mumbai\n![](image)Mumbai consists of two revenue districts.\nMumbai is on a narrow peninsula on the southwest of Salsette Island, which lies between the Arabian Sea to the west, Thane Creek to the east and Vasai Creek to the north. Mumbai's suburban district occupies most of the island. Navi Mumbai is east of Thane Creek and Thane is north of Vasai Creek. Mumbai consists of two distinct regions: Mumbai City district and Mumbai Suburban district, which form two separate revenue districts of Maharashtra.[149] The city district region is also commonly referred to as the *Island City* or South Mumbai.[32] The total area of Mumbai is 603.4\u00a0km2 (233 sq mi).[150] Of this, the island city spans 67.79\u00a0km2 (26 sq mi), while the suburban district spans 370\u00a0km2 (143 sq mi), together accounting for 437.71\u00a0km2 (169 sq mi) under the administration of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). The remaining areas belong to various Defence establishments, the Mumbai Port Trust, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Borivali National Park, which are out of the jurisdiction of the MCGM.[151] The Mumbai Metropolitan Region which includes portions of Thane, Palghar and Raigad districts in addition to Greater Mumbai, covers an area of 4,355\u00a0km2 (1681.5 sq mi).[8]\nMumbai lies at the mouth of the Ulhas River on the western coast of India, in the coastal region known as the Konkan. It sits on Salsette Island (Sashti Island), which it partially shares with the Thane district.[152] Mumbai is bounded by the Arabian Sea to the west.[153] Many parts of the city lie just above sea level, with elevations ranging from 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) to 15\u00a0m (49\u00a0ft);[154] the city has an average elevation of 14\u00a0m (46\u00a0ft).[155] Northern Mumbai (Salsette) is hilly,[156] and the highest point in the city is 450\u00a0m (1,476\u00a0ft) at Salsette in the Powai\u2013Kanheri ranges.[157] The Sanjay Gandhi National Park (Borivali National Park) is located partly in the Mumbai suburban district, and partly in the Thane district, and it extends over an area of 103.09\u00a0km2 (39.80 sq mi).[158]\n\n\nApart from the Bhatsa Dam, there are six major lakes that supply water to the city: Vihar, Lower Vaitarna, Upper Vaitarna, Tulsi, Tansa and Powai. Tulsi Lake and Vihar Lake are located in Borivili National Park, within the city's limits. The supply from Powai lake, also within the city limits, is used only for agricultural and industrial purposes.[159] Three small rivers, the Dahisar River, Poinsar (or Poisar) and Ohiwara (or Oshiwara) originate within the park, while the Mithi River originates from Tulsi Lake and gathers water overflowing from Vihar and Powai Lakes.[160] The coastline of the city is indented with numerous creeks and bays, stretching from the Thane creek on the\neastern to Madh Marve on the western front.[161] The eastern coast of Salsette Island is covered with large mangrove swamps, rich in biodiversity, while the western coast is mostly sandy and rocky.[162]\n\n\nSoil cover in the city region is predominantly sandy due to its proximity to the sea. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely alluvial and loamy.[163] The underlying rock of the region is composed of black Deccan basalt flows, and their acidic and basic variants dating back to the late Cretaceous and early Eocene eras.[164] Mumbai sits on a seismically active zone owing to the presence of 23 fault lines in the vicinity.[165] The area is classified as a Seismic Zone III region,[166] which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter magnitude scale may be expected.[167]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Mumbai\n\nSee also: Mumbai Climate Action Plan\n\n![The average temperature ranges between 23\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u00a0\u00b0F) in January to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) in May. Rainfall is at or near zero from November through May, then quickly rises to a peak of about 600\u00a0mm (23.62\u00a0in) in July, falling back more gradually.](image)Average temperature and precipitation in Mumbai\n![](image)Skyline of Mumbai during a monsoon\nMumbai has an extreme tropical wet and dry climate (*Aw*) under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, although the central and northern suburbs have a tropical monsoon climate (*Am*) with even heavier wet season rainfall. Mumbai has a virtually rainless period extending from October to May and an extremely wet period peaking in July.[168] A cooler season from December to February is followed by a hotter season from March to May. The period from June to about the end of September constitutes the south west monsoon season, and October and November form the post-monsoon season.[169]\n\n\nBetween June and September, the South-west monsoon rains occur in Mumbai. Pre-monsoon showers are received in May. Occasionally, north-east monsoon showers occur in October and November. The maximum annual rainfall ever recorded was 3,452\u00a0mm (136\u00a0in) for 1954.[170] The highest rainfall recorded in a single day was 944\u00a0mm (37\u00a0in) on 26 July 2005.[171] The average total annual rainfall is 2,213.4\u00a0mm (87\u00a0in) for the Island City, and 2,502.3\u00a0mm (99\u00a0in) for the suburbs.[170]\n\n\nThe average annual temperature is 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F), and the average annual precipitation is 2,213\u00a0mm (87\u00a0in).[172] In the Island City, the average maximum temperature is 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F), while the average minimum temperature is 24\u00a0\u00b0C (75\u00a0\u00b0F). In the suburbs, the daily mean maximum temperature range from 29\u00a0\u00b0C (84\u00a0\u00b0F) to 33\u00a0\u00b0C (91\u00a0\u00b0F), while the daily mean minimum temperature ranges from 16\u00a0\u00b0C (61\u00a0\u00b0F) to 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F).[170] The record high is 42.2\u00a0\u00b0C (108\u00a0\u00b0F) set on 14 April 1952,[173] and the record low is 7.4\u00a0\u00b0C (45\u00a0\u00b0F) set on 27 January 1962.[173][174]\n\n\nTropical cyclones are rare in the city. The worst cyclone to ever impact Mumbai was the one in 1948 where gusts reached 151\u00a0km/h (94\u00a0mph) in Juhu. The storm left 38 people dead and 47 missing. The storm reportedly impacted Mumbai for 20 hours and left the city devastated.[175][176][177]\n\n\n\nMumbai is prone to monsoon floods,[178][179] caused due to climate change that is affected by heavy rains and high tide in the sea, according to the World Bank, unplanned drainage system and informal settlement is a key factor of frequent floods in Mumbai.[180] Among other causes of flooding in Mumbai is its geographic location, Mumbai urban is peninsular in form, (a land-filled area that connects seven islands) a low laying area, compared to its suburbs that sit on an elevated location. Over the past few decades, new informal settlements were formed in the suburbs, causing a rapid increase in population, improper waste management, and drainage congestion. The rainwater from these areas heavily flows towards low-lying urban areas consisting of some slums and high-rise buildings. As a result, slums are either swamped, washed away, or collapse causing heavy casualties, and post-flood water logging lasts for a long time that causing blockage of railway lines-(most frequently used public transport in Mumbai), traffic snarl, inundated roads, and sub-merged bylanes. Over the past few decades, the frequency of floods in Mumbai is enormous, the 2005 Mumbai floods are characterized by 500-1000 deaths, household displacements, damaged infrastructure-(including heritage sites), and a financial loss of US$ 1.2\u00a0billion.[180][181] In the process of reducing floods in Mumbai, the Maharashtra government adopted a flood mitigation plan; according to which the drainage system will be restructured, restoration of Mithi River, and re-establishment of informal settlements. Local civic body Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities are assigned to forecast and issue eviction notices while BMC along with NGO's prepare for the evacuation of the residents of those areas to temporary safe camps.[180][181][182]\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Mumbai (Colaba) 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1901\u2013present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n |

Mumbai.[191][192][193] According to the 2016 World Health Organization Global Urban Ambient Air Pollution Database,[194] the annual average PM2.5 concentration in 2013 was 63 \u03bcg/m3, which is 6.3 times higher than that recommended by the WHO Air Quality Guidelines[195] for the annual mean PM2.5. The Central Pollution Control Board for the Government of India and the Consulate General of the United States, Mumbai monitor and publicly share real-time air quality data.[196][197] In December 2019, IIT Bombay, in partnership with the McKelvey School of Engineering of Washington University in St. Louis launched the Aerosol and Air Quality Research Facility to study air pollution in Mumbai, among other Indian cities.[198]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Mumbai\n\n![](image)\nSome of the tallest skyscrapers of Mumbai, like World One and Lodha Park complexes, can be found in Lower Parel.\n![](image)\nAntilia and Lodha Altamount skyscrapers on Altamount Road, also known as India's Billionaires' Row.\n\nMumbai is India's largest city (by population) and is the financial and commercial capital of the country as it generates 6.16% of the total GDP.[32][146][199] It serves as an economic hub of India; as of 2006, Mumbai contributed 10% of the nation's factory employment, 25% of industrial output, 33% of income tax collections, 60% of customs duty collections, 20% of central excise tax collections, 40% of foreign trade, and \u20b940 billion (equivalent to \u20b9130\u00a0billion or US$1.5\u00a0billion in 2023) in corporate taxes.[200]\n\n\nAlong with the rest of India, Mumbai has witnessed an economic boom since the liberalisation of 1991, the finance boom in the mid-nineties and the IT, export, services and outsourcing boom in the 2000s.[201] Although Mumbai had prominently figured as the hub of economic activity of India in the 1990s, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region's contribution to India's GDP is currently declining.[202]\n\n\nRecent estimates of the economy of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region have ranged from $368\u00a0billion to $400\u00a0billion (PPP metro GDP) ranking it either the most or second-most productive metro area of India.[14][203][204][205][15] Many of India's numerous conglomerates (including Larsen & Toubro, State Bank of India (SBI), Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), Tata Group, Godrej and Reliance),[146] and five of the Fortune Global 500 companies are based in Mumbai.[206] This is facilitated by the presence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE), and financial sector regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).[202]\n\n\nUntil the 1970s, Mumbai owed its prosperity largely to textile mills and the seaport, but the local economy has since then diversified to include finance, engineering, diamond-polishing, healthcare and information technology.[207]\nThe key sectors contributing to the city's economy are: finance, gems & jewellery, leather processing, IT and ITES, textiles, petrochemical, electronics manufacturing, automobiles, and entertainment. Nariman Point and Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) are Mumbai's major financial centres.[202]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThree Sixty West Tower B, occupied by The Ritz-Carlton, is one of the tallest commercial skyscrapers in the city.\n![](image)\nThe Bombay Stock Exchange is the oldest stock exchange in Asia.\n\nDespite competition from Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune, Mumbai has carved a niche for itself in the information technology industry. The Santacruz Electronic Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ) and the International Infotech Park (Navi Mumbai) offer excellent facilities to IT companies.[208]\n\n\nState and central government employees make up a large percentage of the city's workforce. Mumbai also has a large unskilled and semi-skilled self-employed population, who primarily earn their livelihood as hawkers, taxi drivers, mechanics, and other such blue collar professions. The port and shipping industry is well established, with Mumbai Port being one of the oldest and most significant ports in India.[209] Dharavi, in central Mumbai, has an increasingly large recycling industry, processing recyclable waste from other parts of the city; the district has an estimated 15,000 single-room factories.[210]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Mumbai is home to the seventh-highest number of billionaires of any city.[211] With a total wealth of around $960\u00a0billion,[212][213] it is the richest Indian city and one of the richest cities in the world.[214] As of 2008[update], the Globalization and World Cities Study Group (GaWC) has ranked Mumbai as an \"Alpha world city\", third in its categories of Global cities.[21] Mumbai is the third most expensive office market in the world, and was ranked among the fastest cities in the country for business startup in 2009.[215]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\n### Civic administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the largest civic organisation in the country.\nGreater Mumbai (or Brihanmumbai), an area of 603\u00a0km2 (233\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[216] consisting of the Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban districts, extends from Colaba in the south, to Mulund and Dahisar in the north, and Mankhurd in the east. Its population as per the 2011 census was 12,442,373.[217]\n\n\nIt is administered by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) (sometimes referred to as the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai), formerly known as the *Bombay Municipal Corporation* (BMC).[153] The BMC is in charge of the civic and infrastructure needs of the metropolis.[218] The mayor, who serves for a term of two and a half years, is chosen through an indirect election by the councillors from among themselves.[219]\n\n\nThe municipal commissioner is the chief executive officer and head of the executive arm of the municipal corporation. All executive powers are vested in the municipal commissioner who is an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer appointed by the state government. Although the municipal corporation is the legislative body that lays down policies for the governance of the city, it is the commissioner who is responsible for the execution of the policies. The commissioner is appointed for a fixed term as defined by state statute. The powers of the commissioner are those provided by statute and those delegated by the corporation or the standing committee.[220]\n\n\nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation was ranked 9th out of 21 cities for best governance & administrative practices in India in 2014. It scored 3.5 on 10 compared to the national average of 3.3.[221]\n\n\n\n![A brown building with a central tower and sloping roofs surrounded by trees. A grassy ground and a coconut tree are in front of it.](image)The Bombay High Court exercises jurisdiction over Maharashtra, Goa, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.\nThe two revenue districts of Mumbai come under the jurisdiction of a District Collector. The collectors are in charge of property records and revenue collection for the central government, and oversee the national elections held in the city.\n\n\nThe Mumbai Police is headed by a police commissioner, who is an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer. The Mumbai Police is a division of the Maharashtra Police, under the state Home Ministry.[222] The city is divided into seven police zones and seventeen traffic police zones,[151] each headed by a deputy commissioner of police.[223] The Mumbai Traffic Police is a semi-autonomous body under the Mumbai Police. The Mumbai Fire Brigade, which is under the jurisdiction of the municipal corporation, is headed by the chief fire officer, who is assisted by four deputy chief fire officers and six divisional officers.[151] The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is responsible for infrastructure development and planning of Mumbai Metropolitan Region.[224]\n\n\nMumbai is the seat of the Bombay High Court, which exercises jurisdiction over the states of Maharashtra and Goa, and the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.[225] Mumbai also has two lower courts, the Small Causes Court for civil matters, and the Sessions Court for criminal cases. Mumbai also has a special Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (TADA) court for people accused of conspiring and abetting acts of terrorism in the city.[226]\n\n\n\n### National politics[edit]\n\n\n![Men in traditional Indian dresses posing for a photograph](image)First session of the Indian National Congress in Mumbai (28\u201331 December 1885)\nMumbai had been a traditional stronghold and birthplace of the Indian National Congress, also known as the Congress Party.[227] The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Mumbai from 28 to 31 December 1885.[228] The city played host to the Indian National Congress six times during its first 50 years, and became a strong base for the Indian independence movement during the 20th century.[229]\n\n\nThe 1960s saw the rise of regionalist politics in Mumbai, with the formation of the Shiv Sena on 19 June 1966, under the leadership of Balasaheb Thackeray out of a feeling of resentment about the relative marginalisation of the native Marathi people in Mumbai.[230] Shiv Sena switched from 'Marathi Cause' to larger 'Hindutva Cause' in 1985 and joined hands with Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in the same year.[231] The Congress had dominated the politics of Mumbai from independence until the early 1980s, when the Shiv Sena won the 1985 Mumbai Municipal Corporation elections.[232]\n\n\nIn 1989, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a major national political party, forged an electoral alliance with the Shiv Sena to dislodge the Congress in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections. In 1999, several members left the Congress to form the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) but later allied with the Congress as part of an alliance known as the Democratic Front.[233] Other parties such as Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and several independent candidates also contest elections in the city.[234]\n\n\nIn the Indian national elections held every five years, Mumbai is represented by six parliamentary constituencies: North, North West, North East, North Central, South Central, and South.[235] A member of parliament (MP) to the *Lok Sabha*, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, is elected from each of the parliamentary constituencies. In the 2019 national election, all six parliamentary constituencies were won by the BJP and Shiv Sena in alliance, with both parties winning three seats each.[236]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maharashtra Legislative Assembly\nIn the Maharashtra state assembly elections held every five years, Mumbai is represented by 36 assembly constituencies.[237][238] A member of the legislative assembly (MLA) to the Maharashtra *Vidhan Sabha* (legislative assembly) is elected from each of the assembly constituencies. In the 2019 state assembly election, out of the 36 assembly constituencies, 16 were won by the BJP, 11 by the Shiv Sena, 6 by the Congress, 2 by the NCP and one by independent candidate.[239]\n\n\nElections are also held every five years to elect corporators to power in the MCGM.[240] The Corporation comprises 227 directly elected Councillors representing the 24 municipal wards, five nominated Councillors having special knowledge or experience in municipal administration, and a mayor whose role is mostly ceremonial.[241][242][243] In the 2012 municipal corporation elections, out of the 227 seats, the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance secured 107 seats, holding power with the support of independent candidates in the MCGM, while the Congress-NCP alliance bagged 64 seats.[244] The tenure of the mayor, deputy mayor, and municipal commissioner is two and a half years.[245]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Mumbai\n\n![](image)\nRapid transit map of Mumbai\n![](image)\nThe Mumbai Suburban Railway system carries more than 69.9\u00a0lakh (6.99\u00a0million) commuters on a daily basis.

Suburban railway and BEST bus services together accounted for about 88% of the passenger traffic in 2008.[246] Auto rickshaws are allowed to operate only in the suburban areas of Mumbai, while taxis are allowed to operate throughout Mumbai, but generally operate in South Mumbai.[247] Taxis and Auto rickshaws in Mumbai are required by law to run on compressed natural gas (CNG),[248] and are a convenient, economical, and easily available means of transport.[247]\n\n\n\n#### Railway[edit]\n\n\nThe Mumbai Suburban Railway, popularly referred to as Locals forms the backbone of the city's transport system.[249] It is operated by the Central Railway and Western Railway zones of the Indian Railways.[250] Mumbai's suburban rail systems carried a total of 63\u00a0lakh (6.3\u00a0million) passengers every day in 2007.[251] Trains are overcrowded during peak hours, with nine-car trains of rated capacity 1,700 passengers, actually carrying around 4,500 passengers at peak hours.[252] The Mumbai rail network is spread at an expanse of 319 route kilometres. 191 rakes (train-sets) of 9 car and 12 car composition are utilised to run a total of 2,226 train services in the city.[253]\n\n\nThe Mumbai Monorail and Mumbai Metro have been built and are being extended in phases to relieve the overcrowding on the existing network. The Monorail opened in early February 2014.[254] The first line of the Mumbai Metro opened in early June 2014.[255]\n\n\nMumbai is the headquarters of two zones of the Indian Railways: the Central Railway (CR) headquartered at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus), and the Western Railway (WR) headquartered at Churchgate.[256] Mumbai is also well connected to most parts of India by the Indian Railways. Long-distance trains originate from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Dadar, Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Mumbai Central, Bandra Terminus, Andheri and Borivali.[257]\n\n\n\n#### Bus[edit]\n\n\nMumbai's bus services carried over 55\u00a0lakh (5.5\u00a0million) passengers per day in 2008,[246] which dropped to 28\u00a0lakh (2.8\u00a0million) in 2015.[258] Public buses run by BEST cover almost all parts of the metropolis, as well as parts of Navi Mumbai, Mira-Bhayandar and Thane.[259] The BEST operates a total of 4,608 buses[260] with CCTV cameras installed, ferrying 45\u00a0lakh (4.5\u00a0million) passengers daily[246] over 390 routes. Its fleet consists of single-decker, double-decker, vestibule, low-floor, disabled-friendly, air-conditioned and Euro III compliant diesel and compressed natural gas powered buses.[261] BEST introduced air-conditioned buses in 1998.[262] BEST buses are red in colour, based originally on the Routemaster buses of London.[263]\nMaharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC, also known as ST)[264] buses provide intercity transport connecting Mumbai with other towns and cities of Maharashtra and nearby states.[265][266] The Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport (NMMT) and Thane Municipal Transport (TMT) also operate their buses in Mumbai, connecting various nodes of Navi Mumbai and Thane to parts of Mumbai.[267][268]\n\n\nBuses are generally favoured for commuting short to medium distances, while train fares are more economical for longer distance commutes.[269]\n\n\nThe *Mumbai Darshan* is a tourist bus service which explores numerous tourist attractions in Mumbai.[270] Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) lanes have been planned throughout Mumbai.[271] Though 88% of the city's commuters travel by public transport, Mumbai still continues to struggle with traffic congestion.[272] Mumbai's transport system has been categorised as one of the most congested in the world.[273]\n\n\n\n#### Water[edit]\n\n\nWater transport in Mumbai consists of ferries, hovercraft and catamarans. Services are provided by both government agencies as well as private partners.[274] Hovercraft services plied briefly in the late 1990s between the Gateway of India and CBD Belapur in Navi Mumbai. They were subsequently scrapped due to lack of adequate infrastructure.[275]\n\n\n\n### Road[edit]\n\n\nMumbai is served by National Highway 48, National Highway 66, National Highway 160 and National Highway 61.[276] The Mumbai\u2013Chennai and Mumbai\u2013Delhi prongs of the Golden Quadrilateral system of National Highways start from the city. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway was the first expressway built in India.[277] The Eastern Freeway was opened in 2013. The Bandra-Worli Sea Link bridge, along with Mahim Causeway, links the island city to the western suburbs.[278] The three major road arteries of the city are the Eastern Express Highway from Sion to Thane, the Sion Panvel Expressway from Sion to Panvel and the Western Express Highway from Bandra to Bhayander.[279] The under-construction Mumbai Trans Harbour Link will connect Mumbai with Navi Mumbai and when completed, will be the longest sea bridge in India.[280] Mumbai has approximately 1,900\u00a0km (1,181\u00a0mi) of roads.[281] There are five tolled entry points to the city by road.[282]\n\n\nMumbai had about 721,000 private vehicles as of March 2014,[283] 56,459 black and yellow taxis as of 2005[update],[284] and 106,000 auto rickshaws, as of May 2013.[285]\n\n\nMumbai currently has one operational expressway\u2013the Mumbai\u2013Pune Expressway, which directly connects Mumbai with Pune. In the coming years, the great metropolis will be connected with more expressways. They are as follows:\n\n\n\n* Delhi\u2013Mumbai Expressway: Under construction since March 2019,[286] to be completed by December 2023.[287][288]\n* Mumbai\u2013Nagpur Expressway: Under construction since January 2019,[289] to be completed by December 2023.[290][291]\n* Konkan Expressway: Proposed.[292]\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\nThe Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (formerly Sahar International Airport) is the main aviation hub in the city and the second busiest airport in India in terms of passenger traffic.[293] It handled 36.6\u00a0million (3.66\u00a0crore) passengers and 694,300 tonnes of cargo during FY 2014\u20132015.[294] An upgrade plan was initiated in 2006, targeted at increasing the capacity of the airport to handle up to 40\u00a0million (4\u00a0crore) passengers annually[295] and the new terminal T2 was opened in February 2014.[296]\n\n\nThe proposed Navi Mumbai International airport to be built in the Kopra-Panvel area has been sanctioned by the Indian Government and will help relieve the increasing traffic burden on the existing airport.[297]\n\n\nThe Juhu Aerodrome was India's first airport, and now hosts the Bombay Flying Club and a heliport operated by state-owned Pawan Hans.[298]\n\n\n\n### Sea[edit]\n\n\nMumbai is served by two major ports, Mumbai Port Trust and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, which lies just across the creek in Navi Mumbai.[299] Mumbai Port has one of the best natural harbours in the world, and has extensive wet and dry dock accommodation facilities.[300] Jawaharlal Nehru Port, commissioned on 26 May 1989, is the busiest and most modern major port in India.[301] It handles 55\u201360% of the country's total containerised cargo.[302] Ferries from Ferry Wharf in Mazagaon allow access to islands near the city.[303]\n\n\nThe city is also the headquarters of the Western Naval Command, and also an important base for the Indian Navy.[153]\n\n\n\n## Utility services[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mumbai's water sources\n\nUnder colonial rule, tanks were the only source of water in Mumbai, with many localities having been named after them. The MCGM supplies potable water to the city from six lakes,[304][305] most of which comes from the Tulsi and Vihar lakes. The Tansa lake supplies water to the western suburbs and parts of the island city along the Western Railway.[306] The water is filtered at Bhandup,[306] which is Asia's largest water filtration plant.[307][308][309] India's first underground water tunnel was completed in Mumbai to supply water to the Bhandup filtration plant.[310][311]\n\n\n\n![](image)Deonar dumping ground seen behind the Eastern Express Highway\nAbout 700\u00a0million (70\u00a0crore) litres of water, out of a daily supply of 3.5\u00a0billion (350\u00a0crore) litres, is lost by way of water thefts, illegal connections and leakages, per day in Mumbai.[312] Almost all of Mumbai's daily refuse of 7,800\u00a0metric tonnes, of which 40\u00a0metric tonnes is plastic waste,[313] is transported to dumping grounds in Gorai in the northwest, Mulund in the northeast, and to the Deonar dumping ground in the east.[314] Sewage treatment is carried out at Worli and Bandra, and disposed of by two independent marine outfalls of 3.4\u00a0km (2.1\u00a0mi) and 3.7\u00a0km (2.3\u00a0mi) at Bandra and Worli respectively.[315]\n\n\nElectricity is distributed by the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking in the island city, and by Adani Transmission,[316] Tata Power and the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd (Mahavitaran) in the suburbs.[317] Power supply cables are underground, which reduces pilferage, thefts and other losses.[318][319]\n\n\nCooking gas is supplied in the form of liquefied petroleum gas cylinders sold by state-owned oil companies,[320] as well as through piped natural gas supplied by Mahanagar Gas Limited.[321]\n\n\nThe largest telephone service provider is the state-owned MTNL, which held a monopoly over fixed line and cellular services up until 2000, and provides fixed line as well as mobile WLL services.[322] Mobile phone coverage is extensive, and the main service providers are Vodafone Essar, Airtel, MTNL, Loop Mobile, Reliance Communications, Idea Cellular and Tata Indicom. Both GSM and CDMA services are available in the city.[323] Mumbai, along with the area served by telephone exchanges in Navi Mumbai and Kalyan is classified as a *Metro* telecom circle.[324] Many of the above service providers also provide broadband internet and wireless internet access in Mumbai. As of 2014[update], Mumbai had the highest number of internet users in India with 16.4\u00a0million (1.64\u00a0crore) users.[325]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Growth of Mumbai\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1971  | 5,970,575 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1981  | 8,243,405 | +38.1% |\n| 1991  | 9,925,891 | +20.4% |\n| 2001  | 11,914,398 | +20.0% |\n| 2011  | 12,478,447 | +4.7% |\n| Data is based on Government of India Census.Source: MMRDA[326] |\n\n\n![](image)Shri Siddhivinayak Temple is one of the most popular Hindu temples in the city.\nAccording to the 2011 census, the population of Mumbai city was 12,479,608. The population density is estimated to be about 20,482 persons per square kilometre. The living space is 4.5 square metres per person.[327] Mumbai Metropolitan Region was home to 20,748,395 people by 2011.[10] Greater Mumbai, the area under the administration of the MCGM, has a literacy rate of 94.7%, higher than the national average of 86.7%. The number of slum-dwellers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region is estimated to be 90\u00a0lakh (9\u00a0million), up from 60\u00a0lakh (6\u00a0million) in 2001 which constitutes approximately 38.5% of the region.[328][329]\n\n\nThe sex ratio in 2011 was 838 females per 1,000 males in the island city, 857 in the suburbs, and 848 as a whole in Greater Mumbai, all numbers lower than the national average of 914 females per 1,000 males. The low sex ratio is partly because of the large number of male migrants who come to the city to work.[330]\n\n\nResidents of Mumbai call themselves *Mumbaikar*,[60] *Mumbaiite*,[331] *Bombayite* or *Bombaiite*.\n\n\nMumbai suffers from the same major urbanization problems seen in many fast growing cities in developing countries: poverty and unemployment. With available land at a premium, Mumbai residents often reside in cramped, relatively expensive housing, usually far from workplaces, and therefore requiring long commutes on crowded mass transit, or clogged roadways.
