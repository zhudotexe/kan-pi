For other uses, see Mountain Dew (disambiguation).\n\nFor home-made high-proof distilled spirits also known as mountain dew, see Moonshine.\n\nFurther information: List of Mountain Dew flavors and varieties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMountain Dew| ![](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n| Type | Citrus soft drink |\n| Manufacturer | PepsiCo |\n| Country of origin\u00a0 | United States |\n| Introduced | 1940; 84\u00a0years ago\u00a0(1940) |\n| Related products | * Mello Yello\n* Sun Drop\n* Surge\n |\n| Website | mountaindew.com |\n\n\n**Mountain Dew**, stylized as **Mtn Dew** in some countries, is a carbonated soft drink brand produced and owned by PepsiCo. The original formula was invented in 1940 by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman. A revised formula was created by Bill Bridgforth[1] in 1958. The rights to this formula were obtained by the Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia.[2] William H. \"Bill\" Jones of the Tip Corporation further refined the formula, launching that version of Mountain Dew in 1961.[3] In August 1964, the Mountain Dew brand and production rights were acquired from Tip by the Pepsi-Cola company, and the distribution expanded across the United States and Canada.[4]\n\n\nBetween the 1940s and 1980s there was only one variety of Mountain Dew, which was citrus-flavored and caffeinated in most markets. Diet Mountain Dew was introduced in 1988,[5] followed by Mountain Dew Red, which was introduced and discontinued in 1988.[6] In 2001, a cherry-flavored variant called Code Red debuted. Expansions of the product line have continued to this day, including specialty offerings, limited time productions, region-specific and retailer-specific flavors of Mountain Dew.\n\n\nProduction was extended to the United Kingdom in 1996,[7] but was phased out in 1998. A similarly named but different-tasting product, with a recipe more similar to the original American product[8] has been sold in the U.K. under the name \"Mountain Dew Energy\" since 2010 and in Ireland since the spring of 2011. As of 2017, Mountain Dew represented a 6.6% share of the carbonated soft drinks market in the U.S.[9] Its competition includes the Coca-Cola Company's Mello Yello and Surge, and Keurig Dr Pepper's Sun Drop; Mountain Dew accounted for 80% of citrus soft drinks sold within the U.S. in 2010.[10][*clarification needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Origin\n\n[edit]\n\nTennessee bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman developed Mountain Dew as a mixer in the 1940s.[11] Soft drinks were sold regionally in the 1930s, and the Hartmans had difficulty in Knoxville obtaining their preferred soda to mix with liquor, preferably whiskey, so the two developed their own.[12] Originally a 19th-century slang term for whiskey, especially Highland Scotch whisky,[13] the Mountain Dew name was trademarked for the soft drink in 1948.[11]\n\n\nCharles Gordon, who had partnered with William Swartz to bottle and promote Dr. Enuf, was introduced to Mountain Dew when he met the Hartman brothers on a train and they offered him a sample. Gordon and the Hartman brothers subsequently made a deal to bottle Mountain Dew by the Tri-Cities Beverage Corporation in Johnson City, Tennessee.[12][14]\n\n\nThe Tip Corporation of Marion, Virginia, bought the rights to Mountain Dew, revising the flavor and launching it in 1961.[3] In 1964, Pepsico purchased the Tip Corporation and thus acquired the rights to Mountain Dew.[15] In 1999, the Virginia legislature recognized Tip Corporation president Bill Jones and the town of Marion for their role in the history of Mountain Dew.[16]\n\n\n\n## Packaging\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)A 1950s Mountain Dew advertisement sign in Tonto, Arizona, showing the cartoon character \"Willie the Hillbilly\"\n\"Mountain Dew\" was originally Southern and/or Scots-Irish slang for moonshine (i.e., homemade whiskey or poit\u00edn), as referenced in the Irish folk song \"The Rare Old Mountain Dew\", dating from 1882. Using it as the name for the soda was originally suggested by Carl E. Retzke at an Owens-Illinois Inc. meeting in Toledo, Ohio,[17] and was first trademarked by Ally and Barney Hartman in the 1940s. Early bottles and signage carried the reference forward by showing a cartoon-stylized hillbilly. The first sketches of the original Mountain Dew bottle labels were devised in 1948 by John Brichetto, and the representation on product packaging has changed at multiple points in the history of the beverage.[6]\n\n\n\n### Logo\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Two sides of an early Mountain Dew bottle using the \"Hillbilly\" design. These returnable bottles could be found in stores and vending machines until the late 1980s.\n![](image)The Mountain Dew logo used from 1969 to 1996 was also used on Mountain Dew Throwback when it was introduced in 2009 and was later used on special glass bottles of the drink.\n![](image)The fourth Mountain Dew logo, used from 1999 to 2005\nPepsiCo (then The Pepsi-Cola Company) acquired the Mountain Dew brand in 1964, and shortly thereafter in 1969 the logo was modified as the company sought to shift its focus to a \"younger, outdoorsy\" generation. This direction continued as the logo remained the same through the 1970s, 1980s. In 1996, PepsiCo began using a strategy it was already using with its flagship cola Pepsi, changing Mountain Dew's logo every few years. New logos were introduced in 1996, 1998, and 2005.[6] In October 2008, the Mountain Dew logo was redesigned to *\"Mtn Dew\"* within the U.S. market, as a result of PepsiCo announcing that it would rebrand its core carbonated soft-drink products by early 2009.[18][19] However, the variant flavors continued to use the previous design until May 2011, when it was announced that the \"Code Red\", \"LiveWire\", \"Voltage\", and \"Baja Blast\" flavor variants would be given redesigned packaging, including new logos to correspond with the \"Mtn Dew\" style.[*citation needed*] The returning flavors \"Pitch Black\", \"Supernova\", \"Typhoon\", and \"Game Fuel\" were given redesigned packaging and logos for their 2011 re-release.\n\n\n\n### Sidekick bottles\n\n[edit]\n\nIn summer 2010, a secondary type of Mountain Dew bottles began appearing on some US shelves.[20] Designed by 4sight, a design and innovation firm, these bottles featured a sleeker design, smaller packaging labels, and a built-in grip. The bottles were dubbed \"sidekick bottles\" and were tested in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Indiana markets.[21] By 2014, sidekick bottles had become the predominant Mountain Dew bottle design in most of the United States.[22]\n\n\n\n## Ingredients\n\n[edit]\n\nIn its primary market of the United States, the ingredient composition of Mountain Dew is listed as: \"carbonated water, high-fructose corn syrup (in much of the U.S.), concentrated orange juice, citric acid, natural flavors, sodium benzoate, caffeine, sodium citrate, erythorbic acid, gum arabic, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and yellow 5.\"[23] The ingredient makeup of Mountain Dew varies based on the country of production. For example, in Canada, the sweetener listed is \"glucose-fructose\"[24] (another name for high-fructose corn syrup), and until 2012, it was caffeine-free by default.[25] Formerly, the composition included brominated vegetable oil, an emulsifier banned in foods throughout Europe and in Japan. As of 2020, this ingredient has been removed.[26][27]\n\n\nIn response to negative publicity around high-fructose corn syrup, PepsiCo in 2009 released a limited-run production of Mountain Dew Throwback, a variation consisting of sugar in place of high-fructose corn syrup.[28] Mountain Dew Throwback subsequently was re-released for brief periods (generally 8\u201312 weeks at a time), including a second wave from December 2009 to February 2010 and a third wave in the summer and fall of 2010.[29][30] A fourth eight-week production run began in March 2011, before becoming a permanent addition to the Mountain Dew flavor line-up, until being discontinued again during the CoViD '19 pandemic.[31]\n\n\nA 12\u00a0US\u00a0fl\u00a0oz (355\u00a0mL) can of Mountain Dew contains 54\u00a0mg of caffeine (equivalent to 152\u00a0mg/L).[32]\n\n\n\n### Tartrazine\n\n[edit]\n\nAn urban legend about Mountain Dew ingredients is that dye Yellow #5 (tartrazine) lowers sperm count.[33] Tartrazine has never been scientifically linked to any of the alleged effects in the legends, nor has any other component of the drink.[34]\n\n\n\n### Alcohol\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2022, PepsiCo partnered with the Boston Beer Company to produce a line of alcohol-infused drinks in four flavors. Labelled \"Hard Mtn Dew\", the drinks were initially sold in Florida, Iowa and Tennessee,[35] before expanding to other states.\n\n\n\n## Promotions\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | The relevance of particular information in (or previously in) this article or section is **disputed**.

From 2007 to 2008, several additional flavors of Amp were introduced. In 2012, Amp's labeling and ingredients changed, as did the flavor and appeal, according to fans. The Mountain Dew branding was also removed from cans during this change, though it has since been reintroduced.\n\n\n\n### Taco Bell's Mountain Dew Baja Blast\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Baja Blast\n\nLeading up to 2004, PepsiCo conducted extensive research to develop a beverage with a taste and color to complement Taco Bell food products.[36] The resulting product was named Baja Blast, a light blue-green colored, tropical lime-flavored variety of the soft drink. Taco Bell was given a 10-year exclusive rights period, during which Baja Blast would not be available in any store or other food outlet, not even to Taco Bell's fellow Yum! Brands restaurants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn spring 2014, Mountain Dew began distributing its Baja Blast flavor in standard 12-ounce cans, 20-ounce bottles and 24-ounce cans for sale at supermarkets and retail businesses in the U.S. The new retail product bore the Taco Bell logo. Taco Bell's chief marketing officer, Chris Brandt, said the exclusive drinks have helped increase the company's beverage sales, even as soda sales have declined in the broader market. He noted that people are more likely to buy drinks when they are available exclusively at the chain.[37] Due to the drink's success, many other new beverages were introduced at Taco Bell, including a new Taco Bell exclusive, Mountain Dew Sangrita Blast, a non-alcoholic sangrita-flavored Mountain Dew.[38]\n\n\n\n### DEWmocracy 1\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image) DEWmocracy 1: People's Dew (2008) flavor finalists: Revolution, Voltage, and Supernova\nBeginning in 2007, Mountain Dew began a promotion entitled \"DEWmocracy\",[39] which involved the public electing new flavors, colors, names, packaging graphics and advertisements for upcoming Mountain Dew products.[40] The campaign has been the subject of recognition within the advertising industry,[41] cited as one of the earliest and longest-running examples of a consumer product brand employing crowdsourcing to make decisions which are traditionally made internally by employees.[42] In its initial phase, DEWmocracy participation and voting was conducted via an online game.[43] Television advertisements at the time featured actor Forest Whitaker asking people to decide the next new flavor of Mountain Dew. Online voters selected from three choices: Supernova (a strawberry/melon flavor), Revolution (a berry flavor), and Voltage (a raspberry/citrus flavor). Each included ginseng. The event ended on 17 August 2008, with Voltage announced as the winning flavor. It was officially released on 29 December 2008.[44] According to Beverage Digest, sales of DEWmocracy flavors totaled 25 million cases in 2008.[45]\n\n\n\n### DEWmocracy 2\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)DEWmocracy 2: Collective Intelligence (2010) flavor finalists: White Out, Distortion, and TyphoonMountain Dew announced a continuation of the DEWmocracy campaign\u00a0\u2013 referred to as \"DEWmocracy 2\"[46]\u00a0\u2013 which launched in July 2009. A marked difference between DEWmocracy 2 and its predecessor was the wider range of online voting methods, expanding beyond the DEWmocracy website to include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,[47] and the \"Dew Labs Community\"\u00a0\u2013 a private, online forum for the \"most passionate Dew fans.\"[48] In July 2009, Dew Labs sampling trucks distributed product samples of seven potential flavor variations. At the same time, 50 \"Dew fanatics\" were chosen based on their video submissions to the video website 12seconds.tv, and were shipped boxes of the seven prototype flavors.[42] From the initial seven flavors, taste testers were asked to elect three final flavors for later release at retail stores. The three new candidate flavors were Distortion (a Key lime flavor), Typhoon (a tropical punch flavor), and White Out (a smooth citrus flavor). The three new candidate flavors were released on 19 April 2010 and voting lasted until 14 June. The following day, White Out was announced as the winner. Mountain Dew White Out was released for sale on 4 October 2010. A limited production White Out Slurpee (Mtn Dew White Out Freeze) was made available at 7-Eleven stores beginning in January 2011. In July 2011, Mountain Dew Typhoon was re-released briefly in 2-liter form; in June 2022, it was re-released on the Mountain Dew online store.[49]\n\n\n### Game Fuel\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Game Fuel\" redirects here. Not to be confused with G Fuel.\n\nIn 2007, after using the term \"Game Fuel\" to market their sodas to the video-gaming subculture, Mountain Dew introduced a new flavor variant (citrus cherry) with the Game Fuel name. Coinciding with the release of the Xbox 360 game *Halo 3*, Mountain Dew Game Fuel sported a label that was almost entirely image-based, showing promotional artwork for the game and featuring the game series' main character Master Chief prominently. This variant remained on shelves for 12 weeks, and was discontinued afterwards.[50]\n\n\nTwo years later, the website for the popular MMORPG *World of Warcraft* stated that two Mountain Dew Game Fuel flavors would be sold in June 2009 and would promote the game.[51] Shortly afterwards, the bottle art was released, and showed that the two flavors would promote different player races in the game. One of the two was exactly the same citrus cherry flavor from the original *Halo 3* promotion, with updated packaging.[52] The second flavor was a new wild fruit drink, similar to the previously released Pepsi Blue.[53] Both drinks were given *World of Warcraft*-based packaging, and sported the newly updated \"MTN Dew\" logo. Like their precursor, these two flavors lasted for 12 weeks and were discontinued.\n\n\nOn 24 August 2011, Mountain Dew announced another return of the Game Fuel promotion on their Facebook page. The original citrus cherry would once again return,[54] along with a new tropical companion flavor.[55] The announcement gave a planned release date of October 2011 and stated that the packaging would feature codes granting players double experience points in *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3*. Both flavors were mailed out to Dew Labs members in early September 2011, a month before the planned release date. Later that same month, it was announced through the Facebook page that Game Fuel would be arriving to the public in mid-October, though it would vary by market. These flavors began appearing from the first week of October and were also discontinued after 12 weeks of being on shelves.\n\n\nGame Fuel returned in October 2012 to promote *Halo 4*, in the original citrus-cherry flavor. In August 2013, Mountain Dew announced that Game Fuel would be returning to stores in the fall of 2013, with a new blueberry-flavored version titled \"Electrifying Berry\".[56] In October 2013, boxes of original citrus cherry Game Fuel appeared on store shelves with packaging promoting the Xbox One and the games *Dead Rising 3* and *Forza Motorsport 5* and with cans featuring *Dead Rising 3* graphics. The new Electrifying Berry flavor of Game Fuel simultaneously appeared with packaging promoting *Kinect Sports Rivals* and the game *Ryse: Son of Rome*, graphics from which appear on the cans as well.\nIn May 2014, the original citrus cherry Game Fuel began reappearing on shelves, but this time, the soda does not seem to be promoting any video game.[57]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Game Fuel returned with a new lemonade flavor for the promotion of *Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare*.[58] Unlike past two-variant Game Fuel releases, both drinks sport the same artwork (unlike 2009's Horde Red and Alliance Blue or 2011's citrus cherry and tropical), albeit differing colors to match their respective flavors. After the promotion ended, Citrus Cherry reverted to packaging not promoting a game, while lemonade flavor was permanently removed from shelves.\n\n\nIn October 2015, Game Fuel returned with a new companion flavor, Berry Lime, for the promotion of *Call of Duty: Black Ops III*. After the promotion, Citrus Cherry once again reverted to promotion-less packaging, while the Berry Lime flavor remained available as a Slurpee.\n\n\nImages leaked in May 2016 led to speculation that Game Fuel would once again see a new release later in 2016, with a new mango-flavored variant alongside the original citrus cherry flavor, promoting the game *Titanfall 2*.[59] Mountain Dew announced the return of Game Fuel and the new flavor, Mango Heat, in September. Then, in October, Game Fuel was released with the *Titanfall 2* promotion, with a lower calorie version of the original citrus cherry variant returning alongside the new Mango Heat.[60]\n\n\nIn 2017, Game Fuel returned with two previously discontinued flavors: Arctic Burst (originally released as a Slurpee flavor in 2006 to promote *Superman Returns*) and Tropical Smash (originally Flavor #736, one of the four prototype flavors for \"DEWmocracy II\" that lost to Mountain Dew White Out and did not even make the final round). As was the case with the 2013 promotion, the two flavors promoted two different Xbox games (Arctic Burst promoted *Middle-earth: Shadow of War* while Tropical Smash promoted *Forza 7*).[61] For the first time, Citrus Cherry was not fully part of the promotion; instead, promotion-less Citrus Cherry was sold with the same white caps with codes under them as the other flavors in the promotion.\n\n\nIn January 2019, PepsiCo introduced a new line of Game Fuel drinks called Amp Game Fuel, since renamed to simply \"Game Fuel\". The can features a re-sealable lid. Game Fuel has 90\u00a0mg of caffeine and also includes theanine and vitamins A and B.[62] The Citrus Cherry flavor from the original Game Fuel lineup was re-released under this new product line in April 2022.[63]\n\n\nIn 2023, Game Fuel returned with two flavors: Citrus Cherry and Mystic Punch. As was the case with the 2017 promotion, the two flavors promoted two different Xbox games (Citrus Cherry promoted Halo Infinite while Mystic Punch promoted Diablo IV).\n\n\n\n### Green Label\n\n[edit]\n\nNot to be confused with the flavor named Mountain Dew Green Label, released in 2017.\n![](image)A limited edition bottle featuring Green Label art\nGreen Label is an online magazine, a partnership between Mountain Dew and Complex Media producing sponsored content covering action sports, music, art and style, housed at Green-Label.com.[64] The site replaces several websites and a YouTube channel that have been overseen by PepsiCo since 2007. The initiative originated in 2013 and will continue through the year.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Green Label Art\n\n[edit]\n\nMountain Dew's Green Label promotion originated in 2007, when a line of limited edition aluminum bottles was put into production, featuring artwork from a range of tattoo artists and other artists.[66] This initial series marked the first use of the term *Green Label Art* to describe the use of artistic works on Mountain Dew packaging.[67] In June 2010, a contest entitled \"Green Label Art: Shop Series\" was announced,[68] involving 35 independent skateboard store owners who partnered with local artists to design and submit future can artwork designs.[69] Approximately one million votes were submitted by the conclusion of the contest in October of the same year, with Street Science Skate Shop\u00a0\u2013 a store in Tracy, California\u00a0\u2013 named the winner of a cash prize. This winning can design was scheduled to appear on Mountain Dew cans at some point in 2011.[70]\n\n\n\n#### Green Label Sound\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, a Mountain Dew-sponsored music label was launched under the name *Green Label Sound*. In December 2010, a Mountain Dew Code Red television advertisement was produced, incorporating the hip-hop artist Jay Electronica performing his song \"The Announcement\".[71] The advertisement concludes with the tagline \"Hip Hop is different on the mountain\".[72]\n\n\nThe label released its first full-length album release, *When Fish Ride Bicycles* by the hip hop group The Cool Kids, on 12 June 2011.\n\n\n\n#### Dew Tour/Green Label experience\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)2007 Dew Tour BMX in Salt Lake City, Utah Sponsorship of action sports athletes has been a part of Mountain Dew marketing since the late 1990s, with present sponsorship including Eli Reed (skateboarder), Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder), and Danny Davis (snowboarder).[73] Mountain Dew also sponsors its own namesake festival, \"The Dew Tour\", which is an action sports tour made up of events held in five U.S. cities over several months.[74] The first Dew Tour was held in the summer of 2005 with events in skateboarding, BMX and Freestyle Motocross. In 2008 it expanded to add a \"Winter Dew Tour\", comprising snowboarding and snow skiing competitions. It is \"the most watched and attended action sports event in the world,\" according to *Transworld Snowboarding* magazine.[75][76] In coordination with its Dew Tour sponsorship, a sponsored television show entitled *Mountain Dew's Green Label Experience* premiered on Fuel TV in July 2010, for the primary purpose of broadcasting interviews with action sports athletes from each of the stops on the Dew Tour.[77]\n\n\n#### Green Label Gaming\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder the term *Green Label Gaming*\u00a0\u2013 coined in 2007\u00a0\u2013 Mountain Dew has broadened its sponsorship of independent video game designers and players. The brand was often the subject of media attention[*citation needed*] for its popularity among video game enthusiasts, as several flavors of Mountain Dew have been produced in partnership with video games. In December 2008, Mountain Dew produced a 30-minute television special which documented independent gamers in Japan and the U.S., which aired on the Spike TV network.[78] In 2009, Mountain Dew sponsored two prominent gaming events: the Independent Games Festival and the Game Developers Conference.[79][80][81] *Green Label Gaming* has since come under controversy over a sponsored Game Jam-themed reality show by Matti Leshem.[*how?*]\n\n\n\n### Doritos Quest\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, Doritos debuted a mystery flavor known as \"Quest\", featuring a campaign of online puzzles and prizes to identify the Quest flavor. The flavor was later identified as Mountain Dew.[82]\n\n\n\n### FanDEWmonium\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 2010, Mountain Dew started the \"FanDEWmonium\" promotion, a competition in which new flavors would compete to become permanent similar to the two DEWmocracy campaigns, but with eight diet flavors instead of three regular ones.[83] Five of the participating flavors were diet versions of previous DEWmocracy flavors: Diet SuperNova, Diet Voltage, Diet Crave, Diet Distortion, Diet Typhoon, and Diet White Out. Another flavor, Diet Ultra Violet, returned from its own limited release in 2009. The remaining competitor was a brand-new Diet flavor created specifically for the promotion - Flare (berry/citrus-flavored). Each of the eight flavors was available for tasting at specific tour locations, and special cans were also mailed to some Dew Labs members.\n\n\nAlso similar to the DEWmocracy campaign, those who taste-tested the Diet flavors were asked to go online and vote for which flavors they thought should be permanently sold in stores. After the first round of voting was completed, two flavor finalists were chosen to receive a limited release to store shelves for a final round of voting. Diet Voltage and Diet SuperNova were sold in stores for an eight-week period beginning in March 2011. After votes were cast, it was announced that Diet SuperNova had won, with 55% of all votes, and it returned in January 2012. Afterwards, it was removed from shelves permanently after a 12-week release due to low sales.\n\n\n\n### Back by Popular DEWmand\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 7 January 2011, Mountain Dew posted on their Facebook that Pitch Black would return to the shelves in May 2011, also stating that this may be the start of many re-releases of old favorites.[84] The company promoted Pitch Black's return heavily with giveaways and contests. About a month before the planned release date, a photo was posted on a Mountain Dew worker's Pongr, which showed Pitch Black and 2008's Supernova. Two weeks before the release, Dew Labs announced the return of 2010's Typhoon in 2-liter bottles exclusively at Walmart Supercenters. The three flavors were re-released to stores on 2 May.\n\n\nAt the same time of the DEWmand Promotion, Mountain Dew launched the Throwback Shack, a website where participators could enter to win exclusive Dew merchandise, including a \"secret stash\" of Mountain Dew Revolution, a losing competitor from 2008's DEWmocracy. The promotional advertisements were then taken down from the Mountain Dew website. Mountain Dew later stated via tweet that there would not be any more flavors returning 'by Popular DEWmand' for now, as it was only intended to be a summer program.\n\n\n\n### Dub the Dew\n\n[edit]\n\nIn August 2012, Villa Enterprises held a promotion known as *Dub the Dew*, where users were asked to submit and vote on name ideas for a green apple flavor of Mountain Dew. The promotion was infamously hijacked by users, particularly those originating from the imageboard 4chan, who submitted and upvoted entries such as \"Hitler did nothing wrong\", \"Diabeetus\", \"Fapple\", \"Bill Cosby Sweat\", \"Jimmie Rustle's Jumpin' Juice\", and numerous variations of \"Gushing Granny\".[85][86] Although the promotion was not directly connected to Mountain Dew, a representative from the company did offer to \"help clean up\" the site. *Adweek* compared the incident to another recent campaign hijacked under similar circumstances, where musician Pitbull was sent to perform in Kodiak, Alaska, in a Walmart promotion.[87][88][89]\n\n\n\n### Puppy Monkey Baby\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 7 February 2016, for Super Bowl 50, Mountain Dew aired a spot featuring a CGI character dubbed \"the puppy monkey baby\" (also styled PuppyMonkeyBaby). The promotion has garnered a wide amount of media coverage, both positive and negative. According to iSpot.tv, the spot was rated #1 of all the Super Bowl commercials of the night, having generated 2.2 million online views and 300,000 social media interactions after airing.[90]\n\n\nThe ad features a computer-generated mash-up of three things that the public generally finds to be cute or harmless; a Pug puppy (the head), a monkey (the body and tail), and a dancing baby (the hips and legs). The puppy monkey baby dances with three men who are presumably watching the Super Bowl, offering them Mountain Dew Kickstart, which is similarly described as being a combination of three things (Mountain Dew, juice, and caffeine).\n\n\nThe media response to the advertisement was mixed to negative. Melissa Cronin of Gawker described it as a \"horror-hallucination of brand awareness\",[91] while noting the beverage itself contains brominated vegetable oil, a chemical that is banned in several countries.[27] Jim Joseph, chief integrated marketing officer at Cohn & Wolfe, called it \"weird\".[92]\n\n\n\n### DEWcision 2016\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 16 April 2016, Mountain Dew announced the return of two popular favorites, Baja Blast and Pitch Black. Fans could vote on which flavor stays permanently on store shelves via the Mountain Dew website. Voting ended on 9 July, and, after many delays, Pitch Black was announced the winner on 18 July 2016. Pitch Black became part of the brand's flavor lineup starting in September[*when?*], and was produced for several years before being discontinued by early 2020.[93]\n\n\n\n### Mountain Dew Spark and Spark Zero\n\n[edit]\n\nMountain Dew Spark is a raspberry lemonade flavored beverage and a part of the Mountain Dew line up of offerings.[94] In 2022, Mountain Dew Spark Zero Sugar was launched and is now available across the United States.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe computer worm Code Red was named because the person who discovered the worm was drinking this version of Mountain Dew at the time.[95]\n\n\nIn the musical *Be More Chill*, green Mountain Dew activates the \"squip\", a tiny super-computer in a pill that tells the user what to do, in order to help them achieve their goals. Mountain Dew Red shuts them off. In the musical, it is said that this is the reason for Mountain Dew Red being discontinued.[96]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of Mountain Dew flavors and varieties\n* List of citrus soft drinks\n* Surge\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Mason, Doug (16 September 2007). \"Drinking in History\". *Knoxville News Sentinel*.

Since the original flavor's launch in 2004, the Baja Blast brand has since expanded to include new flavors, alcoholic beverages, and energy drinks, as well as merchandise. \n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nThe flavor was first made available in 2004. Created for, and exclusively sold at Taco Bell locations, it was a collaboration between the company and Mountain Dew owners PepsiCo. One of the first instances of a restaurant offering an exclusive soda beverage was created to increase sales of fountain soda.[1][2] The flavor was heavily promoted at launch with advertising campaigns.[3]\n\n\nIn 2014, ten years after the drink's original launch, it was released for the first time in a packaged format.[4][5] The retail release was only available for a limited time. The drink was promoted on Twitter, as well as through on-air advertisements featuring Dale Earnhardt Jr.[6]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Taco Bell released Mountain Dew Sangrita Blast, a non-alcoholic sangria flavor, as a sister flavor to Baja Blast, along with a diet version of Baja Blast.[7][8][9]\n\n\nIn 2015, Baja Blast was re-released for a limited time at retail stores, along with Sangrita Blast.[10][11][12]\n\n\nIn 2016, the flavor was part of the \"DEWcision\" campaign. It was put up against Mountain Dew flavor Pitch Black, and fans would vote for their favorite, the winner of which would be kept on store shelves permanently. The campaign featured wide promotion of both flavors, including advertisements,[13] NASCAR paint schemes[14] and a \"Dewggro Crag\" event themed around the Nickelodeon game show Guts.[15][16] It was ultimately announced that Pitch Black had won the vote, and would remain on store shelves.[17][18] As such, Baja Blast was once again discontinued from retailers. \n\n\nThe flavor has returned to store shelves yearly since 2018.[19][20][21][22][23] A zero sugar version was offered starting in 2019.\n\n\nIn 2019, Taco Bell began offering a birthday-themed Baja Blast freeze to celebrate the drink's 15th birthday.[24][25][26] Select locations, branded \"Taco Bell Cantina,\" offered the alcoholic \"Mountain Dew Baja Blast Twisted Freeze.\"[27] The \"Baja Blast Colada\" freeze was offered by Taco Bell in 2021.[28][29][30]\n\n\nIn 2022, Baja Blast was announced as one of the flavors of the Hard Mountain Dew line of alcoholic beverages, which would release in retail stores later that year.[31][32][33][34] The flavor was added to the Mountain Dew Energy line of energy drinks later that year.[35][23]\n\n\nThe Baja Blast brand has expanded to include themed merchandise, such as flavored lip balm,[36] room sprays,[37] and Halloween costumes.[38] A limited-edition Baja Blast hot sauce was created in 2023 as part of a giveaway promotion.[39]\n\n\nTaco Bell began testing a Baja Blast gelato on their menu in August 2023; during which it was offered for two weeks at a single location in Irvine, CA.[40] Taco Bell also offered Mtn Dew Energy Baja Blast in a test market, along with Baja Blast Charged Berry, which features the energy drink mixed with strawberry flavor.[41]\n\n\n\n## Flavors\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2021, Baja Blast was released at retail as part of the \"Summer of Baja\" promotion, alongside new, \"spinoff\" flavors. These flavors were **Baja Punch**, a tropical punch flavor, and **Baja Flash**, a pina colada flavor.[22][42][43]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Baja Blast's retail release was accompanied with new flavors **Baja Gold**, a pineapple flavor, and **Baja Mango Gem**, a mango flavor. A third new flavor, **Baja Deep Dive**, was a mystery flavor available exclusively as a giveaway prize.[23][35]\n\n\nHard Mountain Dew, an alcoholic line of Mountain Dew flavors, offers Baja Blast as one of its flavors. In May 2023, a Baja Blast variety pack was announced, including new flavors **Hard Baja Blast Pineapple**, **Hard Baja Blast Punch** and **Hard Baja Blast Mango**.[44]\n\n\nShortly after, in June 2023, Baja Blast was released into retail stores for the ninth time, this time accompanied with new flavors **Baja Caribbean Splash**, a guava flavor, and **Baja Passionfruit Punch**, a passionfruit flavor.[45]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of soft drink brands\n* ![](image) Drink portal\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"New Mountain Dew Flavor Available Only at Taco Bell\". *QSR magazine*.

Brands, Inc. The restaurants serve a variety of Mexican-inspired foods, including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, novelty and speciality items, and a variety of \"value menu\" items. As of 2018[update], Taco Bell serves over two billion customers each year, at 7,072 restaurants, more than 93 percent of which are owned and operated by independent franchisees and licensees.[6]\n\n\nPepsiCo purchased Taco Bell in 1978,[7] and later spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum! Brands.\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Glen Bell, the founder of Taco Bell\nTaco Bell was founded by Glen Bell, an entrepreneur who first opened a hot dog stand called Bell's Drive-In in San Bernardino, California, in 1948. Bell watched long lines of customers at a Mexican restaurant called the Mitla Cafe, located across the street, which became famous among residents for its hard-shelled tacos. Bell attempted to reverse-engineer the recipe, and eventually the owners allowed him to see how the tacos were made. He took what he had learned and opened a new stand in 1951. The name underwent several changes, from Taco-Tia through El Taco, before settling on Taco Bell.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)A modern Taco Bell restaurant in Hiawassee, Georgia\nGlen Bell opened the first Taco Bell in 1962 at 7112 Firestone Boulevard in Downey, California.[9][10] Currently there is a Taco Bell location across the street at 7127 Firestone Blvd, in Downey. The original location was a 400-square-foot (37\u00a0m2) building about the size of a two-car garage, and was built with Mission-style arches that covered a small walk-up window that served the original menu items: Tostadas, burritos, frijoles, chiliburgers, and tacos, all for 19 cents ($2 in 2023 dollars [11]). The first restaurant closed in 1986,[12] while the building was saved from demolition November 19, 2015, and was moved 45 miles (72\u00a0km) to the Taco Bell Corporate Office at 1 Glen Bell Way in Irvine and is currently stored intact on the corporate parking lot premises and known as \"Taco Bell Numero Uno\".[13][14]\n\n\nIn 1964, the first franchisee opened, in Torrance, California, at the intersection of West Carson Street and South Western Avenue which still exists but has been repurposed at 1647 West Carson Street.[15] In 1967, the 100th restaurant opened at 400 South Brookhurst in Anaheim which was later replaced by a new restaurant at 324 South Brookhurst. The first location east of the Mississippi River opened on East Main Street in Springfield, Ohio, in 1968.[16][9] Original Taco Bells only featured walk-up windows without indoor seating or drive-thru service and former original Taco Bell locations still survive while having been repurposed, frequently as other Mexican restaurants. In 1970, Taco Bell went public with 325 restaurants.\n\n\nThe corporate office has had a few locations, and previously maintained an office at 2516 Via Tejon in Palos Verdes, then at 2424 Moreton Street in Torrance before settling into Irvine more than 40 years ago in 1976 at 17901 Von Karman Avenue.[15]\n\n\n\n### PepsiCo subsidiary\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Former headquarters at 17901 Von Karman Avenue in Irvine, California\nIn 1978, PepsiCo purchased Taco Bell from Glen Bell.[9] Several locations in the Midwestern United States were converted from Zantigo, a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Mexican chain which PepsiCo acquired in 1986.[17] In 1990, the Hot 'n Now chain was acquired.[18] Taco Bell sold Hot 'n Now to a Connecticut company in 1997.[19]\n\n\nIn 1991, Taco Bell opened the first Taco Bell Express in San Francisco.[20] Taco Bell Express locations operate primarily inside convenience stores, truck stops, shopping malls, and airports. Taco Bell began co-branding with KFC in 1995 when the first such co-brand opened in Clayton, North Carolina.[21] The chain has since co-branded with Pizza Hut[22] and Long John Silver's as well.[23]\n\n\nIn 1997, PepsiCo experimented with a new \"fresh grill\" concept, opening at least one Border Bell restaurant in Mountain View, California, on El Camino Real (SR 82). Close to the time that PepsiCo spun off its restaurant business in 1997,[24] the Border Bell in Mountain View was closed and converted to a Taco Bell restaurant which was still open in 2018.[25]\n\n\nIn September 2000, up to $50 million worth of Taco Bell-branded shells were recalled from supermarkets.[26] The shells contained a variety of genetically modified corn called StarLink that was not approved for human consumption.[27] StarLink was approved only for use in animal feed because of questions about whether it can cause allergic reactions in people.[28] It was the first-ever recall of genetically modified food (GMO). Corn was not segregated at grain elevators and the miller in Texas did not order that type.[29] In 2001, Tricon Global announced a $60 million settlement with the suppliers. They stated that it would go to Taco Bell franchisees and TGR would not take any of it.[30]\n\n\n\n### Yum! Brands subsidiary\n\n[edit]\n\nPepsiCo spun out Taco Bell and its other restaurant chains in late 1997 in Tricon Global Restaurants.[31][32] With the purchase of Yorkshire Global Restaurants, the owners of A&W and Long John Silver's chains, Tricon changed its name to Yum! Brands on May 16, 2002.[33][34]\n\n\nIn March 2005, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) won a landmark victory in its national boycott of Taco Bell for human rights. Taco Bell agreed to meet all the coalition's demands to improve wages and working conditions for Florida tomato pickers in its supply chain.[35] After four years of boycott, Taco Bell and Yum! Brands agreed to make an agreement called the *CIW-Yum agreement* with representatives of CIW at Yum! Brands headquarters.[36]\n\n\n\n![The downstairs interior of the Taco Bell Cantina flagship store in Las Vegas, Nevada.](image)The downstairs interior of the Taco Bell Cantina flagship store in Las Vegas, Nevada\nTaco Bell began experimenting with fast-casual and urban concepts when it created U.S. Taco Co. and Urban Taproom in 2014 reflecting a market shift due to the popularity of Chipotle Mexican Grill. The menu consisted of tacos with American fillings, and did not sell the food sold in Taco Bell restaurants such as burritos. It was launched in Huntington Beach, California, in August 2014.[37] U.S. Taco Co. closed on September 15, 2015, so the company could focus on its new similar Taco Bell Cantina concept, which featured special menu items and served alcohol. It opened its first location a few days later in Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood, followed by a location in San Francisco about a month later, located less than a block away from AT&T Park.[38] In 2016, Taco Bell launched the Taco Bell Cantina flagship store located on the Las Vegas strip.[39] The 24-hour restaurant serves alcohol, unique menu items, and features a DJ. It was announced in August 2017 that the store would begin hosting weddings.[40] Taco Bell Cantina currently has locations in San Francisco, Berkeley, Chicago (2 locations), Las Vegas, Austin, Fayetteville, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Atlanta, Newport Beach, San Diego, San Jose, Nashville, with plans to open soon in Somerville, Massachusetts.[41][42] In March 2020, Taco Bell announced that it would be converting 3 of its suburban stores into Cantinas this year as part of a test run.[43]\n\n\nIn March 2016, Taco Bell introduced private beta testing of an artificial intelligence bot on the messaging platform Slack designed to take orders of select menu items from local Taco Bell locations and have the orders delivered. Taco Bell plans to have a wider roll-out of this functionality in the coming months.[*when?*][44]\n\n\nPreviously, Taco Bell's hot sauces were only available in packets at the chain itself. In February 2014, Taco Bell made its hot sauces available at grocery stores, sold in bottles.[45] These would be followed by further grocery store products including chips in May 2018 [46] and shredded cheese in 2019.[47] In September 2016, Taco Bell opened a pop-up in New York City in the SoHo, Manhattan area called the Taco Bell VR Arcade. Taco Bell and VR fans could demo PlayStation VR, games, and food.[48]\n\n\nIn 2016, Taco Bell built a restaurant out of five cargo shipping containers for the Texas music festival, South by Southwest. Due to popularity, the franchise decided to move the restaurant to a lot in South Gate, California, and it opened to the public a year later. The restaurant features Taco Bell's full menu, with outdoor seating, a walk-up window, and a drive-thru, but no indoor seating unlike regular Taco Bell locations.[49] Taco Bell announced plans in November 2017 to open 300 more urban and Cantina-style locations by 2022, with 50 to be located about New York City's five boroughs.[50] In 2019 Taco Bell opened a pop-up hotel called \"The Bell: A Taco Bell Hotel and Resort\" for one weekend in August. Upon the announcement the hotel was booked up in two minutes [51]\n\n\nTaco Bell announced plans to stay in its current corporate headquarters in Irvine until 2030.[52]\n\n\n\n## Menu and advertising\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1992, Johnny Cash starred in a television commercial for Taco Bell's value menu.[53]\n\n\nIn 1993, Taco Bell was part of product placement for the movie *Demolition Man* and updated their currently used logo.[54][55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Several Taco Bell menu items. Clockwise from lower right: chalupa supreme, combo burrito, double decker taco.\nIn March 2001, Taco Bell announced a promotion to coincide with the re-entry of the Mir space station. They towed a large target out into the Pacific Ocean, announcing that if the target was hit by a falling piece of Mir, every person in the United States would be entitled to a free Taco Bell taco. The company bought a sizable insurance policy for this gamble.[56] No piece of the station struck the target.\n\n\nIn 2004, a local Taco Bell franchisee bought the naming rights to the Boise State Pavilion in Boise, Idaho, and renamed the stadium Taco Bell Arena.[57] Also, in 2004, Mountain Dew offered Taco Bell stores the exclusive right to carry Mountain Dew Baja Blast, a tropical lime flavor of the popular soft drink.[58]\n\n\nIn 2005, Taco Bell released the menu item called the Crunchwrap Supreme.\n\n\nIn 2007, Taco Bell first offered the \"Steal a Base, Steal a Taco\" promotion\u2014if any player from either team stole a base in the World Series, the company would give away free tacos to everyone in the United States in a campaign similar to the Mir promotion, albeit with a much higher likelihood of being realized.[59] After Jacoby Ellsbury of the Boston Red Sox stole a base in Game 2, the company made good on the promotion on October 30, 2007. The promotion has subsequently been offered in multiple World Series.\n\n\n\nMain article: Steal a Base, Steal a Taco\n\nTaco Bell sponsors a promotion at home games for both the Portland Trail Blazers and the Cleveland Cavaliers in which everyone in attendance receives a coupon for a free Chalupa if the home team scores 100 points or more.[60][61]\n\n\nIn 2009, Taco Bell introduced a music video style commercial entitled \"It's all about the Roosevelts\" composed and produced by Danny de Matos at his studio for Amber Music on behalf of DraftFCB Agency. Featuring, Varsity Fanclub's Bobby Edner, the rap music style commercial shows a group of friends gathering change as they drive toward Taco Bell. The commercial represents Taco Bell's first foray into movie theater advertising, featuring the ad during the opening previews of *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen* and *Public Enemies* as well as screens in some movie theater lobbies.[62]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2009, Taco Bell replaced 20-year sponsor McDonald's as the fast-food partner of the NBA. Taco Bell and the NBA agreed on a 4-year deal allowing them to advertise on ABC, TNT and ESPN, and NBA-themed promotions.[63] On July 21, 2009, Gidget, the Chihuahua featured in Taco Bell ads in the late 1990s, was euthanized after suffering a stroke.[64] She was 15 years old. 2009 commercials for the \"Frutista Freeze\" frozen drink feature Snowball, an Eleonora cockatoo noted for his ability to dance to human music.[65] In an effort to promote its $2 Meal Deals, Taco Bell started a Facebook group in June 2010 to collect signatures on a petition that appeals to the Federal Reserve to produce more two-dollar bills.[66]\n\n\nA large advertising push by Taco Bell was begun in late February 2011 in response to a consumer protection lawsuit filed against the company by an Alabama law firm. The promotion sought to counter allegations that the company falsely advertised the ratio of ingredients in its beef filling for its tacos. The spots featured employees and franchisees stating that the filling has always been a mixture of 88% beef and various spices and binders and nothing else. The ad followed several full-page print ads in the *New York Times* and other newspapers that featured the headline \"Thank you for suing us.\"[67] Additionally, the chain added a new social campaign using Twitter and Facebook. The company invested heavily in the campaign, spending more than $3 million (USD) putting out its message\u2014about 20 percent more than the company usually spends on an advertising program. The various campaigns came shortly before the company began its official response to the suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and were designed to bring public opinion into their camp. Various analysts stated that the company would have been better off using a grass-root campaign that involved in store advertising and other non-broadcast media.[68] The suit was eventually withdrawn,[69] and the company continued its advertising response by publicly requesting an apology from the suing firm of Beasley Allen. Analyst Laura Ries, of marketing strategy firm Ries & Ries, stated she believed Taco Bell's latest response was a mistake. She commented that reviving memories of a suit that the majority of the public had forgotten after the initial burst of publicity was the wrong strategy from Taco Bell.[70]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Taco Bell teamed up with Frito-Lay and created the Doritos Locos Tacos, which is a taco with a Dorito Nacho Cheese flavored taco shell.[71]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Taco Bell released a drink named Mountain Dew A.M, a mixture of Mountain Dew and orange juice.[72]\n\n\nOn June 6, 2012, Taco Bell announced it would be testing a new \"Cantina Menu\" with upscale items in their Kentucky and California restaurants. The new menu was created by celebrity chef Lorena Garcia, and featured the addition of: Black Beans; Cilantro Rice; Citrus & Herb Marinated Chicken; and Cilantro Dressing.[73][74]\n\n\nThe *Cool Ranch Doritos Taco*, became available to order on March 7, 2013.[75] Shortly before its release, Taco Bell launched a promotion advertising that fans could get the new flavor at its stores a day early if they \"just asked\" on March 6. However, they neglected to inform the majority of their stores of this \u2013 leading to numerous complaints on its social media accounts and news sites from disappointed consumers who were unable to obtain the new taco.[76][77]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2013, Taco Bell announced they were discontinuing the sale of kids' meals and accompanying toys at all of their U.S.\u2013based restaurants by January 2014. Some outlets ceased their sale as early as July 2013.[78]\n\n\n\n![](image)Taco Bell outlet in Los Angeles\nOn August 6, 2013, the chain announced it was expanding its test market of \"Waffle Tacos\" to \u2248100 restaurants in Fresno, California, Omaha, Nebraska, and Chattanooga, Tennessee, beginning on August 8 of that year. The Waffle Taco included scrambled eggs, sausage, and a side of syrup. It was the top\u2013selling item during breakfast hours at the five Southern California restaurants where they had been test\u2013released earlier in 2013.[79] The breakfast menu started on March 27, 2014. Other items include: the A.M. Crunchwrap, Cinnabon Delights, Breakfast Burrito, A.M. Grilled Sausage Flatbread Melt, Hash Browns, Coffee and Orange Juice.[80] The ad\u2013campaign, which began March 27, used twenty-five men who were named Ronald McDonald, a reference to the famous clown mascot of McDonald's.[81] Another commercial advertisement for the Waffle Taco features the narrator singing, \"I've been eating Egg McMuffins since 1984. But when I saw Taco Bell made a Waffle Taco, I figured I would get with the times\" set to the tune of \"Old MacDonald Had a Farm\"\u2014 another shot at McDonald's.[82]\n\n\nOn April 28, 2014, Taco Bell ridiculed McDonald's for its \"out\u2013dated muffins\", in a breakfast campaign devised by Taylor.[83] The advertisement stated the claim that the McMuffin belonged in 1984.[82][84][85] In October 2014, Taco Bell launched the *Pink Strawberry Starburst Freeze* beverage for a limited time.[86] In August 2016, Taco Bell brought back its Pink Strawberry Starburst Freeze.[87] In October 2015, Taco Bell launched a certified vegetarian menu.[88]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Taco Bell announced it would begin testing a mashup known as Cheetos Burritos at select Taco Bell restaurants[89] On September 19, 2016, Taco Bell launched Airheads Freeze, a drink inspired by the candy Airheads White Mystery, and allow people to guess its flavor on social media.[90] On September 15, 2016, Taco Bell introduced the Cheddar Habanero Quesarito, a quesadilla shelled burrito.[91] In April 2017, Taco Bell announced that it will begin testing the Naked Breakfast Taco in Flint, Michigan in mid-April. The breakfast taco, which uses a fried egg as the shell for potato bites, nacho cheese, shredded cheddar, and bacon or sausage crumble.[92][93]\n\n\nIn 2017, the company released the Naked Chicken Chalupa that uses a chalupa shell made from chicken, using a similar idea to the Double Down and later that year the Naked Chicken Chips, which are chicken nuggets shaped like chips with nacho cheese.[94]\n\n\nIn July 2017, Taco Bell announced a partnership with Lyft in which Lyft passengers in Orange County, California, can request \"Taco Mode\" on their way to their destination from 9 PM to 2 AM, having a stop at Taco Bell. The program was cancelled after much negative feedback from drivers.[95]\n\n\nOn September 21, 2018, Taco Bell announced National Taco Day celebrating its global reach outside of the United States, to be celebrated in 20 countries.[96]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Taco Bell nearly doubled its television advertising spending to US$64 million.[97]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Taco Bell revamped their menu, for the Fall Season.[98]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Taco Bell announced the Grilled Cheese Burrito.[99] The burrito is a recurring menu item that occasionally reappears for a limited time.[100]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Taco Bell announced the return of potatoes to the menu after a brief discontinuation in August 2020 in efforts to streamline processes in their restaurants in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the potatoes, the company had announced plans to expand their vegetarian menu by introducing Beyond Meat as a plant-based vegetarian customization option.[101]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Taco Bell said that it will start reusing hot sauce packets in partnership with the recycling company TerraCycle, aiming to reduce the environmental pollution.[102]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Taco Bell announced the Crispy Chicken Sandwich Taco.[103][104]\n\n\nOn April 18, 2022, Taco Bell announced that Mexican Pizza will return to its menu on May 19, after having previously been discontinued in November 2020.[105]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2022, Taco Bell launched a digital taco subscription service called the Taco Lover's Pass through the company app. For the cost of $10, a customer can order one of seven different tacos each day for 30 consecutive days.[106]\n\n\nTaco Bell launched the Crunchwrap Supreme in 2006. In 2023, the company was test marketing a vegan Crunchwrap Supreme in Los Angeles, New York, and Orlando to gauge the potential of a national roll out. *Bon App\u00e9tit* tested a vegan Crunchwrap alongside a non-vegan Crunchwrap purchased at the store in midtown Manhattan and said \"the differences between the two were also genuinely difficult to discern.\"[107]\n\n\n\n### Dollar Cravings\n\n[edit]\n\nOn August 18, 2014, Taco Bell launched a new value menu called Dollar Cravings.[108][109][110][111] Replacing the old Why Pay More menu, Dollar Cravings currently contains thirteen food items all priced at a United States dollar.[110][111][112][113][114]\n\n\nIt was renamed \"Cravings Value Menu\", when prices were increased on some of the items. In April 2019, they introduced a \"loaded nacho taco\" for a dollar.[115][116]\n\n\n\n### Discontinued menu items\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of Taco Bell's original 1960s menu items was the Chiliburger, later known as the Bell Burger, then the Bell Beefer. This was a loose meat sandwich with taco-seasoned ground beef, shredded cheese and lettuce, diced onions and tomato with mild red sauce, served on a steamed hamburger bun. The sandwich was removed from the menu sometime in the late 1980s to keep a strictly Tex Mex-inspired line up.[117]\n\n\nOther discontinued items include: Enchirito (name revived for a different menu item); Taco Lite; Taco Grande; Chilito (Chili Cheese Burrito); Beefy Crunch Burrito; Beefy Melt Burrito; Seafood Salad; Chicken Fiesta Burrito; Potatorito; Volcano Taco; BLT Taco; Cheesarito; Cinnamon Crispas; Nacho Crunch Grilled Stuft Burrito; Chicken Caesar Grilled Stuft Burrito; Grilled Stuft Nacho; Fully Loaded Nachos; Crunchwrap Sliders;[118] Blackjack Taco; Bean Burrito Especial; Border Ices; and the Meximelt.[119]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Taco Bell made new changes to its menu.

The two branches opened in the summer of 2010, Itaewon's branch coming first.

A second location opened in the \u00c1rt\u00fansh\u00f6f\u00f0i part of Reykjav\u00edk in November 2008.[151]\n\n\n\n#### Netherlands\n\n[edit]\n\nOn April 4, 2017, Taco Bell opened its first restaurant in Eindhoven, Netherlands.[152][153] On October 12, Taco Bell opened another restaurant in Tilburg. A third restaurant has opened in Breda.[154]\n\n\n\n#### Poland\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first Polish Taco Bell store was opened in 1993. Following an aggressive campaign of expansion, Taco Bell's efforts soon withered, and the chain withdrew from Poland shortly thereafter.[155]\n\n\n\n#### Portugal\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first Taco Bell store was opened in 2019, with 11 restaurants spread across the country in 2021.[156]\n\n\n\n#### Romania\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first Taco Bell store opened in Romania's capital, Bucharest, on October 12, 2017, and there are currently 13 stores on the Romanian market.[157] For the time being, Romania is the only country in Eastern Europe that has a Taco Bell store.[158]\n\n\n\n#### Russia\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1990s, PepsiCo opened several Taco Bell locations inside the Moscow metro system, including Metro Park Kulturi and Metro Komsomolskaya.[159] This experiment lasted only a few years.[160] These locations live on under different ownership and a different name.\n\n\n\n#### Spain\n\n[edit]\n\nSpain is the most important market for Taco Bell in Europe. The outlets are in various towns on the mainland, on Mallorca and on the Canary Islands.[161] There are 67 Taco Bell branches by late 2019, more than twice than in 2017 when Taco Bell had 32 branches in Spain.[162] The first Taco Bell in Spain was opened at Naval Station Rota in 2004 and is available only to those authorized to access the naval base.[163] The first Taco Bell for the public was opened in the Islazul Shopping Mall, Madrid, in December 2008.[164] Yum! Brands announced that it would open additional restaurants in Spain in early 2009 as part of a test trial for the European market.[165][166] The second location of Taco Bell in Spain was opened at the La Vaguada Shopping Mall, Madrid in March 2010.\n\n\n\n#### United Kingdom\n\n[edit]\n\nThe United Kingdom was the first European country with a Taco Bell. In 1986, a location was opened in London on Coventry Street (between Leicester Square and Piccadilly Circus) followed by a second location in Earl's Court near the Earl's Court tube station. One other store opened in Uxbridge but all closed in the mid-1990s.[167] In 1994, the university food provider Compass announced plans for outlets on its university and college sites. However, only one store was opened at Birmingham University, which is now closed.[168][169]\n\n\nAfter the Birmingham University branch closed, there were only two Taco Bell branches in the UK, at the Strategic Air Command and United States Air Force bases at RAF Mildenhall and RAF Lakenheath. Access is restricted to relevant service personnel.[170]\n\n\nIn the late 2000s, Yum! Brands announced that it was reopening Taco Bell locations in the United Kingdom as part of a large planned expansion into Europe. Yum! took advantage of the recent great recession which led to increasing sales at other fast food outlets; it also said that there was now a greater awareness of Mexican food in the UK and that it can be successful with improved menu offerings and marketing.[165][166] The first new store opened at the Lakeside Shopping Centre in Essex on June 28, 2010.[171] Another store opened in Basildon, Essex, on November 29, 2010, and a third in the Manchester Arndale Food Court on November 7, 2011.\n\n\nOn March 1, 2013, it was announced that trace amounts of horse meat from a European supplier had been found in various food products, including Taco Bell's beef in the UK.[172] By August 2017, there were 17 Taco Bell branches in the United Kingdom, all of which were in England and outside of London.[173] The first Scottish branch was opened in Glasgow in December 2017.[174] As of June 2019 there are 39 branches in Scotland and England, including three in London.[175] Beginning in October 2019, Taco Bell locations in the UK began serving Doritos Locos Tacos.[176]\n\n\nOn 2 March 2020, the first Welsh Taco Bell branch was opened in Cardiff.[177]\n\n\nMore recently, in November 2021, Taco Bell opened its 77th UK store, and a return to the British Midlands with a store in The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham.\n\n\nIn August 2022 a Taco Bell was opened in Torquay, Devon, the second in the county after Plymouth.[178]\n\n\n\n### Middle East\n\n[edit]\n\nA Taco Bell opened in the United Arab Emirates in November 2008 in Dubai at the Dubai Mall.[179] A fourth UAE location was also planned for Bawadi Mall in the city of Al Ain. The locations at Dubai Mall, Deira City Centre, and Mirdif City Centre have all closed and Taco Bell has completely pulled out of the Emirati market.[180] Taco Bell is still open in Kuwait and has not been pulled out ever since from the Kuwaiti market.[181][182]\n\n\n\n### North America\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Taco Bell in Canada\n#### Canada\n\n[edit]\n\nTaco Bell has been present in Canada since 1981, with the first store opening in Windsor, Ontario. There are currently Taco Bell locations in 7 of the 10 Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.[183] Taco Bell had operated in the province of Quebec for close to 15 years, however announced its withdrawal on January 6, 2022.[184] For some time it was possible to order draft beer with one's order. Taco Bell offers free soda refills in its stores.\n\n\nOn March 31, 2011, Priszm, owner of Taco Bell (Canada), went into bankruptcy protection in Ontario and British Columbia.[185] On May 6, 2011, Priszm Income Fund was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange for failure to meet the continued listing requirements.[186] Since then, some Taco Bell restaurants have been closed down including those in Guelph, Hamilton, and Cambridge, Ontario among others.\n\n\n\n#### Mexico\n\n[edit]\n\nTaco Bell has attempted to enter the Mexican market twice. After a highly publicised launch in Mexico City in 1992, all the restaurants were closed two years later. In September 2007, Taco Bell returned to Monterrey, projecting an American image with an Americanized menu that included french fries, but it closed in January 2010 due to low patronage.[187][188][189]\n\n\n\n### Oceania\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Australia\n\n[edit]\n\nTaco Bell first opened in Australia in September 1981, but Taco Bell was ordered to change its name after the owner of a local restaurant successfully sued Taco Bell for misleading conduct.[190] The local restaurant was called \"Taco Bell's Casa\" and had been operating in Australia since the 1970s. The owner successfully argued that Sydneysiders would confuse the takeaway chain with his restaurant, and this would damage his reputation. Taco Bell later opened in 1997 in Australia with a store in the cinema district on George Street, Sydney and a year later in 1998 within a few KFC stores in the state of New South Wales, but by 2005, the Taco Bell brand was pulled out of the country.[191]\n\n\nOn September 13, 2017, Collins Foods announced that Taco Bell would return to the Australian market, with their first store being situated in the Brisbane suburb of Annerley in Queensland using a refurbished Sizzler restaurant which had closed earlier that year.[192] The Annerley store opened on November 4, 2017.[193] In 2018, Collins Foods signed a development deal with Yum! Brands to open over 50 Taco Bell restaurants across Australia between January 2019 and December 2021.[194] A legal dispute with Victoria-based restaurant chain Taco Bill was resolved in February 2020.[195]\n\n\nAs of January 2023, there are 39 Taco Bell restaurants across Australia; 12 in New South Wales, 13 in Queensland, nine in Victoria, and four in Western Australia.[196] There are also plans to open restaurants in other locations, such as Canberra,[197][198] the Central Coast,[199][200] Port Macquarie[201][202] and Toowoomba.[203] While the chain has grown nationwide, both of its two outlets in North Queensland closed in November 2022, which were previously locations in Cairns[204] and Townsville.[205]\n\n\n\n#### New Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nTaco Bell officially opened its first New Zealand location on November 12, 2019, in the suburb of New Lynn, Auckland.[206]\n\n\nAs of January 2023, there are 14 Taco Bell restaurants across New Zealand; 10 on the North Island and four on the South Island.[207] By city, there are seven in Auckland, three in Christchurch and one each in Dunedin, Rotorua, Taupiri and Wellington. There are two outlets at airports in New Zealand, one at Auckland Airport and the other at Christchurch Airport.\n\n\n\n#### Territories of the United States\n\n[edit]\n\nTaco Bell operates several stores in Guam.[208]\n\n\nTaco Bell operates one restaurant in the Northern Mariana Islands, located on the island of Saipan.[209]\n\n\nIn 2005 Taco Bell started the permitting process to set up a restaurant in American Samoa in Pago Pago.[210]\n\n\n\n### South America\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are outlets in Brazil in the S\u00e3o Paulo area, Campinas and Rio de Janeiro.[211][212][213]\n\n\nTaco Bell has stores in Chile, which many of them are operated in conjunction (and in the same facilities) with Pizza Hut.[214] All Taco Bell stores are in shopping malls located mainly in Santiago.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPeru has branches in Lima.[215]\n\n\nThere were four outlets in the Bogot\u00e1 area in Colombia, but these closed in late 2018.[216]\n\n\nThere was a Taco Bell in Ecuador.[217]\n\n\n\n### Other countries\n\n[edit]\n\nTaco Bell is present in the Dominican Republic,[218] Aruba,[219] Costa Rica,[220] Panama[221] and Portugal.[222]\n\n\n\n### Military bases\n\n[edit]\n\nOn AAFES military bases it's located in Germany, Italy, Kosovo, Iraq, Brazil, Guatemala,[223] and El Salvador.[224]\n\n\n\n## Clothing line\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Man wearing a white Taco Bell hooded sweatshirt, part of the 2017 Forever 21 Taco Bell collection\nIn 2017, Forever 21 produced a clothing line in partnership with Taco Bell, featuring branded T-shirts and sweatshirts, as well as bodysuits made to look like Border Sauce packets.[225][226]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Taco Bell announced *Taco Bell's Taco Shop*, an online store with Taco Bell branded merchandise including hoodies and tees, holiday ornaments, inflatable sauce packets, and wedding-related items.[227]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![photo](image)Los Angeles portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n* ![icon](image)Food portal\n\n\n* Priszm\n* Taco Bell chihuahua\n* Enchirito\n\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Number of Taco Bell restaurants worldwide from 2010 to 2018\". *Statista*.

As defined by the United States Census Bureau, an incorporated place includes cities, towns, villages, boroughs, and municipalities.[a] A few exceptional census-designated places (CDPs) are also included in the Census Bureau's listing of incorporated places.[b] Consolidated city-counties represent a distinct type of government that includes the entire population of a county, or county equivalent. Some consolidated city-counties, however, include multiple incorporated places. This list presents only the portion of such consolidated city-counties that are not a part of another incorporated place.\n\n\nThis list refers only to the population of individual municipalities within their defined limits; the populations of other municipalities considered suburbs of a central city are listed separately, and unincorporated areas within urban agglomerations are not included. Therefore, a different ranking is evident when considering U.S. urban areas or metropolitan areas.\n\n\n\n\n## 50 states and Washington, D.C.[edit]\n\n\n\nThis table lists the 333 incorporated places in the United States, excluding the U.S. territories, with a population of at least 100,000 as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau. Five states have no cities with populations exceeding 100,000. They are: Delaware, Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\n\nThe table displays:\n\n\n\n1. The city rank by population as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau[1]\n2. The city name[1]\n3. The name of the state in which the city lies[1]\n4. The city population as of July 1, 2022, as estimated by the United States Census Bureau[1]\n5. The city population as of April 1, 2020, as enumerated by the 2020 United States census[1]\n6. The city percent population change from April 1, 2020, to July 1, 2022\n7. The city land area as of January 1, 2020[2]\n8.

A CDP is a concentration of population identified by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes. CDPs are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places such as cities, towns and villages. CDPs are populated areas that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physically resemble incorporated places. Unlike the incorporated cities in the main list, the US Census Bureau does not release annual population estimates for CDPs.\n\n\nThe table below contains the following information:\n\n\n\n1.

According to the 2020 census data, Irvine had a population of 307,670, making it the 63rd largest city in the United States.\n\nLooking at the largest cities by population as of the 2020 census:\n1.
