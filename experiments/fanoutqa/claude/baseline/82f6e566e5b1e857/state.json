The 53\u201329 Boston Celtics, who were also the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference and reached the Eastern Conference Finals at the time of the NBA draft lottery, won the #1 pick with pick swapping rights thanks to a previous trade with the Brooklyn Nets, who had the worst record the previous season. The Los Angeles Lakers, who had risked losing their 2017 first round pick to the Philadelphia 76ers, moved up two spots to get the Second overall pick, while Philadelphia moved up to receive the No. 3 pick due to the Sacramento Kings moving up in the draft, which activated pick swapping rights the 76ers had from an earlier trade. On June 19, four days before the NBA draft began, the Celtics and 76ers traded their top first round picks to each other, meaning the holders of the top four picks of this year's draft would be exactly the same as the previous year's draft.[2]\n\n\nThe draft class was the youngest draft class to date, with the most freshmen and fewest seniors selected in the first round; the top seven picks in the draft were college freshmen. It was the third time, and the second in a row, that three players were selected from Serbian team KK Mega Basket in the same draft (Vlatko \u010can\u010dar, Ognjen Jaramaz, Alpha Kaba), with it previously occurring during the 2014 and 2016 NBA draft. The draft also received much media coverage from ESPN pertaining to eventual second overall pick Lonzo Ball and his outspoken father, LaVar Ball, much to the chagrin of many sports fans and even some ESPN employees. This was one of the rare occasions where a player drafted from their year did not win Rookie of the Year; the award went to 2016 first overall pick Ben Simmons, the first player since Blake Griffin in 2011 to win the award in a year he was not drafted.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Draft selections[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| PG | Point guard | SG | Shooting guard | SF | Small forward | PF | Power forward | C | Center |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| \\*\n | Denotes player who has been selected for at least one All-Star Game and All-NBA Team |\n| + | Denotes player who has been selected for at least one All-Star Game |\n| # | Denotes player who has never appeared in an NBA regular season or playoff game\n |\n| ~ | Denotes player who has been selected as Rookie of the Year |\n\n\n![](image)Markelle Fultz was selected 1st overall by the Philadelphia 76ers.\n![](image)Jayson Tatum was selected 3rd overall by the Boston Celtics.\n![](image)De'Aaron Fox was selected 5th overall by the Sacramento Kings.\n![](image)Lauri Markkanen was selected 7th overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves (traded to the Chicago Bulls).\n![](image)Donovan Mitchell was selected 13th overall by the Denver Nuggets (traded to the Utah Jazz).\n![](image)Bam Adebayo was selected 14th overall by the Miami Heat.\n![](image)Jarrett Allen was selected 22nd overall by the Brooklyn Nets.\n![](image)Kyle Kuzma was selected 27th overall by the Brooklyn Nets (traded to the Los Angeles Lakers).\n\n\n| Rnd. | Pick | Player\n | Pos. | Nationality[n 1] | Team\n | School / club team |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1 | Markelle Fultz | PG/SG\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Philadelphia 76ers (from Brooklyn via Boston)[A][B] | Washington (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 2\n | Lonzo Ball | PG\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Los Angeles Lakers | UCLA (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 3\n | Jayson Tatum\\*\n | SF\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Boston Celtics (from Sacramento via Philadelphia)[C][B] | Duke (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 4\n | Josh Jackson | SF\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Phoenix Suns | Kansas (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 5\n | De'Aaron Fox\\*\n | PG\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Sacramento Kings (from Philadelphia)[C] | Kentucky (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 6\n | Jonathan Isaac | SF/PF\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Orlando Magic | Florida State (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 7\n | Lauri Markkanen+\n | PF\n | ![](image)\u00a0Finland | Minnesota Timberwolves (traded to Chicago Bulls)[a] | Arizona (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 8\n | Frank Ntilikina | PG\n | ![](image)\u00a0France[n 2] | New York Knicks | SIG Strasbourg (France)\n |\n| 1\n | 9\n | Dennis Smith Jr. | PG\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Dallas Mavericks | NC State (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 10\n | Zach Collins | C/PF\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Sacramento Kings (from New Orleans,[D] traded to Portland Trail Blazers[b]) | Gonzaga (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 11\n | Malik Monk | SG\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Charlotte Hornets | Kentucky (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 12\n | Luke Kennard | SG\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Detroit Pistons | Duke (So.) |\n| 1\n | 13\n | Donovan Mitchell\\*\n | SG\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Denver Nuggets (traded to Utah Jazz)[c] | Louisville (So.) |\n| 1\n | 14\n | Bam Adebayo+\n | PF/C\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Miami Heat | Kentucky (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 15\n | Justin Jackson | SF\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Portland Trail Blazers (traded to Sacramento Kings)[b] | North Carolina (Jr.) |\n| 1\n | 16\n | Justin Patton | C\n | ![](image)\u00a0United States\n | Chicago Bulls (traded to Minnesota)[a] | Creighton (Fr.) |\n| 1\n | 17\n | D.

established in the league's 2017 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with its player's union. The CBA that ended the 2011 lockout instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but called for a committee of owners and players to discuss future changes.\n\n\n\n* All drafted players must have been at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft. In terms of dates, players who are eligible for the 2017 draft, must have been born on or before December 31, 1998.\n* Since the 2016 draft, the NCAA Division I council implemented the following rules for that division that significantly changed the draft landscape for college players:[61]\n\t+ Declaration for the draft no longer resulted in automatic loss of college eligibility. As long as a player did not sign a contract with a professional team outside the NBA, or sign with an agent, he retained college eligibility as long as he made a timely withdrawal from the draft.\n\t+ NCAA players had until 10 days after the end of the NBA Draft Combine to withdraw from the draft. Since the combine was held in mid-May, the deadline was about five weeks after the previous mid-April deadline.\n\t+ NCAA players were permitted to participate in the draft combine, and were also allowed to attend one tryout per year with each NBA team without losing college eligibility.\n\t+ NCAA players were permitted to enter and withdraw from the draft up to two times without loss of eligibility. Previously, the NCAA treated a second declaration of draft eligibility as a permanent loss of college eligibility.\n\n\nThe NBA has since expanded the draft combine to include players with remaining college eligibility (who, like players without college eligibility, can only attend by invitation).[62]\n\n\n\n### Early entrants[edit]\n\n\nPlayers who were not automatically eligible for the draft had to declare their eligibility by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before the draft. For the 2017 draft, this date fell on April 23. After that date \"early entry\" players were able to attend NBA pre-draft camps and individual team workouts to show off their skills and obtain feedback regarding their draft positions. Under the CBA, a player could withdraw from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration date, which was 10 days before the draft. Under NCAA rules, players had until May 24 (10 days after the draft combine) to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility.\n\n\nA player who hired an agent forfeited his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he was drafted.\n\n\n\n#### College underclassmen[edit]\n\n\nAt the time, a record-high 185 underclassed draft prospects (i.e., players with remaining college eligibility) had declared themselves for eligibility at the April 24 deadline (138 of them being from college), although college players who had not hired agents or signed professional contracts outside the NBA were able to decide to return to college by May 24, 10 days after the end of the NBA Draft Combine. These players have publicly indicated that they have hired agents, or had planned to do so around the start of the draft; those who hired agents immediately lost their eligibility to return to NCAA basketball in 2017\u201318.[63] By the end of the May 24 deadline, 73 draft candidates from college decided to return to their respective colleges for at least another year, leaving 64 underclassmen to officially enter the draft this year.[64][65] Additionally, two more players left entry at the end of the international player deadline, meaning both Maverick Rowan from North Carolina State and Darin Johnson from Cal State Northridge would not return for college, but one player managed to enter the college underclassman deadline, thus leaving 63 entries at hand for the NBA Draft.[66]\n\n\n\n* ![United States](image) Bam Adebayo \u2013 F, Kentucky (freshman)\n* ![United States](image) Jarrett Allen \u2013 F, Texas (freshman)\n* ![United States](image) Ike Anigbogu \u2013 F, UCLA (freshman)\n* ![England](image)/![Nigeria](image) OG Anunoby \u2013 F, Indiana (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image) Dwayne Bacon \u2013 G, Florida State (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image) Lonzo Ball \u2013 G, UCLA (freshman)\n* ![United States](image) Jordan Bell \u2013 F, Oregon (junior)\n* ![United States](image) James Blackmon Jr. \u2013 G, Indiana (junior)\n* ![United States](image) Antonio Blakeney \u2013 G, LSU (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image) Tony Bradley \u2013 F, North Carolina (freshman)\n* ![United States](image) Isaiah Briscoe \u2013 G, Kentucky (sophomore)\n* ![Canada](image) Dillon Brooks \u2013 F, Oregon (junior)\n* ![United States](image) Thomas Bryant \u2013 C, Indiana (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image) Clandell Cetoute \u2013 F, Thiel College (junior)\n* ![United States](image) John Collins \u2013 F, Wake Forest (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image) Zach Collins \u2013 F/C, Gonzaga (freshman)\n* ![United States](image) Chance Comanche \u2013 C, Arizona (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image)/![Greece](image) Tyler Dorsey \u2013 G, Oregon (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image) PJ Dozier \u2013 G, South Carolina (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image) Jawun Evans \u2013 G, Oklahoma State (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image) Tony Farmer \u2013 F, Lee College (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image) De'Aaron Fox \u2013 G, Kentucky (freshman)\n* ![United States](image) Markelle Fultz \u2013 G, Washington (freshman)\n* ![United States](image) Harry Giles \u2013 F, Duke (freshman)\n* ![Australia](image) Isaac Humphries \u2013 C, Kentucky (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image) Tre Hunter \u2013 G, Mount San Jacinto College (junior)\n* ![United States](image) Jonathan Isaac \u2013 F, Florida State (freshman)\n* ![United States](image) Frank Jackson \u2013 G, Duke (freshman)\n* ![United States](image) Josh Jackson \u2013 F, Kansas (freshman)\n* ![United States](image) Justin Jackson \u2013 F, North Carolina (junior)\n* ![United States](image) Jaylen Johnson \u2013 F, Louisville (junior)\n* ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) Ted Kapita \u2013 F, NC State (freshman)\n* ![United States](image) Marcus Keene \u2013 G, Central Michigan (junior)\n* ![United States](image) Luke Kennard \u2013 G, Duke (sophomore)\n* ![United States](image) Kyle Kuzma \u2013 F, Utah (junior)\n* ![Israel](image)/![United States](image) T.

Initially, there were 46 players who originally expressed interest entering the 2017 draft. At the end of the international deadline, 36 players wound up declining entry for the draft, leaving only 10 international players staying in the NBA Draft. As a result, 73 total underclassmen entered the 2017 NBA Draft.\n\n\n\n* ![Sweden](image) Simon Birgander \u2013 F/C, Calzados Robusta Clavijo (Spain)\n* ![Croatia](image) Luka Bo\u017ei\u0107 \u2013 G/F, KK Zagreb (Croatia)\n* ![Slovenia](image) Vlatko \u010can\u010dar \u2013 F, Mega Leks (Serbia)\n* ![Brazil](image) Wesley Alves da Silva \u2013 F, Paulistano Corpore (Brazil)\n* ![Brazil](image) Georginho de Paula \u2013 G, Paulistano Corpore (Brazil)\n* ![Germany](image) Isaiah Hartenstein \u2013 C, \u017dalgiris Kaunas (Lithuania)\n* ![France](image) Jonathan Jeanne \u2013 C, SLUC Nancy (France)\n* ![France](image) Alpha Kaba \u2013 F/C, Mega Leks (Serbia)\n* ![France](image) Tidjan Keita \u2013 F, C\u00e9gep de Thetford (Canada)\n* ![France](image) Frank Ntilikina \u2013 G, SIG Strasbourg (France)\n\n### Automatically eligible entrants[edit]\n\n\nPlayers who do not meet the criteria for \"international\" players are automatically eligible if they meet any of the following criteria:[67]\n\n\n\n* They have completed four years of their college eligibility.\n* If they graduated from high school in the U.S., but did not enroll in a U.S. college or university, four years have passed since their high school class graduated.\n* They have signed a contract with a professional basketball team outside of the NBA, anywhere in the world, and have played under that contract.\n\n\nPlayers who meet the criteria for \"international\" players are automatically eligible if they meet any of the following criteria:\n\n\n\n* They are least 22 years old during the calendar year of the draft.

The on-court element of the combine took place on May 11 and 12. This year's event had Under Armour as its primary sponsor. A total of 67 players were invited for this year's NBA Draft Combine, with 5 more named as alternates in the event some players could not come for whatever reason.[75][76] Ten invited players declined to attend for various reasons, including three players completely on the international scale. Eighteen more players that were guaranteed invitations were also players testing out their draft stocks during the event. Eleven players participating in the event were seniors, the lowest number ever of combine participants who had exhausted their college eligibility. During the event, six different players were deemed injured either before or during this year's Draft Combine. At the end of the May 24 college deadline, eight players who originally declared for the NBA Draft and were invited to the Draft Combine this year, including potential \"none-and-done\" Kentucky freshman redshirt Hamidou Diallo, ultimately returned to college for at least one more season.\n\n\n\n## Draft lottery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: NBA Draft Lottery\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) 2017 NBA Draft Lottery Drawing, *NBA's official YouTube channel*.
