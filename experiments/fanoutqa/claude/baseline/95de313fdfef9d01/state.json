          "content": "<document>\n<title>List of presidents of the United States by age</title>\n<content>\nIn this **list of presidents of the United States by age**, the first table charts the age of each president of the United States at the time of presidential inauguration (first inauguration if elected to multiple and consecutive terms), upon leaving office, and at the time of death. Where the president is still living, their lifespan and post-presidency timespan are calculated up to October 25, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## Age of presidents\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Age of presidents when assuming office\nThe median age at inauguration of incoming U.S. presidents is 55 years.[1][2] The specific years and days median is 55 years and 104.5 days, which falls midway between how old Warren G. Harding was in 1921 and Lyndon B. Johnson was in 1963.\n\n\nArticle Two of the United States Constitution provides that U.S. presidents must be at least 35 years old at the time of taking office. The youngest person to become U.S. president was Theodore Roosevelt, who, at age\u00a042, succeeded to the office after the assassination of William McKinley.[1] The youngest at the time of his election to the office was John F. Kennedy, at age\u00a043.[3] The oldest person elected president was Joe Biden, the nation's current president, at age\u00a077. Biden celebrated a birthday between Election Day and Inauguration Day making him 78 when sworn into office.[1][4]\n\n\nAssassinated at age 46, John F. Kennedy was the youngest president at the end of his tenure, and his lifespan was the shortest of any president.[3][5] At age 50, Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest person to become a former president.[6] The oldest president at the end of his tenure was Ronald Reagan at 77; this distinction will eventually fall upon Joe Biden,[2][4] who is currently 81.\n\n\nJames K. Polk had the shortest retirement of any president, dying 3 months after leaving office at age 53 (the youngest president to die of natural causes).[7] Jimmy Carter's retirement, now 43 years, is the longest in American presidential history. At age 100, Carter is also the oldest living president[2] and the nation's longest-lived president.[8] The youngest living president is Barack Obama, age 63.\n\n\n\n## Presidential age-related data\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| No. | President\n | Born\n | Age atstart of presidency | Age atend of presidency | Post-presidencytimespan\n | Lifespan\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Died\n | Age\n |\n| 01\n | George Washington | Feb 22, 1732[a] | 57\u00a0years, 67\u00a0daysApr 30, 1789 | 65\u00a0years, 10\u00a0daysMar 4, 1797 | 2\u00a0years, 285\u00a0days\n | Dec 14, 1799 | 67\u00a0years, 295\u00a0days\n |\n| 02\n | John Adams | Oct 30, 1735[a] | 61\u00a0years, 125\u00a0daysMar 4, 1797 | 65\u00a0years, 125\u00a0daysMar 4, 1801 | 25\u00a0years, 122\u00a0days | July 5, 1826Jul 4, 1826 | 90\u00a0years, 247\u00a0days |\n| 03\n | Thomas Jefferson | Apr 13, 1743[a] | 57\u00a0years, 325\u00a0daysMar 4, 1801 | 65\u00a0years, 325\u00a0daysMar 4, 1809 | 17\u00a0years, 122\u00a0days\n | Jul 4, 1826 | 83\u00a0years, 82\u00a0days\n |\n| 04\n | James Madison | Mar 16, 1751[a] | 57\u00a0years, 353\u00a0daysMar 4, 1809 | 65\u00a0years, 353\u00a0daysMar 4, 1817 | 19\u00a0years, 116\u00a0days\n | Jun 28, 1836 | 85\u00a0years, 104\u00a0days\n |\n| 05\n | James Monroe | Apr 28, 1758 | 58\u00a0years, 310\u00a0daysMar 4, 1817 | 66\u00a0years, 310\u00a0daysMar 4, 1825 | 6\u00a0years, 122\u00a0days\n | Jul 4, 1831 | 73\u00a0years, 67\u00a0days\n |\n| 06\n | John Quincy Adams | Jul 11, 1767 | 57\u00a0years, 236\u00a0daysMar 4, 1825 | 61\u00a0years, 236\u00a0daysMar 4, 1829 | 18\u00a0years, 356\u00a0days\n | Feb 23, 1848 | 80\u00a0years, 227\u00a0days\n |\n| 07\n | Andrew Jackson | Mar 15, 1767 | 61\u00a0years, 354\u00a0daysMar 4, 1829 | 69\u00a0years, 354\u00a0daysMar 4, 1837 | 8\u00a0years, 96\u00a0days\n | Jun 8, 1845 | 78\u00a0years, 85\u00a0days\n |\n| 08\n | Martin Van Buren | Dec 5, 1782 | 54\u00a0years, 89\u00a0daysMar 4, 1837 | 58\u00a0years, 89\u00a0daysMar 4, 1841 | 21\u00a0years, 142\u00a0days\n | Jul 24, 1862 | 79\u00a0years, 231\u00a0days\n |\n| 09\n | William Henry Harrison | Feb 9, 1773 | 68\u00a0years, 23\u00a0daysMar 4, 1841 | 68\u00a0years, 54\u00a0days Apr 4, 1841 | 00,0010 days[b] | Apr 4, 1841 | 68\u00a0years, 54\u00a0days\n |\n| 10\n | John Tyler | Mar 29, 1790 | 51\u00a0years, 6\u00a0daysApr 4, 1841 | 54\u00a0years, 340\u00a0daysMar 4, 1845 | 16\u00a0years, 320\u00a0days\n | Jan 18, 1862 | 71\u00a0years, 295\u00a0days\n |\n| 11\n | James K.
