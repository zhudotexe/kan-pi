Ideologically a moderate member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.\n\n\nBorn in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and to the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and Biden was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. Biden is the second Catholic president in U.S. history (after John F. Kennedy), and his politics have been widely described as profoundly influenced by Catholic social teaching.\n\n\nTaking office at age 78, Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history, the first to have a female vice president, and the first from Delaware. In 2021, he signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill, as well as a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its related recession. Biden proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that was signed into law in 2022. Biden also signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which focused on manufacturing, appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court and worked with congressional Republicans to prevent a first-ever national default by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. Biden has responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Biden announced American military support for Israel, and condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism.[1] In April 2023, he announced his candidacy for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2024 presidential election. \n\n\n\n\n## Early life (1942–1965)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early life and career of Joe Biden\n\nJoseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[2] at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,[3] to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden (née Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.[4][5] The oldest child in a Catholic family of largely Irish descent, he has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James.[6]\n\n\nBiden's father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in the fall of 1946,[7] but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[8][9][10] and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton.[11] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden's father could not find steady work.[12] Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[13] the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield.[14][15][9][11] Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[11][12][16]\n\n\nAt Archmere Academy in Claymont,[17] Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team.[11][18] Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years.[19][20] He graduated in 1961.[19] At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football,[21][22] and, as an unexceptional student,[23] earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science.[24][25]\n\n\nBiden had a stutter, and has mitigated it since his early twenties.[26] He has described his efforts to reduce it by reciting poetry before a mirror.[20][27]\n\n\n\n## Marriages, law school, and early career (1966–1973)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early career of Joe Biden\n\nSee also: Family of Joe Biden\nOn August 27, 1966, Biden married Neilia Hunter, a student at Syracuse University,[24][28] after overcoming her parents' reluctance for her to wed a Roman Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York.[29] They had three children: Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III, Robert Hunter Biden, and Naomi Christina \"Amy\" Biden.[24]\n\n\n![](image)Biden in the Syracuse 1968 yearbook\nIn 1968, Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law, ranked 76th in his class of 85, after failing a course due to an acknowledged \"mistake\" when he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school.[23] He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.[2]\n\n\nIn 1968, Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett and, he later said, \"thought of myself as a Republican\".[30][31] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968.[30] Biden was recruited by local Republicans but registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon.[30]\n\n\nIn 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a public defender and then at a firm headed by a locally active Democrat[32][30] who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party;[33] Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat.[30] He and another attorney also formed a law firm.[32] Corporate law did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well.[11] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[34]\n\n\nIn 1970, Biden ran for the 4th district seat on the New Castle County Council on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[35][36] The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom, who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts.[37][38][39] Biden won the general election by defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971.[40][41] He served until January 1, 1973, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift.[42][43] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.[43]\n\n\nBiden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war.[44] While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments, at a time when most draftees were sent to the war. In 1968, based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had \"asthma as a teenager\" was the reason for the deferment.[45]\n\n\n\n### 1972 U.S. Senate campaign in Delaware[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1972 United States Senate election in Delaware\n\nIn 1972, Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs, and with minimal campaign funds, he was given no chance of winning.[32][11] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[46] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[34] He received help from the AFL–CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[32] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care, and public dissatisfaction with \"politics as usual\".[32][46] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[32] but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,[16] and he won with 50.5% of the vote.[46]\n\n\n\n### Death of wife and daughter[edit]\n\n\nOn December 18, 1972, a few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware.[24][47] Neilia's station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) were taken to the hospital in fair condition, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries.[48] Biden considered resigning to care for them,[16] but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to.[49] The accident filled Biden with anger and religious doubt. He wrote that he \"felt God had played a horrible trick\" on him,[50] and he had trouble focusing on work.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Second marriage[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden and his wife smiling, dressed casually](image)Biden and his second wife, Jill, met in 1975 and married in 1977.Biden met the teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date.[53] They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977.[54][55] They spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic.[56][57] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.[58] Biden is Roman Catholic and attends Mass with his wife, Jill, at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware.[59][60][61] Their daughter, Ashley Biden,[24] is a social worker, and is married to physician Howard Krein.[62] Beau Biden became an Army Judge Advocate in Iraq and later Delaware Attorney General[63] before dying of brain cancer in 2015.[64][65] Hunter Biden worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings and personal life came under significant scrutiny during his father's presidency.[66][67]\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1991 to 2008, as an adjunct professor, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law.[68][69] Biden sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class.[70][71][72][73]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (1973–2009)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: US Senate career of Joe Biden\n\n### Senate activities[edit]\n\n\n![Scanned photo of Biden and Carter smiling at each other in the Oval Office. On the photo, Carter wrote: \"Best wishes to my friend Joe Biden\"](image)Biden with President Jimmy Carter, 1979\n![Biden-Church-Sadat](image)Biden shaking hands with President Anwar Sadat after the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, 1979\nIn January 1973, secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo swore Biden in at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center.[74][48] Present were his sons Beau (whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident) and Hunter and other family members.[74][48] At 30, he was the seventh-youngest senator in U.S. history.[75] To see his sons, Biden traveled by train between his Delaware home and D.C.[76]—74 minutes each way—and maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate.[16]\n\n\nElected to the Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.[77] He was junior senator to William Roth, who was first elected in 1970, until Roth was defeated in 2000.[78] As of 2023[update], he was the 19th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.[79]\n\n\nDuring his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[80] In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription.[81] Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Jimmy Carter for president in the 1976 Democratic primary.[82] Carter went on to win the Democratic nomination and defeat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. Biden also worked on arms control.[83][84] After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden met with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.[85] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its continued policy of apartheid.[30]\n\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[86] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy *de jure* segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy *de facto* segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[87] In 1976, Biden supported a measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them.[86] In 1977, he co-sponsored an amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978.[88]\n\n\n\n![Photo of Biden shaking hands with Reagan in the Oval Office](image)Biden shaking hands with President Ronald Reagan, 1984\nBiden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. In 1984, he was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.[89] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a ban on assault weapons,[90][91] and the Violence Against Women Act,[92] which he has called his most significant legislation.[93] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;[94][95] in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a \"big mistake\", citing its policy on crack cocaine and saying that the bill \"trapped an entire generation\".[96]\n\n\nIn 1993, Biden voted for a provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gays from serving in the armed forces.[97][98] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.[99] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in *Obergefell v. Hodges*.[100]\n\n\nBiden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying \"it's going to be a cold day in hell\" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.[101] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of President Clinton.[102] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.[16] Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act,[16] with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.[103] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security.[77][104]\n\n\n\n### Brain surgeries[edit]\n\n\nIn February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm.[105][106] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, a serious complication.[106] After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May,[106][107] Biden's recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[108]\n\n\n\n### Senate Judiciary Committee[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Senator Biden giving a speech, with uniformed law enforcement officers in the background](image)Biden speaking at the signing of the 1994 Crime Bill with President Bill Clinton in 1994\nBiden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.[109]\n\n\nAs chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[16] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌ given in an interview the previous year‍—‌ of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered,[110] but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[110][111] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[16] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[111] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5–9 vote[111] and then in the full Senate, 42–58.[112]\n\n\nDuring Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them,[113] and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to \"beanballs\".[114] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law school professor, had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together.[115][116] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[16] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.[117] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed.[16] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[117] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.[118]\n\n\n\n### Senate Foreign Relations Committee[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Clinton, his senior officials, and Biden on Air Force One](image)Senator Biden accompanies President Clinton and other officials to Bosnia and Herzegovina, December 1997.\nBiden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.[119] His positions were generally liberal internationalist.[83][120] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[119][120] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.[121]\n\n\nBiden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991,[120] siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators. He said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition.[122]\n\n\nBiden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.[83] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the \"lift and strike\" policy.[83][119] The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[83][120] In April 1993, Biden held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević.[123] Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement.[123] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his \"proudest moment in public life\" related to foreign policy.[120] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia.[83] He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over Yugoslav actions toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.[120][124]\n\n\n\n#### Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq[edit]\n\n\nMain article: War on terror\n\n![refer to caption](image)Biden addresses the press after meeting with Prime Minister Ayad Allawi in Baghdad in 2004.Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, \"Whatever it takes, we should do it.\"[125] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to \"eliminate\" that threat.[126] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. Invasion of Iraq.[120] As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaeda, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction.[127] Biden eventually became a critic of the war and viewed his vote and role as a \"mistake\", but did not push for withdrawal.[120][123] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should \"level with the American people\" about its cost and length.[119][124]\n\n\nBy late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007,[120][123] saying General David Petraeus was \"dead, flat wrong\" in believing the surge could work.[128] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[129] Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for \"a third way\": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis \"breathing room\" in their own regions.[130] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,[131] but the idea failed to gain traction.[128]\n\n\n\n## Presidential campaigns of 1988 and 2008[edit]\n\n\n### 1988 campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign\n\n![Photo of Biden smiling, looking to the side](image)Biden at the White House in 1987\nBiden formally declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9, 1987.[132] He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his appeal to Baby Boomers; he would have been the second-youngest person elected president, after John F. Kennedy.[30][133][134] He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate.[133][134]\n\n\nBy August his campaign's messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries,[135] and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.[136] Biden's speech had similar lines about being the first person in his family to attend university. Biden had credited Kinnock with the formulation on previous occasions,[137][138] but did not on two occasions in late August.[139]: 230–232[138] Kinnock himself was more forgiving; the two men met in 1988, forming an enduring friendship.[140]\n\n\nEarlier that year he had also used passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which his aides took blame) and a short phrase from John F. Kennedy's inaugural address; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey.[141] Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, Jesse Jackson, had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used.[16][23]\n\n\nA few days later, an incident in law school in which Biden drew text from a *Fordham Law Review* article with inadequate citations was publicized.[23] He was required to repeat the course and passed with high marks.[142] At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules.[143]\n\n\nBiden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class,[144][145] and that he had marched in the civil rights movement.[146] The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures[147] and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy, saying it had been overrun by \"the exaggerated shadow\" of his past mistakes.[148]\n\n\n\n### 2008 campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign\n\n![Photo of Biden, casually dressed, talking with a citizen in a garden](image)Biden campaigns at a house party in Creston, Iowa, July 2007.\nAfter exploring the possibility of a run in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections.[77][149][150] During his campaign, Biden focused on the Iraq War, his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience.[151] Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani: \"There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11.\"[152]\n\n\nBiden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton.[153] He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.[154] He withdrew from the race that evening.[155]\n\n\nDespite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world.[156]: 336 In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,[128][157] while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.[156]: 28, 337–338 Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was \"the real deal\".[157][156]: 28, 337–338\n\n\n\n## Vice presidential campaigns of 2008 and 2012[edit]\n\n\n### 2008 campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign and 2008 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection\n\n![Photo of Biden outdoors behind a lectern, with Obama seated behind him and smiling](image)Biden speaks at the August 23, 2008, vice presidential announcement at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois.\nShortly after Biden withdrew from the presidential race, Obama privately told him he was interested in finding an important place for Biden in his administration.[158] In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility,[158] and developed a strong personal rapport.[157] On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate.[159] *The New York Times* reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone with foreign policy and national security experience.[160] Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters.[161][162] Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.[163]\n\n\nBiden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[164][165] Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks, such as one he made about Obama's being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention.[166][167] Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama. \"How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?\" he asked.[156]: 411–414, 419 Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders \"Joe bombs\" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden.[168] Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.[156]: 411–414\n\n\nAs the financial crisis of 2007–2010 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008 and the proposed bailout of the United States financial system became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed in the Senate, 74–25.[169] On October 2, 2008, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had won the debate overall.[170]\n\n\nOn November 4, 2008, Obama and Biden were elected with 53% of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes to McCain–Palin's 173.[171][172][173]\n\n\nAt the same time Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate,[174] as permitted by Delaware law.[77] On November 4, he was reelected to the Senate, defeating Republican Christine O'Donnell.[175] Having won both races, Biden made a point of waiting to resign from the Senate until he was sworn in for his seventh term on January 6, 2009.[176] Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program,[177] and resigned from the Senate later that day.[b]\n\n\n\n### 2012 campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign\n\n![Official portrait of Obama and Biden, smiling](image)Biden and Obama, July 2012\nIn October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election,[181] but with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket with Hillary Clinton.[182] The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama,[182] and White House officials later said Obama himself had never entertained the idea.[183]\n\n\nBiden's May 2012 statement that he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as \"evolving\".[184] Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention.[168][185][186] Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement,[185] and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks.[187] Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out,[188][189] while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart.[185]\n\n\nThe Obama campaign valued Biden as a retail-level politician, and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012.[190][191] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would \"put y'all back in chains\" once again drew attention to Biden's propensity for colorful remarks.[190][192][193] In the vice-presidential debate on October 11 with Republican nominee Paul Ryan, Biden defended the Obama administration's record.[194][195] On November 6, Obama and Biden won reelection[196] over Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan with 332 of 538 Electoral College votes and 51% of the popular vote.[197]\n\n\n\n## Vice presidency (2009–2017)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Presidency of Barack Obama\n\n### First term (2009–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden raising his right hand, reciting the Oath](image)Biden being sworn in as vice president on January 20, 2009\nBiden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.[198] On January 20, 2009, he was sworn in as the 47th vice president of the United States.[199] He was the first vice president from Delaware[200] and the first Roman Catholic vice president.[201][202]\n\n\nObama was soon comparing Biden to a basketball player \"who does a bunch of things that don't show up in the stat sheet\".[203] In May, Biden visited Kosovo and affirmed the U.S. position that its \"independence is irreversible\".[204] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan,[205][206] but his skepticism was valued,[207] and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.[208] Biden visited Iraq about every two months,[128] becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there.[207] More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility: Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\"[209] By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.[191][210]\n\n\n\n![Photo of Obama and Biden shaking hands in the Oval Office](image)President Obama congratulates Biden for his role in shaping the debt ceiling deal which led to the Budget Control Act of 2011.\nBiden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession.[211] During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred,[207] and when he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.[212]\n\n\nIn late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak led to a swift retraction by the White House.[213] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes.[214][208][215] Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had \"misread how bad the economy was\" but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.[216] On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was \"a big fucking deal\". Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.[168]\n\n\nMembers of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions.[217] Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink.[203] Obama said, \"The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me.\"[207] The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.[218]\n\n\nBiden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party.[181] Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.[219][220] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty.[219][220] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts.[220][221] The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010.\n\n\n\n![Photo of Obama, Biden, and national security staffers in the Situation Room, somberly listening to updates on the bin Laden raid](image)Biden, Obama and the national security team gathered in the White House Situation Room to monitor the progress of the May 2011 mission to kill Osama bin Laden.\nIn March 2011, Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown.[222] The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in breaking a deadlock and bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed on August 2, 2011, the same day an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed.[223][224][225] Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden,[191][226] lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects.[227][228]\n\n\nIn December 2012, Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force, created to address the causes of school shootings and consider possible gun control to implement in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[229] Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the \"fiscal cliff\", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013.[230][231] It made many of the Bush tax cuts permanent but raised rates on upper income levels.[231]\n\n\n\n### Second term (2013–2017)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Biden in Morocco, November 2014\nBiden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle, his official residence, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).[232]\n\n\nBiden played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013. This was because Senate majority leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.[233][234][235]\n\n\nBiden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs.[236][237]\n\n\nBiden favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[238] As the ISIL insurgency in Iraq intensified in 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along.[239][240] Biden himself said the U.S. would follow ISIL \"to the gates of hell\".[241] Biden had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and was assigned a focus on the region during the administration; he visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president.[242] In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia, where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vučić, and expressed his condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.[243]\n\n\n\n![Photo of Biden and Netanyahu giving speeches, with American and Israeli flags in the background](image)Biden with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, March 9, 2016\nBiden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction.[244]\n\n\n\n#### Role in the 2016 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nDuring his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.[245] With his family, many friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with Hillary Clinton's favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a \"Draft Biden 2016\" PAC was established.[245][246][247]\n\n\nBy late 2015, Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son's recent death had largely drained his emotional energy, and said, \"nobody has a right ... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110% of who they are.\"[248] On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016.[249][250][251]\n\n\n\n## Subsequent activities (2017–2019)[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Trump speaking to Biden and Obama, with Trump's hand on Obama's shoulder](image)Biden with Barack Obama and Donald Trump, at the latter's inauguration on January 20, 2017\nAfter leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania, developing the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Biden remained in that position into 2019, before running for president.[252][253]\n\n\nIn 2017, Biden wrote a memoir, *Promise Me, Dad*, and went on a book tour.[254] By 2019, he and his wife reported that they had earned over $15 million since the end of his vice presidency from speaking engagements and book sales.[255]\n\n\nBiden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the presidency of Donald Trump.[256][257][258] He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency.[259][260] In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator John McCain, praising McCain's embrace of American ideals and bipartisan friendships.[261] Biden continued to support efforts to find treatments for cancer.[262]\n\n\n\n## 2020 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign\n\n### Speculation and announcement[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden raising his fist while while standing behind a lectern](image)Biden at his presidential kickoff rally in Philadelphia, May 2019\nBetween 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[263] When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying \"never say never\".[264] A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the race.[265] He finally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,[266] saying he was prompted to run because he was worried by the Trump administration and felt a \"sense of duty\".[267]\n\n\n\n### Campaign[edit]\n\n\nAs the 2020 campaign season heated up, voluminous public polling showed Biden as one of the best-performing Democratic candidates in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump.[268][269][270] With Democrats keenly focused on \"electability\" for defeating Trump,[271] this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters.[272] It also made Biden a frequent target of Trump.[273][274] In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden.[275] Despite the allegations, no evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[276][277][278] Trump's pressure to investigate the Bidens was perceived by many as an attempt to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency.[279] Trump's alleged actions against Biden resulted in a political scandal[280] and Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of congress.[281]\n\n\nIn March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of previous instances of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[282] Biden had previously called himself a \"tactile politician\" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him.[283] Journalist Mark Bowden described Biden's lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he \"doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you... scooting closer\" and leaning forward to talk.[284] In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more \"respectful of people's personal space\".[285]\n\n\n\n![Photo of Biden holding a microphone, with a crowd in the background](image)Biden at a rally on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, February 2020\nThroughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.[286][287] Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and eight days later, fifth in the New Hampshire primary.[288][289] He performed better in the Nevada caucuses, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind Bernie Sanders.[290] Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points.[291] After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, he made large gains in the March 3 Super Tuesday primary elections. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests, putting him in the lead overall.[292] Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10.[293]\n\n\nIn late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.[294] There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.[294][295] Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.[296][297]\n\n\nWhen Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for president.[298] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes.[299] Former President Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day.[300] On August 11, Biden announced U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[301] On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.[302][303]\n\n\n\n### Presidential transition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidential transition of Joe Biden\n\nBiden was elected the 46th president of the United States in November 2020. He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[304] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[305] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[306]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2021, during Congress' electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol, saying, \"We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.\"[307] Soon after, they attacked the Capitol. During the insurrection at the Capitol, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times\".[308][309] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[310]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Joe Biden\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Joe Biden presidency.\n\n![Photo of Biden raising his right hand, with his left hand placed on a thick Bible](image)Biden takes the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. at the Capitol, January 20, 2021.\n### Inauguration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Inauguration of Joe Biden\n\nBiden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021.[311] At 78, he is the oldest person to have assumed the office.[311] He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy)[312] and the first president whose home state is Delaware.[313] He is also the first man since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after Richard Nixon in 1968) to be elected president.[314] He is also the first president from the Silent Generation.[315]\n\n\nBiden's inauguration was \"a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration\" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since 1869 to not attend his successor's inauguration.[316]\n\n\n\n### First 100 days[edit]\n\n\nSee also: First 100 days of Joe Biden's presidency\n\nIn his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, face mask requirements on federal property, measures to combat hunger in the United States,[317][318][319][320] and revoking permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.[321][322][323] In his first two weeks in office, Biden signed more executive orders than any other president since Franklin D. Roosevelt had in their first month in office.[324]\n\n\nOn February 4, 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen.[325]\n\n\n\n![Group photo of Biden, Harris and cabinet members standing outdoors](image)Biden with his Cabinet, July 2021\nOn March 11, the first anniversary of COVID-19 having been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus and relief package that he had proposed to support the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[326] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit. Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after the Senate parliamentarian determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats declined to pursue overruling her and removed the increase from the package.[327][328][329]\n\n\nAlso in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico, Biden told migrants, \"Don't come over.\" In the meantime, migrant adults \"are being sent back\", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[330] Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them (before they were sent to sponsors), leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help.[331]\n\n\nOn April 14, Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years.[332] In February 2020, the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.[333] Biden's decision met with a wide range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support.[334] On April 22–23, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%–52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Other countries also increased their pledges.[335][336] On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress.[337]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\nOn June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday.[338] Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since 1986.[339] In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that the country has \"a pandemic for those who haven't gotten the vaccination\" and that it was therefore \"gigantically important\" for Americans to be vaccinated.[340]\n\n\n\n#### Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inflation rate, United States and eurozone, January 2018 through June 2023\nMain article: Economic policy of the Joe Biden administration\n\nBiden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation. Real GDP grew 5.9 percent, the fastest rate in 37 years.[341][342] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year.[343][344][345] By the end of 2021, inflation reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1 percent, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years.[346][347][348][349] In his third month in office, Biden signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, an increase of nearly 37 percent. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022.[350][351]\n\n\nAmid a surge in inflation and high gas prices, Biden's approval ratings declined, reaching net negative in early 2022.[352][353][354] After 5.9 percent growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in Biden's second year to 2.1 percent, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5 percent in December. Inflation peaked at 8.9 percent in June but began easing in the second half of the year, to 6.5 percent in December. Stocks had their worst performance since 2008.[355][356][357][358] Despite widespread predictions of an imminent recession in 2022 and 2023, by late 2023 indicators showed economic acceleration.[359]\n\n\nOver the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion. After Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers.[360] He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure.[361]\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 118th Congress, Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff that raised the risk that the United States would default on its debt.[362] Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which would suspend the debt limit until January 2025. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default.[363] The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden.[364][365]\n\n\n\n#### Judiciary[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden and Jackson looking at an off-camera television screen](image)Biden and Ketanji Brown Jackson watching the U.S. Senate vote on her confirmation, April 2022\nBy the end of 2021, 40 of Biden's appointees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan.[366] Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color.[367] Most of his appointments have been in blue states, making a limited impact since the courts in these states already generally lean liberal.[368]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, a moderate liberal nominated by Bill Clinton, announced his intention to retire from the Supreme Court. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,[369] a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement.[370] On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.[371] She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 7[372] and sworn in on June 30.[373]\n\n\n\n#### Infrastructure and climate[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Build Back Better Plan and Environmental policy of the Joe Biden administration\n\n![Phot of Biden, Johnson and Guterres standing onstage](image)Biden, UK prime minister Boris Johnson and UN secretary-general António Guterres at the opening ceremony of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on November 1, 2021\nAs part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development.[374][375] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,[376][377] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[378] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[379]\n\n\nThe other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change.[380][381] The bill did not have Republican support, so Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion.[382] After Manchin rejected the bill,[383] the Build Back Better Act's size was reduced and comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform.[384]\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by Senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin.[385][386] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform.[387] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower US greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.[388] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51–50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. The bill was passed by the House on August 12[388] and was signed by Biden on August 16.[389][390]\n\n\nBefore and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort.[391] He tried to convince China[392] and Australia[393] to do more. He convened an online Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change to press other countries to strengthen their climate policy.[394][395] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024.[396] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions.[397] In July 2023, when the 2023 heat waves hit the U.S., Biden announced several measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change.[398][399]\n\n\n\n#### COVID-19 diagnosis[edit]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 with reportedly mild symptoms.[400] According to the White House, he was treated with Paxlovid.[401] He worked in isolation in the White House for five days[402] and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30.[403]\n\n\n\n#### Other domestic policy issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, Biden endorsed a change to the Senate filibuster to allow for the passing of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act, on both of which the Senate had failed to invoke cloture.[404] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.[405] In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 to revamp the finances and operations of the United States Postal Service agency.[406]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2022, the Biden administration announced it would fill four wide gaps on the Mexico–United States border in Arizona near Yuma, an area with some of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings. During his presidential campaign, Biden had pledged to cease all future border wall construction.[407] This occurred after both allies and critics of Biden criticized his administration's management of the southern border.[408]\n\n\n\n![Photo of Biden and staffers, seated, looking at a television](image)Biden and senior advisers watch the Senate pass the CHIPS and Science Act on July 27, 2022.\nIn the summer of 2022, several other pieces of legislation Biden supported passed Congress. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act aimed to address gun reform issues following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.[409] The act's gun control provisions include extended background checks for gun purchasers under 21, clarification of Federal Firearms License requirements, funding for state red flag laws and other crisis intervention programs, further criminalization of arms trafficking and straw purchases, and partial closure of the boyfriend loophole.[410][411][412] Biden signed the bill on June 25, 2022.[413]\n\n\nThe Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 was introduced in 2021 and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022.[414] The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including burn pits, during military service.[415] The bill gained significant media coverage due to the activism of comedian Jon Stewart.[416]\n\n\nBiden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022.[417] The act provides billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors, to compete economically with China.[418]\n\n\nOn October 6, 2022, Biden pardoned all Americans convicted of \"small\" amounts of cannabis possession under federal law.[419] Two months later, he signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages.[420]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 elections[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden holding a microphone at a campaign rally, with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up](image)Biden holding a rally at Bowie State University in Maryland for gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore, November 7, 2022\nOn September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast Philadelphia speech, Biden called for a \"battle for the soul of the nation\". Off camera, he called Trump supporters \"semi-fascists\", which Republican commentators denounced.[421][422][423] A predicted Republican wave election did not materialize and the race for U.S. Congress control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of 222 seats in the House of Representatives,[424][425][426][427] and the Democratic caucus keeping control of the U.S. Senate, with 51 seats, a gain of one seat from the last Congress.[428][c]\n\n\nIt was the first midterm election since 1986 in which the party of the incumbent president achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since 1934 in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers.[431] Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly favorable performance,[432] and he celebrated the results as a strong day for democracy.[433]\n\n\n\n#### Discovery of classified documents[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joe Biden classified documents incident\n\nOn November 2, 2022, while packing files at the Penn Biden Center, Biden's attorneys found classified documents dating to his vice presidency in a \"locked closet\".[434][435] According to the White House, the documents were reported that day to the U.S. National Archives, which recovered the documents the next day.[435] On November 14, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. to conduct an investigation.[436][437] On December 20, a second batch of classified documents was discovered in the garage of Biden's Wilmington, Delaware residence.[438]\n\n\nThe findings were made public on January 10, 2023, after several news organizations published articles on the investigation.[435][439] On January 12, Garland appointed Robert K. Hur as special counsel to investigate \"possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records\".[440] On January 20, after a 13-hour consensual search by FBI investigators, six more items with classified markings were recovered from Biden's Wilmington residence.[441] FBI agents searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach on February 1 and collected papers and notes from his time as vice president, but did not find any classified information.[442]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden, Stoltenberg, and staffers sitting in the Oval Office](image)Biden meeting with Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg in the Oval Office, June 7, 2021\nIn June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president. In eight days he visited Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended a G7 summit, a NATO summit, and an EU summit, and held one-on-one talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin.[443]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure \"peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term\"; the deal included nuclear-powered submarines built for Australia's use.[444]\n\n\n\n#### Withdrawal from Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)\n\n![Photo of Biden seated alone at a table, looking at a videoconference screen](image)Biden in a video conference with Vice President Harris and the U.S. National Security team, discussing the Fall of Kabul on August 15, 2021\nAmerican forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a February 2020 US-Taliban agreement that set a May 1, 2021, deadline.[445] The Taliban began an offensive on May 1.[446][447] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn.[333] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, \"The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\"[333]\n\n\nOn August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.[333][448] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist in the evacuation of American personnel and Afghan allies.[449] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal,[450] with the evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies described as chaotic and botched.[451][452][453] On August 16, Biden addressed the \"messy\" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation \"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\".[448][454] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\".[454][455]\n\n\nOn August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were \"planners and facilitators\", according to a U.S. Army general.[456] On August 29, another American drone strike killed ten civilians, including seven children. The Defense Department initially claimed the strike was conducted on an Islamic State suicide bomber threatening Kabul Airport, but admitted the suspect was harmless on September 17, calling its killing of civilians \"a tragic mistake\".[457]\n\n\nThe U.S. military completed withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30. Biden called the extraction of over 120,000 Americans, Afghans and other allies \"an extraordinary success\".[458] He acknowledged that up to 200 Americans who wanted to leave did not, despite his August 18 pledge to keep troops in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left.[459]\n\n\n\n#### Aid to Ukraine[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of a smiling Biden holding a child, with a mask lowered onto his chin](image)Biden with refugees from Ukraine in Warsaw, Poland, March 2022\nIn late February 2022, after warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden led the U.S. response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $8 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine.[460][461][462] On April 29, Biden asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine,[463] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion.[464] Biden blamed Vladimir Putin for the emerging energy and food crises,[465] saying, \"Putin's war has raised the price of food because Ukraine and Russia are two of the world's major breadbaskets for wheat and corn, the basic product for so many foods around the world.\"[466]\n\n\nOn February 20, 2023, four days before the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden visited Kyiv and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and first lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska.[467] While there, he promised more military aid to Ukraine and denounced the war.[468] The trip was unannounced, and involved major security coordination to ensure safety.[469]\n\n\n\n#### China relations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: China–United States relations\n\n![](image)Biden with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during the G20 summit in Bali, November 14, 2022\nChina's assertiveness, particularly in the Pacific, remains a challenge for Biden. The Solomon Islands-China security pact caused alarm, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal, as Anthony Albanese succeeded to the premiership of Australia and Jacinda Ardern's government took a firmer line on Chinese influence.[470][471][472] In a September 2022 interview with *60 Minutes*, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of \"an unprecedented attack\" by the Chinese,[473] which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" toward China and Taiwan.[474][475][476] The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.[477] Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed.[477][478][474] In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy.[479]\n\n\nOn February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[480][481] The Biden administration described the balloon as carrying two railroad cars' equivalent of spy equipment with a propeller for maneuverability.[482][483] The State Department said the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations.[484] The Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian (mainly meteorological) airship that had blown off course.[485] The incident was seen as damaging to U.S. and China relations.[486][487][488]\n\n\n\n#### Israel[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Biden with Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 18, 2023\nIn May 2021, during a flareup in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Biden said, \"my party still supports Israel\".[489] In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that devolved into a war, jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.[490] Biden stated his unequivocal support for Israel, deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war,[491] and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel.[492] He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.[493] Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to the people of the Gaza Strip.[494] He asked Israel to pause the invasion for at least three days to allow for hostage negotiations; Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses.[495]\n\n\n\n#### Other foreign issues[edit]\n\n\nIn early February 2022, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the second leader of the Islamic State.[496] In late July, Biden approved the drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second leader of Al-Qaeda, and an integral member in the planning of the September 11 attacks.[497] The 2022 OPEC+ oil production cut caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, widening the rift between the two countries, and threatening a longstanding alliance.[498][499]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Biden's letter to Peruvian President Dina Boluarte for Fiestas Patrias praising her government for \"advancing our democratic values, including human rights\" raised controversy due to her administration's violent response to protests, including the Ayacucho and Juliaca massacres.[500][501]\n\n\nBiden may skip the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 28) even though United Arab Emirates officials previously expected he would participate. The 2023 Israel–Hamas war and internal problems with government spending are cited as possible causes.[502]\n\n\n\n### Impeachment inquiry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden\n\nOn September 12, 2023, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden, saying that recent House investigations \"paint a picture of corruption\" by him and his family.[503][504][505][506] Congressional investigations, most notably by the House Oversight committee, have discovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden.[d]\n\n\n\n### 2024 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign\n\nEnding months of speculation,[511][512] on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for a second term as president in the 2024 election, with Harris again as his running mate. The campaign launched four years to the day after the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.[513] It was also announced that Julie Chávez Rodriguez would serve as campaign manager and Quentin Fulks would be principal deputy campaign manager. Co-chairs include Lisa Blunt Rochester, Jim Clyburn, Chris Coons, Tammy Duckworth, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Gretchen Whitmer.\n\n\nOn the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was just 37 percent.[514] Most who were surveyed in the poll said that the economy was their biggest concern.[514] During his campaign, Biden has promoted his economic record by touting the creation of over 13 million jobs, faster pandemic recovery in terms of GDP than other G7 countries, and the longest period of low unemployment in over 50 years.[515][516]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Joe Biden\n\n![Photo of Obama, Biden and Gorbachev smiling at each other](image)Mikhail Gorbachev (right) being introduced to President Obama by Joe Biden, March 2009.

As a senator, he co-sponsored the Boxer–Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate.[541] Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[542] He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050.[543] His program includes reentering the Paris Agreement, nature conservation, and green building.[544] Biden supports environmental justice, including climate justice, and has taken steps to implement it.[545] A major step is increasing energy efficiency, water efficiency and resilience to climate disasters in low-income houses. This should help mitigate climate change, reduce costs for households, and improve health and safety.[546][547] Biden has called global temperature rise above the 1.5 degree limit the \"only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war\".[548] Despite his clean energy policies and congressional Republicans characterizing them as a \"War on American Energy\", domestic oil production reached a record high in October 2023.[549]\n\n\nBiden has said the U.S. needs to \"get tough\" on China, calling it the \"most serious competitor\" that poses challenges to the United States' \"prosperity, security, and democratic values\".[550][551] Biden has spoken about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region to the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, pledging to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[552][553]\n\n\nBiden has said he is against regime change, but for providing non-military support to opposition movements.[554] He opposed direct U.S. intervention in Libya,[555][217] voted against U.S. participation in the Gulf War,[556] voted in favor of the Iraq War,[557] and supports a two-state solution in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[558] Biden has pledged to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and to reevaluate the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia.[257] Biden supports extending the New START arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of nuclear weapons deployed by both sides.[559][560] In 2021, Biden officially recognized the Armenian genocide, becoming the first U.S. president to do so.[561][e]\n\n\nBiden has supported abortion rights throughout his presidency. In 2019, he said he supported *Roe v. Wade* and repealing the Hyde Amendment.[564][565] After *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, he criticized near-total bans on abortion access passed in a majority of Republican-controlled states,[566] and took measures to protect abortion rights in the United States.[567] He has vowed to sign a bill codifying the protections of *Roe* into federal law; such a bill passed the House in 2022, but was unable to clear the Senate filibuster.[568][569]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public image of Joe Biden\n\n![Photo of Obama placing a medal on Biden, who looks emotional but solemn](image)President Obama presents Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction, January 12, 2017.\nBiden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[570][571] which he attributed to his having been elected young.[572] Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term.[89] As of November 2009[update], Biden's net worth was $27,012.[573] By November 2020[update], the Bidens were worth $9 million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[574][575]\n\n\nThe political writer Howard Fineman has written, \"Biden is not an academic, he's not a theoretical thinker, he's a great street pol. He comes from a long line of working people in Scranton—auto salesmen, car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift.\"[34] Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: \"He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better.\"[34] Journalist James Traub has written that \"Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself\".[128] In recent years, especially after the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief.[576][577] In 2020, CNN wrote that his presidential campaign aimed to make him \"healer-in-chief\", while *The New York Times* described his extensive history of being called upon to give eulogies.[578]\n\n\nJournalist and TV anchor Wolf Blitzer has called Biden loquacious;[579] journalist Mark Bowden has said that he is famous for \"talking too much\", leaning in close \"like an old pal with something urgent to tell you\".[284] He often deviates from prepared remarks[580] and sometimes \"puts his foot in his mouth\".[164][581][582] Biden has a reputation for being prone to gaffes[583] and in 2018 called himself \"a gaffe machine\".[584][585] *The New York Times* wrote that Biden's \"weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything\".[164] During his presidency, several Republicans have criticized Biden's publicized gaffes as related to cognitive health issues due to his age, which Biden has repeatedly denied.[586][587][588][589]\n\n\nAccording to *The New York Times*, Biden often embellishes elements of his life or exaggerates, a trait also noted by *The New Yorker* in 2014.[590][591] For instance, he has claimed to have been more active in the civil rights movement than he actually was, and has falsely recalled being an excellent student who earned three college degrees.[590] The *Times* wrote, \"Mr. Biden's folksiness can veer into folklore, with dates that don't quite add up and details that are exaggerated or wrong, the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences.\"[591]\n\n\n\n### Job approval[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Morning Consult polling, Biden maintained an approval rating above 50 percent in the first eight months of his presidency. In August 2021, it began to decline, and it reached the low forties by December.[592] This was attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the Delta variant, high inflation and gas prices, disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics.[593][594][595][596]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Gallup, Inc. reported that 98 percent of Democrats approved of Biden.[597][598] As of October 2023, that number had declined to 75 percent.[599] His approval rating among Republicans reached a high of 12 percent in February 2021 and again in July 2021.[597]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2020 United States presidential debates\n* Cabinet of Joe Biden\n* Electoral history of Joe Biden\n* List of awards and honors received by Joe Biden\n* List of things named after Joe Biden\n* Bibliography of Joe Biden\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Biden held the chairmanship from January 3 to 20, then was succeeded by Jesse Helms until June 6, and thereafter held the position until 2003.\n2. **^**  Delaware's Democratic governor, Ruth Ann Minner, announced on November 24, 2008, that she would appoint Biden's longtime senior adviser Ted Kaufman to succeed Biden in the Senate.[178] Kaufman said he would serve only two years, until Delaware's special Senate election in 2010.[178] Biden's son Beau ruled himself out of the 2008 selection process due to his impending tour in Iraq with the Delaware Army National Guard.[179] He was a possible candidate for the 2010 special election, but in early 2010 said he would not run for the seat.[180]\n3. **^** Kyrsten Sinema, whose seat was not up for election in 2022, left the Democratic Party and became an independent politician in December 2022, after the election but before the swearing in of the next Congress. As a result, 48 Democrats (rather than 49), plus Angus King and Bernie Sanders, independents who caucus with Democrats, were in the Senate upon commencement of the 118th United States Congress, on January 3, 2023. Sinema has opted to caucus with neither party but to continue to align with the Democrats, bringing the Democratic Senate majority to 51 seats.[429][430]\n4. **^** Attributed to multiple sources: [507][508][509][510]\n5. **^** In 1981, President Ronald Reagan referred to the Armenian genocide in passing in a statement regarding The Holocaust, but never made a formal declaration recognizing it.[562][563]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Baker, Peter (October 10, 2023). \"In Unforgiving Terms, Biden Condemns 'Evil' and 'Abhorrent' Attack on Israel\". *The New York Times*.

Ideologically a moderate member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under President Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.\n\n\nBorn in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden moved with his family to Delaware in 1953. He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and to the U.S. Senate in 1972. As a senator, Biden drafted and led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act. He also oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. Biden ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. In 2008, Obama chose Biden as his running mate, and Biden was a close counselor to Obama during his two terms as vice president. In the 2020 presidential election, Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, defeated incumbents Donald Trump and Mike Pence. Biden is the second Catholic president in U.S. history (after John F. Kennedy), and his politics have been widely described as profoundly influenced by Catholic social teaching.\n\n\nTaking office at age 78, Biden is the oldest president in U.S. history, the first to have a female vice president, and the first from Delaware. In 2021, he signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill, as well as a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its related recession. Biden proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that was signed into law in 2022. Biden also signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which focused on manufacturing, appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court and worked with congressional Republicans to prevent a first-ever national default by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. Biden has responded to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by imposing sanctions on Russia and authorizing civilian and military aid to Ukraine. During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Biden announced American military support for Israel, and condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism.[1] In April 2023, he announced his candidacy for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2024 presidential election. \n\n\n\n\n## Early life (1942–1965)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early life and career of Joe Biden\n\nJoseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born on November 20, 1942,[2] at St. Mary's Hospital in Scranton, Pennsylvania,[3] to Catherine Eugenia \"Jean\" Biden (née Finnegan) and Joseph Robinette Biden Sr.[4][5] The oldest child in a Catholic family of largely Irish descent, he has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Francis and James.[6]\n\n\nBiden's father had been wealthy and the family purchased a home in the affluent Long Island suburb of Garden City in the fall of 1946,[7] but he suffered business setbacks around the time Biden was seven years old,[8][9][10] and for several years the family lived with Biden's maternal grandparents in Scranton.[11] Scranton fell into economic decline during the 1950s and Biden's father could not find steady work.[12] Beginning in 1953 when Biden was ten,[13] the family lived in an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, before moving to a house in nearby Mayfield.[14][15][9][11] Biden Sr. later became a successful used-car salesman, maintaining the family in a middle-class lifestyle.[11][12][16]\n\n\nAt Archmere Academy in Claymont,[17] Biden played baseball and was a standout halfback and wide receiver on the high school football team.[11][18] Though a poor student, he was class president in his junior and senior years.[19][20] He graduated in 1961.[19] At the University of Delaware in Newark, Biden briefly played freshman football,[21][22] and, as an unexceptional student,[23] earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 with a double major in history and political science.[24][25]\n\n\nBiden had a stutter, and has mitigated it since his early twenties.[26] He has described his efforts to reduce it by reciting poetry before a mirror.[20][27]\n\n\n\n## Marriages, law school, and early career (1966–1973)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early career of Joe Biden\n\nSee also: Family of Joe Biden\nOn August 27, 1966, Biden married Neilia Hunter, a student at Syracuse University,[24][28] after overcoming her parents' reluctance for her to wed a Roman Catholic. Their wedding was held in a Catholic church in Skaneateles, New York.[29] They had three children: Joseph R. \"Beau\" Biden III, Robert Hunter Biden, and Naomi Christina \"Amy\" Biden.[24]\n\n\n![](image)Biden in the Syracuse 1968 yearbook\nIn 1968, Biden earned a Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law, ranked 76th in his class of 85, after failing a course due to an acknowledged \"mistake\" when he plagiarized a law review article for a paper he wrote in his first year at law school.[23] He was admitted to the Delaware bar in 1969.[2]\n\n\nIn 1968, Biden clerked at a Wilmington law firm headed by prominent local Republican William Prickett and, he later said, \"thought of myself as a Republican\".[30][31] He disliked incumbent Democratic Delaware governor Charles L. Terry's conservative racial politics and supported a more liberal Republican, Russell W. Peterson, who defeated Terry in 1968.[30] Biden was recruited by local Republicans but registered as an Independent because of his distaste for Republican presidential candidate Richard Nixon.[30]\n\n\nIn 1969, Biden practiced law, first as a public defender and then at a firm headed by a locally active Democrat[32][30] who named him to the Democratic Forum, a group trying to reform and revitalize the state party;[33] Biden subsequently reregistered as a Democrat.[30] He and another attorney also formed a law firm.[32] Corporate law did not appeal to him, and criminal law did not pay well.[11] He supplemented his income by managing properties.[34]\n\n\nIn 1970, Biden ran for the 4th district seat on the New Castle County Council on a liberal platform that included support for public housing in the suburbs.[35][36] The seat had been held by Republican Henry R. Folsom, who was running in the 5th District following a reapportionment of council districts.[37][38][39] Biden won the general election by defeating Republican Lawrence T. Messick, and took office on January 5, 1971.[40][41] He served until January 1, 1973, and was succeeded by Democrat Francis R. Swift.[42][43] During his time on the county council, Biden opposed large highway projects, which he argued might disrupt Wilmington neighborhoods.[43]\n\n\nBiden had not openly supported or opposed the Vietnam War until he ran for Senate and opposed Richard Nixon's conduct of the war.[44] While studying at the University of Delaware and Syracuse University, Biden obtained five student draft deferments, at a time when most draftees were sent to the war. In 1968, based on a physical examination, he was given a conditional medical deferment; in 2008, a spokesperson for Biden said his having had \"asthma as a teenager\" was the reason for the deferment.[45]\n\n\n\n### 1972 U.S. Senate campaign in Delaware[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1972 United States Senate election in Delaware\n\nIn 1972, Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs, and with minimal campaign funds, he was given no chance of winning.[32][11] Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers,[46] an approach made feasible by Delaware's small size.[34] He received help from the AFL–CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell.[32] His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care, and public dissatisfaction with \"politics as usual\".[32][46] A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points,[32] but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters' emotions worked to his advantage,[16] and he won with 50.5% of the vote.[46]\n\n\n\n### Death of wife and daughter[edit]\n\n\nOn December 18, 1972, a few weeks after Biden was elected senator, his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter Naomi were killed in an automobile accident while Christmas shopping in Hockessin, Delaware.[24][47] Neilia's station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged 3) and Hunter (aged 2) were taken to the hospital in fair condition, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries.[48] Biden considered resigning to care for them,[16] but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to.[49] The accident filled Biden with anger and religious doubt. He wrote that he \"felt God had played a horrible trick\" on him,[50] and he had trouble focusing on work.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Second marriage[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden and his wife smiling, dressed casually](image)Biden and his second wife, Jill, met in 1975 and married in 1977.Biden met the teacher Jill Tracy Jacobs in 1975 on a blind date.[53] They married at the United Nations chapel in New York on June 17, 1977.[54][55] They spent their honeymoon at Lake Balaton in the Hungarian People's Republic.[56][57] Biden credits her with the renewal of his interest in politics and life.[58] Biden is Roman Catholic and attends Mass with his wife, Jill, at St. Joseph's on the Brandywine in Greenville, Delaware.[59][60][61] Their daughter, Ashley Biden,[24] is a social worker, and is married to physician Howard Krein.[62] Beau Biden became an Army Judge Advocate in Iraq and later Delaware Attorney General[63] before dying of brain cancer in 2015.[64][65] Hunter Biden worked as a Washington lobbyist and investment adviser; his business dealings and personal life came under significant scrutiny during his father's presidency.[66][67]\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1991 to 2008, as an adjunct professor, Biden co-taught a seminar on constitutional law at Widener University School of Law.[68][69] Biden sometimes flew back from overseas to teach the class.[70][71][72][73]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (1973–2009)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: US Senate career of Joe Biden\n\n### Senate activities[edit]\n\n\n![Scanned photo of Biden and Carter smiling at each other in the Oval Office. On the photo, Carter wrote: \"Best wishes to my friend Joe Biden\"](image)Biden with President Jimmy Carter, 1979\n![Biden-Church-Sadat](image)Biden shaking hands with President Anwar Sadat after the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, 1979\nIn January 1973, secretary of the Senate Francis R. Valeo swore Biden in at the Delaware Division of the Wilmington Medical Center.[74][48] Present were his sons Beau (whose leg was still in traction from the automobile accident) and Hunter and other family members.[74][48] At 30, he was the seventh-youngest senator in U.S. history.[75] To see his sons, Biden traveled by train between his Delaware home and D.C.[76]—74 minutes each way—and maintained this habit throughout his 36 years in the Senate.[16]\n\n\nElected to the Senate in 1972, Biden was reelected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, 2002, and 2008, regularly receiving about 60% of the vote.[77] He was junior senator to William Roth, who was first elected in 1970, until Roth was defeated in 2000.[78] As of 2023[update], he was the 19th-longest-serving senator in U.S. history.[79]\n\n\nDuring his early years in the Senate, Biden focused on consumer protection and environmental issues and called for greater government accountability.[80] In a 1974 interview, he described himself as liberal on civil rights and liberties, senior citizens' concerns and healthcare but conservative on other issues, including abortion and military conscription.[81] Biden was the first U.S. senator to endorse Jimmy Carter for president in the 1976 Democratic primary.[82] Carter went on to win the Democratic nomination and defeat incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford in the 1976 election. Biden also worked on arms control.[83][84] After Congress failed to ratify the SALT II Treaty signed in 1979 by Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and President Jimmy Carter, Biden met with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko to communicate American concerns and secured changes that addressed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's objections.[85] He received considerable attention when he excoriated Secretary of State George Shultz at a Senate hearing for the Reagan administration's support of South Africa despite its continued policy of apartheid.[30]\n\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Biden was one of the Senate's strongest opponents of race-integration busing. His Delaware constituents strongly opposed it, and such opposition nationwide later led his party to mostly abandon school integration policies.[86] In his first Senate campaign, Biden had expressed support for busing to remedy *de jure* segregation, as in the South, but opposed its use to remedy *de facto* segregation arising from racial patterns of neighborhood residency, as in Delaware; he opposed a proposed constitutional amendment banning busing entirely.[87] In 1976, Biden supported a measure forbidding the use of federal funds for transporting students beyond the school closest to them.[86] In 1977, he co-sponsored an amendment closing loopholes in that measure, which President Carter signed into law in 1978.[88]\n\n\n\n![Photo of Biden shaking hands with Reagan in the Oval Office](image)Biden shaking hands with President Ronald Reagan, 1984\nBiden became ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. In 1984, he was a Democratic floor manager for the successful passage of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act. His supporters praised him for modifying some of the law's worst provisions, and it was his most important legislative accomplishment to that time.[89] In 1994, Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which included a ban on assault weapons,[90][91] and the Violence Against Women Act,[92] which he has called his most significant legislation.[93] The 1994 crime law was unpopular among progressives and criticized for resulting in mass incarceration;[94][95] in 2019, Biden called his role in passing the bill a \"big mistake\", citing its policy on crack cocaine and saying that the bill \"trapped an entire generation\".[96]\n\n\nIn 1993, Biden voted for a provision that deemed homosexuality incompatible with military life, thereby banning gays from serving in the armed forces.[97][98] In 1996, he voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibited the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages, thereby barring individuals in such marriages from equal protection under federal law and allowing states to do the same.[99] In 2015, the act was ruled unconstitutional in *Obergefell v. Hodges*.[100]\n\n\nBiden was critical of Independent Counsel Ken Starr during the 1990s Whitewater controversy and Lewinsky scandal investigations, saying \"it's going to be a cold day in hell\" before another independent counsel would be granted similar powers.[101] He voted to acquit during the impeachment of President Clinton.[102] During the 2000s, Biden sponsored bankruptcy legislation sought by credit card issuers.[16] Clinton vetoed the bill in 2000, but it passed in 2005 as the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act,[16] with Biden being one of only 18 Democrats to vote for it, while leading Democrats and consumer rights organizations opposed it.[103] As a senator, Biden strongly supported increased Amtrak funding and rail security.[77][104]\n\n\n\n### Brain surgeries[edit]\n\n\nIn February 1988, after several episodes of increasingly severe neck pain, Biden underwent surgery to correct a leaking intracranial berry aneurysm.[105][106] While recuperating, he suffered a pulmonary embolism, a serious complication.[106] After a second aneurysm was surgically repaired in May,[106][107] Biden's recuperation kept him away from the Senate for seven months.[108]\n\n\n\n### Senate Judiciary Committee[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Senator Biden giving a speech, with uniformed law enforcement officers in the background](image)Biden speaking at the signing of the 1994 Crime Bill with President Bill Clinton in 1994\nBiden was a longtime member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. He chaired it from 1987 to 1995 and was a ranking minority member from 1981 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 1997.[109]\n\n\nAs chair, Biden presided over two highly contentious U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[16] When Robert Bork was nominated in 1988, Biden reversed his approval‍—‌ given in an interview the previous year‍—‌ of a hypothetical Bork nomination. Conservatives were angered,[110] but at the hearings' close Biden was praised for his fairness, humor, and courage.[110][111] Rejecting the arguments of some Bork opponents,[16] Biden framed his objections to Bork in terms of the conflict between Bork's strong originalism and the view that the U.S. Constitution provides rights to liberty and privacy beyond those explicitly enumerated in its text.[111] Bork's nomination was rejected in the committee by a 5–9 vote[111] and then in the full Senate, 42–58.[112]\n\n\nDuring Clarence Thomas's nomination hearings in 1991, Biden's questions on constitutional issues were often convoluted to the point that Thomas sometimes lost track of them,[113] and Thomas later wrote that Biden's questions were akin to \"beanballs\".[114] After the committee hearing closed, the public learned that Anita Hill, a University of Oklahoma law school professor, had accused Thomas of making unwelcome sexual comments when they had worked together.[115][116] Biden had known of some of these charges, but initially shared them only with the committee because Hill was then unwilling to testify.[16] The committee hearing was reopened and Hill testified, but Biden did not permit testimony from other witnesses, such as a woman who had made similar charges and experts on harassment.[117] The full Senate confirmed Thomas by a 52–48 vote, with Biden opposed.[16] Liberal legal advocates and women's groups felt strongly that Biden had mishandled the hearings and not done enough to support Hill.[117] In 2019, he told Hill he regretted his treatment of her, but Hill said afterward she remained unsatisfied.[118]\n\n\n\n### Senate Foreign Relations Committee[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Clinton, his senior officials, and Biden on Air Force One](image)Senator Biden accompanies President Clinton and other officials to Bosnia and Herzegovina, December 1997.\nBiden was a longtime member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He became its ranking minority member in 1997 and chaired it from June 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2009.[119] His positions were generally liberal internationalist.[83][120] He collaborated effectively with Republicans and sometimes went against elements of his own party.[119][120] During this time he met with at least 150 leaders from 60 countries and international organizations, becoming a well-known Democratic voice on foreign policy.[121]\n\n\nBiden voted against authorization for the Gulf War in 1991,[120] siding with 45 of the 55 Democratic senators. He said the U.S. was bearing almost all the burden in the anti-Iraq coalition.[122]\n\n\nBiden became interested in the Yugoslav Wars after hearing about Serbian abuses during the Croatian War of Independence in 1991.[83] Once the Bosnian War broke out, Biden was among the first to call for the \"lift and strike\" policy.[83][119] The George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were both reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement.[83][120] In April 1993, Biden held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević.[123] Biden worked on several versions of legislative language urging the U.S. toward greater involvement.[123] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkan policy in the mid-1990s his \"proudest moment in public life\" related to foreign policy.[120] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia.[83] He and Senator John McCain co-sponsored the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milošević over Yugoslav actions toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.[120][124]\n\n\n\n#### Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq[edit]\n\n\nMain article: War on terror\n\n![refer to caption](image)Biden addresses the press after meeting with Prime Minister Ayad Allawi in Baghdad in 2004.Biden was a strong supporter of the War in Afghanistan, saying, \"Whatever it takes, we should do it.\"[125] As head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said in 2002 that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein was a threat to national security and there was no other option than to \"eliminate\" that threat.[126] In October 2002, he voted in favor of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq, approving the U.S. Invasion of Iraq.[120] As chair of the committee, he assembled a series of witnesses to testify in favor of the authorization. They gave testimony grossly misrepresenting the intent, history, and status of Saddam and his secular government, which was an avowed enemy of al-Qaeda, and touted Iraq's fictional possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction.[127] Biden eventually became a critic of the war and viewed his vote and role as a \"mistake\", but did not push for withdrawal.[120][123] He supported the appropriations for the occupation, but argued that the war should be internationalized, that more soldiers were needed, and that the Bush administration should \"level with the American people\" about its cost and length.[119][124]\n\n\nBy late 2006, Biden's stance had shifted considerably. He opposed the troop surge of 2007,[120][123] saying General David Petraeus was \"dead, flat wrong\" in believing the surge could work.[128] Biden instead advocated dividing Iraq into a loose federation of three ethnic states.[129] Rather than continue the existing approach or withdrawing, the plan called for \"a third way\": federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds, Shiites, and Sunnis \"breathing room\" in their own regions.[130] In September 2007, a non-binding resolution endorsing the plan passed the Senate,[131] but the idea failed to gain traction.[128]\n\n\n\n## Presidential campaigns of 1988 and 2008[edit]\n\n\n### 1988 campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign\n\n![Photo of Biden smiling, looking to the side](image)Biden at the White House in 1987\nBiden formally declared his candidacy for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination on June 9, 1987.[132] He was considered a strong candidate because of his moderate image, his speaking ability, his high profile as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the upcoming Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination hearings, and his appeal to Baby Boomers; he would have been the second-youngest person elected president, after John F. Kennedy.[30][133][134] He raised more in the first quarter of 1987 than any other candidate.[133][134]\n\n\nBy August his campaign's messaging had become confused due to staff rivalries,[135] and in September, he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.[136] Biden's speech had similar lines about being the first person in his family to attend university. Biden had credited Kinnock with the formulation on previous occasions,[137][138] but did not on two occasions in late August.[139]: 230–232[138] Kinnock himself was more forgiving; the two men met in 1988, forming an enduring friendship.[140]\n\n\nEarlier that year he had also used passages from a 1967 speech by Robert F. Kennedy (for which his aides took blame) and a short phrase from John F. Kennedy's inaugural address; two years earlier he had used a 1976 passage by Hubert Humphrey.[141] Biden responded that politicians often borrow from one another without giving credit, and that one of his rivals for the nomination, Jesse Jackson, had called him to point out that he (Jackson) had used the same material by Humphrey that Biden had used.[16][23]\n\n\nA few days later, an incident in law school in which Biden drew text from a *Fordham Law Review* article with inadequate citations was publicized.[23] He was required to repeat the course and passed with high marks.[142] At Biden's request the Delaware Supreme Court's Board of Professional Responsibility reviewed the incident and concluded that he had violated no rules.[143]\n\n\nBiden has made several false or exaggerated claims about his early life: that he had earned three degrees in college, that he attended law school on a full scholarship, that he had graduated in the top half of his class,[144][145] and that he had marched in the civil rights movement.[146] The limited amount of other news about the presidential race amplified these disclosures[147] and on September 23, 1987, Biden withdrew his candidacy, saying it had been overrun by \"the exaggerated shadow\" of his past mistakes.[148]\n\n\n\n### 2008 campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign\n\n![Photo of Biden, casually dressed, talking with a citizen in a garden](image)Biden campaigns at a house party in Creston, Iowa, July 2007.\nAfter exploring the possibility of a run in several previous cycles, in January 2007, Biden declared his candidacy in the 2008 elections.[77][149][150] During his campaign, Biden focused on the Iraq War, his record as chairman of major Senate committees, and his foreign-policy experience.[151] Biden was noted for his one-liners during the campaign; in one debate he said of Republican candidate Rudy Giuliani: \"There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11.\"[152]\n\n\nBiden had difficulty raising funds, struggled to draw people to his rallies, and failed to gain traction against the high-profile candidacies of Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton.[153] He never rose above single digits in national polls of the Democratic candidates. In the first contest on January 3, 2008, Biden placed fifth in the Iowa caucuses, garnering slightly less than one percent of the state delegates.[154] He withdrew from the race that evening.[155]\n\n\nDespite its lack of success, Biden's 2008 campaign raised his stature in the political world.[156]: 336 In particular, it changed the relationship between Biden and Obama. Although they had served together on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, they had not been close: Biden resented Obama's quick rise to political stardom,[128][157] while Obama viewed Biden as garrulous and patronizing.[156]: 28, 337–338 Having gotten to know each other during 2007, Obama appreciated Biden's campaign style and appeal to working-class voters, and Biden said he became convinced Obama was \"the real deal\".[157][156]: 28, 337–338\n\n\n\n## Vice presidential campaigns of 2008 and 2012[edit]\n\n\n### 2008 campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign and 2008 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection\n\n![Photo of Biden outdoors behind a lectern, with Obama seated behind him and smiling](image)Biden speaks at the August 23, 2008, vice presidential announcement at the Old State Capitol in Springfield, Illinois.\nShortly after Biden withdrew from the presidential race, Obama privately told him he was interested in finding an important place for Biden in his administration.[158] In early August, Obama and Biden met in secret to discuss the possibility,[158] and developed a strong personal rapport.[157] On August 22, 2008, Obama announced that Biden would be his running mate.[159] *The New York Times* reported that the strategy behind the choice reflected a desire to fill out the ticket with someone with foreign policy and national security experience.[160] Others pointed out Biden's appeal to middle-class and blue-collar voters.[161][162] Biden was officially nominated for vice president on August 27 by voice vote at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver.[163]\n\n\nBiden's vice-presidential campaigning gained little media attention, as the press devoted far more coverage to the Republican nominee, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[164][165] Under instructions from the campaign, Biden kept his speeches succinct and tried to avoid offhand remarks, such as one he made about Obama's being tested by a foreign power soon after taking office, which had attracted negative attention.[166][167] Privately, Biden's remarks frustrated Obama. \"How many times is Biden gonna say something stupid?\" he asked.[156]: 411–414, 419 Obama campaign staffers called Biden's blunders \"Joe bombs\" and kept Biden uninformed about strategy discussions, which in turn irked Biden.[168] Relations between the two campaigns became strained for a month, until Biden apologized on a call to Obama and the two built a stronger partnership.[156]: 411–414\n\n\nAs the financial crisis of 2007–2010 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008 and the proposed bailout of the United States financial system became a major factor in the campaign, Biden voted for the $700 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed in the Senate, 74–25.[169] On October 2, 2008, he participated in the vice-presidential debate with Palin at Washington University in St. Louis. Post-debate polls found that while Palin exceeded many voters' expectations, Biden had won the debate overall.[170]\n\n\nOn November 4, 2008, Obama and Biden were elected with 53% of the popular vote and 365 electoral votes to McCain–Palin's 173.[171][172][173]\n\n\nAt the same time Biden was running for vice president, he was also running for reelection to the Senate,[174] as permitted by Delaware law.[77] On November 4, he was reelected to the Senate, defeating Republican Christine O'Donnell.[175] Having won both races, Biden made a point of waiting to resign from the Senate until he was sworn in for his seventh term on January 6, 2009.[176] Biden cast his last Senate vote on January 15, supporting the release of the second $350 billion for the Troubled Asset Relief Program,[177] and resigned from the Senate later that day.[b]\n\n\n\n### 2012 campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign\n\n![Official portrait of Obama and Biden, smiling](image)Biden and Obama, July 2012\nIn October 2010, Biden said Obama had asked him to remain as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election,[181] but with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley conducted some secret polling and focus group research in late 2011 on the idea of replacing Biden on the ticket with Hillary Clinton.[182] The notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama,[182] and White House officials later said Obama himself had never entertained the idea.[183]\n\n\nBiden's May 2012 statement that he was \"absolutely comfortable\" with same-sex marriage gained considerable public attention in comparison to Obama's position, which had been described as \"evolving\".[184] Biden made his statement without administration consent, and Obama and his aides were quite irked, since Obama had planned to shift position several months later, in the build-up to the party convention.[168][185][186] Gay rights advocates seized upon Biden's statement,[185] and within days, Obama announced that he too supported same-sex marriage, an action in part forced by Biden's remarks.[187] Biden apologized to Obama in private for having spoken out,[188][189] while Obama acknowledged publicly it had been done from the heart.[185]\n\n\nThe Obama campaign valued Biden as a retail-level politician, and he had a heavy schedule of appearances in swing states as the reelection campaign began in earnest in spring 2012.[190][191] An August 2012 remark before a mixed-race audience that Republican proposals to relax Wall Street regulations would \"put y'all back in chains\" once again drew attention to Biden's propensity for colorful remarks.[190][192][193] In the vice-presidential debate on October 11 with Republican nominee Paul Ryan, Biden defended the Obama administration's record.[194][195] On November 6, Obama and Biden won reelection[196] over Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan with 332 of 538 Electoral College votes and 51% of the popular vote.[197]\n\n\n\n## Vice presidency (2009–2017)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Presidency of Barack Obama\n\n### First term (2009–2013)[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden raising his right hand, reciting the Oath](image)Biden being sworn in as vice president on January 20, 2009\nBiden said he intended to eliminate some explicit roles assumed by George W. Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney, and did not intend to emulate any previous vice presidency.[198] On January 20, 2009, he was sworn in as the 47th vice president of the United States.[199] He was the first vice president from Delaware[200] and the first Roman Catholic vice president.[201][202]\n\n\nObama was soon comparing Biden to a basketball player \"who does a bunch of things that don't show up in the stat sheet\".[203] In May, Biden visited Kosovo and affirmed the U.S. position that its \"independence is irreversible\".[204] Biden lost an internal debate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton about sending 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan,[205][206] but his skepticism was valued,[207] and in 2009, Biden's views gained more influence as Obama reconsidered his Afghanistan strategy.[208] Biden visited Iraq about every two months,[128] becoming the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress there.[207] More generally, overseeing Iraq policy became Biden's responsibility: Obama was said to have said, \"Joe, you do Iraq.\"[209] By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit of U.S. troops in 2011.[191][210]\n\n\n\n![Photo of Obama and Biden shaking hands in the Oval Office](image)President Obama congratulates Biden for his role in shaping the debt ceiling deal which led to the Budget Control Act of 2011.\nBiden oversaw infrastructure spending from the Obama stimulus package intended to help counteract the ongoing recession.[211] During this period, Biden was satisfied that no major instances of waste or corruption had occurred,[207] and when he completed that role in February 2011, he said the number of fraud incidents with stimulus monies had been less than one percent.[212]\n\n\nIn late April 2009, Biden's off-message response to a question during the beginning of the swine flu outbreak led to a swift retraction by the White House.[213] The remark revived Biden's reputation for gaffes.[214][208][215] Confronted with rising unemployment through July 2009, Biden acknowledged that the administration had \"misread how bad the economy was\" but maintained confidence the stimulus package would create many more jobs once the pace of expenditures picked up.[216] On March 23, 2010, a microphone picked up Biden telling the president that his signing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was \"a big fucking deal\". Despite their different personalities, Obama and Biden formed a friendship, partly based around Obama's daughter Sasha and Biden's granddaughter Maisy, who attended Sidwell Friends School together.[168]\n\n\nMembers of the Obama administration said Biden's role in the White House was to be a contrarian and force others to defend their positions.[217] Rahm Emanuel, White House chief of staff, said that Biden helped counter groupthink.[203] Obama said, \"The best thing about Joe is that when we get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, to look at things from every angle, and that is very valuable for me.\"[207] The Bidens maintained a relaxed atmosphere at their official residence in Washington, often entertaining their grandchildren, and regularly returned to their home in Delaware.[218]\n\n\nBiden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, maintaining an attitude of optimism in the face of predictions of large-scale losses for the party.[181] Following big Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important.[219][220] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty.[219][220] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy for a middle ground, followed by his negotiations with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that included a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts.[220][221] The package passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010.\n\n\n\n![Photo of Obama, Biden, and national security staffers in the Situation Room, somberly listening to updates on the bin Laden raid](image)Biden, Obama and the national security team gathered in the White House Situation Room to monitor the progress of the May 2011 mission to kill Osama bin Laden.\nIn March 2011, Obama delegated Biden to lead negotiations with Congress to resolve federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown.[222] The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next few months, but Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved key in breaking a deadlock and bringing about a deal to resolve it, in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011, signed on August 2, 2011, the same day an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed.[223][224][225] Some reports suggest that Biden opposed proceeding with the May 2011 U.S. mission to kill Osama bin Laden,[191][226] lest failure adversely affect Obama's reelection prospects.[227][228]\n\n\nIn December 2012, Obama named Biden to head the Gun Violence Task Force, created to address the causes of school shootings and consider possible gun control to implement in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.[229] Later that month, during the final days before the United States fell off the \"fiscal cliff\", Biden's relationship with McConnell again proved important as the two negotiated a deal that led to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 being passed at the start of 2013.[230][231] It made many of the Bush tax cuts permanent but raised rates on upper income levels.[231]\n\n\n\n### Second term (2013–2017)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Biden in Morocco, November 2014\nBiden was inaugurated to a second term on January 20, 2013, at a small ceremony at Number One Observatory Circle, his official residence, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor presiding (a public ceremony took place on January 21).[232]\n\n\nBiden played little part in discussions that led to the October 2013 passage of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014, which resolved the federal government shutdown of 2013 and the debt-ceiling crisis of 2013. This was because Senate majority leader Harry Reid and other Democratic leaders cut him out of any direct talks with Congress, feeling Biden had given too much away during previous negotiations.[233][234][235]\n\n\nBiden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized again in 2013. The act led to related developments, such as the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden and Valerie Jarrett as co-chairs.[236][237]\n\n\nBiden favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[238] As the ISIL insurgency in Iraq intensified in 2014, renewed attention was paid to the Biden-Gelb Iraqi federalization plan of 2006, with some observers suggesting Biden had been right all along.[239][240] Biden himself said the U.S. would follow ISIL \"to the gates of hell\".[241] Biden had close relationships with several Latin American leaders and was assigned a focus on the region during the administration; he visited the region 16 times during his vice presidency, the most of any president or vice president.[242] In August 2016, Biden visited Serbia, where he met with the Serbian Prime Minister, Aleksandar Vučić, and expressed his condolences for civilian victims of the bombing campaign during the Kosovo War.[243]\n\n\n\n![Photo of Biden and Netanyahu giving speeches, with American and Israeli flags in the background](image)Biden with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, March 9, 2016\nBiden never cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate, making him the longest-serving vice president with this distinction.[244]\n\n\n\n#### Role in the 2016 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nDuring his second term, Biden was often said to be preparing for a bid for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.[245] With his family, many friends, and donors encouraging him in mid-2015 to enter the race, and with Hillary Clinton's favorability ratings in decline at that time, Biden was reported to again be seriously considering the prospect and a \"Draft Biden 2016\" PAC was established.[245][246][247]\n\n\nBy late 2015, Biden was still uncertain about running. He felt his son's recent death had largely drained his emotional energy, and said, \"nobody has a right ... to seek that office unless they're willing to give it 110% of who they are.\"[248] On October 21, speaking from a podium in the Rose Garden with his wife and Obama by his side, Biden announced his decision not to run for president in 2016.[249][250][251]\n\n\n\n## Subsequent activities (2017–2019)[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Trump speaking to Biden and Obama, with Trump's hand on Obama's shoulder](image)Biden with Barack Obama and Donald Trump, at the latter's inauguration on January 20, 2017\nAfter leaving the vice presidency, Biden became an honorary professor at the University of Pennsylvania, developing the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Biden remained in that position into 2019, before running for president.[252][253]\n\n\nIn 2017, Biden wrote a memoir, *Promise Me, Dad*, and went on a book tour.[254] By 2019, he and his wife reported that they had earned over $15 million since the end of his vice presidency from speaking engagements and book sales.[255]\n\n\nBiden remained in the public eye, endorsing candidates while continuing to comment on politics, climate change, and the presidency of Donald Trump.[256][257][258] He also continued to speak out in favor of LGBT rights, continuing advocacy on an issue he had become more closely associated with during his vice presidency.[259][260] In 2018, he gave a eulogy for Senator John McCain, praising McCain's embrace of American ideals and bipartisan friendships.[261] Biden continued to support efforts to find treatments for cancer.[262]\n\n\n\n## 2020 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign\n\n### Speculation and announcement[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden raising his fist while while standing behind a lectern](image)Biden at his presidential kickoff rally in Philadelphia, May 2019\nBetween 2016 and 2019, media outlets often mentioned Biden as a likely candidate for president in 2020.[263] When asked if he would run, he gave varied and ambivalent answers, saying \"never say never\".[264] A political action committee known as Time for Biden was formed in January 2018, seeking Biden's entry into the race.[265] He finally launched his campaign on April 25, 2019,[266] saying he was prompted to run because he was worried by the Trump administration and felt a \"sense of duty\".[267]\n\n\n\n### Campaign[edit]\n\n\nAs the 2020 campaign season heated up, voluminous public polling showed Biden as one of the best-performing Democratic candidates in a head-to-head matchup against President Trump.[268][269][270] With Democrats keenly focused on \"electability\" for defeating Trump,[271] this boosted his popularity among Democratic voters.[272] It also made Biden a frequent target of Trump.[273][274] In September 2019, it was reported that Trump had pressured Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to investigate alleged wrongdoing by Biden and his son Hunter Biden.[275] Despite the allegations, no evidence was produced of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.[276][277][278] Trump's pressure to investigate the Bidens was perceived by many as an attempt to hurt Biden's chances of winning the presidency.[279] Trump's alleged actions against Biden resulted in a political scandal[280] and Trump's impeachment by the House of Representatives for abuse of power and obstruction of congress.[281]\n\n\nIn March 2019 and April 2019, eight women accused Biden of previous instances of inappropriate physical contact, such as embracing, touching or kissing.[282] Biden had previously called himself a \"tactile politician\" and admitted this behavior had caused trouble for him.[283] Journalist Mark Bowden described Biden's lifelong habit of talking close, writing that he \"doesn't just meet you, he engulfs you... scooting closer\" and leaning forward to talk.[284] In April 2019, Biden pledged to be more \"respectful of people's personal space\".[285]\n\n\n\n![Photo of Biden holding a microphone, with a crowd in the background](image)Biden at a rally on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, February 2020\nThroughout 2019, Biden stayed generally ahead of other Democrats in national polls.[286][287] Despite this, he finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses, and eight days later, fifth in the New Hampshire primary.[288][289] He performed better in the Nevada caucuses, reaching the 15% required for delegates, but still finished 21.6 percentage points behind Bernie Sanders.[290] Making strong appeals to Black voters on the campaign trail and in the South Carolina debate, Biden won the South Carolina primary by more than 28 points.[291] After the withdrawals and subsequent endorsements of candidates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, he made large gains in the March 3 Super Tuesday primary elections. Biden won 18 of the next 26 contests, putting him in the lead overall.[292] Elizabeth Warren and Mike Bloomberg soon dropped out, and Biden expanded his lead with victories over Sanders in four states on March 10.[293]\n\n\nIn late March 2020, Tara Reade, one of the eight women who in 2019 had accused Biden of inappropriate physical contact, accused Biden of having sexually assaulted her in 1993.[294] There were inconsistencies between Reade's 2019 and 2020 allegations.[294][295] Biden and his campaign denied the sexual assault allegation.[296][297]\n\n\nWhen Sanders suspended his campaign on April 8, 2020, Biden became the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee for president.[298] On April 13, Sanders endorsed Biden in a live-streamed discussion from their homes.[299] Former President Barack Obama endorsed Biden the next day.[300] On August 11, Biden announced U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, making her the first African American and first South Asian American vice-presidential nominee on a major-party ticket.[301] On August 18, 2020, Biden was officially nominated at the 2020 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic Party nominee for president in the 2020 election.[302][303]\n\n\n\n### Presidential transition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidential transition of Joe Biden\n\nBiden was elected the 46th president of the United States in November 2020. He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[304] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[305] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[306]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2021, during Congress' electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol, saying, \"We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.\"[307] Soon after, they attacked the Capitol. During the insurrection at the Capitol, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times\".[308][309] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[310]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Joe Biden\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Joe Biden presidency.\n\n![Photo of Biden raising his right hand, with his left hand placed on a thick Bible](image)Biden takes the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. at the Capitol, January 20, 2021.\n### Inauguration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Inauguration of Joe Biden\n\nBiden was inaugurated as the 46th president of the United States on January 20, 2021.[311] At 78, he is the oldest person to have assumed the office.[311] He is the second Catholic president (after John F. Kennedy)[312] and the first president whose home state is Delaware.[313] He is also the first man since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after Richard Nixon in 1968) to be elected president.[314] He is also the first president from the Silent Generation.[315]\n\n\nBiden's inauguration was \"a muted affair unlike any previous inauguration\" due to COVID-19 precautions as well as massively increased security measures because of the January 6 United States Capitol attack. Trump did not attend, becoming the first outgoing president since 1869 to not attend his successor's inauguration.[316]\n\n\n\n### First 100 days[edit]\n\n\nSee also: First 100 days of Joe Biden's presidency\n\nIn his first two days as president, Biden signed 17 executive orders. By his third day, orders had included rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, ending the state of national emergency at the border with Mexico, directing the government to rejoin the World Health Organization, face mask requirements on federal property, measures to combat hunger in the United States,[317][318][319][320] and revoking permits for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.[321][322][323] In his first two weeks in office, Biden signed more executive orders than any other president since Franklin D. Roosevelt had in their first month in office.[324]\n\n\nOn February 4, 2021, the Biden administration announced that the United States was ending its support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen.[325]\n\n\n\n![Group photo of Biden, Harris and cabinet members standing outdoors](image)Biden with his Cabinet, July 2021\nOn March 11, the first anniversary of COVID-19 having been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus and relief package that he had proposed to support the United States' recovery from the economic and health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[326] The package included direct payments to most Americans, an extension of increased unemployment benefits, funds for vaccine distribution and school reopenings, and expansions of health insurance subsidies and the child tax credit. Biden's initial proposal included an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, but after the Senate parliamentarian determined that including the increase in a budget reconciliation bill would violate Senate rules, Democrats declined to pursue overruling her and removed the increase from the package.[327][328][329]\n\n\nAlso in March, amid a rise in migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico, Biden told migrants, \"Don't come over.\" In the meantime, migrant adults \"are being sent back\", Biden said, in reference to the continuation of the Trump administration's Title 42 policy for quick deportations.[330] Biden earlier announced that his administration would not deport unaccompanied migrant children; the rise in arrivals of such children exceeded the capacity of facilities meant to shelter them (before they were sent to sponsors), leading the Biden administration in March to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help.[331]\n\n\nOn April 14, Biden announced that the United States would delay the withdrawal of all troops from the war in Afghanistan until September 11, signaling an end to the country's direct military involvement in Afghanistan after nearly 20 years.[332] In February 2020, the Trump administration had made a deal with the Taliban to completely withdraw U.S. forces by May 1, 2021.[333] Biden's decision met with a wide range of reactions, from support and relief to trepidation at the possible collapse of the Afghan government without American support.[334] On April 22–23, Biden held an international climate summit at which he announced that the U.S. would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50%–52% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Other countries also increased their pledges.[335][336] On April 28, the eve of his 100th day in office, Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress.[337]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\nOn June 17, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which officially declared Juneteenth a federal holiday.[338] Juneteenth is the first new federal holiday since 1986.[339] In July 2021, amid a slowing of the COVID-19 vaccination rate in the country and the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, Biden said that the country has \"a pandemic for those who haven't gotten the vaccination\" and that it was therefore \"gigantically important\" for Americans to be vaccinated.[340]\n\n\n\n#### Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inflation rate, United States and eurozone, January 2018 through June 2023\nMain article: Economic policy of the Joe Biden administration\n\nBiden entered office nine months into a recovery from the COVID-19 recession and his first year in office was characterized by robust growth in real GDP, employment, wages and stock market returns, amid significantly elevated inflation. Real GDP grew 5.9 percent, the fastest rate in 37 years.[341][342] Amid record job creation, the unemployment rate fell at the fastest pace on record during the year.[343][344][345] By the end of 2021, inflation reached a nearly 40-year high of 7.1 percent, which was partially offset by the highest nominal wage and salary growth in at least 20 years.[346][347][348][349] In his third month in office, Biden signed an executive order to increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour, an increase of nearly 37 percent. The order went into effect for 390,000 workers in January 2022.[350][351]\n\n\nAmid a surge in inflation and high gas prices, Biden's approval ratings declined, reaching net negative in early 2022.[352][353][354] After 5.9 percent growth in 2021, real GDP growth cooled in Biden's second year to 2.1 percent, after slightly negative growth in the first half spurred recession concerns. Job creation and consumer spending remained strong through the year, as the unemployment rate fell to match a 53-year low of 3.5 percent in December. Inflation peaked at 8.9 percent in June but began easing in the second half of the year, to 6.5 percent in December. Stocks had their worst performance since 2008.[355][356][357][358] Despite widespread predictions of an imminent recession in 2022 and 2023, by late 2023 indicators showed economic acceleration.[359]\n\n\nOver the course of five days in March 2023, three small- to mid-size U.S. banks failed, triggering a sharp decline in global bank stock prices and swift response by regulators to prevent potential global contagion. After Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, the first to do so, Biden expressed opposition to a bailout by taxpayers.[360] He claimed that the partial rollback of Dodd-Frank regulations contributed to the bank's failure.[361]\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 118th Congress, Biden and congressional Republicans engaged in a standoff that raised the risk that the United States would default on its debt.[362] Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy struck a deal to raise the debt limit, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, which would suspend the debt limit until January 2025. Biden signed it on June 3, averting a default.[363] The deal was generally seen as favorable to Biden.[364][365]\n\n\n\n#### Judiciary[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden and Jackson looking at an off-camera television screen](image)Biden and Ketanji Brown Jackson watching the U.S. Senate vote on her confirmation, April 2022\nBy the end of 2021, 40 of Biden's appointees to the federal judiciary had been confirmed, more than any president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan.[366] Biden has prioritized diversity in his judicial appointments more than any president in U.S. history, with most of his appointees being women and people of color.[367] Most of his appointments have been in blue states, making a limited impact since the courts in these states already generally lean liberal.[368]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, a moderate liberal nominated by Bill Clinton, announced his intention to retire from the Supreme Court. During his 2020 campaign, Biden vowed to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court if a vacancy occurred,[369] a promise he reiterated after Breyer announced his retirement.[370] On February 25, Biden nominated federal judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.[371] She was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on April 7[372] and sworn in on June 30.[373]\n\n\n\n#### Infrastructure and climate[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Build Back Better Plan and Environmental policy of the Joe Biden administration\n\n![Phot of Biden, Johnson and Guterres standing onstage](image)Biden, UK prime minister Boris Johnson and UN secretary-general António Guterres at the opening ceremony of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on November 1, 2021\nAs part of Biden's Build Back Better agenda, in late March 2021, he proposed the American Jobs Plan, a $2 trillion package addressing issues including transport infrastructure, utilities infrastructure, broadband infrastructure, housing, schools, manufacturing, research and workforce development.[374][375] After months of negotiations among Biden and lawmakers, in August 2021 the Senate passed a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill called the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,[376][377] while the House, also in a bipartisan manner, approved that bill in early November 2021, covering infrastructure related to transport, utilities, and broadband.[378] Biden signed the bill into law in mid-November 2021.[379]\n\n\nThe other core part of the Build Back Better agenda was the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion social spending bill that expands the social safety net and includes major provisions on climate change.[380][381] The bill did not have Republican support, so Democrats attempted to pass it on a party-line vote through budget reconciliation, but struggled to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin, even as the price was lowered to $2.2 trillion.[382] After Manchin rejected the bill,[383] the Build Back Better Act's size was reduced and comprehensively reworked into the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, covering deficit reduction, climate change, healthcare, and tax reform.[384]\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was introduced by Senators Chuck Schumer and Joe Manchin.[385][386] The package aimed to raise $739 billion and authorize $370 billion in spending on energy and climate change, $300 billion in deficit reduction, three years of Affordable Care Act subsidies, prescription drug reform to lower prices, and tax reform.[387] According to an analysis by the Rhodium Group, the bill will lower US greenhouse gas emissions between 31 percent and 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.[388] On August 7, 2022, the Senate passed the bill (as amended) on a 51–50 vote, with all Democrats voting in favor, all Republicans opposed, and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. The bill was passed by the House on August 12[388] and was signed by Biden on August 16.[389][390]\n\n\nBefore and during the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), Biden promoted an agreement that the U.S. and the European Union cut methane emissions by a third by 2030 and tried to add dozens of other countries to the effort.[391] He tried to convince China[392] and Australia[393] to do more. He convened an online Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate Change to press other countries to strengthen their climate policy.[394][395] Biden pledged to double climate funding to developing countries by 2024.[396] Also at COP26, the U.S. and China reached a deal on greenhouse gas emission reduction. The two countries are responsible for 40 percent of global emissions.[397] In July 2023, when the 2023 heat waves hit the U.S., Biden announced several measures to protect the population and said the heat waves were linked to climate change.[398][399]\n\n\n\n#### COVID-19 diagnosis[edit]\n\n\nOn July 21, 2022, Biden tested positive for COVID-19 with reportedly mild symptoms.[400] According to the White House, he was treated with Paxlovid.[401] He worked in isolation in the White House for five days[402] and returned to isolation when he tested positive again on July 30.[403]\n\n\n\n#### Other domestic policy issues[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, Biden endorsed a change to the Senate filibuster to allow for the passing of the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Act, on both of which the Senate had failed to invoke cloture.[404] The rules change failed when two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, joined Senate Republicans in opposing it.[405] In April 2022, Biden signed into law the bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 to revamp the finances and operations of the United States Postal Service agency.[406]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2022, the Biden administration announced it would fill four wide gaps on the Mexico–United States border in Arizona near Yuma, an area with some of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings. During his presidential campaign, Biden had pledged to cease all future border wall construction.[407] This occurred after both allies and critics of Biden criticized his administration's management of the southern border.[408]\n\n\n\n![Photo of Biden and staffers, seated, looking at a television](image)Biden and senior advisers watch the Senate pass the CHIPS and Science Act on July 27, 2022.\nIn the summer of 2022, several other pieces of legislation Biden supported passed Congress. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act aimed to address gun reform issues following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas.[409] The act's gun control provisions include extended background checks for gun purchasers under 21, clarification of Federal Firearms License requirements, funding for state red flag laws and other crisis intervention programs, further criminalization of arms trafficking and straw purchases, and partial closure of the boyfriend loophole.[410][411][412] Biden signed the bill on June 25, 2022.[413]\n\n\nThe Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 was introduced in 2021 and signed into law by Biden on August 10, 2022.[414] The act intends to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances, including burn pits, during military service.[415] The bill gained significant media coverage due to the activism of comedian Jon Stewart.[416]\n\n\nBiden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law on August 9, 2022.[417] The act provides billions of dollars in new funding to boost domestic research on and manufacture of semiconductors, to compete economically with China.[418]\n\n\nOn October 6, 2022, Biden pardoned all Americans convicted of \"small\" amounts of cannabis possession under federal law.[419] Two months later, he signed the Respect for Marriage Act, which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act and requires the federal government to recognize the validity of same-sex and interracial marriages.[420]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 elections[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden holding a microphone at a campaign rally, with his jacket off and sleeves rolled up](image)Biden holding a rally at Bowie State University in Maryland for gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore, November 7, 2022\nOn September 2, 2022, in a nationally broadcast Philadelphia speech, Biden called for a \"battle for the soul of the nation\". Off camera, he called Trump supporters \"semi-fascists\", which Republican commentators denounced.[421][422][423] A predicted Republican wave election did not materialize and the race for U.S. Congress control was much closer than expected, with Republicans securing a slim majority of 222 seats in the House of Representatives,[424][425][426][427] and the Democratic caucus keeping control of the U.S. Senate, with 51 seats, a gain of one seat from the last Congress.[428][c]\n\n\nIt was the first midterm election since 1986 in which the party of the incumbent president achieved a net gain in governorships, and the first since 1934 in which the president's party lost no state legislative chambers.[431] Democrats credited Biden for their unexpectedly favorable performance,[432] and he celebrated the results as a strong day for democracy.[433]\n\n\n\n#### Discovery of classified documents[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joe Biden classified documents incident\n\nOn November 2, 2022, while packing files at the Penn Biden Center, Biden's attorneys found classified documents dating to his vice presidency in a \"locked closet\".[434][435] According to the White House, the documents were reported that day to the U.S. National Archives, which recovered the documents the next day.[435] On November 14, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. to conduct an investigation.[436][437] On December 20, a second batch of classified documents was discovered in the garage of Biden's Wilmington, Delaware residence.[438]\n\n\nThe findings were made public on January 10, 2023, after several news organizations published articles on the investigation.[435][439] On January 12, Garland appointed Robert K. Hur as special counsel to investigate \"possible unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or other records\".[440] On January 20, after a 13-hour consensual search by FBI investigators, six more items with classified markings were recovered from Biden's Wilmington residence.[441] FBI agents searched Biden's home in Rehoboth Beach on February 1 and collected papers and notes from his time as vice president, but did not find any classified information.[442]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Biden, Stoltenberg, and staffers sitting in the Oval Office](image)Biden meeting with Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg in the Oval Office, June 7, 2021\nIn June 2021, Biden took his first trip abroad as president. In eight days he visited Belgium, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. He attended a G7 summit, a NATO summit, and an EU summit, and held one-on-one talks with Russian president Vladimir Putin.[443]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Biden announced AUKUS, a security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to ensure \"peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific over the long term\"; the deal included nuclear-powered submarines built for Australia's use.[444]\n\n\n\n#### Withdrawal from Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020–2021)\n\n![Photo of Biden seated alone at a table, looking at a videoconference screen](image)Biden in a video conference with Vice President Harris and the U.S. National Security team, discussing the Fall of Kabul on August 15, 2021\nAmerican forces began withdrawing from Afghanistan in 2020, under the provisions of a February 2020 US-Taliban agreement that set a May 1, 2021, deadline.[445] The Taliban began an offensive on May 1.[446][447] By early July, most American troops in Afghanistan had withdrawn.[333] Biden addressed the withdrawal in July, saying, \"The likelihood there's going to be the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\"[333]\n\n\nOn August 15, the Afghan government collapsed under the Taliban offensive, and Afghan President Ashraf Ghani fled the country.[333][448] Biden reacted by ordering 6,000 American troops to assist in the evacuation of American personnel and Afghan allies.[449] He faced bipartisan criticism for the manner of the withdrawal,[450] with the evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies described as chaotic and botched.[451][452][453] On August 16, Biden addressed the \"messy\" situation, taking responsibility for it, and admitting that the situation \"unfolded more quickly than we had anticipated\".[448][454] He defended his decision to withdraw, saying that Americans should not be \"dying in a war that Afghan forces are not willing to fight for themselves\".[454][455]\n\n\nOn August 26, a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport killed 13 U.S. service members and 169 Afghans. On August 27, an American drone strike killed two ISIS-K targets, who were \"planners and facilitators\", according to a U.S. Army general.[456] On August 29, another American drone strike killed ten civilians, including seven children. The Defense Department initially claimed the strike was conducted on an Islamic State suicide bomber threatening Kabul Airport, but admitted the suspect was harmless on September 17, calling its killing of civilians \"a tragic mistake\".[457]\n\n\nThe U.S. military completed withdrawal from Afghanistan on August 30. Biden called the extraction of over 120,000 Americans, Afghans and other allies \"an extraordinary success\".[458] He acknowledged that up to 200 Americans who wanted to leave did not, despite his August 18 pledge to keep troops in Afghanistan until all Americans who wanted to leave had left.[459]\n\n\n\n#### Aid to Ukraine[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of a smiling Biden holding a child, with a mask lowered onto his chin](image)Biden with refugees from Ukraine in Warsaw, Poland, March 2022\nIn late February 2022, after warning for several weeks that an attack was imminent, Biden led the U.S. response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, imposing severe sanctions on Russia and authorizing over $8 billion in weapons shipments to Ukraine.[460][461][462] On April 29, Biden asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine,[463] but lawmakers later increased it to about $40 billion.[464] Biden blamed Vladimir Putin for the emerging energy and food crises,[465] saying, \"Putin's war has raised the price of food because Ukraine and Russia are two of the world's major breadbaskets for wheat and corn, the basic product for so many foods around the world.\"[466]\n\n\nOn February 20, 2023, four days before the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Biden visited Kyiv and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and first lady of Ukraine Olena Zelenska.[467] While there, he promised more military aid to Ukraine and denounced the war.[468] The trip was unannounced, and involved major security coordination to ensure safety.[469]\n\n\n\n#### China relations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: China–United States relations\n\n![](image)Biden with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during the G20 summit in Bali, November 14, 2022\nChina's assertiveness, particularly in the Pacific, remains a challenge for Biden. The Solomon Islands-China security pact caused alarm, as China could build military bases across the South Pacific. Biden sought to strengthen ties with Australia and New Zealand in the wake of the deal, as Anthony Albanese succeeded to the premiership of Australia and Jacinda Ardern's government took a firmer line on Chinese influence.[470][471][472] In a September 2022 interview with *60 Minutes*, Biden said that U.S. forces would defend Taiwan in the event of \"an unprecedented attack\" by the Chinese,[473] which is in contrast to the long-standing U.S. policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" toward China and Taiwan.[474][475][476] The September comments came after three previous comments by Biden that the U.S. would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.[477] Amid increasing tension with China, Biden's administration has repeatedly walked back his statements and asserted that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed.[477][478][474] In late 2022, Biden issued several executive orders and federal rules designed to slow Chinese technological growth, and maintain U.S. leadership over computing, biotech, and clean energy.[479]\n\n\nOn February 4, 2023, Biden ordered the United States Air Force to shoot down a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon off the coast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[480][481] The Biden administration described the balloon as carrying two railroad cars' equivalent of spy equipment with a propeller for maneuverability.[482][483] The State Department said the balloon carried antennas and other equipment capable of geolocating communications signals, and similar balloons from China have flown over more than 40 nations.[484] The Chinese government denied that the balloon was a surveillance device, instead claiming it was a civilian (mainly meteorological) airship that had blown off course.[485] The incident was seen as damaging to U.S. and China relations.[486][487][488]\n\n\n\n#### Israel[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Biden with Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv, Israel, October 18, 2023\nIn May 2021, during a flareup in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Biden said, \"my party still supports Israel\".[489] In October 2023, Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that devolved into a war, jeopardizing the administration's push to normalize relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia.[490] Biden stated his unequivocal support for Israel, deployed aircraft carriers in the region to deter others from joining the war,[491] and called for an additional $14 billion in military aid to Israel.[492] He later began pressuring Israel to address the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.[493] Biden rejected calls for a ceasefire but said he supported \"humanitarian pauses\" to deliver aid to the people of the Gaza Strip.[494] He asked Israel to pause the invasion for at least three days to allow for hostage negotiations; Israel agreed to daily four-hour pauses.[495]\n\n\n\n#### Other foreign issues[edit]\n\n\nIn early February 2022, Biden ordered the counterterrorism raid in northern Syria that resulted in the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the second leader of the Islamic State.[496] In late July, Biden approved the drone strike that killed Ayman al-Zawahiri, the second leader of Al-Qaeda, and an integral member in the planning of the September 11 attacks.[497] The 2022 OPEC+ oil production cut caused a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia, widening the rift between the two countries, and threatening a longstanding alliance.[498][499]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Biden's letter to Peruvian President Dina Boluarte for Fiestas Patrias praising her government for \"advancing our democratic values, including human rights\" raised controversy due to her administration's violent response to protests, including the Ayacucho and Juliaca massacres.[500][501]\n\n\nBiden may skip the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 28) even though United Arab Emirates officials previously expected he would participate. The 2023 Israel–Hamas war and internal problems with government spending are cited as possible causes.[502]\n\n\n\n### Impeachment inquiry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Impeachment inquiry against Joe Biden\n\nOn September 12, 2023, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against Biden, saying that recent House investigations \"paint a picture of corruption\" by him and his family.[503][504][505][506] Congressional investigations, most notably by the House Oversight committee, have discovered no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden.[d]\n\n\n\n### 2024 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign\n\nEnding months of speculation,[511][512] on April 25, 2023, Biden confirmed he would run for a second term as president in the 2024 election, with Harris again as his running mate. The campaign launched four years to the day after the start of his 2020 presidential campaign.[513] It was also announced that Julie Chávez Rodriguez would serve as campaign manager and Quentin Fulks would be principal deputy campaign manager. Co-chairs include Lisa Blunt Rochester, Jim Clyburn, Chris Coons, Tammy Duckworth, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Gretchen Whitmer.\n\n\nOn the day of his announcement, a Gallup poll found that Biden's approval rating was just 37 percent.[514] Most who were surveyed in the poll said that the economy was their biggest concern.[514] During his campaign, Biden has promoted his economic record by touting the creation of over 13 million jobs, faster pandemic recovery in terms of GDP than other G7 countries, and the longest period of low unemployment in over 50 years.[515][516]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Joe Biden\n\n![Photo of Obama, Biden and Gorbachev smiling at each other](image)Mikhail Gorbachev (right) being introduced to President Obama by Joe Biden, March 2009.

As a senator, he co-sponsored the Boxer–Sanders Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act, the most stringent climate bill in the United States Senate.[541] Biden opposes drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[542] He wants to achieve a carbon-free power sector in the U.S. by 2035 and stop emissions completely by 2050.[543] His program includes reentering the Paris Agreement, nature conservation, and green building.[544] Biden supports environmental justice, including climate justice, and has taken steps to implement it.[545] A major step is increasing energy efficiency, water efficiency and resilience to climate disasters in low-income houses. This should help mitigate climate change, reduce costs for households, and improve health and safety.[546][547] Biden has called global temperature rise above the 1.5 degree limit the \"only existential threat humanity faces even more frightening than a nuclear war\".[548] Despite his clean energy policies and congressional Republicans characterizing them as a \"War on American Energy\", domestic oil production reached a record high in October 2023.[549]\n\n\nBiden has said the U.S. needs to \"get tough\" on China, calling it the \"most serious competitor\" that poses challenges to the United States' \"prosperity, security, and democratic values\".[550][551] Biden has spoken about human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region to the Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, pledging to sanction and commercially restrict Chinese government officials and entities who carry out repression.[552][553]\n\n\nBiden has said he is against regime change, but for providing non-military support to opposition movements.[554] He opposed direct U.S. intervention in Libya,[555][217] voted against U.S. participation in the Gulf War,[556] voted in favor of the Iraq War,[557] and supports a two-state solution in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.[558] Biden has pledged to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and to reevaluate the United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia.[257] Biden supports extending the New START arms control treaty with Russia to limit the number of nuclear weapons deployed by both sides.[559][560] In 2021, Biden officially recognized the Armenian genocide, becoming the first U.S. president to do so.[561][e]\n\n\nBiden has supported abortion rights throughout his presidency. In 2019, he said he supported *Roe v. Wade* and repealing the Hyde Amendment.[564][565] After *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, he criticized near-total bans on abortion access passed in a majority of Republican-controlled states,[566] and took measures to protect abortion rights in the United States.[567] He has vowed to sign a bill codifying the protections of *Roe* into federal law; such a bill passed the House in 2022, but was unable to clear the Senate filibuster.[568][569]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public image of Joe Biden\n\n![Photo of Obama placing a medal on Biden, who looks emotional but solemn](image)President Obama presents Biden with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction, January 12, 2017.\nBiden was consistently ranked one of the least wealthy members of the Senate,[570][571] which he attributed to his having been elected young.[572] Feeling that less-wealthy public officials may be tempted to accept contributions in exchange for political favors, he proposed campaign finance reform measures during his first term.[89] As of November 2009[update], Biden's net worth was $27,012.[573] By November 2020[update], the Bidens were worth $9 million, largely due to sales of Biden's books and speaking fees after his vice presidency.[574][575]\n\n\nThe political writer Howard Fineman has written, \"Biden is not an academic, he's not a theoretical thinker, he's a great street pol. He comes from a long line of working people in Scranton—auto salesmen, car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift.\"[34] Political columnist David S. Broder wrote that Biden has grown over time: \"He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better.\"[34] Journalist James Traub has written that \"Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself\".[128] In recent years, especially after the 2015 death of his elder son Beau, Biden has been noted for his empathetic nature and ability to communicate about grief.[576][577] In 2020, CNN wrote that his presidential campaign aimed to make him \"healer-in-chief\", while *The New York Times* described his extensive history of being called upon to give eulogies.[578]\n\n\nJournalist and TV anchor Wolf Blitzer has called Biden loquacious;[579] journalist Mark Bowden has said that he is famous for \"talking too much\", leaning in close \"like an old pal with something urgent to tell you\".[284] He often deviates from prepared remarks[580] and sometimes \"puts his foot in his mouth\".[164][581][582] Biden has a reputation for being prone to gaffes[583] and in 2018 called himself \"a gaffe machine\".[584][585] *The New York Times* wrote that Biden's \"weak filters make him capable of blurting out pretty much anything\".[164] During his presidency, several Republicans have criticized Biden's publicized gaffes as related to cognitive health issues due to his age, which Biden has repeatedly denied.[586][587][588][589]\n\n\nAccording to *The New York Times*, Biden often embellishes elements of his life or exaggerates, a trait also noted by *The New Yorker* in 2014.[590][591] For instance, he has claimed to have been more active in the civil rights movement than he actually was, and has falsely recalled being an excellent student who earned three college degrees.[590] The *Times* wrote, \"Mr. Biden's folksiness can veer into folklore, with dates that don't quite add up and details that are exaggerated or wrong, the factual edges shaved off to make them more powerful for audiences.\"[591]\n\n\n\n### Job approval[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Morning Consult polling, Biden maintained an approval rating above 50 percent in the first eight months of his presidency. In August 2021, it began to decline, and it reached the low forties by December.[592] This was attributed to the Afghanistan withdrawal, increasing hospitalizations from the Delta variant, high inflation and gas prices, disarray within the Democratic Party, and a general decline in popularity customary in politics.[593][594][595][596]\n\n\nIn February 2021, Gallup, Inc. reported that 98 percent of Democrats approved of Biden.[597][598] As of October 2023, that number had declined to 75 percent.[599] His approval rating among Republicans reached a high of 12 percent in February 2021 and again in July 2021.[597]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n* 2020 United States presidential debates\n* Cabinet of Joe Biden\n* Electoral history of Joe Biden\n* List of awards and honors received by Joe Biden\n* List of things named after Joe Biden\n* Bibliography of Joe Biden\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Biden held the chairmanship from January 3 to 20, then was succeeded by Jesse Helms until June 6, and thereafter held the position until 2003.\n2. **^**  Delaware's Democratic governor, Ruth Ann Minner, announced on November 24, 2008, that she would appoint Biden's longtime senior adviser Ted Kaufman to succeed Biden in the Senate.[178] Kaufman said he would serve only two years, until Delaware's special Senate election in 2010.[178] Biden's son Beau ruled himself out of the 2008 selection process due to his impending tour in Iraq with the Delaware Army National Guard.[179] He was a possible candidate for the 2010 special election, but in early 2010 said he would not run for the seat.[180]\n3. **^** Kyrsten Sinema, whose seat was not up for election in 2022, left the Democratic Party and became an independent politician in December 2022, after the election but before the swearing in of the next Congress. As a result, 48 Democrats (rather than 49), plus Angus King and Bernie Sanders, independents who caucus with Democrats, were in the Senate upon commencement of the 118th United States Congress, on January 3, 2023. Sinema has opted to caucus with neither party but to continue to align with the Democrats, bringing the Democratic Senate majority to 51 seats.[429][430]\n4. **^** Attributed to multiple sources: [507][508][509][510]\n5. **^** In 1981, President Ronald Reagan referred to the Armenian genocide in passing in a statement regarding The Holocaust, but never made a formal declaration recognizing it.[562][563]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Baker, Peter (October 10, 2023). \"In Unforgiving Terms, Biden Condemns 'Evil' and 'Abhorrent' Attack on Israel\". *The New York Times*.

He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the Central Secretariat in October 2007. In 2008, he was designated as Hu Jintao's presumed successor as paramount leader; to that end, Xi was appointed vice president of the PRC and vice chairman of the CMC. He officially received the title of leadership core from the CCP in 2016.\n\n\nXi is the first CCP general secretary born after the establishment of the PRC. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China's relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. He has also promoted \"common prosperity\", a series of policies designed with stated goal to increase equality, and used the term to justify a broad crackdown and major slew of regulations against the tech and tutoring sectors in 2021. Xi met with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou in 2015, the first time PRC and Republic of China leaders met, though relations deteriorated after Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016. He responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China with a zero-COVID approach from January 2020 until December 2022, afterwards shifting towards a mitigation strategy. Xi also oversaw the passage of a national security law in Hong Kong, clamping down on political opposition in the city, especially pro-democracy activists.\n\n\nOften described as an authoritarian leader by political and academic observers, Xi's tenure has included an increase of censorship and mass surveillance, deterioration in human rights, including the internment of one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang (which some observers have described as part of a genocide), a cult of personality developing around Xi, and the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Xi's political ideas and principles, known as Xi Jinping Thought, have been incorporated into the party and national constitutions, and he has emphasized the importance of national security and the need for CCP leadership over the country. As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including chairing the National Security Commission and new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. He and the CCP Central Committee passed a \"historical resolution\" in November 2021, the third such resolution after Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, the second leader of the CCP to do so after Mao, and in March 2023 was reelected state president for a third term, the first head of state to be so.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nXi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953,[2] the third child of Xi Zhongxun and his second wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (安安; *Ān'ān*), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nXi went to the Beijing Bayi School,[7][8] and then the Beijing No. 25 School,[9] in the 1960s. He became friends with Liu He, who attended Beijing No. 101 School in the same district, who later became China's vice premier and a close advisor to Xi after he became China's paramount leader.[10][11] In 1963, when he was aged 10, his father was purged from the CCP and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan.[12] In May 1966, the Cultural Revolution cut short Xi's secondary education when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. Student militants ransacked the Xi family home and one of Xi's sisters, Xi Heping, committed suicide from the pressure.[13]\n\n\nLater, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement.[14] He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house.[15] According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor.[16] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but he later returned to the village. He then spent a total of seven years there.[17][18]\n\n\nThe misfortunes and suffering of his family in his early years hardened Xi's view of politics. During an interview in 2000, he said, \"People who have little contact with power, who are far from it, always see these things as mysterious and novel. But what I see is not just the superficial things: the power, the flowers, the glory, the applause. I see the bullpens and how people can blow hot and cold. I understand politics on a deeper level.\" The \"bullpens\" (牛棚) was a reference to Red Guards' detention houses during the Cultural Revolution.[16]\n\n\nAfter seven rejections, Xi joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1971 on his eighth attempt after he befriended a local official.[8] He reunited with his father in 1972, because of a family reunion ordered by premier Zhou Enlai.[13] From 1973, he applied to join the CCP ten times and was finally accepted on his tenth attempt in 1974.[19][20][21] From 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student in Beijing. The engineering majors there spent about 15 percent of their time studying Marxism–Leninism–Maoism and 5 percent of their time doing farm work and \"learning from the People's Liberation Army\".[22]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1979 to 1982, Xi served as secretary for his father's former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and secretary-general of the CMC.[8] In 1982, he was sent to Zhengding County in Hebei as deputy party secretary of Zhengding County. He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county.[23] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982–1985), Fujian (1985–2002), Zhejiang (2002–2007), and Shanghai (2007).[24] Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.[b][25]\n\n\nFrom 1998 to 2002, Xi studied Marxist theory and ideological education in Tsinghua University,[26] graduating with a doctorate in law and ideology in 2002.[27] In 1999, he was promoted to the office of Vice Governor of Fujian, and became governor a year later. In Fujian, Xi made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to strengthen the private sector of the provincial economy.[28] In February 2000, he and then-provincial party secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top members of PSC – general secretary Jiang Zemin, premier Zhu Rongji, vice president Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection secretary Wei Jianxing – to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.[29]\n\n\nIn 2002, Xi left Fujian and took up leading political positions in neighbouring Zhejiang. He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year.[30] His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders.[31] Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi's chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.[32]\n\n\nFollowing the dismissal of Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, Xi was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007, where he was the party secretary there for seven months.[33][34] In Shanghai, Xi avoided controversy and was known for strictly observing party discipline. For example, Shanghai administrators attempted to earn favour with him by arranging a special train to shuttle him between Shanghai and Hangzhou for him to complete handing off his work to his successor as Zhejiang party secretary Zhao Hongzhu. However, Xi reportedly refused to take the train, citing a loosely enforced party regulation that stipulated that special trains can only be reserved for \"national leaders\".[35] While in Shanghai, he worked on preserving unity of the local party organisation. He pledged there would be no 'purges' during his administration, despite the fact many local officials were thought to have been implicated in the Chen Liangyu corruption scandal.[36] On most issues, Xi largely echoed the line of the central leadership.[37]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping greeting U.S. president George W. Bush in August 2008\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev on 28 September 2010\nXi was appointed to the nine-man PSC at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. He was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the first secretary of the CCP's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as vice president of the PRC.[38] Following his elevation, Xi held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new president of the Central Party School of the CCP, its cadre-training and ideological education wing. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. He made his first foreign trip as vice president to North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008.[39] After the Olympics, Xi was assigned the post of committee chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of the PRC. He was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level CCP committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of politically sensitive anniversaries in 2009.[40]\n\n\nXi's position as the apparent successor to become the paramount leader was threatened with the rapid rise of Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time. Bo was expected to join the PSC at the 18th Party Congress, with most expecting that he would try to eventually maneuver himself into replacing Xi.[41] Bo's policies in Chongqing inspired imitations throughout China and received praise from Xi himself during Xi's visit to Chongqing in 2010. Records of praises from Xi were later erased after he became paramount leader. Bo's downfall would come with the Wang Lijun incident, which opened the door for Xi to come to power without challengers.[42]\n\n\nXi is considered one of the most successful members of the Princelings, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was \"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations\".[43] Lee also commented: \"I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive\".[44] Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as \"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line\".[45] Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi \"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man\".[46]\n\n\n\n### Trips as Vice President[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2009, in his capacity as vice-president, Xi Jinping embarked on a tour of Latin America, visiting Mexico,[47] Jamaica,[48] Colombia,[49] Venezuela,[50] Brazil,[51] and Malta, after which he returned to China.[52] On 11 February 2009, while visiting Mexico, Xi spoke in front of a group of overseas Chinese and explained China's contributions during the international financial crisis, saying that it was \"the greatest contribution towards the whole of human race, made by China, to prevent its 1.3 billion people from hunger\".[c] He went on to remark: \"There are some bored foreigners, with full stomachs, who have nothing better to do than point fingers at us. First, China doesn't export revolution; second, China doesn't export hunger and poverty; third, China doesn't come and cause you headaches. What more is there to be said?\"[d][53] The story was reported on some local television stations. The news led to a flood of discussions on Chinese Internet forums and it was reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was caught off-guard by Xi's remarks, as the actual video was shot by some accompanying Hong Kong reporters and broadcast on Hong Kong TV, which then turned up on various Internet video websites.[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Muscatine, Iowa house where Xi stayed with an American family during a 1985 agricultural visit to the United States. The home was turned into a museum decades later.\nIn the European Union, Xi visited Belgium, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania from 7 to 21 October 2009.[55] He visited Japan, South Korea, Cambodia, and Myanmar on his Asian trip from 14 to 22 December 2009.[56] He later visited the United States, Ireland and Turkey in February 2012. This visit included meeting with then U.S. president Barack Obama at the White House[57] and then vice president Joe Biden; and stops in California and Iowa, where he met with the family that previously hosted him during his 1985 tour as a Hebei provincial official.[58]\n\n\n\n### Accession to top posts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Generations of Chinese leadership and Succession of power in China\n\nA few months before his ascendancy to the party leadership, Xi disappeared from official media coverage and cancelled meeting with foreign officials for several weeks beginning on 1 September 2012, causing rumors.[8] He then reappeared on 15 September.[59] On 15 November 2012, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee of the CCP. This made him, informally, the paramount leader and the first to be born after the founding of the PRC. The following day Xi led the new line-up of the PSC onto the stage in their first public appearance.[60] The PSC was reduced from nine to seven, with only Xi and Li Keqiang retaining their seats; the other five members were new.[61][62][63] In a marked departure from the common practice of Chinese leaders, Xi's first speech as general secretary was plainly worded and did not include any political slogans or mention his predecessors.[64] Xi mentioned the aspirations of the average person, remarking, \"Our people ... expect better education, more stable jobs, better income, more reliable social security, medical care of a higher standard, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful environment.\" Xi also vowed to tackle corruption at the highest levels, alluding that it would threaten the CCP's survival; he was reticent about far-reaching economic reforms.[65]\n\n\nIn December 2012, Xi visited Guangdong in his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership. The overarching theme of the trip was to call for further economic reform and a strengthened military. Xi visited the statue of Deng Xiaoping and his trip was described as following in the footsteps of Deng's own southern trip in 1992, which provided the impetus for further economic reforms in China after conservative party leaders stalled many of Deng's reforms in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. On his trip, Xi consistently alluded to his signature slogan, the \"Chinese Dream\". \"This dream can be said to be the dream of a strong nation. And for the military, it is a dream of a strong military\", Xi told sailors.[66] Xi's trip was significant in that he departed from the established convention of Chinese leaders' travel routines in multiple ways. Rather than dining out, Xi and his entourage ate regular hotel buffet. He travelled in a large van with his colleagues rather than a fleet of limousines, and did not restrict traffic on the parts of the highway he travelled.[67]\n\n\nXi was elected president on 14 March 2013, in a confirmation vote by the 12th National People's Congress in Beijing. He received 2,952 for, one vote against, and three abstentions.[60] He replaced Hu Jintao, who retired after serving two terms.[68] In his new capacity as president, on 16 March 2013 Xi expressed support for non-interference in China–Sri Lanka relations amid a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn that country over government abuses during the Sri Lankan Civil War.[69] On 17 March, Xi and his new ministers arranged a meeting with the chief executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung, confirming his support for Leung.[70] Within hours of his election, Xi discussed cyber security and North Korea with U.S. President Barack Obama over the phone. Obama announced the visits of treasury and state secretaries Jacob Lew and John F. Kerry to China the following week.[71]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping Administration\n\n### Anti-corruption campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping\n\n> \n> “To speak the truth” means to focus on the nature of things, to speak frankly, and follow the truth. This is an important embodiment of a leading official’s characteristics of truth seeking, embodying justice, devotion to public interests, and uprightness. Moreover, he highlighted that the premise of telling the truth is to listen to the truth.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Xi Jinping during a speech in 2012[72][73]\n\nXi vowed to crack down on corruption almost immediately after he ascended to power at the 18th Party Congress. In his inaugural speech as general secretary, Xi mentioned that fighting corruption was one of the toughest challenges for the party.[74] A few months into his term, Xi outlined the Eight-point Regulation, listing rules intended to curb corruption and waste during official party business; it aimed at stricter discipline on the conduct of party officials. Xi also vowed to root out \"tigers and flies\", that is, high-ranking officials and ordinary party functionaries.[75]\n\n\nXi initiated cases against former CMC vice-chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, former PSC member and security chief Zhou Yongkang and former Hu Jintao chief aide Ling Jihua.[76] Along with new disciplinary chief Wang Qishan, Xi's administration spearheaded the formation of \"centrally-dispatched inspection teams\" (中央巡视组). These were essentially cross-jurisdictional squads of officials whose main task was to gain more in-depth understanding of the operations of provincial and local party organizations, and in the process, also enforce party discipline mandated by Beijing. Many of the work teams also had the effect of identifying and initiating investigations of high-ranking officials. Over one hundred provincial-ministerial level officials were implicated during a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign. These included former and current regional officials (Su Rong, Bai Enpei, Wan Qingliang), leading figures of state-owned enterprises and central government organs (Song Lin, Liu Tienan), and highly ranked generals in the military (Gu Junshan). In June 2014, the Shanxi provincial political establishment was decimated, with four officials dismissed within a week from the provincial party organization's top ranks. Within the first two years of the campaign alone, over 200,000 low-ranking officials received warnings, fines, and demotions.[77]\n\n\nThe campaign has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including members of the PSC.[78] Xi's anti-corruption campaign is seen by critics, such as *The Economist*, as a political tool with the aim of removing potential opponents and consolidating power.[79][80] Xi's establishment of a new anti-corruption agency, the National Supervision Commission, ranked higher than the supreme court, has been described by Amnesty International's East Asia director as a \"systemic threat to human rights\" that \"places tens of millions of people at the mercy of a secretive and virtually unaccountable system that is above the law.\"[81][82]\n\n\nXi has overseen significant reforms of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CCP's highest internal control institution.[83] He and CCDI Secretary Wang Qishan further institutionalized CCDI's independence from the day-to-day operations of the CCP, improving its ability to function as a *bona fide* control body.[83] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, any anti-corruption punishment to officials at or above the vice ministerial level need approval from Xi.[84] Another article from *The Wall Street Journal* said that when he wants to neutralize a political rival, he asks inspectors to prepare hundreds of pages of evidence. The article also said that he sometimes authorizes investigations on close associates of a high-ranking politician to replace them with his own proteges and puts political rivals in less important positions to separate them from their political bases. Reportedly, these tactics have even been used against Wang Qishan, Xi's close friend.[85]\n\n\nAccording to historian and sinologist Wang Gungwu, Xi Jinping inherited a political party that was faced with pervasive corruption.[86][87] Xi believed that the amount of corruption at the higher levels of the CCP put both the party and the country at risk of collapse.[86] Wang further adds that Xi has a belief that only the CCP is capable of governing China, and that a collapse of the party would be disastrous for the Chinese people. Xi and the new generational leaders reacted by launching the anti-corruption campaign to eliminate corruption at the higher levels of the government.[86]\n\n\n\n### Censorship[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Censorship in China and Internet censorship in China\n\nSince Xi became the CCP general secretary, censorship, including internet censorship, has been significantly stepped up.[88][89] Chairing the 2018 China Cyberspace Governance Conference on 20 and 21 April 2018, Xi committed to \"fiercely crack down on criminal offenses including hacking, telecom fraud, and violation of citizens' privacy.\"[90] During a visit to Chinese state media, Xi stated that \"party and government-owned media must hold the family name of the party\" (党和政府主办的媒体必须姓党) and that the state media \"must embody the party's will, safeguard the party's authority\".[91]\n\n\nHis administration has overseen more Internet restrictions imposed in China, and is described as being \"stricter across the board\" on speech than previous administrations.[92] Xi has taken a very strong stand to control internet usage inside China, including Google and Facebook,[93] advocating Internet censorship in the country under the concept of internet sovereignty.[94][95] The censorship of Wikipedia has also been stringent; in April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia were blocked in China.[96] Likewise, the situation for users of Weibo has been described as a change from fearing that individual posts would be deleted, or at worst one's account, to fear of arrest.[97]\n\n\nA law enacted in September 2013 authorized a three-year prison term for bloggers who shared more than 500 times any content considered \"defamatory\".[98] The State Internet Information Department summoned a group of influential bloggers to a seminar instructing them to avoid writing about politics, the CCP, or making statements contradicting official narratives. Many bloggers stopped writing about controversial topics, and Weibo went into decline, with much of its readership shifting to WeChat users speaking to very limited social circles.[98] In 2017, telecommunications carriers in China were instructed by the government to block individuals' use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) by February 2018.[99]\n\n\nXi has spoken out against \"historical nihilism\", meaning historical viewpoints that challenge the official line of the CCP.[100] Xi said that one of the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union has been historical nihilism.[101] The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has established a telephone hotline for people to report acts of historical nihilism, while Toutiao and Douyin urged its user to report instances of historical nihilism.[102] In May 2021, the CAC reported that it removed two million online posts for historical nihilism.[103]\n\n\n\n### Consolidation of power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Xi in Beijing, September 2015\nSee also: New Zhijiang Army and Fujian clique\n\nPolitical observers have called Xi the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, especially since the ending of presidential two-term limits in 2018.[104][105][106][107] Xi has notably departed from the collective leadership practices of his post-Mao predecessors. He has centralised his power and created working groups with himself at the head to subvert government bureaucracy, making himself become the unmistakable central figure of the new administration.[108] Beginning in 2013, the CCP under Xi has created a series of Central Leading Groups: supra-ministerial steering committees, designed to bypass existing institutions when making decisions, and ostensibly make policy-making a more efficient process. The most notable new body is the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms. It has broad jurisdiction over economic restructuring and social reforms, and is said to have displaced some of the power previously held by the State Council and its premier.[109]\n\n\nXi also became the leader of the Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization, in charge of cyber-security and Internet policy. The Third Plenum held in 2013 also saw the creation of the National Security Commission of the CCP, another body chaired by Xi, which commentators have said would help Xi consolidate over national security affairs.[110][111] In the opinion of at least one political scientist, Xi \"has surrounded himself with cadres he met while stationed on the coast, Fujian and Shanghai and in Zhejiang.\"[112] Control of Beijing is seen as crucial to Chinese leaders; Xi has selected Cai Qi, one of the cadres mentioned above, to manage the capital.[113] Xi was also believed to have diluted the authority of premier Li Keqiang, taking authority over the economy which has generally been considered to be the domain of the premier.[114][115]\n\n\nSince coming to power, various observers have said that Xi has seriously diluted the influence of the once-dominant \"Tuanpai\", also called the Youth League Faction, which were CCP officials who rose through the Party's Communist Youth League (CYLC).[116] He criticized the cadres of the CYLC, saying that [these cadres] can't talk about science, literature and art, work or life [with young people]. All they can do is just repeat the same old bureaucratic, stereotypical talk.\"[117] Its budget was also cut, dropping from around 700 million yuan ($96 million) in 2012 to 260 million yuan ($40 million) in 2021, while its membership dropped from 90 million to 74 million in the same period.[116] He also led to the closure of the Central School of the Communist Youth League of China, merging it with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and effectively demoted Qin Yizhi, first secretary of the CYLC, in 2017.[118]\n\n\nIn March 2018, the National People's Congress (NPC) passed a set of constitutional amendments including removal of term limits for the president and vice president, the creation of a National Supervisory Commission, as well as enhancing the central role of the CCP.[119][120] On 17 March 2018, the Chinese legislature reappointed Xi as president, now without term limits; Wang Qishan was appointed vice president.[121][122] The following day, Li Keqiang was reappointed premier and longtime allies of Xi, Xu Qiliang and Zhang Youxia, were voted in as vice-chairmen of the CMC.[123] Foreign minister Wang Yi was promoted to state councillor and General Wei Fenghe was named defence minister.[124] According to the *Financial Times*, Xi expressed his views of constitutional amendment at meetings with Chinese officials and foreign dignitaries. Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts—general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC—which have no term limits. However, Xi did not say whether he intended to serve as party general secretary, CMC chairman and state president, for three or more terms.[125]\n\n\nIn its sixth plenary session in November 2021, CCP adopted a historical resolution, a kind of document that evaluated the party's history. This was the third of its kind after ones adopted by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping,[126][127] and the document for the first time credited Xi as being the \"main innovator\" of Xi Jinping Thought[128] while also declaring Xi's leadership as being \"the key to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".[129] In comparison with the other historical resolutions, Xi's one did not herald a major change in how the CCP evaluated its history.[130] To accompany the historical resolution, the CCP promoted the terms Two Establishes and Two Safeguards, calling the CCP to unite around and protect Xi's core status within the party.[131] In 2022, Xi appointed his close ally Wang Xiaohong as the Minister of Public Security, giving him further control over the security establishment.[132]\n\n\nThe 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held between 16 and 22 October 2022, has overseen amendments in the CCP constitution and the re-election of Xi as general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC for a third term, with the overall result of the Congress being further strengthening of Xi's power.[133] The newly amended CCP constitution included the term two safeguards, reinforcing Xi's power.[134] It also included concepts promoted by Xi like common prosperity, \"Chinese-style modernization\" and \"whole-process people's democracy\".[135] Xi's re-election made him the first party leader since Mao Zedong to be chosen for a third term, though Deng Xiaoping ruled the country informally for a longer period.[136] Xi was further re-elected as the PRC president and chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission on 10 March 2023 during the opening of the 14th National People's Congress.[137]\n\n\nThe new Politburo Standing Committee elected just after the CCP Congress was filled almost completely with people close to Xi, with four out of the seven members of the previous PSC including premier Li Keqiang and CPPCC chairman Wang Yang stepping down.[138] Li Qiang, a close Xi ally, became the second-ranking member of the PSC, and was further promoted to premier in 2023.[133][139] Other allies of Xi, including Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang and Li Xi have also joined the PSC, and became the first secretary of the CCP Secretariat, first vice premier, and secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection respectively.[140] The only remaining members of the previous PSC except Xi were Zhao Leji and Wang Huning, though their ranking and positions changed,[140] and became the NPC Standing Committee and CPPCC chairmen respectively on 10 March 2023.[141][142] Reuters remarked that the retirement of Wang Yang and Li Keqiang, as well as the demotion of vice premier Hu Chunhua from the Politburo meant the wipeout of Tuanpai,[116] while Willy Wo-Lap Lam wrote that there were no representatives from the Tuanpai or the Shanghai clique, leading to a total dominance of Xi's own faction.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Cult of personality[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping's cult of personality\n\nXi has had a cult of personality constructed around himself since entering office[144][145] with books, cartoons, pop songs and dance routines honouring his rule.[146] Following Xi's ascension to the leadership core of the CCP, he had been referred to as *Xi Dada* (习大大, Uncle or Papa Xi),[146][147] though this stopped in April 2016.[148] The village of Liangjiahe, where Xi was sent to work, has become a \"modern-day shrine\" decorated with CCP propaganda and murals extolling the formative years of his life.[149] The CCP's Politburo named Xi Jinping *lingxiu* (领袖), a reverent term for \"leader\" and a title previously only given to Mao Zedong and his immediate successor Hua Guofeng.[150][151][152] He is also sometimes called the \"pilot at the helm\" (领航掌舵).[153] On 25 December 2019, the Politburo officially named Xi as \"People's Leader\" (人民领袖; *rénmín lǐngxiù*), a title only Mao had held previously.[154]\n\n\n\n### Economy and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of China\n\nXi was initially seen as a market reformist,[155] and the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee under him announced that \"market forces\" would begin to play a \"decisive\" role in allocating resources.[156] This meant that the state would gradually reduce its involvement in the distribution of capital, and restructure China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to allow further competition, potentially by attracting foreign and private sector players in industries that were previously highly regulated. This policy aimed to address the bloated state sector that had unduly profited from an earlier round of re-structuring by purchasing assets at below-market prices, assets that were no longer being used productively. Xi also launched the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone in August 2013, which was seen as part of the economic reforms.[157] In However, by 2017, Xi's promise of economic reforms has been said to stall by experts.[158][155] In 2015, the Chinese stock market bubble popped, which led Xi to use state forces to fix the issue.[159] From 2012 to 2022, the share of the market value of private sector firms in China's top listed companies has increased from around 10% to over 40%.[160] He has also overseen the relaxation of restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) and increased cross-border holdings of stocks and bonds.[160]\n\n\nXi has increased state control over China's economy, voicing support for SOEs,[161][155] while also supporting the country's private sector.[162] CCP control of SOEs has increased under Xi, while some limited steps towards market liberalization, such as increasing mixed ownership of SOEs were also undertaken.[163] Under Xi, \"government guidance funds\", public-private investment funds set up by or for government bodies, have raised more than $900 billion for early funding to companies that work in sectors the government deems as strategic.[164] Xi has increased the role of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission at the expense of the State Council.[165] His administration made it easier for banks to issue mortgages, increased foreign participation in the bond market, and increased the national currency renminbi's global role, helping it to join IMF's basket of special drawing right.[166] In the 40th anniversary of the launching of Chinese economic reforms in 2018, he has promised to continue reforms but has warned that nobody \"can dictate to the Chinese people\".[167]\n\n\nXi has also personally made eradicating extreme poverty through \"targeted poverty alleviation\" a key goal.[168] In 2021, Xi declared a \"complete victory\" over extreme poverty, saying that nearly 100 million people have been lifted out of poverty under his tenure, though some experts said that China's poverty threshold was relatively lower than the one set by the World Bank.[169] In 2020, premier Li Keqiang, citing the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that China still had 600 million people living with less than 1000 yuan ($140) a month, although an article from *The Economist* said that the methodology NBS used was flawed, stating that the figure took the combined income, which was then equally divided.[170]\n\n\nChina's economy has grown under Xi, with GDP in nominal terms more than doubling from $8.53 trillion in 2012 to $17.73 trillion in 2021,[171] while China's nominal GDP per capita surpassed the world average in 2021,[172] though the rate of growth has slowed from 7.9% in 2012 to 6% in 2019.[173] Xi has stressed the importance of \"high-quality growth\" rather than \"inflated growth\".[174] He has additionally stated that China will focus on quality of economic growth and that it has abandoned a growth-at-all-costs strategy which Xi refers to as \"GDP heroism\".[175]: 22 Instead, Xi said that other social issues such as environmental protection are important.[175]: 22 His administration pursued a debt-deleveraging campaign, seeking to slow and cut the unsustainable amount of debt China has accrued during its economic growth.[176] Though China's total non-financial-sector debt-to-GDP ratio reached a record 270.9% by 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis, it fell to reach around 262.5% by 2021 before going up again to 273.2% in 2022, mainly due to the pressure put by the zero-COVID policy to local finances.[177]\n\n\nXi has circulated a policy called \"dual circulation\", meaning reorienting the economy towards domestic consumption while remaining open to foreign trade and investment.[178] Xi has also made boosting productivity in the economy a priority.[179] Xi has attempted to reform the property sector to combat the steep increase in the property prices and to cut Chinese economy's dependence on the real estate sector.[180] In the 19th CCP National Congress, Xi declared \"Houses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation\".[181] In 2020, Xi's government formulated the \"three red lines\" policy that aimed to deleverage the heavily indebted property sector.[182] Xi additionally has supported a property tax, for which he has faced resistance from members of the CCP.[183]\n\n\nXi's administration has promoted \"Made in China 2025\" plan that aims to make China self-reliant in key technologies, although publicly China de-emphasised this plan due to the outbreak of a trade war with the U.S. Since the outbreak of the trade war in 2018, Xi has revived calls for \"self-reliance\", especially on the matters of technology.[184] Domestic spending on R&D has significantly increased under Xi, surpassing the total of the European Union (EU) and reaching a record $564 billion in 2020.[185] In August 2022, Xi's administration has allocated more than $100 billion to support China's efforts at semiconductor independence.[186] The Chinese government has also supported technology companies like Huawei through grants, tax breaks, credit facilities and other forms of assistance, enabling their rise but also leading to countermeasures by the U.S.[187] Xi has also been personally involved in the development of Xiong'an, a new area announced in 2017, planned to become a major metropolis near Beijing and Tianjin in Hebei province; the relocation aspect is estimated to last until 2035 while it is planned to developed into a \"modern socialist city\" by 2050.[188]\n\n\n\n> \n> Common prosperity is an essential requirement of socialism and a key feature of Chinese-style modernization. The common prosperity we are pursuing is for all, affluence both in material and spiritual life, but not for a small portion nor for uniform egalitarianism.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Xi Jinping during a speech in 2021[189]\n\nIn November 2020, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Xi personally ordered a halt to Ant Group's initial public offering (IPO), in reaction to its founder Jack Ma criticizing government regulation in finance.[190] Xi's administration has also overseen a decrease in offshore IPOs by Chinese companies, with most Chinese IPOs taking place either in Shanghai or Shenzhen as of 2022[update], and has increasingly directed funding to IPOs of companies that works in sectors it deems as strategic, including electric vehicles, biotechnology, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and other high-technology manufacturing.[164]\n\n\nSince 2021, Xi has promoted the term \"common prosperity\", a term which he defined as an \"essential requirement of socialism\", described as affluence for all and said entailed reasonable adjustments to excess incomes.[189][191] Common prosperity has been used as the justification for large-scale crackdowns and regulations towards the perceived \"excesses\" of several sectors, most prominently tech and tutoring industries.[192] The examples of actions taken against tech companies have included fining large tech companies[193] and passing of laws such as the Data Security Law. China also banned private tutoring companies from making profits and teaching school syllabus during weekends and holidays, effectively destroying the whole industry.[194] Xi additionally opened a new stock exchange in Beijing targeted for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which was another part of his common prosperity campaign.[195] There have also been other numerous cultural regulations, such as limiting video game usage by minors to 90 minutes during weekdays and 3 hours during weekends,[196] complete banning of cryptocurrency,[197] cracking down on idol worship, fandom and celebrity culture[198] and cracking down on \"sissy men\".[199] *The Wall Street Journal* has also reported in October 2021 that Xi had launched a round of inspections of the country's financial institutions, including state-owned banks, investment funds and financial regulators, on whether their ties to private firms had become too close, with the investigations being led by Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.[200]\n\n\n\n### Reforms[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2013, at the conclusion of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, the Communist Party delivered a far-reaching reform agenda that alluded to changes in both economic and social policy. Xi signaled at the plenum that he was consolidating control of the massive internal security organization that was formerly the domain of Zhou Yongkang.[156] A new National Security Commission was formed with Xi at its helm. The Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms—another *ad hoc* policy coordination body led by Xi upgraded to a commission in 2018—was also formed to oversee the implementation of the reform agenda.[201] Termed \"comprehensive deepening reforms\" (全面深化改革; *quánmiàn shēnhuà gǎigé*), they were said to be the most significant since Deng Xiaoping's 1992 Southern Tour. The plenum also announced economic reforms and resolved to abolish the *laogai* system of \"re-education through labour\", which was largely seen as a blot on China's human rights record. The system has faced significant criticism for years from domestic critics and foreign observers.[156] In January 2016, a two-child policy replaced the one-child policy,[202] which was in turn was replaced with a three-child policy in May 2021.[203] In July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed.[204]\n\n\n\n#### Political reforms[edit]\n\n\nXi's administration taken a number of changes to the structure of the CCP and state bodies, especially in a large overhaul in 2018. In March 2014, the CCP Central Committee merged the Office for External Propaganda (OEP), externally known as the State Council Information Office (SCIO), to the CCP's Central Propaganda Department. SCIO is now used by the Central Propaganda Department as an external name under an arrangement called \"one institution with two names\".[205] February earlier that year oversaw the creation of the Central Leading Group for Cybersecurity and Informatization. The State Internet Information Office (SIIO), previously under the OEP and SCIO, was transferred to the central leading group and renamed in English into the Cyberspace Administration of China.[206] As part of managing the financial system, the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a State Council body, was established in 2017. Chaired by vice premier Liu He during its existence, the committee was disestablished by the newly established Central Financial Commission during the 2023 Party and state reforms.[207]\n\n\n2018 has seen larger reforms to the bureaucracy. In that year, several central leading groups including reform, cyberspace affairs, finance and economics. and foreign affairs were upgraded to commissions.[208][209] In the area of media, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) was renamed into the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) with its film, news media and publications being transferred to the Central Propaganda Department.[209] Additionally, the control of China Central Television (CCTV, including its international edition, China Global Television), China National Radio (CNR) and China Radio International (CRI) were transferred to the newly established China Media Group (CMG) under the control of the Central Propaganda Department.[209][210] Two State Council departments. one dealing with overseas Chinese, and other one dealing with religious affairs, were merged into the United Front Work Department while another commission dealing with ethnic affairs was brought under formal UFWD leadership.[209]\n\n\n2023 has seen further reforms to the CCP and state bureaucracy, most notably the strengthening of Party control over the financial and technology domains.[211] This included the creation of two CCP bodies for overseeing finance; the Central Financial Commission (CFC), as well as the revival of the Central Financial Work Commission (CFWC) that was previously dissolved in 2002.[211] The CFC would broadly manage the financial system while the CFWC would focus on strengthening the ideological and political role of the CCP in the sector.[207] Additionally, a new CCP Central Science and Technology Commission would be established to broadly oversee the technology sector, while a newly created Social Work Department was tasked with CCP interactions with several sectors, including civic groups, chambers of commerce and industry groups, as well as handling public petition and grievance work.[211] A new Central Hong Kong and Macau Work Office would also be established, with the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office being turned into the new body's external name.[211]\n\n\nAt the State Council, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission was replaced by the National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR), which is taking a much larger responsibility on financial regulation, effectively overseeing all financial activities except the securities industry, which was continued to be regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, now elevated to a government body.[212] Several regulatory responsibilities were also transferred from the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to the SAFS, while the PBoC will also reopen offices around the country that were closed in a previous reorganization.[213]\n\n\n\n#### Legal reforms[edit]\n\n\n> \n> Efforts should be made to enable the people to see that justice is served in every judicial case.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Xi Jinping during a speech in November 2020[214]\n\nThe party under Xi announced a raft of legal reforms at the Fourth Plenum held in the fall 2014, and he called for \"Chinese socialistic rule of law\" immediately afterwards. The party aimed to reform the legal system, which had been perceived as ineffective at delivering justice and affected by corruption, local government interference and lack of constitutional oversight. The plenum, while emphasizing the absolute leadership of the party, also called for a greater role of the constitution in the affairs of state and a strengthening of the role of the National People's Congress Standing Committee in interpreting the constitution.[215] It also called for more transparency in legal proceedings, more involvement of ordinary citizens in the legislative process, and an overall \"professionalization\" of the legal workforce. The party also planned to institute cross-jurisdictional circuit legal tribunals as well as giving provinces consolidated administrative oversight over lower level legal resources, which is intended to reduce local government involvement in legal proceedings.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Military reforms[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Modernization of the People's Liberation Army and 2015 People's Republic of China military reform\nSince taking power in 2012, Xi has undertaken an overhaul of the People's Liberation Army, including both political reform and its modernization.[217] Military-civil fusion has advanced under Xi.[218][219] Xi has been active in his participation in military affairs, taking a direct hands-on approach to military reform. In addition to being the Chairman of the CMC and leader of the Central Leading Group for Military Reform founded in 2014 to oversee comprehensive military reforms, Xi has delivered numerous high-profile pronouncements vowing to clean up malfeasance and complacency in the military. Xi has repeatedly warned that the depoliticization of the PLA from the CCP would lead to a collapse similar to that of the Soviet Union.[220] Xi held the New Gutian Conference in 2014, gathering China's top military officers, re-emphasizing the principle of \"the party has absolute control over the army\" first established by Mao at the 1929 Gutian Conference.[221]\n\n\n> \n> In the USSR, where the military was depoliticized, separated from the party and nationalized, the party was disarmed. When the Soviet Union came to crisis point, a big party was gone just like that. Proportionally, the Soviet Communist Party had more members than we do, but nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Xi Jinping during a speech[222]\n\nThough predating Xi, his administration has taken a more assertive stance towards maritime affairs, and has boosted CCP control over the maritime security forces.[223] In 2013, the previously separate rival maritime law enforcements of China were merged into the China Coast Guard. Initially under the joint administration of the State Oceanic Administration and the Ministry of Public Security, it was placed squarely under the administration of the People's Armed Police (PAP) in 2018.[223]\n\n\nXi announced a reduction of 300,000 troops from the PLA in 2015, bringing its size to 2 million troops. Xi described this as a gesture of peace, while analysts such as Rory Medcalf have said that the cut was done to reduce costs as well as part of PLA's modernization.[224] On 2016, he reduced the number of theater commands of the PLA from seven to five.[225] He has also abolished the four autonomous general departments of the PLA, replacing them with 15 agencies directly reporting to the CMC.[217] Two new branches of the PLA were created under his reforms, the Strategic Support Force[226] and the Joint Logistics Support Force.[227] In 2018, the PAP was placed under the sole control of the CMC; the PAP was previously under the joint command of the CMC and the State Council through the Ministry of Public Security.[228]: 15\n\n\nOn 21 April 2016, Xi was named commander-in-chief of the country's new Joint Operations Command Center of the PLA by Xinhua News Agency and the broadcaster China Central Television.[229][230] Some analysts interpreted this move as an attempt to display strength and strong leadership and as being more \"political than military\".[231] According to Ni Lexiong, a military affairs expert, Xi \"not only controls the military but also does it in an absolute manner, and that in wartime, he is ready to command personally\".[232] According to a University of California, San Diego expert on Chinese military, Xi \"has been able to take political control of the military to an extent that exceeds what Mao and Deng have done\".[233]\n\n\nUnder Xi, China's official military budget has more than doubled,[185] reaching a record $224 billion in 2023.[234] The PLA Navy has grown rapidly under Xi, with China adding more warships, submarines, support ships and major amphibious vessels than the than the entire number of ships under the United Kingdom navy between 2014 and 2018.[235] In 2017, China established the navy's first overseas base in Djibouti.[236] Xi has also undertaken an expansion of China's nuclear arsenal, with him calling China to \"establish a strong system of strategic deterrence\". The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) has estimated China's total amount of nuclear arsenals to be 410 in 2023, with the US Department of Defense estimating that China's arsenal could reach 1,000 by 2030.[237]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of Xi Jinping\nSee also: List of international trips made by Xi Jinping\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet in 2016![](image)World leaders assemble for \"family photo\" at G20 summit in HamburgXi has taken a harder line on security issues as well as foreign affairs, projecting a more nationalistic and assertive China on the world stage.[238] His political program calls for a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure.[239] Foreign analysts and observers have frequently said that Xi's main foreign policy objective is to restore China's position on the global stage as a great power.[240][222][241] Xi advocates \"baseline thinking\" in China's foreign policy: setting explicit red lines that other countries must not cross.[242] In the Chinese perspective, these tough stances on baseline issues reduce strategic uncertainty, preventing other nations from misjudging China's positions or underestimating China's resolve in asserting what it perceives to be in its national interest.[242] Xi stated during the 20th CCP National Congress that he wanted to ensure China \"leads the world in terms of composite national strength and international influence\" by 2049.[243]\n\n\nXi has promoted \"major-country diplomacy\" (大国外交), stating that China is already a \"big power\" and breaking away from previous Chinese leaders who had a more precautious diplomacy.[244] He has adopted a hawkish foreign policy posture called \"wolf warrior diplomacy\",[245] while his foreign policy thoughts are collectively known as \"Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy\".[246] In March 2021, he said that \"the East is rising and the West is declining\" (东升西降), saying that the power of the Western world was in decline and their COVID-19 response was an example of this, and that China was entering a period of opportunity because of this.[247] Xi has frequently alluded to \"community with a shared future for mankind\", which Chinese diplomats have said doesn't imply an intention to change the international order,[248] but which foreign observers say China wants a new order that puts it more at the centre.[249] Under Xi, China has, along with Russia, also focused on increasing relations with the Global South in order to blunt the effect of Western sanctions.[250]\n\n\nXi has put an emphasis on increasing China's \"international discourse power\" (国际话语权) to create a more favorable global opinion of China in the world.[251] In this pursuit, Xi has emphasised the need to \"tell China's story well\" (讲好中国故事), meaning expanding China's external propaganda (外宣) and communications.[252] Xi has expanded the focus and scope of the united front, which aims to consolidate support for CCP in non-CCP elements both inside and outside China, and has accordingly expanded the United Front Work Department.[253] Xi has unveiled the Global Development Initiative (GDI),[254] the Global Security Initiative (GSI),[255] and the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI), in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, aiming to increase China's influence in the international order.[256]\n\n\n\n#### Security[edit]\n\n\nUnder Xi, China has promoted reformation of the international system, with Xi calling for a \"rejection of hegemonic power structures in global governance\".[257] Addressing a regional conference in Shanghai on 21 May 2014, he called on Asian countries to unite and forge a way together, rather than get involved with third party powers, seen as a reference to the United States. \"Matters in Asia ultimately must be taken care of by Asians. Asia's problems ultimately must be resolved by Asians and Asia's security ultimately must be protected by Asians\", he told the conference.[258] His proposed Global Security Initiative has been aiming to create a new global security architecture, incorporating the term \"indivisible security\", a concept also supported by Russia.[255] He has also advocated for international security cooperation; during a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in September 2021, he spoke out against \"interference in other countries' internal affairs\", and called for joint cooperation in warding off against \"colour revolutions\".[259]\n\n\n\n#### Africa[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sino-African relations\n\nUnder Xi, China has cut back lending to Africa after fears that African countries couldn't repay their debts to China.[260] Xi has also promised that China would write off debts of some African countries.[261] In November 2021, Xi promised African nations 1 billion doses of China's COVID-19 vaccines, which was in addition to the 200 million already supplied before. This has been said to be part of China's vaccine diplomacy.[262]\n\n\n\n#### European Union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–European Union relations\n\n![](image)Xi in an official visit to Warsaw, where he and Poland's president Andrzej Duda signed a declaration on strategic partnership.China's efforts under Xi has been for the European Union (EU) to stay in a neutral position in their contest with the U.S.[263] China and the EU announced the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) in 2020, although the deal was later frozen due to mutual sanctions over Xinjiang.[264] Xi has supported calls for EU to achieve \"strategic autonomy\",[265] and has also called on the EU to view China \"independently\".[266]\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–India relations\n\n![](image)The BRICS leaders in 2023, from left to right: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Xi Jinping, Cyril Ramaphosa, Narendra Modi and Sergey Lavrov (representing Vladimir Putin).\nRelations between China and India had ups and downs under Xi, later deteriorating due to various factors. In 2013, the two countries had a standoff in Depsang for three weeks, which ended with no border change.[267] In 2017, the two countries again had a standoff over a Chinese construction of a road in Doklam, a territory both claimed by Bhutan, India's ally, and China,[268] though by 28 August, both countries mutually disengaged.[269] The most serious crisis in the relationship came when the two countries had a deadly clash in 2020 at the Line of Actual Control, leaving some soldiers dead.[270][271] The clashes created a serious deterioration in relations, with China seizing a small chunk of territory that India controlled.[272]\n\n\n\n#### Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–Japan relations\n\nChina–Japan relations have initially soured under Xi's administration; the most thorny issue between the two countries remains the dispute over the Senkaku islands, which China calls Diaoyu. In response to Japan's continued robust stance on the issue, China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone in November 2013.[273] However, the relations later started to improve, with Xi being invited to visit in 2020,[274] though the trip was later delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[275] In August 2022, Kyodo News reported that Xi personally decided to let ballistic missiles land within Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) during the military exercises held around Taiwan, to send a warning to Japan.[276]\n\n\n\n#### Middle East[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi with Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, 23 January 2016\nWhile China has historically been wary of getting closer to the Middle East countries, Xi has changed this approach.[277] China has grown closer to both Iran and Saudi Arabia under Xi.[277] During a visit to Iran in 2016, Xi proposed a large cooperation program with Iran,[278] a deal that was later signed in 2021.[279] China has also sold ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia and is helping build 7,000 schools in Iraq.[277] In 2013, Xi proposed a peace deal between Israel and Palestine that entails a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.[280] Turkey, with whom relations were long strained over Uyghurs, has also grown closer to China.[281] On 10 March 2023, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to restore diplomatic ties cut in 2016 after a deal brokered between the two countries by China following secret talks in Beijing.[282]\n\n\n\n#### North Korea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–North Korea relations\n\nUnder Xi, China initially took a more critical stance on North Korea due to its nuclear tests.[283] However, starting in 2018, the relations started to improve due to meetings between Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.[284] Xi has also supported denuclearization of North Korea,[285] and has voiced support for economic reforms in the country.[286] At the G20 meeting in Japan, Xi called for a \"timely easing\" of sanctions imposed on North Korea.[287] After the 20th CCP National Congress in 2022, *Rodong Sinmun*, official newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, wrote a long editorial praising Xi, titling both Kim and Xi *Suryong* (수령), a title historically reserved for North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–Russia relations\n\n![](image)Xi with his wife Peng Liyuan during the Moscow Victory Day Parade on 9 May 2015\nXi has cultivated stronger relations with Russia, particularly in the wake of the Ukraine crisis of 2014. He seems to have developed a strong personal relationship with president Vladimir Putin. Both are viewed as strong leaders with a nationalist orientation who are not afraid to assert themselves against Western interests.[289] Xi attended the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Under Xi, China signed a $400 billion gas deal with Russia; China has also become Russia's largest trading partner.[289]\n\n\nXi and Putin met on 4 February 2022 during the run up to the 2022 Beijing Olympics during the massive Russian build-up of force on the Ukrainian border, with the two expressing that the two countries are nearly united in their anti-US alignment and that both nations shared \"no limits\" to their commitments.[290][291] U.S. officials said that China had asked Russia to wait for the invasion of Ukraine until after the Beijing Olympics ended on 20 February.[291] In April 2022, Xi Jinping expressed opposition to sanctions against Russia.[292] On 15 June 2022, Xi Jinping reasserted China's support for Russia on issues of sovereignty and security.[293] However, Xi also said China is committed to respecting \"the territorial integrity of all countries\",[294] and said China was \"pained to see the flames of war reignited in Europe\".[295] China has additionally kept a distance from Russia's actions, instead putting itself as a neutral party.[291] In February 2023, China released a 12-point peace plan to \"settle the acute crisis in Ukraine\"; the plan was praised by Putin but criticized by the U.S. and European countries.[296]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vladimir Putin welcomes Xi in Moscow during Xi's visit to Russia in March 2023\nDuring the war Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given a nuanced take to China,[297] saying that the country has the economic leverage to pressure Putin to end the war, adding \"I'm sure that without the Chinese market for the Russian Federation, Russia would be feeling complete economic isolation. That's something that China can do – to limit the trade [with Russia] until the war is over.\" In August 2022, Zelenskyy said that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Xi Jinping did not respond to his requests for direct talks with him.[298] He additionally said that while he would like China to take a different approach to the war in Ukraine, he also wanted the relationship to improve every year and said that China and Ukraine shared similar values.[299] On 26 April 2023, Zelenskyy and Xi held their first phone call since the start of the war.[300]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–South Korea relations\n\nXi has initially improved relationships with South Korea,[283] and the two countries signed a free-trade agreement in December 2015.[301] Starting in 2017, China's relationship with South Korea soured over the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), a missile defence system, purchase of the latter. which China sees as a threat but which South Korea says is a defence measure against North Korea.[302] Ultimately, South Korea halted the purchase of the THAAD after China imposed unofficial sanctions.[303] China's relations with South Korea improved again under president Moon Jae-in.[304]\n\n\n\n#### Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Philippine President Bongbong Marcos in Bangkok, November 2022\nSince Xi came to power, China has been rapidly building and militarizing islands in the South China Sea, a decision *Study Times* of the Central Party School said was personally taken by Xi.[305] In April 2015, new satellite imagery revealed that China was rapidly constructing an airfield on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea.[306] In November 2014, in a major policy address, Xi called for a decrease in the use of force, preferring dialogue and consultation to solve the current issues plaguing the relationship between China and its South East Asian neighbors.[307]\n\n\n\n#### Taiwan[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cross-Strait relations and Ma–Xi meeting\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping met with then-Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou in November 2015 in their capacity as the leader of mainland China and Taiwan respectively.\nIn 2015, Xi met with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou, which marked the first time the political leaders of both sides of the Taiwan Strait have met since the end of the Chinese Civil War in Mainland China in 1950.[308] Xi said that China and Taiwan are \"one family\" that cannot be pulled apart.[309] However, the relations started deteriorating after Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016.[310]\n\n\nIn the 19th Party Congress held in 2017, Xi reaffirmed six of the nine principles that had been affirmed continuously since the 16th Party Congress in 2002, with the notable exception of \"Placing hopes on the Taiwan people as a force to help bring about unification\".[311] According to the Brookings Institution, Xi used stronger language on potential Taiwan independence than his predecessors towards previous DPP governments in Taiwan.[311] He said that \"we will never allow any person, any organisation, or any political party to split any part of the Chinese territory from China at any time at any form.\"[311] In March 2018, Xi said that Taiwan would face the \"punishment of history\" for any attempts at separatism.[312]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Xi Jinping called on Taiwan to reject its formal independence from China, saying: \"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means.\" Those options, he said, could be used against \"external interference\". Xi also said that they \"are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities.\"[313][314] President Tsai responded to the speech by saying Taiwan would not accept a one country, two systems arrangement with the mainland, while stressing the need for all cross-strait negotiations to be on a government-to-government basis.[315]\n\n\nIn 2022, after the Chinese military exercises around Taiwan, the PRC published a white paper called \"The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era\", which was the first white paper regards to Taiwan since 2000.[316] The paper urged Taiwan to become a special administrative region of the PRC under the one country two systems formula,[316] and said that \"a small number of countries, the U.S. foremost amongst them\" are \"using Taiwan to contain China\".[317] Notably, the new white paper excluded a part that previously said the PRC would not send troops or officials to Taiwan after unification.[317]\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–United States relations\n\n![](image)U.S. president Donald Trump arrives in China, 8 November 2017Xi has called China–United States relations in the contemporary world a \"new type of great-power relations\", a phrase the Obama administration had been reluctant to embrace.[318] Under his administration the U.S.–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue that began under Hu Jintao has continued, until it was suspended by the administration of Donald Trump.[319] On China–U.S. relations, Xi said, \"If [China and the United States] are in confrontation, it would surely spell disaster for both countries\".[320] The U.S. has been critical of Chinese actions in the South China Sea.[318] In 2014, Chinese hackers compromised the computer system of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management,[321] resulting in the theft of approximately 22 million personnel records handled by the office.[322] Xi has also indirectly spoken out critically on the U.S. \"strategic pivot\" to Asia.[323]\nRelations with the U.S. soured after Donald Trump became president in 2017.[324] Since 2018, U.S. and China have been engaged in an escalating trade war.[325] In 2020, the relations further deteriorated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[326] In 2021, Xi has called the U.S. the biggest threat to China's development, saying that \"the biggest source of chaos in the present-day world is the United States\".[247] Xi has also scrapped a previous policy in which China did not challenge the U.S. in most instances, while Chinese officials said that they now see China as an \"equal\" to the U.S.[327] On 6 March 2023, during a speech to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Xi said that \"Western countries—led by the U.S.—have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression\" against China, which he said brought \"unprecedentedly severe challenges to our country's development\".[328]\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping with U.S. President Joe Biden at the margins of the 2022 G20 Bali summit\n#### Economic relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Belt and Road Initiative\n![](image)Countries that signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was unveiled by Xi in September and October 2013 during visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia,[329] and was thereafter promoted by Premier Li Keqiang during state visits to Asia and Europe. Xi made the announcement for the initiative while in Astana, Kazakhstan, and called it a \"golden opportunity\".[330] BRI has been called Xi's \"signature project\", involving numerous infrastructure development and investment projects throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas.[331] BRI was added to the CCP Constitution at the closing session of the 19th Party Congress on 24 October 2017,[332] further elevating its importance.[333] Since the BRI was launched, China became the world's largest lender, lending about $1 trillion in a decade to almost 150 countries. However, by 2022, many BRI projects have stalled, and most of China's debt became held by countries in financial distress, leading the Chinese leaders to adopt a more conservative approach to BRI, dubbed as \"Belt and Road Initiative 2.0\".[334]\n\n\nXi officially proposed the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in October 2013 during a visit to Indonesia,[335] which officially launched in January 2016.[336] The membership of the AIIB has included numerous countries, including allies of the United States and Western countries, despite opposition from the US.[336] Since its launch until 2022, AIIB has invested $36.43 billion to 190 projects.[337] Xi's tenure has seen a signing of several free-trade deals, including with Australia in 2014,[338] South Korea in 2015,[301] and the larger Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2020.[339] Xi has also expressed his interest in China joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), with China formally applying to join in September 2021.[340]\n\n\n\n### National security[edit]\n\n\nXi has devoted a large amount of work towards national security, calling for a \"holistic national security architecture\" that encompasses \"all aspects of the work of the party and the country\".[341] During a private talk with U.S. president Obama and vice president Biden, he said that China had been a target of \"colour revolutions\", foreshadowing his focus on national security.[342] Since its creation by Xi, the National Security Commission has established local security committees, focusing on dissent.[342] In the name of national security, Xi's government has passed numerous laws including a counterespionage law in 2014,[343] national security[344] and a counterterrorism law in 2015,[345] a cybersecurity law[346] and a law restricting foreign NGOs in 2016,[347] a national intelligence law in 2017,[348] and a data security law in 2021.[349] Under Xi, China's mass surveillance network has dramatically grown, with comprehensive profiles being built for each citizen.[350]\n\n\n\n### Hong Kong[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hong Kong protesters throw eggs at Xi Jinping's portrait on National DayDuring his leadership, Xi has supported and pursued a greater political and economic integration of Hong Kong to mainland China, including through projects such as the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge.[351] He has pushed for the Greater Bay Area project, which aims to integrate Hong Kong, Macau, and nine other cities in Guangdong.[351] Xi's push for greater integration has created fears of decreasing freedoms in Hong Kong.[352] Many of the views held by the central government and eventually implemented in Hong Kong were outlined in a white paper published by the State Council in 2014 named *The Practice of the 'One Country, Two Systems' Policy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region*, which outlined that the China's central government has \"comprehensive jurisdiction\" over Hong Kong.[353] Under Xi, the Chinese government also declared the Sino-British Joint Declaration to be legally void.[353]\n\n\nIn August 2014, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) made a decision allowing universal suffrage for the 2017 election of the chief executive of Hong Kong, but also requiring the candidates to \"love the country, and love Hong Kong\", as well as other measures that ensured the Chinese leadership would be the ultimate decision-maker on the selection, leading to protests,[354] and the eventual rejection of the reform bill in the Legislative Council due to a walk-out by the pro-Beijing camp to delay to vote.[355] In the 2017 chief executive election, Carrie Lam was victorious, reportedly with the endorsement of the CCP Politburo.[356]\n\n\n\nXi has supported the Hong Kong Government and Carrie Lam against the protesters in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, which broke out after a proposed bill that would allow extraditions to China.[357] He has defended the Hong Kong police's use of force, saying that \"We sternly support the Hong Kong police to take forceful actions in enforcing the law, and the Hong Kong judiciary to punish in accordance with the law those who have committed violent crimes.\"[358] While visiting Macau on 20 December 2019 as part of the 20th anniversary of its return to China, Xi warned of foreign forces interfering in Hong Kong and Macau,[359] while also hinting that Macau could be a model for Hong Kong to follow.[360]\n\n![](image)Xi swearing in John Lee as chief executive during the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China\nIn 2020, the NPCSC passed a national security law in Hong Kong that dramatically expanded government clampdown over the opposition in the city; amongst the measures were the dramatic restriction on political opposition and the creation of a central government office outside Hong Kong jurisdiction to oversee the enforcement of the law.[353] This was seem as the culmination of a long-term project under Xi to further closely integrate Hong Kong with the mainland.[353] Xi visited Hong Kong as president in 2017 and 2022, in the 20th and 25th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong respectively.[361] In his 2022 visit, he swore in John Lee as chief executive, a former police officer that was backed by the Chinese government to expand control over the city.[362][363] While in the city, he said Hong Kong had moved from \"chaos\" to \"stability\".[364] Since John Lee became chief executive, Hong Kong government officials including Lee himself have shown public displays of loyalty towards Xi, similar to the mainland but previously unheard in the city.[365]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human rights in China, Uyghur genocide, and Antireligious campaigns in China\n\nAccording to the Human Rights Watch, Xi has \"started a broad and sustained offensive on human rights\" since he became leader in 2012.[366] The HRW also said that repression in China is \"at its worst level since the Tiananmen Square massacre.\"[367] Since taking power, Xi has cracked down on grassroots activism, with hundreds being detained.[368] He presided over the 709 crackdown on 9 July 2015, which saw more than 200 lawyers, legal assistants and human rights activists being detained.[369] His term has seen the arrest and imprisonment of activists such as Xu Zhiyong, as well as numerous others who identified with the New Citizens' Movement. Prominent legal activist Pu Zhiqiang of the Weiquan movement was also arrested and detained.[370]\n\n\nIn 2017, the local government of the Jiangxi province told Christians to replace their pictures of Jesus with Xi Jinping as part of a general campaign on unofficial churches in the country.[371][372][373] According to local social media, officials \"transformed them from believing in religion to believing in the party\".[371] According to activists, \"Xi is waging the most severe systematic suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982\", and according to pastors and a group that monitors religion in China, has involved \"destroying crosses, burning bibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith\".[374]\n\n\nUnder Xi, the CCP has embraced assimilationist policies towards ethnic minorities, scaling back affirmative action in the country by 2019,[375] and scrapping a wording in October 2021 that guaranteed the rights of minority children to be educated in their native language, replacing it with one that emphasized teaching the national language.[376] In 2020, Chen Xiaojiang was appointed as head of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission, the first Han Chinese head of the body since 1954.[377] On 24 June 2022, Pan Yue, another Han Chinese, became the head of the commission, with him reportedly holding assimilationist policies toward ethnic minorities.[378] Xi outlined his official views relations between the majority Han Chinese and ethnic minorities by saying \"[n]either Han chauvinism nor local ethnic chauvinism is conducive to the development of a community for the Chinese nation\".[379]\n\n\n\n#### Xinjiang[edit]\n\n\nFollowing several terrorist attacks in Xinjiang in 2013 and 2014, the CCP leaders held a secret meeting to find a solution to the attacks,[380] leading to Xi to launch the Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism in 2014, which involved mass detention, and surveillance of ethnic Uyghurs there.[381][382] Xi made an inspection tour in Xinjiang between 27 and 30 April in 2014.[383] The program was massively expanded in 2016, after the appointment of Chen Quanguo as the Xinjiang CCP secretary. The campaign included the detainment of 1.8 million people in internment camps, mostly Uyghurs but also including other ethnic and religious minorities, by 2020,[380] and a birth suppression campaign that led to a large drop in the Uyghur birth rate by 2019.[384] Various human rights groups and former inmates have described the camps as \"concentration camps\", where Uyghurs and other minorities have been forcibly assimilated into China's majority ethnic Han society.[385] This program has been called a genocide by some observers, while a report by the UN Human Rights Office said they may amount to crimes against humanity.[386][387]\n\n\nInternal Chinese government documents leaked to the press in November 2019 showed that Xi personally ordered a security crackdown in Xinjiang, saying that the party must show \"absolutely no mercy\" and that officials use all the \"weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship\" to suppress those \"infected with the virus of extremism\".[382][388] The papers also showed that Xi repeatedly discussed about Islamic extremism in his speeches, likening it to a \"virus\" or a \"drug\" that could be only addressed by \"a period of painful, interventionary treatment.\"[382] However, he also warned against the discrimination against Uyghurs and rejected proposals to eradicate Islam in China, calling that kind of viewpoint \"biased, even wrong\".[382] Xi's exact role in the building of internment camps has not been publicly reported, though he's widely believed to be behind them and his words have been the source for major justifications in the crackdown in Xinjiang.[389][390] In the Xinjiang Police Files leaked in 2022, a document quoting Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi suggested that Xi had been aware of the internment camps.[391]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chinese government response to COVID-19 and COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China\nOn 20 January 2020, Xi commented for the first time on the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, and ordered \"efforts to curb the spread\" of the virus.[392] He gave premier Li Keqiang some responsibility over the COVID-19 response, in what has been suggested by *The Wall Street Journal* was an attempt to potentially insulate himself from criticism if the response failed.[393] The government initially responded to the pandemic with a lockdown and censorship, with the initial response causing widespread backlash within China.[394] He met with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), on 28 January.[395] *Der Spiegel* reported that in January 2020 Xi pressured Tedros Adhanom to hold off on issuing a global warning about the outbreak of COVID-19 and hold back information on human-to-human transmission of the virus, allegations denied by the WHO.[396] On 5 February, Xi met with Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen in Beijing, the first foreign leader allowed into China since the outbreak.[395] After the COVID-19 outbreak got under control in Wuhan, Xi visited the city on 10 March.[397]\n\n\n![](image)Italian president Sergio Mattarella with Xi in March 2019\nAfter getting the outbreak in Wuhan under control, Xi has favoured what has officially been termed \"dynamic zero-COVID policy\"[398] that aims to control and suppress the virus as much as possible within the country's borders. This has involved local lockdowns and mass-testing.[399] While initially credited for China's suppression of the COVID-19 outbreak, the policy was later criticized by foreign and some domestic observers for being out of touch with the rest of the world and taking a heavy toll on the economy.[399] This approach has especially come under criticism during a 2022 lockdown on Shanghai, which forced millions to their homes and damaged the city's economy,[400] denting the image of Li Qiang, close Xi ally and Party secretary of the city.[401] Conversely, Xi has said that the policy was designed to protect people's life safety.[402] On 23 July 2022, the National Health Commission reported that Xi and other top leaders have taken the local COVID-19 vaccines.[403]\n\n\nAt the 20th CCP Congress, Xi confirmed the continuation of the zero-COVID policy,[404] stating he would \"unswervingly\" carry out \"dynamic zero-COVID\" and promising to \"resolutely win the battle,\"[405] though China started a limited easing of the policies in the following weeks.[406] In November 2022, protests broke out against China's COVID-19 policies, with a fire in a high-rise apartment building in Ürümqi being the trigger.[407] The protests were held in multiple major cities, with some of the protesters demanding the end of Xi's and the CCP's rule.[407] The protests were mostly suppressed by December,[407] though the government further eased COVID-19 restrictions in the time since.[408] On 7 December 2022, China announced large-scale changes to its COVID-19 policy, including allowing quarantine at home for mild infections, reducing of PCR testing, and decreasing the power of local officials to implement lockdowns.[409]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental policy in China\n\nIn September 2020, Xi announced that China will \"strengthen its 2030 climate target (NDC), peak emissions before 2030 and aim to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060\".[410] If accomplished, this would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2–0.3 °C – \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\".[410] Xi mentioned the link between the COVID-19 pandemic and nature destruction as one of the reasons for the decision, saying that \"Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature.\"[411] On 27 September, Chinese scientists presented a detailed plan how to achieve the target.[412] In September 2021, Xi announced that China will not build \"coal-fired power projects abroad, which was said to be potentially \"pivotal\" in reducing emissions. The Belt and Road Initiative did not include financing such projects already in the first half of 2021.[413]\n\n\nXi Jinping did not attend COP26 personally. However, a Chinese delegation led by climate change envoy Xie Zhenhua did attend.[414][415] During the conference, the United States and China agreed on a framework to reduce GHG emission by co-operating on different measures.[416]\n\n\n\n### Governance style[edit]\n\n\nKnown as a very secretive leader, little is known publicly about how Xi makes political decisions, or how he came to power.[417][418] Xi's speeches generally get released months or years after they are made.[417] Xi has also never given a press conference since becoming paramount leader, except in rare joint press conferences with foreign leaders.[417][419] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Xi prefers micromanaging in governance, in contrast to previous leaders such as Hu Jintao who left details of major policies to lower-ranking officials.[84] Reportedly, ministerial officials try to get Xi's attention in various ways, with some creating slide shows and audio reports. *The Wall Street Journal* also reported that Xi created a performance-review system in 2018 to give evaluations on officials on various measures, including loyalty.[84] According to *The Economist*, Xi's orders have generally been vague, leaving lower level officials to interpret his words.[389] Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency said that Xi \"personally reviews every draft of major policy documents\" and \"all reports submitted to him, no matter how late in the evening, were returned with instructions the following morning\".[420] With regard to behavior of Communist Party members, Xi emphasizes the \"Two Musts\" (members must not be arrogant or rash and must keep their hard-working spirit) and the \"Six Nos\" (members must say no to formalism, bureaucracy, gift-giving, luxurious birthday celebrations, hedonism, and extravagance).[175]: 52 Xi called for officials to practice self-criticism which, according to observers, is in order to appear less corrupt and more popular among the people.[421][422][423]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ideology of the Chinese Communist Party\n\n### Chinese Dream[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chinese Dream\n\n![](image)According to *Qiushi*, the Chinese Dream is about Chinese prosperity, collective effort, socialism, and national glory.\nXi and CCP ideologues coined the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" to describe his overarching plans for China as its leader. Xi first used the phrase during a high-profile visit to the National Museum of China on 29 November 2012, where he and his Standing Committee colleagues were attending a \"national revival\" exhibition. Since then, the phrase has become the signature political slogan of the Xi era.[424][425] The origin of the term \"Chinese Dream\" is unclear. While the phrase has been used before by journalists and scholars,[426] some publications have posited the term likely drew its inspiration from the concept of the American Dream.[427] *The Economist* noted the abstract and seemingly accessible nature of the concept with no specific overarching policy stipulations may be a deliberate departure from the jargon-heavy ideologies of his predecessors.[428] Xi has linked the \"Chinese Dream\" with the phrase \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".[429][e]\n\n\n\n### Cultural revival[edit]\n\n\nIn recent years, top political leaders of the CCP such as Xi have overseen the rehabilitation of ancient Chinese philosophical figures like Han Fei into the mainstream of Chinese thought alongside Confucianism. At a meeting with other officials in 2013, he quoted Confucius, saying \"he who rules by virtue is like the Pole Star, it maintains its place, and the multitude of stars pay homage.\" While visiting Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius, in November, he told scholars that the Western world was \"suffering a crisis of confidence\" and that the CCP has been \"the loyal inheritor and promoter of China's outstanding traditional culture.\"[430]\n\n\nAccording to several analysts, Xi's leadership has been characterised by a resurgence of the ancient political philosophy Legalism.[431][432][433] Han Fei gained new prominence with favourable citations; one sentence of Han Fei's that Xi quoted appeared thousands of times in official Chinese media at the local, provincial, and national levels.[433] Xi has additionally supported the Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming, telling local leaders to promote him.[434]\n\n\nXi has also overseen a revival of traditional Chinese culture, breaking from the CCP's previous path, which had often attacked it.[435] He has called traditional culture the \"soul\" of the nation and the \"foundation\" of the CCP's culture.[436] Xi has also called for integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China's traditional culture.[256] Hanfu, the traditional dress of Han Chinese, has seen a revival under him, associated with the revival of traditional culture.[437] He has established the \"four matters of confidence\", which has later been added to the CCP constitution, calling for CCP members, government officials and the Chinese people to be \"confident in our chosen path, confident in our guiding theories, confident in our political system, and confident in our culture\". He has unveiled Global Civilisation initiative in 2023, calling for \"respecting the diversity of civilisations, advocating the common values of humanity, valuing the inheritance and innovation of civilisations, and strengthening international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation\"[256]\n\n\n\n### Ideology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eight-point Regulation\n\nXi has said that \"only socialism can save China\".[438] Xi has also declared socialism with Chinese characteristics to be the \"only correct path to realize national rejuvenation\".[439] According to BBC News, while the CCP was perceived to have abandoned its communist ideology since it initiated economic reforms in the 1970s, Xi is believed by some observers to be more believing in the \"idea of a communist project\",[440] being described as a Marxist–Leninist by former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd.[441] Xi's emphasis on prioritizing ideology has included re-asserting the Party's goal of eventually realizing communism and reprimanding those who dismiss communism as impractical or irrelevant.[163] Xi described the communist ideal as the \"calcium\" in a Party member's spine, without which the Party member would suffer the \"osteoporosis\" of political decay and be unable to stand upright.[163]\n\n\nSubscribing to the view that socialism will eventually triumph over capitalism, Xi has said \"Marx and Engels's analysis of the basic contradictions of capitalist society is not outdated, nor is the historical materialist view that capitalism is bound to die out and socialism bound to win\".[442] Xi has overseen the increase of \"Socialist Political Economy With Chinese Characteristics\" as a major study topic for academics in China, aiming to decrease the influence of Western-influenced economics.[442] Though he has called a stop to what he considers to be \"disorderly expansion of capital\", he has also said that \"it is necessary to stimulate the vitality of capital of all types, including nonpublic capital, and give full play to its positive role\".[442]\n\n\n\n> \n> China's success proves that socialism is not dead. It is thriving. Just imagine this: had socialism failed in China, had our communist party collapsed like the party in the Soviet Union, then global socialism would lapse into a long dark age. And communism, like Karl Marx once said, would be a haunting spectre lingering in limbo.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Xi Jinping during a speech in 2018[443]\n\nXi has supported greater CCP control over the PRC, saying \"government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west – the party leads them all\".[444] During the 100th anniversary of the CCP in 2021, he said that \"without the Communist Party of China, there would be no new China and no national rejuvenation\", and that \"the leadership of the Party is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and constitutes the greatest strength of this system\".[445] He has said that China, despite many setbacks, has achieved great progress under the CCP, saying that \"socialism with Chinese characteristics has become the standard-bearer of 21st-century socialist development\".[443] However, he has also warned that it will take a long time for China under the CCP to complete its rejuvenation, and during this timeframe, party members must be vigilant to not let CCP rule collapse.[443]\n\n\nXi has ruled out a multi-party system for China, saying that \"constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentarism, a multi-party system and a presidential system, we considered them, tried them, but none worked\".[446] However, Xi considers China to be a democracy, saying that \"China's socialist democracy is the most comprehensive, genuine and effective democracy\".[447] China's definition of democracy is different from liberal democracies and is rooted in Marxism–Leninism, and is based on the phrases \"people's democratic dictatorship\" and \"democratic centralism\".[447] Xi has additionally coined the term \"whole-process people's democracy\" which he said was about having \"the people as masters\".[448] Foreign analysts and observers have widely disputed that China is a democracy, saying that it is a one-party authoritarian state and Xi an authoritarian leader.[455] Some observers, including German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock,[456] have called Xi a dictator, citing the large centralisation of power around him unseen compared to his predecessors.[457][458] Xi has additionally rejected Westernisation as the only way to modernize, instead promoting what he says is \"Chinese-style modernisation\".[459] He has identified five concepts as part of Chinese-style modernisation, including modernisation of a huge population, common prosperity, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development.[460]\n\n\n\n#### Xi Jinping Thought[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping Thought\n\n![](image)A billboard promoting Xi Jinping Thought in Shenzhen\nIn September 2017, the CCP Central Committee decided that Xi's political philosophies, generally referred to as \"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\", would become part of the Party Constitution.[461][462] Xi first made mention of the \"Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\" in his opening day speech delivered to the 19th Party Congress in October 2017. His Politburo Standing Committee colleagues, in their own reviews of Xi's keynote address at the Congress, prepended the name \"Xi Jinping\" in front of \"Thought\".[463] On 24 October 2017, at its closing session, the 19th Party Congress approved the incorporation of Xi Jinping Thought into the Constitution of the CCP,[104] while in March 2018, the National People's Congress changed the state constitution to include Xi Jinping Thought.[464]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Governance of China* in different languages presented at Shanghai Library\nXi himself has described the Thought as part of the broad framework created around socialism with Chinese characteristics, a term coined by Deng Xiaoping that places China in the primary stage of socialism. In official party documentation and pronouncements by Xi's colleagues, the Thought is said to be a continuation of Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, as part of a series of guiding ideologies that embody \"Marxism adopted to Chinese conditions\" and contemporary considerations.[463] It has additionally been described as the \"21st century Marxism\" by two professors in the Central Party School of the CCP.[16] Wang Huning, a top political adviser and a close ally of Xi, has been described as pivotal to developing Xi Jinping Thought.[16] The concepts and context behind Xi Jinping Thought are elaborated in Xi's *The Governance of China* book series, published by the Foreign Languages Press for an international audience. Volume one was published in September 2014, followed by volume two in November 2017.[465]\n\n\nAn app for teaching Xi Jinping Thought had become the most popular smartphone app in China in 2019, as the country's ruling CCP launched a new campaign that calls on its cadres to immerse themselves in the political doctrine every day. *Xuexi Qiangguo* is now the most downloaded item on Apple's domestic App Store, surpassing in demand social media apps such as WeChat and TikTok.[466] In 2021, the government included Xi Jinping Thought in the curriculum including to students from primary schools to university, which created pushback from parents. For much of the preceding 30 years, political ideology and communist doctrine were not a standard taught in Chinese schools until middle school, and textbooks featured a wider set of Chinese leaders with less emphasis on a single leader like Xi.[467]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping, Peng Liyuan and U.S. president Barack Obama in the Lincoln Bedroom\nXi's first marriage was to Ke Lingling, the daughter of Ke Hua, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s. They divorced within a few years.[468] The two were said to fight \"almost every day\", and after the divorce Ke moved to England.[8] In 1987, Xi married the prominent Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan.[469] Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques.[470] Peng Liyuan, a household name in China, was better known to the public than Xi until his political elevation. The couple frequently lived apart due largely to their separate professional lives. Peng has played a much more visible role as China's \"first lady\" compared to her predecessors; for example, Peng hosted U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama on her high-profile visit to China in March 2014.[471]\n\n\nXi and Peng have a daughter named Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University in the spring of 2015. While at Harvard, she used a pseudonym and studied Psychology and English.[472] Xi's family has a home in Jade Spring Hill, a garden and residential area in north-western Beijing run by the CMC.[473]\n\n\nIn June 2012, *Bloomberg News* reported that members of Xi's extended family have substantial business interests, although there was no evidence he had intervened to assist them.[474] The *Bloomberg* website was blocked in mainland China in response to the article.[475] Since Xi embarked on an anti-corruption campaign, *The New York Times* reported members of his family were selling their corporate and real estate investments beginning in 2012.[476] Relatives of highly placed Chinese officials, including seven current and former senior leaders of the Politburo of the CCP, have been named in the Panama Papers, including Deng Jiagui,[477] Xi's brother-in-law. Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became general secretary of the CCP in November 2012.[478]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\nPeng described Xi as hardworking and down-to-earth: \"When he comes home, I've never felt as if there's some leader in the house. In my eyes, he's just my husband.\"[479] In 1992, *The Washington Post* journalist Lena H. Sun had an interview with Xi, then CCP secretary of Fuzhou; Sun described Xi as considerably more at ease and confident than many officials his age, and said that he talked without consulting notes.[480] He was described in a 2011 *The Washington Post* article by those who know him as \"pragmatic, serious, cautious, hard-working, down to earth and low-key\". He was described as a good hand at problem solving and \"seemingly uninterested in the trappings of high office\".[481]\n\n\n\n## Public life[edit]\n\n\nIt is hard to gauge the opinion of the Chinese public on Xi, as no independent surveys exist in China and social media is heavily censored.[482] However, he is believed to be widely popular in the country.[483][484] According to a 2014 poll co-sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, Xi ranked 9 out of 10 in domestic approval ratings.[485] A YouGov poll released in July 2019 found that about 22% of people in mainland China list Xi as the person they admire the most, a plurality, although this figure was less than 5% for residents of Hong Kong.[486] In the spring of 2019, the Pew Research Center made a survey on confidence on Xi Jinping among six-country medians based on Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines and South Korea, which indicated that a median 29% have confidence in Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs, meanwhile a median of 45% have no confidence; these numbers are slightly higher than those of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (23% confidence, 53% no confidence).[487] A poll by Politico and Morning Consult in 2021 found that 5% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Xi, 38% unfavorable, 17% no opinion and 40%, a plurality, never hearing of him.[488]\n\n\nIn 2017, *The Economist* named him the most powerful person in the world.[489] In 2018, *Forbes* ranked him as the most powerful and influential person in the world, replacing Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been ranked so for five consecutive years.[490] Since 2013, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Xi among the list of press freedom predators.[491]\n\n\nUnlike previous Chinese leaders, Chinese state media has given a more encompassing view of Xi's private life, although still strictly controlled. According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi would swim one kilometer and walk every day as long as there was time, and is interested in foreign writers, especially Russian.[420] He is known to love films and TV shows such as *Saving Private Ryan*, *The Departed,* *The Godfather* and *Game of Thrones,*[492][493][494] also praising the independent film-maker Jia Zhangke.[495] The Chinese state media has also cast him as a fatherly figure and a man of the people, determined to stand up for Chinese interests.[418]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Decoration\n | Country/Organisation\n | Date\n | Note\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | The Golden Olympic Order | ![](image) International Olympic Committee | 19 November 2013\n | The highest award of the Olympic movement\n | [496] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold | ![](image) Belgium | 30 March 2014\n | The highest order of Belgium\n | [497] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of the Liberator | ![](image) Venezuela | 20 July 2014\n | The highest order of Venezuela\n | [498] |\n| ![](image) | Order of José Martí | ![](image) Cuba | 22 July 2014\n | Order of Cuba\n | [499] |\n| ![](image) | Nishan-e-Pakistan | ![](image) Pakistan | 21 April 2015\n | The highest civilian award of Pakistan\n | [500] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Abdulaziz al Saud | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 19 January 2016\n | Saudi Arabian order of merit\n | [501] |\n| ![](image) | Collar of the Order of the Republic of Serbia | ![](image) Serbia | 18 June 2016\n | The highest state order of Serbia\n | [502] |\n| ![](image) | Order for Promotion of Peace and Friendship | ![](image) Belarus | 29 September 2016\n | Order of Belarus\n | [503] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross Medal of Honor\n | ![](image) Peru | 21 November 2016\n | Medal of Peru\n | [504] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Saint Andrew | ![](image) Russia | 3 July 2017\n | The highest order of Russia\n | [505] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Collar of the State of Palestine | ![](image) Palestine | 18 July 2017\n | The highest civilian order of Palestine\n | [506] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Zayed | ![](image) United Arab Emirates | 20 July 2018\n | The highest civilian decoration of the United Arab Emirates\n | [507] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion | ![](image) Senegal | 29 July 2018\n | Order of Senegal\n | [508] |\n| ![](image) | Collar of the Order of the Liberator General San Martin | ![](image) Argentina | 2 December 2018\n | Order of Argentina\n | [509] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Manas | ![](image) Kyrgyzstan | 13 June 2019\n | The highest order of Kyrgyzstan\n | [510] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Crown | ![](image) Tajikistan | 15 June 2019\n | Order of Tajikistan\n | [511] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Golden Eagle | ![](image) Kazakhstan | 14 September 2022\n | The highest order of Kazakhstan\n | [512] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Friendship | ![](image) Uzbekistan | 15 September 2022\n | State award of Uzbekistan\n | [513] |\n|  | Order of South Africa | ![](image) South Africa | 22 August 2023\n | State award of South Africa\n | [514] |\n\n\n### Key to the City[edit]\n\n\nXi holds a \"key to the city\", an honor granted to attending guests to symbolize their significance, in:\n\n\n\n* ![](image)![Iowa](image) Muscatine, Iowa, United States (26 April 1985)[515][516]\n* ![](image) Montego Bay, Jamaica (13 February 2009)[48]\n* ![](image)![](image) Muscatine, Iowa, United States (14 February 2012)[515]\n* ![](image)![](image) San José, Costa Rica (3 June 2013)[517]\n* ![](image)![](image) Mexico City, Mexico (5 June 2013)[518]\n* ![](image)![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina (19 July 2014)[519]\n* ![](image)![](image) Prague, Czech Republic (29 March 2016)[520]\n* ![](image)![Madrid](image) Madrid, Spain (28 November 2018)[521]\n\n\n### Honorary doctorates[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Nazarbayev University (7 September 2013)[522]\n* ![](image) University of Johannesburg (11 April 2019)[523]\n* ![](image) Saint Petersburg State University (6 June 2019)[524]\n* ![](image) King Saud University (8 December 2022)[525]\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* Xi, Jinping (1999). *Theory and Practice on Modern Agriculture*.

Xi has also served as the president of the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 2013. He belongs to the fifth generation of Chinese leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This article is part of a series about\nXi Jinping |\n\n |\n| * **Xi Jinping Administration**\n* 2012 election as General Secretary\n* 2017 reelection as General Secretary\n* 2022 reelection as General Secretary\n* New Zhijiang Army\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nPolicies and theories\n* Belt and Road Initiative\n* Chinese Dream\n* Common prosperity\n* Four Confidences\n* Four Comprehensives\n* Comprehensively Deepening Reforms\n* Chinese-style modernization\n* Foreign policy\n* Eight Musts\n* Eight-point Regulation\n* New productive forces\n* Targeted Poverty Alleviation\n* Two Establishes and Two Upholds\n* Xi Jinping Thought\n\t+ Culture\n\t+ Diplomacy\n* Holistic security concept\n* Personality cult\n* Party media takes the party's last name\n* Three Stricts and Three Honests\n* Two Centenaries\n* Wolf warrior diplomacy\n* Whole-process people's democracy\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nKey events\n* Anti-corruption campaign\n* 709 crackdown\n* Persecution of Uyghurs in China\n\t+ Xinjiang internment camps\n* China–US trade war\n* 2019–20 Hong Kong protests\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n\t+ Response\n* CCP centenary\n* Historical resolution\n* 2020–2021 reform spree\n* 2022 Hong Kong visit\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nDiplomatic activities\n* Xi–Chu meeting\n* Xi–Ma Meeting\n* Xi–Kim meetings\n* 2015 Pakistan visit\n* 2015 United States visit\n* 2015 United Kingdom visit\n* 2019 Italy and France visit\n* CPC and World Political Parties Summit\n* 2023 Russia visit\n* 2024 France, Serbia and Hungary visit\n\n\n\n---\n\n* *Speech series*\n* *Governance of China*\n\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| ![](image)　![](image)![](image) |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran Xi Zhongxun, Xi was exiled to rural Yanchuan County as a teenager following his father's purge during the Cultural Revolution. He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the Central Secretariat in October 2007. In 2008, he was designated as Hu Jintao's presumed successor as paramount leader; to that end, Xi was appointed vice president of the PRC and vice chairman of the CMC. He officially received the title of leadership core from the CCP in 2016.\n\n\nXi is the first CCP general secretary born after the establishment of the PRC. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China's relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. He has also promoted \"common prosperity\", a series of policies designed with stated goal to increase equality, and used the term to justify a broad crackdown and major slew of regulations against the tech and tutoring sectors in 2021. Xi met with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou in 2015, the first time PRC and Republic of China leaders met, though relations deteriorated after Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016. He responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China with a zero-COVID approach from January 2020 until December 2022, afterwards shifting towards a mitigation strategy. Xi also oversaw the passage of a national security law in Hong Kong, clamping down on political opposition in the city, especially pro-democracy activists.\n\n\nOften described as an authoritarian leader by political and academic observers, Xi's tenure has included an increase of censorship and mass surveillance, deterioration in human rights, including the internment of one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang (which some observers have described as part of a genocide), a cult of personality developing around Xi, and the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Xi's political ideas and principles, known as Xi Jinping Thought, have been incorporated into the party and national constitutions, and he has emphasized the importance of national security and the need for CCP leadership over the country. As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including chairing the National Security Commission and new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. He and the CCP Central Committee passed a \"historical resolution\" in November 2021, the third such resolution after Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, the second leader of the CCP to do so after Mao, and in March 2023 was reelected state president for a third term, the first head of state to be so.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nXi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953,[2] the third child of Xi Zhongxun and his second wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (安安; *Ān'ān*), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nXi went to the Beijing Bayi School,[7][8] and then the Beijing No. 25 School,[9] in the 1960s. He became friends with Liu He, who attended Beijing No. 101 School in the same district, who later became China's vice premier and a close advisor to Xi after he became China's paramount leader.[10][11] In 1963, when he was aged 10, his father was purged from the CCP and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan.[12] In May 1966, the Cultural Revolution cut short Xi's secondary education when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. Student militants ransacked the Xi family home and one of Xi's sisters, Xi Heping, committed suicide from the pressure.[13]\n\n\nLater, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement.[14] He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house.[15] According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor.[16] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but he later returned to the village. He then spent a total of seven years there.[17][18]\n\n\nThe misfortunes and suffering of his family in his early years hardened Xi's view of politics. During an interview in 2000, he said, \"People who have little contact with power, who are far from it, always see these things as mysterious and novel. But what I see is not just the superficial things: the power, the flowers, the glory, the applause. I see the bullpens and how people can blow hot and cold. I understand politics on a deeper level.\" The \"bullpens\" (牛棚) was a reference to Red Guards' detention houses during the Cultural Revolution.[16]\n\n\nAfter seven rejections, Xi joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1971 on his eighth attempt after he befriended a local official.[8] He reunited with his father in 1972, because of a family reunion ordered by premier Zhou Enlai.[13] From 1973, he applied to join the CCP ten times and was finally accepted on his tenth attempt in 1974.[19][20][21] From 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student in Beijing. The engineering majors there spent about 15 percent of their time studying Marxism–Leninism–Maoism and 5 percent of their time doing farm work and \"learning from the People's Liberation Army\".[22]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1979 to 1982, Xi served as secretary for his father's former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and secretary-general of the CMC.[8] In 1982, he was sent to Zhengding County in Hebei as deputy party secretary of Zhengding County. He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county.[23] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982–1985), Fujian (1985–2002), Zhejiang (2002–2007), and Shanghai (2007).[24] Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.[b][25]\n\n\nFrom 1998 to 2002, Xi studied Marxist theory and ideological education in Tsinghua University,[26] graduating with a doctorate in law and ideology in 2002.[27] In 1999, he was promoted to the office of Vice Governor of Fujian, and became governor a year later. In Fujian, Xi made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to strengthen the private sector of the provincial economy.[28] In February 2000, he and then-provincial party secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top members of PSC – general secretary Jiang Zemin, premier Zhu Rongji, vice president Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection secretary Wei Jianxing – to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.[29]\n\n\nIn 2002, Xi left Fujian and took up leading political positions in neighbouring Zhejiang. He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year.[30] His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders.[31] Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi's chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.[32]\n\n\nFollowing the dismissal of Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, Xi was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007, where he was the party secretary there for seven months.[33][34] In Shanghai, Xi avoided controversy and was known for strictly observing party discipline. For example, Shanghai administrators attempted to earn favour with him by arranging a special train to shuttle him between Shanghai and Hangzhou for him to complete handing off his work to his successor as Zhejiang party secretary Zhao Hongzhu. However, Xi reportedly refused to take the train, citing a loosely enforced party regulation that stipulated that special trains can only be reserved for \"national leaders\".[35] While in Shanghai, he worked on preserving unity of the local party organisation. He pledged there would be no 'purges' during his administration, despite the fact many local officials were thought to have been implicated in the Chen Liangyu corruption scandal.[36] On most issues, Xi largely echoed the line of the central leadership.[37]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping greeting U.S. president George W. Bush in August 2008\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev on 28 September 2010\nXi was appointed to the nine-man PSC at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. He was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the first secretary of the CCP's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as vice president of the PRC.[38] Following his elevation, Xi held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new president of the Central Party School of the CCP, its cadre-training and ideological education wing. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. He made his first foreign trip as vice president to North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008.[39] After the Olympics, Xi was assigned the post of committee chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of the PRC. He was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level CCP committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of politically sensitive anniversaries in 2009.[40]\n\n\nXi's position as the apparent successor to become the paramount leader was threatened with the rapid rise of Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time. Bo was expected to join the PSC at the 18th Party Congress, with most expecting that he would try to eventually maneuver himself into replacing Xi.[41] Bo's policies in Chongqing inspired imitations throughout China and received praise from Xi himself during Xi's visit to Chongqing in 2010. Records of praises from Xi were later erased after he became paramount leader. Bo's downfall would come with the Wang Lijun incident, which opened the door for Xi to come to power without challengers.[42]\n\n\nXi is considered one of the most successful members of the Princelings, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was \"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations\".[43] Lee also commented: \"I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive\".[44] Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as \"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line\".[45] Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi \"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man\".[46]\n\n\n\n### Trips as Vice President[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2009, in his capacity as vice-president, Xi Jinping embarked on a tour of Latin America, visiting Mexico,[47] Jamaica,[48] Colombia,[49] Venezuela,[50] Brazil,[51] and Malta, after which he returned to China.[52] On 11 February 2009, while visiting Mexico, Xi spoke in front of a group of overseas Chinese and explained China's contributions during the international financial crisis, saying that it was \"the greatest contribution towards the whole of human race, made by China, to prevent its 1.3 billion people from hunger\".[c] He went on to remark: \"There are some bored foreigners, with full stomachs, who have nothing better to do than point fingers at us. First, China doesn't export revolution; second, China doesn't export hunger and poverty; third, China doesn't come and cause you headaches. What more is there to be said?\"[d][53] The story was reported on some local television stations. The news led to a flood of discussions on Chinese Internet forums and it was reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was caught off-guard by Xi's remarks, as the actual video was shot by some accompanying Hong Kong reporters and broadcast on Hong Kong TV, which then turned up on various Internet video websites.[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Muscatine, Iowa house where Xi stayed with an American family during a 1985 agricultural visit to the United States. The home was turned into a museum decades later.\nIn the European Union, Xi visited Belgium, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania from 7 to 21 October 2009.[55] He visited Japan, South Korea, Cambodia, and Myanmar on his Asian trip from 14 to 22 December 2009.[56] He later visited the United States, Ireland and Turkey in February 2012. This visit included meeting with then U.S. president Barack Obama at the White House[57] and then vice president Joe Biden; and stops in California and Iowa, where he met with the family that previously hosted him during his 1985 tour as a Hebei provincial official.[58]\n\n\n\n### Accession to top posts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Generations of Chinese leadership and Succession of power in China\n\nA few months before his ascendancy to the party leadership, Xi disappeared from official media coverage and cancelled meeting with foreign officials for several weeks beginning on 1 September 2012, causing rumors.[8] He then reappeared on 15 September.[59] On 15 November 2012, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee of the CCP. This made him, informally, the paramount leader and the first to be born after the founding of the PRC. The following day Xi led the new line-up of the PSC onto the stage in their first public appearance.[60] The PSC was reduced from nine to seven, with only Xi and Li Keqiang retaining their seats; the other five members were new.[61][62][63] In a marked departure from the common practice of Chinese leaders, Xi's first speech as general secretary was plainly worded and did not include any political slogans or mention his predecessors.[64] Xi mentioned the aspirations of the average person, remarking, \"Our people ... expect better education, more stable jobs, better income, more reliable social security, medical care of a higher standard, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful environment.\" Xi also vowed to tackle corruption at the highest levels, alluding that it would threaten the CCP's survival; he was reticent about far-reaching economic reforms.[65]\n\n\nIn December 2012, Xi visited Guangdong in his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership. The overarching theme of the trip was to call for further economic reform and a strengthened military. Xi visited the statue of Deng Xiaoping and his trip was described as following in the footsteps of Deng's own southern trip in 1992, which provided the impetus for further economic reforms in China after conservative party leaders stalled many of Deng's reforms in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. On his trip, Xi consistently alluded to his signature slogan, the \"Chinese Dream\". \"This dream can be said to be the dream of a strong nation. And for the military, it is a dream of a strong military\", Xi told sailors.[66] Xi's trip was significant in that he departed from the established convention of Chinese leaders' travel routines in multiple ways. Rather than dining out, Xi and his entourage ate regular hotel buffet. He travelled in a large van with his colleagues rather than a fleet of limousines, and did not restrict traffic on the parts of the highway he travelled.[67]\n\n\nXi was elected president on 14 March 2013, in a confirmation vote by the 12th National People's Congress in Beijing. He received 2,952 for, one vote against, and three abstentions.[60] He replaced Hu Jintao, who retired after serving two terms.[68] In his new capacity as president, on 16 March 2013 Xi expressed support for non-interference in China–Sri Lanka relations amid a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn that country over government abuses during the Sri Lankan Civil War.[69] On 17 March, Xi and his new ministers arranged a meeting with the chief executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung, confirming his support for Leung.[70] Within hours of his election, Xi discussed cyber security and North Korea with U.S. President Barack Obama over the phone. Obama announced the visits of treasury and state secretaries Jacob Lew and John F. Kerry to China the following week.[71]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping Administration\n\n### Anti-corruption campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping\n\n> \n> “To speak the truth” means to focus on the nature of things, to speak frankly, and follow the truth. This is an important embodiment of a leading official’s characteristics of truth seeking, embodying justice, devotion to public interests, and uprightness. Moreover, he highlighted that the premise of telling the truth is to listen to the truth.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Xi Jinping during a speech in 2012[72][73]\n\nXi vowed to crack down on corruption almost immediately after he ascended to power at the 18th Party Congress. In his inaugural speech as general secretary, Xi mentioned that fighting corruption was one of the toughest challenges for the party.[74] A few months into his term, Xi outlined the Eight-point Regulation, listing rules intended to curb corruption and waste during official party business; it aimed at stricter discipline on the conduct of party officials. Xi also vowed to root out \"tigers and flies\", that is, high-ranking officials and ordinary party functionaries.[75]\n\n\nXi initiated cases against former CMC vice-chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, former PSC member and security chief Zhou Yongkang and former Hu Jintao chief aide Ling Jihua.[76] Along with new disciplinary chief Wang Qishan, Xi's administration spearheaded the formation of \"centrally-dispatched inspection teams\" (中央巡视组). These were essentially cross-jurisdictional squads of officials whose main task was to gain more in-depth understanding of the operations of provincial and local party organizations, and in the process, also enforce party discipline mandated by Beijing. Many of the work teams also had the effect of identifying and initiating investigations of high-ranking officials. Over one hundred provincial-ministerial level officials were implicated during a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign. These included former and current regional officials (Su Rong, Bai Enpei, Wan Qingliang), leading figures of state-owned enterprises and central government organs (Song Lin, Liu Tienan), and highly ranked generals in the military (Gu Junshan). In June 2014, the Shanxi provincial political establishment was decimated, with four officials dismissed within a week from the provincial party organization's top ranks. Within the first two years of the campaign alone, over 200,000 low-ranking officials received warnings, fines, and demotions.[77]\n\n\nThe campaign has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including members of the PSC.[78] Xi's anti-corruption campaign is seen by critics, such as *The Economist*, as a political tool with the aim of removing potential opponents and consolidating power.[79][80] Xi's establishment of a new anti-corruption agency, the National Supervision Commission, ranked higher than the supreme court, has been described by Amnesty International's East Asia director as a \"systemic threat to human rights\" that \"places tens of millions of people at the mercy of a secretive and virtually unaccountable system that is above the law.\"[81][82]\n\n\nXi has overseen significant reforms of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CCP's highest internal control institution.[83] He and CCDI Secretary Wang Qishan further institutionalized CCDI's independence from the day-to-day operations of the CCP, improving its ability to function as a *bona fide* control body.[83] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, any anti-corruption punishment to officials at or above the vice ministerial level need approval from Xi.[84] Another article from *The Wall Street Journal* said that when he wants to neutralize a political rival, he asks inspectors to prepare hundreds of pages of evidence. The article also said that he sometimes authorizes investigations on close associates of a high-ranking politician to replace them with his own proteges and puts political rivals in less important positions to separate them from their political bases. Reportedly, these tactics have even been used against Wang Qishan, Xi's close friend.[85]\n\n\nAccording to historian and sinologist Wang Gungwu, Xi Jinping inherited a political party that was faced with pervasive corruption.[86][87] Xi believed that the amount of corruption at the higher levels of the CCP put both the party and the country at risk of collapse.[86] Wang further adds that Xi has a belief that only the CCP is capable of governing China, and that a collapse of the party would be disastrous for the Chinese people. Xi and the new generational leaders reacted by launching the anti-corruption campaign to eliminate corruption at the higher levels of the government.[86]\n\n\n\n### Censorship[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Censorship in China and Internet censorship in China\n\nSince Xi became the CCP general secretary, censorship, including internet censorship, has been significantly stepped up.[88][89] Chairing the 2018 China Cyberspace Governance Conference on 20 and 21 April 2018, Xi committed to \"fiercely crack down on criminal offenses including hacking, telecom fraud, and violation of citizens' privacy.\"[90] During a visit to Chinese state media, Xi stated that \"party and government-owned media must hold the family name of the party\" (党和政府主办的媒体必须姓党) and that the state media \"must embody the party's will, safeguard the party's authority\".[91]\n\n\nHis administration has overseen more Internet restrictions imposed in China, and is described as being \"stricter across the board\" on speech than previous administrations.[92] Xi has taken a very strong stand to control internet usage inside China, including Google and Facebook,[93] advocating Internet censorship in the country under the concept of internet sovereignty.[94][95] The censorship of Wikipedia has also been stringent; in April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia were blocked in China.[96] Likewise, the situation for users of Weibo has been described as a change from fearing that individual posts would be deleted, or at worst one's account, to fear of arrest.[97]\n\n\nA law enacted in September 2013 authorized a three-year prison term for bloggers who shared more than 500 times any content considered \"defamatory\".[98] The State Internet Information Department summoned a group of influential bloggers to a seminar instructing them to avoid writing about politics, the CCP, or making statements contradicting official narratives. Many bloggers stopped writing about controversial topics, and Weibo went into decline, with much of its readership shifting to WeChat users speaking to very limited social circles.[98] In 2017, telecommunications carriers in China were instructed by the government to block individuals' use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) by February 2018.[99]\n\n\nXi has spoken out against \"historical nihilism\", meaning historical viewpoints that challenge the official line of the CCP.[100] Xi said that one of the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union has been historical nihilism.[101] The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has established a telephone hotline for people to report acts of historical nihilism, while Toutiao and Douyin urged its user to report instances of historical nihilism.[102] In May 2021, the CAC reported that it removed two million online posts for historical nihilism.[103]\n\n\n\n### Consolidation of power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Xi in Beijing, September 2015\nSee also: New Zhijiang Army and Fujian clique\n\nPolitical observers have called Xi the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, especially since the ending of presidential two-term limits in 2018.[104][105][106][107] Xi has notably departed from the collective leadership practices of his post-Mao predecessors. He has centralised his power and created working groups with himself at the head to subvert government bureaucracy, making himself become the unmistakable central figure of the new administration.[108] Beginning in 2013, the CCP under Xi has created a series of Central Leading Groups: supra-ministerial steering committees, designed to bypass existing institutions when making decisions, and ostensibly make policy-making a more efficient process. The most notable new body is the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms. It has broad jurisdiction over economic restructuring and social reforms, and is said to have displaced some of the power previously held by the State Council and its premier.[109]\n\n\nXi also became the leader of the Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization, in charge of cyber-security and Internet policy. The Third Plenum held in 2013 also saw the creation of the National Security Commission of the CCP, another body chaired by Xi, which commentators have said would help Xi consolidate over national security affairs.[110][111] In the opinion of at least one political scientist, Xi \"has surrounded himself with cadres he met while stationed on the coast, Fujian and Shanghai and in Zhejiang.\"[112] Control of Beijing is seen as crucial to Chinese leaders; Xi has selected Cai Qi, one of the cadres mentioned above, to manage the capital.[113] Xi was also believed to have diluted the authority of premier Li Keqiang, taking authority over the economy which has generally been considered to be the domain of the premier.[114][115]\n\n\nSince coming to power, various observers have said that Xi has seriously diluted the influence of the once-dominant \"Tuanpai\", also called the Youth League Faction, which were CCP officials who rose through the Party's Communist Youth League (CYLC).[116] He criticized the cadres of the CYLC, saying that [these cadres] can't talk about science, literature and art, work or life [with young people]. All they can do is just repeat the same old bureaucratic, stereotypical talk.\"[117] Its budget was also cut, dropping from around 700 million yuan ($96 million) in 2012 to 260 million yuan ($40 million) in 2021, while its membership dropped from 90 million to 74 million in the same period.[116] He also led to the closure of the Central School of the Communist Youth League of China, merging it with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and effectively demoted Qin Yizhi, first secretary of the CYLC, in 2017.[118]\n\n\nIn March 2018, the National People's Congress (NPC) passed a set of constitutional amendments including removal of term limits for the president and vice president, the creation of a National Supervisory Commission, as well as enhancing the central role of the CCP.[119][120] On 17 March 2018, the Chinese legislature reappointed Xi as president, now without term limits; Wang Qishan was appointed vice president.[121][122] The following day, Li Keqiang was reappointed premier and longtime allies of Xi, Xu Qiliang and Zhang Youxia, were voted in as vice-chairmen of the CMC.[123] Foreign minister Wang Yi was promoted to state councillor and General Wei Fenghe was named defence minister.[124] According to the *Financial Times*, Xi expressed his views of constitutional amendment at meetings with Chinese officials and foreign dignitaries. Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts—general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC—which have no term limits. However, Xi did not say whether he intended to serve as party general secretary, CMC chairman and state president, for three or more terms.[125]\n\n\nIn its sixth plenary session in November 2021, CCP adopted a historical resolution, a kind of document that evaluated the party's history. This was the third of its kind after ones adopted by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping,[126][127] and the document for the first time credited Xi as being the \"main innovator\" of Xi Jinping Thought[128] while also declaring Xi's leadership as being \"the key to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".[129] In comparison with the other historical resolutions, Xi's one did not herald a major change in how the CCP evaluated its history.[130] To accompany the historical resolution, the CCP promoted the terms Two Establishes and Two Safeguards, calling the CCP to unite around and protect Xi's core status within the party.[131] In 2022, Xi appointed his close ally Wang Xiaohong as the Minister of Public Security, giving him further control over the security establishment.[132]\n\n\nThe 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held between 16 and 22 October 2022, has overseen amendments in the CCP constitution and the re-election of Xi as general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC for a third term, with the overall result of the Congress being further strengthening of Xi's power.[133] The newly amended CCP constitution included the term two safeguards, reinforcing Xi's power.[134] It also included concepts promoted by Xi like common prosperity, \"Chinese-style modernization\" and \"whole-process people's democracy\".[135] Xi's re-election made him the first party leader since Mao Zedong to be chosen for a third term, though Deng Xiaoping ruled the country informally for a longer period.[136] Xi was further re-elected as the PRC president and chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission on 10 March 2023 during the opening of the 14th National People's Congress.[137]\n\n\nThe new Politburo Standing Committee elected just after the CCP Congress was filled almost completely with people close to Xi, with four out of the seven members of the previous PSC including premier Li Keqiang and CPPCC chairman Wang Yang stepping down.[138] Li Qiang, a close Xi ally, became the second-ranking member of the PSC, and was further promoted to premier in 2023.[133][139] Other allies of Xi, including Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang and Li Xi have also joined the PSC, and became the first secretary of the CCP Secretariat, first vice premier, and secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection respectively.[140] The only remaining members of the previous PSC except Xi were Zhao Leji and Wang Huning, though their ranking and positions changed,[140] and became the NPC Standing Committee and CPPCC chairmen respectively on 10 March 2023.[141][142] Reuters remarked that the retirement of Wang Yang and Li Keqiang, as well as the demotion of vice premier Hu Chunhua from the Politburo meant the wipeout of Tuanpai,[116] while Willy Wo-Lap Lam wrote that there were no representatives from the Tuanpai or the Shanghai clique, leading to a total dominance of Xi's own faction.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Cult of personality[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping's cult of personality\n\nXi has had a cult of personality constructed around himself since entering office[144][145] with books, cartoons, pop songs and dance routines honouring his rule.[146] Following Xi's ascension to the leadership core of the CCP, he had been referred to as *Xi Dada* (习大大, Uncle or Papa Xi),[146][147] though this stopped in April 2016.[148] The village of Liangjiahe, where Xi was sent to work, has become a \"modern-day shrine\" decorated with CCP propaganda and murals extolling the formative years of his life.[149] The CCP's Politburo named Xi Jinping *lingxiu* (领袖), a reverent term for \"leader\" and a title previously only given to Mao Zedong and his immediate successor Hua Guofeng.[150][151][152] He is also sometimes called the \"pilot at the helm\" (领航掌舵).[153] On 25 December 2019, the Politburo officially named Xi as \"People's Leader\" (人民领袖; *rénmín lǐngxiù*), a title only Mao had held previously.[154]\n\n\n\n### Economy and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of China\n\nXi was initially seen as a market reformist,[155] and the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee under him announced that \"market forces\" would begin to play a \"decisive\" role in allocating resources.[156] This meant that the state would gradually reduce its involvement in the distribution of capital, and restructure China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to allow further competition, potentially by attracting foreign and private sector players in industries that were previously highly regulated. This policy aimed to address the bloated state sector that had unduly profited from an earlier round of re-structuring by purchasing assets at below-market prices, assets that were no longer being used productively. Xi also launched the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone in August 2013, which was seen as part of the economic reforms.[157] In However, by 2017, Xi's promise of economic reforms has been said to stall by experts.[158][155] In 2015, the Chinese stock market bubble popped, which led Xi to use state forces to fix the issue.[159] From 2012 to 2022, the share of the market value of private sector firms in China's top listed companies has increased from around 10% to over 40%.[160] He has also overseen the relaxation of restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) and increased cross-border holdings of stocks and bonds.[160]\n\n\nXi has increased state control over China's economy, voicing support for SOEs,[161][155] while also supporting the country's private sector.[162] CCP control of SOEs has increased under Xi, while some limited steps towards market liberalization, such as increasing mixed ownership of SOEs were also undertaken.[163] Under Xi, \"government guidance funds\", public-private investment funds set up by or for government bodies, have raised more than $900 billion for early funding to companies that work in sectors the government deems as strategic.[164] Xi has increased the role of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission at the expense of the State Council.[165] His administration made it easier for banks to issue mortgages, increased foreign participation in the bond market, and increased the national currency renminbi's global role, helping it to join IMF's basket of special drawing right.[166] In the 40th anniversary of the launching of Chinese economic reforms in 2018, he has promised to continue reforms but has warned that nobody \"can dictate to the Chinese people\".[167]\n\n\nXi has also personally made eradicating extreme poverty through \"targeted poverty alleviation\" a key goal.[168] In 2021, Xi declared a \"complete victory\" over extreme poverty, saying that nearly 100 million people have been lifted out of poverty under his tenure, though some experts said that China's poverty threshold was relatively lower than the one set by the World Bank.[169] In 2020, premier Li Keqiang, citing the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that China still had 600 million people living with less than 1000 yuan ($140) a month, although an article from *The Economist* said that the methodology NBS used was flawed, stating that the figure took the combined income, which was then equally divided.[170]\n\n\nChina's economy has grown under Xi, with GDP in nominal terms more than doubling from $8.53 trillion in 2012 to $17.73 trillion in 2021,[171] while China's nominal GDP per capita surpassed the world average in 2021,[172] though the rate of growth has slowed from 7.9% in 2012 to 6% in 2019.[173] Xi has stressed the importance of \"high-quality growth\" rather than \"inflated growth\".[174] He has additionally stated that China will focus on quality of economic growth and that it has abandoned a growth-at-all-costs strategy which Xi refers to as \"GDP heroism\".[175]: 22 Instead, Xi said that other social issues such as environmental protection are important.[175]: 22 His administration pursued a debt-deleveraging campaign, seeking to slow and cut the unsustainable amount of debt China has accrued during its economic growth.[176] Though China's total non-financial-sector debt-to-GDP ratio reached a record 270.9% by 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis, it fell to reach around 262.5% by 2021 before going up again to 273.2% in 2022, mainly due to the pressure put by the zero-COVID policy to local finances.[177]\n\n\nXi has circulated a policy called \"dual circulation\", meaning reorienting the economy towards domestic consumption while remaining open to foreign trade and investment.[178] Xi has also made boosting productivity in the economy a priority.[179] Xi has attempted to reform the property sector to combat the steep increase in the property prices and to cut Chinese economy's dependence on the real estate sector.[180] In the 19th CCP National Congress, Xi declared \"Houses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation\".[181] In 2020, Xi's government formulated the \"three red lines\" policy that aimed to deleverage the heavily indebted property sector.[182] Xi additionally has supported a property tax, for which he has faced resistance from members of the CCP.[183]\n\n\nXi's administration has promoted \"Made in China 2025\" plan that aims to make China self-reliant in key technologies, although publicly China de-emphasised this plan due to the outbreak of a trade war with the U.S. Since the outbreak of the trade war in 2018, Xi has revived calls for \"self-reliance\", especially on the matters of technology.[184] Domestic spending on R&D has significantly increased under Xi, surpassing the total of the European Union (EU) and reaching a record $564 billion in 2020.[185] In August 2022, Xi's administration has allocated more than $100 billion to support China's efforts at semiconductor independence.[186] The Chinese government has also supported technology companies like Huawei through grants, tax breaks, credit facilities and other forms of assistance, enabling their rise but also leading to countermeasures by the U.S.[187] Xi has also been personally involved in the development of Xiong'an, a new area announced in 2017, planned to become a major metropolis near Beijing and Tianjin in Hebei province; the relocation aspect is estimated to last until 2035 while it is planned to developed into a \"modern socialist city\" by 2050.[188]\n\n\n\n> \n> Common prosperity is an essential requirement of socialism and a key feature of Chinese-style modernization. The common prosperity we are pursuing is for all, affluence both in material and spiritual life, but not for a small portion nor for uniform egalitarianism.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Xi Jinping during a speech in 2021[189]\n\nIn November 2020, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Xi personally ordered a halt to Ant Group's initial public offering (IPO), in reaction to its founder Jack Ma criticizing government regulation in finance.[190] Xi's administration has also overseen a decrease in offshore IPOs by Chinese companies, with most Chinese IPOs taking place either in Shanghai or Shenzhen as of 2022[update], and has increasingly directed funding to IPOs of companies that works in sectors it deems as strategic, including electric vehicles, biotechnology, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and other high-technology manufacturing.[164]\n\n\nSince 2021, Xi has promoted the term \"common prosperity\", a term which he defined as an \"essential requirement of socialism\", described as affluence for all and said entailed reasonable adjustments to excess incomes.[189][191] Common prosperity has been used as the justification for large-scale crackdowns and regulations towards the perceived \"excesses\" of several sectors, most prominently tech and tutoring industries.[192] The examples of actions taken against tech companies have included fining large tech companies[193] and passing of laws such as the Data Security Law. China also banned private tutoring companies from making profits and teaching school syllabus during weekends and holidays, effectively destroying the whole industry.[194] Xi additionally opened a new stock exchange in Beijing targeted for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which was another part of his common prosperity campaign.[195] There have also been other numerous cultural regulations, such as limiting video game usage by minors to 90 minutes during weekdays and 3 hours during weekends,[196] complete banning of cryptocurrency,[197] cracking down on idol worship, fandom and celebrity culture[198] and cracking down on \"sissy men\".[199] *The Wall Street Journal* has also reported in October 2021 that Xi had launched a round of inspections of the country's financial institutions, including state-owned banks, investment funds and financial regulators, on whether their ties to private firms had become too close, with the investigations being led by Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.[200]\n\n\n\n### Reforms[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2013, at the conclusion of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, the Communist Party delivered a far-reaching reform agenda that alluded to changes in both economic and social policy. Xi signaled at the plenum that he was consolidating control of the massive internal security organization that was formerly the domain of Zhou Yongkang.[156] A new National Security Commission was formed with Xi at its helm. The Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms—another *ad hoc* policy coordination body led by Xi upgraded to a commission in 2018—was also formed to oversee the implementation of the reform agenda.[201] Termed \"comprehensive deepening reforms\" (全面深化改革; *quánmiàn shēnhuà gǎigé*), they were said to be the most significant since Deng Xiaoping's 1992 Southern Tour. The plenum also announced economic reforms and resolved to abolish the *laogai* system of \"re-education through labour\", which was largely seen as a blot on China's human rights record. The system has faced significant criticism for years from domestic critics and foreign observers.[156] In January 2016, a two-child policy replaced the one-child policy,[202] which was in turn was replaced with a three-child policy in May 2021.[203] In July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed.[204]\n\n\n\n#### Political reforms[edit]\n\n\nXi's administration taken a number of changes to the structure of the CCP and state bodies, especially in a large overhaul in 2018. In March 2014, the CCP Central Committee merged the Office for External Propaganda (OEP), externally known as the State Council Information Office (SCIO), to the CCP's Central Propaganda Department. SCIO is now used by the Central Propaganda Department as an external name under an arrangement called \"one institution with two names\".[205] February earlier that year oversaw the creation of the Central Leading Group for Cybersecurity and Informatization. The State Internet Information Office (SIIO), previously under the OEP and SCIO, was transferred to the central leading group and renamed in English into the Cyberspace Administration of China.[206] As part of managing the financial system, the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a State Council body, was established in 2017. Chaired by vice premier Liu He during its existence, the committee was disestablished by the newly established Central Financial Commission during the 2023 Party and state reforms.[207]\n\n\n2018 has seen larger reforms to the bureaucracy. In that year, several central leading groups including reform, cyberspace affairs, finance and economics. and foreign affairs were upgraded to commissions.[208][209] In the area of media, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) was renamed into the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) with its film, news media and publications being transferred to the Central Propaganda Department.[209] Additionally, the control of China Central Television (CCTV, including its international edition, China Global Television), China National Radio (CNR) and China Radio International (CRI) were transferred to the newly established China Media Group (CMG) under the control of the Central Propaganda Department.[209][210] Two State Council departments. one dealing with overseas Chinese, and other one dealing with religious affairs, were merged into the United Front Work Department while another commission dealing with ethnic affairs was brought under formal UFWD leadership.[209]\n\n\n2023 has seen further reforms to the CCP and state bureaucracy, most notably the strengthening of Party control over the financial and technology domains.[211] This included the creation of two CCP bodies for overseeing finance; the Central Financial Commission (CFC), as well as the revival of the Central Financial Work Commission (CFWC) that was previously dissolved in 2002.[211] The CFC would broadly manage the financial system while the CFWC would focus on strengthening the ideological and political role of the CCP in the sector.[207] Additionally, a new CCP Central Science and Technology Commission would be established to broadly oversee the technology sector, while a newly created Social Work Department was tasked with CCP interactions with several sectors, including civic groups, chambers of commerce and industry groups, as well as handling public petition and grievance work.[211] A new Central Hong Kong and Macau Work Office would also be established, with the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office being turned into the new body's external name.[211]\n\n\nAt the State Council, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission was replaced by the National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR), which is taking a much larger responsibility on financial regulation, effectively overseeing all financial activities except the securities industry, which was continued to be regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, now elevated to a government body.[212] Several regulatory responsibilities were also transferred from the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to the SAFS, while the PBoC will also reopen offices around the country that were closed in a previous reorganization.[213]\n\n\n\n#### Legal reforms[edit]\n\n\n> \n> Efforts should be made to enable the people to see that justice is served in every judicial case.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Xi Jinping during a speech in November 2020[214]\n\nThe party under Xi announced a raft of legal reforms at the Fourth Plenum held in the fall 2014, and he called for \"Chinese socialistic rule of law\" immediately afterwards. The party aimed to reform the legal system, which had been perceived as ineffective at delivering justice and affected by corruption, local government interference and lack of constitutional oversight. The plenum, while emphasizing the absolute leadership of the party, also called for a greater role of the constitution in the affairs of state and a strengthening of the role of the National People's Congress Standing Committee in interpreting the constitution.[215] It also called for more transparency in legal proceedings, more involvement of ordinary citizens in the legislative process, and an overall \"professionalization\" of the legal workforce. The party also planned to institute cross-jurisdictional circuit legal tribunals as well as giving provinces consolidated administrative oversight over lower level legal resources, which is intended to reduce local government involvement in legal proceedings.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Military reforms[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Modernization of the People's Liberation Army and 2015 People's Republic of China military reform\nSince taking power in 2012, Xi has undertaken an overhaul of the People's Liberation Army, including both political reform and its modernization.[217] Military-civil fusion has advanced under Xi.[218][219] Xi has been active in his participation in military affairs, taking a direct hands-on approach to military reform. In addition to being the Chairman of the CMC and leader of the Central Leading Group for Military Reform founded in 2014 to oversee comprehensive military reforms, Xi has delivered numerous high-profile pronouncements vowing to clean up malfeasance and complacency in the military. Xi has repeatedly warned that the depoliticization of the PLA from the CCP would lead to a collapse similar to that of the Soviet Union.[220] Xi held the New Gutian Conference in 2014, gathering China's top military officers, re-emphasizing the principle of \"the party has absolute control over the army\" first established by Mao at the 1929 Gutian Conference.[221]\n\n\n> \n> In the USSR, where the military was depoliticized, separated from the party and nationalized, the party was disarmed. When the Soviet Union came to crisis point, a big party was gone just like that. Proportionally, the Soviet Communist Party had more members than we do, but nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Xi Jinping during a speech[222]\n\nThough predating Xi, his administration has taken a more assertive stance towards maritime affairs, and has boosted CCP control over the maritime security forces.[223] In 2013, the previously separate rival maritime law enforcements of China were merged into the China Coast Guard. Initially under the joint administration of the State Oceanic Administration and the Ministry of Public Security, it was placed squarely under the administration of the People's Armed Police (PAP) in 2018.[223]\n\n\nXi announced a reduction of 300,000 troops from the PLA in 2015, bringing its size to 2 million troops. Xi described this as a gesture of peace, while analysts such as Rory Medcalf have said that the cut was done to reduce costs as well as part of PLA's modernization.[224] On 2016, he reduced the number of theater commands of the PLA from seven to five.[225] He has also abolished the four autonomous general departments of the PLA, replacing them with 15 agencies directly reporting to the CMC.[217] Two new branches of the PLA were created under his reforms, the Strategic Support Force[226] and the Joint Logistics Support Force.[227] In 2018, the PAP was placed under the sole control of the CMC; the PAP was previously under the joint command of the CMC and the State Council through the Ministry of Public Security.[228]: 15\n\n\nOn 21 April 2016, Xi was named commander-in-chief of the country's new Joint Operations Command Center of the PLA by Xinhua News Agency and the broadcaster China Central Television.[229][230] Some analysts interpreted this move as an attempt to display strength and strong leadership and as being more \"political than military\".[231] According to Ni Lexiong, a military affairs expert, Xi \"not only controls the military but also does it in an absolute manner, and that in wartime, he is ready to command personally\".[232] According to a University of California, San Diego expert on Chinese military, Xi \"has been able to take political control of the military to an extent that exceeds what Mao and Deng have done\".[233]\n\n\nUnder Xi, China's official military budget has more than doubled,[185] reaching a record $224 billion in 2023.[234] The PLA Navy has grown rapidly under Xi, with China adding more warships, submarines, support ships and major amphibious vessels than the than the entire number of ships under the United Kingdom navy between 2014 and 2018.[235] In 2017, China established the navy's first overseas base in Djibouti.[236] Xi has also undertaken an expansion of China's nuclear arsenal, with him calling China to \"establish a strong system of strategic deterrence\". The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) has estimated China's total amount of nuclear arsenals to be 410 in 2023, with the US Department of Defense estimating that China's arsenal could reach 1,000 by 2030.[237]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of Xi Jinping\nSee also: List of international trips made by Xi Jinping\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet in 2016![](image)World leaders assemble for \"family photo\" at G20 summit in HamburgXi has taken a harder line on security issues as well as foreign affairs, projecting a more nationalistic and assertive China on the world stage.[238] His political program calls for a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure.[239] Foreign analysts and observers have frequently said that Xi's main foreign policy objective is to restore China's position on the global stage as a great power.[240][222][241] Xi advocates \"baseline thinking\" in China's foreign policy: setting explicit red lines that other countries must not cross.[242] In the Chinese perspective, these tough stances on baseline issues reduce strategic uncertainty, preventing other nations from misjudging China's positions or underestimating China's resolve in asserting what it perceives to be in its national interest.[242] Xi stated during the 20th CCP National Congress that he wanted to ensure China \"leads the world in terms of composite national strength and international influence\" by 2049.[243]\n\n\nXi has promoted \"major-country diplomacy\" (大国外交), stating that China is already a \"big power\" and breaking away from previous Chinese leaders who had a more precautious diplomacy.[244] He has adopted a hawkish foreign policy posture called \"wolf warrior diplomacy\",[245] while his foreign policy thoughts are collectively known as \"Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy\".[246] In March 2021, he said that \"the East is rising and the West is declining\" (东升西降), saying that the power of the Western world was in decline and their COVID-19 response was an example of this, and that China was entering a period of opportunity because of this.[247] Xi has frequently alluded to \"community with a shared future for mankind\", which Chinese diplomats have said doesn't imply an intention to change the international order,[248] but which foreign observers say China wants a new order that puts it more at the centre.[249] Under Xi, China has, along with Russia, also focused on increasing relations with the Global South in order to blunt the effect of Western sanctions.[250]\n\n\nXi has put an emphasis on increasing China's \"international discourse power\" (国际话语权) to create a more favorable global opinion of China in the world.[251] In this pursuit, Xi has emphasised the need to \"tell China's story well\" (讲好中国故事), meaning expanding China's external propaganda (外宣) and communications.[252] Xi has expanded the focus and scope of the united front, which aims to consolidate support for CCP in non-CCP elements both inside and outside China, and has accordingly expanded the United Front Work Department.[253] Xi has unveiled the Global Development Initiative (GDI),[254] the Global Security Initiative (GSI),[255] and the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI), in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, aiming to increase China's influence in the international order.[256]\n\n\n\n#### Security[edit]\n\n\nUnder Xi, China has promoted reformation of the international system, with Xi calling for a \"rejection of hegemonic power structures in global governance\".[257] Addressing a regional conference in Shanghai on 21 May 2014, he called on Asian countries to unite and forge a way together, rather than get involved with third party powers, seen as a reference to the United States. \"Matters in Asia ultimately must be taken care of by Asians. Asia's problems ultimately must be resolved by Asians and Asia's security ultimately must be protected by Asians\", he told the conference.[258] His proposed Global Security Initiative has been aiming to create a new global security architecture, incorporating the term \"indivisible security\", a concept also supported by Russia.[255] He has also advocated for international security cooperation; during a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in September 2021, he spoke out against \"interference in other countries' internal affairs\", and called for joint cooperation in warding off against \"colour revolutions\".[259]\n\n\n\n#### Africa[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sino-African relations\n\nUnder Xi, China has cut back lending to Africa after fears that African countries couldn't repay their debts to China.[260] Xi has also promised that China would write off debts of some African countries.[261] In November 2021, Xi promised African nations 1 billion doses of China's COVID-19 vaccines, which was in addition to the 200 million already supplied before. This has been said to be part of China's vaccine diplomacy.[262]\n\n\n\n#### European Union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–European Union relations\n\n![](image)Xi in an official visit to Warsaw, where he and Poland's president Andrzej Duda signed a declaration on strategic partnership.China's efforts under Xi has been for the European Union (EU) to stay in a neutral position in their contest with the U.S.[263] China and the EU announced the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) in 2020, although the deal was later frozen due to mutual sanctions over Xinjiang.[264] Xi has supported calls for EU to achieve \"strategic autonomy\",[265] and has also called on the EU to view China \"independently\".[266]\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–India relations\n\n![](image)The BRICS leaders in 2023, from left to right: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Xi Jinping, Cyril Ramaphosa, Narendra Modi and Sergey Lavrov (representing Vladimir Putin).\nRelations between China and India had ups and downs under Xi, later deteriorating due to various factors. In 2013, the two countries had a standoff in Depsang for three weeks, which ended with no border change.[267] In 2017, the two countries again had a standoff over a Chinese construction of a road in Doklam, a territory both claimed by Bhutan, India's ally, and China,[268] though by 28 August, both countries mutually disengaged.[269] The most serious crisis in the relationship came when the two countries had a deadly clash in 2020 at the Line of Actual Control, leaving some soldiers dead.[270][271] The clashes created a serious deterioration in relations, with China seizing a small chunk of territory that India controlled.[272]\n\n\n\n#### Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–Japan relations\n\nChina–Japan relations have initially soured under Xi's administration; the most thorny issue between the two countries remains the dispute over the Senkaku islands, which China calls Diaoyu. In response to Japan's continued robust stance on the issue, China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone in November 2013.[273] However, the relations later started to improve, with Xi being invited to visit in 2020,[274] though the trip was later delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[275] In August 2022, Kyodo News reported that Xi personally decided to let ballistic missiles land within Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) during the military exercises held around Taiwan, to send a warning to Japan.[276]\n\n\n\n#### Middle East[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi with Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, 23 January 2016\nWhile China has historically been wary of getting closer to the Middle East countries, Xi has changed this approach.[277] China has grown closer to both Iran and Saudi Arabia under Xi.[277] During a visit to Iran in 2016, Xi proposed a large cooperation program with Iran,[278] a deal that was later signed in 2021.[279] China has also sold ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia and is helping build 7,000 schools in Iraq.[277] In 2013, Xi proposed a peace deal between Israel and Palestine that entails a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.[280] Turkey, with whom relations were long strained over Uyghurs, has also grown closer to China.[281] On 10 March 2023, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to restore diplomatic ties cut in 2016 after a deal brokered between the two countries by China following secret talks in Beijing.[282]\n\n\n\n#### North Korea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–North Korea relations\n\nUnder Xi, China initially took a more critical stance on North Korea due to its nuclear tests.[283] However, starting in 2018, the relations started to improve due to meetings between Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.[284] Xi has also supported denuclearization of North Korea,[285] and has voiced support for economic reforms in the country.[286] At the G20 meeting in Japan, Xi called for a \"timely easing\" of sanctions imposed on North Korea.[287] After the 20th CCP National Congress in 2022, *Rodong Sinmun*, official newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, wrote a long editorial praising Xi, titling both Kim and Xi *Suryong* (수령), a title historically reserved for North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–Russia relations\n\n![](image)Xi with his wife Peng Liyuan during the Moscow Victory Day Parade on 9 May 2015\nXi has cultivated stronger relations with Russia, particularly in the wake of the Ukraine crisis of 2014. He seems to have developed a strong personal relationship with president Vladimir Putin. Both are viewed as strong leaders with a nationalist orientation who are not afraid to assert themselves against Western interests.[289] Xi attended the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Under Xi, China signed a $400 billion gas deal with Russia; China has also become Russia's largest trading partner.[289]\n\n\nXi and Putin met on 4 February 2022 during the run up to the 2022 Beijing Olympics during the massive Russian build-up of force on the Ukrainian border, with the two expressing that the two countries are nearly united in their anti-US alignment and that both nations shared \"no limits\" to their commitments.[290][291] U.S. officials said that China had asked Russia to wait for the invasion of Ukraine until after the Beijing Olympics ended on 20 February.[291] In April 2022, Xi Jinping expressed opposition to sanctions against Russia.[292] On 15 June 2022, Xi Jinping reasserted China's support for Russia on issues of sovereignty and security.[293] However, Xi also said China is committed to respecting \"the territorial integrity of all countries\",[294] and said China was \"pained to see the flames of war reignited in Europe\".[295] China has additionally kept a distance from Russia's actions, instead putting itself as a neutral party.[291] In February 2023, China released a 12-point peace plan to \"settle the acute crisis in Ukraine\"; the plan was praised by Putin but criticized by the U.S. and European countries.[296]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vladimir Putin welcomes Xi in Moscow during Xi's visit to Russia in March 2023\nDuring the war Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given a nuanced take to China,[297] saying that the country has the economic leverage to pressure Putin to end the war, adding \"I'm sure that without the Chinese market for the Russian Federation, Russia would be feeling complete economic isolation. That's something that China can do – to limit the trade [with Russia] until the war is over.\" In August 2022, Zelenskyy said that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Xi Jinping did not respond to his requests for direct talks with him.[298] He additionally said that while he would like China to take a different approach to the war in Ukraine, he also wanted the relationship to improve every year and said that China and Ukraine shared similar values.[299] On 26 April 2023, Zelenskyy and Xi held their first phone call since the start of the war.[300]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–South Korea relations\n\nXi has initially improved relationships with South Korea,[283] and the two countries signed a free-trade agreement in December 2015.[301] Starting in 2017, China's relationship with South Korea soured over the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), a missile defence system, purchase of the latter. which China sees as a threat but which South Korea says is a defence measure against North Korea.[302] Ultimately, South Korea halted the purchase of the THAAD after China imposed unofficial sanctions.[303] China's relations with South Korea improved again under president Moon Jae-in.[304]\n\n\n\n#### Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Philippine President Bongbong Marcos in Bangkok, November 2022\nSince Xi came to power, China has been rapidly building and militarizing islands in the South China Sea, a decision *Study Times* of the Central Party School said was personally taken by Xi.[305] In April 2015, new satellite imagery revealed that China was rapidly constructing an airfield on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea.[306] In November 2014, in a major policy address, Xi called for a decrease in the use of force, preferring dialogue and consultation to solve the current issues plaguing the relationship between China and its South East Asian neighbors.[307]\n\n\n\n#### Taiwan[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cross-Strait relations and Ma–Xi meeting\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping met with then-Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou in November 2015 in their capacity as the leader of mainland China and Taiwan respectively.\nIn 2015, Xi met with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou, which marked the first time the political leaders of both sides of the Taiwan Strait have met since the end of the Chinese Civil War in Mainland China in 1950.[308] Xi said that China and Taiwan are \"one family\" that cannot be pulled apart.[309] However, the relations started deteriorating after Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016.[310]\n\n\nIn the 19th Party Congress held in 2017, Xi reaffirmed six of the nine principles that had been affirmed continuously since the 16th Party Congress in 2002, with the notable exception of \"Placing hopes on the Taiwan people as a force to help bring about unification\".[311] According to the Brookings Institution, Xi used stronger language on potential Taiwan independence than his predecessors towards previous DPP governments in Taiwan.[311] He said that \"we will never allow any person, any organisation, or any political party to split any part of the Chinese territory from China at any time at any form.\"[311] In March 2018, Xi said that Taiwan would face the \"punishment of history\" for any attempts at separatism.[312]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Xi Jinping called on Taiwan to reject its formal independence from China, saying: \"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means.\" Those options, he said, could be used against \"external interference\". Xi also said that they \"are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities.\"[313][314] President Tsai responded to the speech by saying Taiwan would not accept a one country, two systems arrangement with the mainland, while stressing the need for all cross-strait negotiations to be on a government-to-government basis.[315]\n\n\nIn 2022, after the Chinese military exercises around Taiwan, the PRC published a white paper called \"The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era\", which was the first white paper regards to Taiwan since 2000.[316] The paper urged Taiwan to become a special administrative region of the PRC under the one country two systems formula,[316] and said that \"a small number of countries, the U.S. foremost amongst them\" are \"using Taiwan to contain China\".[317] Notably, the new white paper excluded a part that previously said the PRC would not send troops or officials to Taiwan after unification.[317]\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China–United States relations\n\n![](image)U.S. president Donald Trump arrives in China, 8 November 2017Xi has called China–United States relations in the contemporary world a \"new type of great-power relations\", a phrase the Obama administration had been reluctant to embrace.[318] Under his administration the U.S.–China Strategic and Economic Dialogue that began under Hu Jintao has continued, until it was suspended by the administration of Donald Trump.[319] On China–U.S. relations, Xi said, \"If [China and the United States] are in confrontation, it would surely spell disaster for both countries\".[320] The U.S. has been critical of Chinese actions in the South China Sea.[318] In 2014, Chinese hackers compromised the computer system of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management,[321] resulting in the theft of approximately 22 million personnel records handled by the office.[322] Xi has also indirectly spoken out critically on the U.S. \"strategic pivot\" to Asia.[323]\nRelations with the U.S. soured after Donald Trump became president in 2017.[324] Since 2018, U.S. and China have been engaged in an escalating trade war.[325] In 2020, the relations further deteriorated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[326] In 2021, Xi has called the U.S. the biggest threat to China's development, saying that \"the biggest source of chaos in the present-day world is the United States\".[247] Xi has also scrapped a previous policy in which China did not challenge the U.S. in most instances, while Chinese officials said that they now see China as an \"equal\" to the U.S.[327] On 6 March 2023, during a speech to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Xi said that \"Western countries—led by the U.S.—have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression\" against China, which he said brought \"unprecedentedly severe challenges to our country's development\".[328]\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping with U.S. President Joe Biden at the margins of the 2022 G20 Bali summit\n#### Economic relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Belt and Road Initiative\n![](image)Countries that signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was unveiled by Xi in September and October 2013 during visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia,[329] and was thereafter promoted by Premier Li Keqiang during state visits to Asia and Europe. Xi made the announcement for the initiative while in Astana, Kazakhstan, and called it a \"golden opportunity\".[330] BRI has been called Xi's \"signature project\", involving numerous infrastructure development and investment projects throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas.[331] BRI was added to the CCP Constitution at the closing session of the 19th Party Congress on 24 October 2017,[332] further elevating its importance.[333] Since the BRI was launched, China became the world's largest lender, lending about $1 trillion in a decade to almost 150 countries. However, by 2022, many BRI projects have stalled, and most of China's debt became held by countries in financial distress, leading the Chinese leaders to adopt a more conservative approach to BRI, dubbed as \"Belt and Road Initiative 2.0\".[334]\n\n\nXi officially proposed the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in October 2013 during a visit to Indonesia,[335] which officially launched in January 2016.[336] The membership of the AIIB has included numerous countries, including allies of the United States and Western countries, despite opposition from the US.[336] Since its launch until 2022, AIIB has invested $36.43 billion to 190 projects.[337] Xi's tenure has seen a signing of several free-trade deals, including with Australia in 2014,[338] South Korea in 2015,[301] and the larger Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2020.[339] Xi has also expressed his interest in China joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), with China formally applying to join in September 2021.[340]\n\n\n\n### National security[edit]\n\n\nXi has devoted a large amount of work towards national security, calling for a \"holistic national security architecture\" that encompasses \"all aspects of the work of the party and the country\".[341] During a private talk with U.S. president Obama and vice president Biden, he said that China had been a target of \"colour revolutions\", foreshadowing his focus on national security.[342] Since its creation by Xi, the National Security Commission has established local security committees, focusing on dissent.[342] In the name of national security, Xi's government has passed numerous laws including a counterespionage law in 2014,[343] national security[344] and a counterterrorism law in 2015,[345] a cybersecurity law[346] and a law restricting foreign NGOs in 2016,[347] a national intelligence law in 2017,[348] and a data security law in 2021.[349] Under Xi, China's mass surveillance network has dramatically grown, with comprehensive profiles being built for each citizen.[350]\n\n\n\n### Hong Kong[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hong Kong protesters throw eggs at Xi Jinping's portrait on National DayDuring his leadership, Xi has supported and pursued a greater political and economic integration of Hong Kong to mainland China, including through projects such as the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge.[351] He has pushed for the Greater Bay Area project, which aims to integrate Hong Kong, Macau, and nine other cities in Guangdong.[351] Xi's push for greater integration has created fears of decreasing freedoms in Hong Kong.[352] Many of the views held by the central government and eventually implemented in Hong Kong were outlined in a white paper published by the State Council in 2014 named *The Practice of the 'One Country, Two Systems' Policy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region*, which outlined that the China's central government has \"comprehensive jurisdiction\" over Hong Kong.[353] Under Xi, the Chinese government also declared the Sino-British Joint Declaration to be legally void.[353]\n\n\nIn August 2014, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) made a decision allowing universal suffrage for the 2017 election of the chief executive of Hong Kong, but also requiring the candidates to \"love the country, and love Hong Kong\", as well as other measures that ensured the Chinese leadership would be the ultimate decision-maker on the selection, leading to protests,[354] and the eventual rejection of the reform bill in the Legislative Council due to a walk-out by the pro-Beijing camp to delay to vote.[355] In the 2017 chief executive election, Carrie Lam was victorious, reportedly with the endorsement of the CCP Politburo.[356]\n\n\n\nXi has supported the Hong Kong Government and Carrie Lam against the protesters in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, which broke out after a proposed bill that would allow extraditions to China.[357] He has defended the Hong Kong police's use of force, saying that \"We sternly support the Hong Kong police to take forceful actions in enforcing the law, and the Hong Kong judiciary to punish in accordance with the law those who have committed violent crimes.\"[358] While visiting Macau on 20 December 2019 as part of the 20th anniversary of its return to China, Xi warned of foreign forces interfering in Hong Kong and Macau,[359] while also hinting that Macau could be a model for Hong Kong to follow.[360]\n\n![](image)Xi swearing in John Lee as chief executive during the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China\nIn 2020, the NPCSC passed a national security law in Hong Kong that dramatically expanded government clampdown over the opposition in the city; amongst the measures were the dramatic restriction on political opposition and the creation of a central government office outside Hong Kong jurisdiction to oversee the enforcement of the law.[353] This was seem as the culmination of a long-term project under Xi to further closely integrate Hong Kong with the mainland.[353] Xi visited Hong Kong as president in 2017 and 2022, in the 20th and 25th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong respectively.[361] In his 2022 visit, he swore in John Lee as chief executive, a former police officer that was backed by the Chinese government to expand control over the city.[362][363] While in the city, he said Hong Kong had moved from \"chaos\" to \"stability\".[364] Since John Lee became chief executive, Hong Kong government officials including Lee himself have shown public displays of loyalty towards Xi, similar to the mainland but previously unheard in the city.[365]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human rights in China, Uyghur genocide, and Antireligious campaigns in China\n\nAccording to the Human Rights Watch, Xi has \"started a broad and sustained offensive on human rights\" since he became leader in 2012.[366] The HRW also said that repression in China is \"at its worst level since the Tiananmen Square massacre.\"[367] Since taking power, Xi has cracked down on grassroots activism, with hundreds being detained.[368] He presided over the 709 crackdown on 9 July 2015, which saw more than 200 lawyers, legal assistants and human rights activists being detained.[369] His term has seen the arrest and imprisonment of activists such as Xu Zhiyong, as well as numerous others who identified with the New Citizens' Movement. Prominent legal activist Pu Zhiqiang of the Weiquan movement was also arrested and detained.[370]\n\n\nIn 2017, the local government of the Jiangxi province told Christians to replace their pictures of Jesus with Xi Jinping as part of a general campaign on unofficial churches in the country.[371][372][373] According to local social media, officials \"transformed them from believing in religion to believing in the party\".[371] According to activists, \"Xi is waging the most severe systematic suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982\", and according to pastors and a group that monitors religion in China, has involved \"destroying crosses, burning bibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith\".[374]\n\n\nUnder Xi, the CCP has embraced assimilationist policies towards ethnic minorities, scaling back affirmative action in the country by 2019,[375] and scrapping a wording in October 2021 that guaranteed the rights of minority children to be educated in their native language, replacing it with one that emphasized teaching the national language.[376] In 2020, Chen Xiaojiang was appointed as head of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission, the first Han Chinese head of the body since 1954.[377] On 24 June 2022, Pan Yue, another Han Chinese, became the head of the commission, with him reportedly holding assimilationist policies toward ethnic minorities.[378] Xi outlined his official views relations between the majority Han Chinese and ethnic minorities by saying \"[n]either Han chauvinism nor local ethnic chauvinism is conducive to the development of a community for the Chinese nation\".[379]\n\n\n\n#### Xinjiang[edit]\n\n\nFollowing several terrorist attacks in Xinjiang in 2013 and 2014, the CCP leaders held a secret meeting to find a solution to the attacks,[380] leading to Xi to launch the Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism in 2014, which involved mass detention, and surveillance of ethnic Uyghurs there.[381][382] Xi made an inspection tour in Xinjiang between 27 and 30 April in 2014.[383] The program was massively expanded in 2016, after the appointment of Chen Quanguo as the Xinjiang CCP secretary. The campaign included the detainment of 1.8 million people in internment camps, mostly Uyghurs but also including other ethnic and religious minorities, by 2020,[380] and a birth suppression campaign that led to a large drop in the Uyghur birth rate by 2019.[384] Various human rights groups and former inmates have described the camps as \"concentration camps\", where Uyghurs and other minorities have been forcibly assimilated into China's majority ethnic Han society.[385] This program has been called a genocide by some observers, while a report by the UN Human Rights Office said they may amount to crimes against humanity.[386][387]\n\n\nInternal Chinese government documents leaked to the press in November 2019 showed that Xi personally ordered a security crackdown in Xinjiang, saying that the party must show \"absolutely no mercy\" and that officials use all the \"weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship\" to suppress those \"infected with the virus of extremism\".[382][388] The papers also showed that Xi repeatedly discussed about Islamic extremism in his speeches, likening it to a \"virus\" or a \"drug\" that could be only addressed by \"a period of painful, interventionary treatment.\"[382] However, he also warned against the discrimination against Uyghurs and rejected proposals to eradicate Islam in China, calling that kind of viewpoint \"biased, even wrong\".[382] Xi's exact role in the building of internment camps has not been publicly reported, though he's widely believed to be behind them and his words have been the source for major justifications in the crackdown in Xinjiang.[389][390] In the Xinjiang Police Files leaked in 2022, a document quoting Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi suggested that Xi had been aware of the internment camps.[391]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chinese government response to COVID-19 and COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China\nOn 20 January 2020, Xi commented for the first time on the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, and ordered \"efforts to curb the spread\" of the virus.[392] He gave premier Li Keqiang some responsibility over the COVID-19 response, in what has been suggested by *The Wall Street Journal* was an attempt to potentially insulate himself from criticism if the response failed.[393] The government initially responded to the pandemic with a lockdown and censorship, with the initial response causing widespread backlash within China.[394] He met with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), on 28 January.[395] *Der Spiegel* reported that in January 2020 Xi pressured Tedros Adhanom to hold off on issuing a global warning about the outbreak of COVID-19 and hold back information on human-to-human transmission of the virus, allegations denied by the WHO.[396] On 5 February, Xi met with Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen in Beijing, the first foreign leader allowed into China since the outbreak.[395] After the COVID-19 outbreak got under control in Wuhan, Xi visited the city on 10 March.[397]\n\n\n![](image)Italian president Sergio Mattarella with Xi in March 2019\nAfter getting the outbreak in Wuhan under control, Xi has favoured what has officially been termed \"dynamic zero-COVID policy\"[398] that aims to control and suppress the virus as much as possible within the country's borders. This has involved local lockdowns and mass-testing.[399] While initially credited for China's suppression of the COVID-19 outbreak, the policy was later criticized by foreign and some domestic observers for being out of touch with the rest of the world and taking a heavy toll on the economy.[399] This approach has especially come under criticism during a 2022 lockdown on Shanghai, which forced millions to their homes and damaged the city's economy,[400] denting the image of Li Qiang, close Xi ally and Party secretary of the city.[401] Conversely, Xi has said that the policy was designed to protect people's life safety.[402] On 23 July 2022, the National Health Commission reported that Xi and other top leaders have taken the local COVID-19 vaccines.[403]\n\n\nAt the 20th CCP Congress, Xi confirmed the continuation of the zero-COVID policy,[404] stating he would \"unswervingly\" carry out \"dynamic zero-COVID\" and promising to \"resolutely win the battle,\"[405] though China started a limited easing of the policies in the following weeks.[406] In November 2022, protests broke out against China's COVID-19 policies, with a fire in a high-rise apartment building in Ürümqi being the trigger.[407] The protests were held in multiple major cities, with some of the protesters demanding the end of Xi's and the CCP's rule.[407] The protests were mostly suppressed by December,[407] though the government further eased COVID-19 restrictions in the time since.[408] On 7 December 2022, China announced large-scale changes to its COVID-19 policy, including allowing quarantine at home for mild infections, reducing of PCR testing, and decreasing the power of local officials to implement lockdowns.[409]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental policy in China\n\nIn September 2020, Xi announced that China will \"strengthen its 2030 climate target (NDC), peak emissions before 2030 and aim to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060\".[410] If accomplished, this would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2–0.3 °C – \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\".[410] Xi mentioned the link between the COVID-19 pandemic and nature destruction as one of the reasons for the decision, saying that \"Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature.\"[411] On 27 September, Chinese scientists presented a detailed plan how to achieve the target.[412] In September 2021, Xi announced that China will not build \"coal-fired power projects abroad, which was said to be potentially \"pivotal\" in reducing emissions. The Belt and Road Initiative did not include financing such projects already in the first half of 2021.[413]\n\n\nXi Jinping did not attend COP26 personally. However, a Chinese delegation led by climate change envoy Xie Zhenhua did attend.[414][415] During the conference, the United States and China agreed on a framework to reduce GHG emission by co-operating on different measures.[416]\n\n\n\n### Governance style[edit]\n\n\nKnown as a very secretive leader, little is known publicly about how Xi makes political decisions, or how he came to power.[417][418] Xi's speeches generally get released months or years after they are made.[417] Xi has also never given a press conference since becoming paramount leader, except in rare joint press conferences with foreign leaders.[417][419] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Xi prefers micromanaging in governance, in contrast to previous leaders such as Hu Jintao who left details of major policies to lower-ranking officials.[84] Reportedly, ministerial officials try to get Xi's attention in various ways, with some creating slide shows and audio reports. *The Wall Street Journal* also reported that Xi created a performance-review system in 2018 to give evaluations on officials on various measures, including loyalty.[84] According to *The Economist*, Xi's orders have generally been vague, leaving lower level officials to interpret his words.[389] Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency said that Xi \"personally reviews every draft of major policy documents\" and \"all reports submitted to him, no matter how late in the evening, were returned with instructions the following morning\".[420] With regard to behavior of Communist Party members, Xi emphasizes the \"Two Musts\" (members must not be arrogant or rash and must keep their hard-working spirit) and the \"Six Nos\" (members must say no to formalism, bureaucracy, gift-giving, luxurious birthday celebrations, hedonism, and extravagance).[175]: 52 Xi called for officials to practice self-criticism which, according to observers, is in order to appear less corrupt and more popular among the people.[421][422][423]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ideology of the Chinese Communist Party\n\n### Chinese Dream[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chinese Dream\n\n![](image)According to *Qiushi*, the Chinese Dream is about Chinese prosperity, collective effort, socialism, and national glory.\nXi and CCP ideologues coined the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" to describe his overarching plans for China as its leader. Xi first used the phrase during a high-profile visit to the National Museum of China on 29 November 2012, where he and his Standing Committee colleagues were attending a \"national revival\" exhibition. Since then, the phrase has become the signature political slogan of the Xi era.[424][425] The origin of the term \"Chinese Dream\" is unclear. While the phrase has been used before by journalists and scholars,[426] some publications have posited the term likely drew its inspiration from the concept of the American Dream.[427] *The Economist* noted the abstract and seemingly accessible nature of the concept with no specific overarching policy stipulations may be a deliberate departure from the jargon-heavy ideologies of his predecessors.[428] Xi has linked the \"Chinese Dream\" with the phrase \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".[429][e]\n\n\n\n### Cultural revival[edit]\n\n\nIn recent years, top political leaders of the CCP such as Xi have overseen the rehabilitation of ancient Chinese philosophical figures like Han Fei into the mainstream of Chinese thought alongside Confucianism. At a meeting with other officials in 2013, he quoted Confucius, saying \"he who rules by virtue is like the Pole Star, it maintains its place, and the multitude of stars pay homage.\" While visiting Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius, in November, he told scholars that the Western world was \"suffering a crisis of confidence\" and that the CCP has been \"the loyal inheritor and promoter of China's outstanding traditional culture.\"[430]\n\n\nAccording to several analysts, Xi's leadership has been characterised by a resurgence of the ancient political philosophy Legalism.[431][432][433] Han Fei gained new prominence with favourable citations; one sentence of Han Fei's that Xi quoted appeared thousands of times in official Chinese media at the local, provincial, and national levels.[433] Xi has additionally supported the Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming, telling local leaders to promote him.[434]\n\n\nXi has also overseen a revival of traditional Chinese culture, breaking from the CCP's previous path, which had often attacked it.[435] He has called traditional culture the \"soul\" of the nation and the \"foundation\" of the CCP's culture.[436] Xi has also called for integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China's traditional culture.[256] Hanfu, the traditional dress of Han Chinese, has seen a revival under him, associated with the revival of traditional culture.[437] He has established the \"four matters of confidence\", which has later been added to the CCP constitution, calling for CCP members, government officials and the Chinese people to be \"confident in our chosen path, confident in our guiding theories, confident in our political system, and confident in our culture\". He has unveiled Global Civilisation initiative in 2023, calling for \"respecting the diversity of civilisations, advocating the common values of humanity, valuing the inheritance and innovation of civilisations, and strengthening international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation\"[256]\n\n\n\n### Ideology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eight-point Regulation\n\nXi has said that \"only socialism can save China\".[438] Xi has also declared socialism with Chinese characteristics to be the \"only correct path to realize national rejuvenation\".[439] According to BBC News, while the CCP was perceived to have abandoned its communist ideology since it initiated economic reforms in the 1970s, Xi is believed by some observers to be more believing in the \"idea of a communist project\",[440] being described as a Marxist–Leninist by former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd.[441] Xi's emphasis on prioritizing ideology has included re-asserting the Party's goal of eventually realizing communism and reprimanding those who dismiss communism as impractical or irrelevant.[163] Xi described the communist ideal as the \"calcium\" in a Party member's spine, without which the Party member would suffer the \"osteoporosis\" of political decay and be unable to stand upright.[163]\n\n\nSubscribing to the view that socialism will eventually triumph over capitalism, Xi has said \"Marx and Engels's analysis of the basic contradictions of capitalist society is not outdated, nor is the historical materialist view that capitalism is bound to die out and socialism bound to win\".[442] Xi has overseen the increase of \"Socialist Political Economy With Chinese Characteristics\" as a major study topic for academics in China, aiming to decrease the influence of Western-influenced economics.[442] Though he has called a stop to what he considers to be \"disorderly expansion of capital\", he has also said that \"it is necessary to stimulate the vitality of capital of all types, including nonpublic capital, and give full play to its positive role\".[442]\n\n\n\n> \n> China's success proves that socialism is not dead. It is thriving. Just imagine this: had socialism failed in China, had our communist party collapsed like the party in the Soviet Union, then global socialism would lapse into a long dark age. And communism, like Karl Marx once said, would be a haunting spectre lingering in limbo.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Xi Jinping during a speech in 2018[443]\n\nXi has supported greater CCP control over the PRC, saying \"government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west – the party leads them all\".[444] During the 100th anniversary of the CCP in 2021, he said that \"without the Communist Party of China, there would be no new China and no national rejuvenation\", and that \"the leadership of the Party is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and constitutes the greatest strength of this system\".[445] He has said that China, despite many setbacks, has achieved great progress under the CCP, saying that \"socialism with Chinese characteristics has become the standard-bearer of 21st-century socialist development\".[443] However, he has also warned that it will take a long time for China under the CCP to complete its rejuvenation, and during this timeframe, party members must be vigilant to not let CCP rule collapse.[443]\n\n\nXi has ruled out a multi-party system for China, saying that \"constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentarism, a multi-party system and a presidential system, we considered them, tried them, but none worked\".[446] However, Xi considers China to be a democracy, saying that \"China's socialist democracy is the most comprehensive, genuine and effective democracy\".[447] China's definition of democracy is different from liberal democracies and is rooted in Marxism–Leninism, and is based on the phrases \"people's democratic dictatorship\" and \"democratic centralism\".[447] Xi has additionally coined the term \"whole-process people's democracy\" which he said was about having \"the people as masters\".[448] Foreign analysts and observers have widely disputed that China is a democracy, saying that it is a one-party authoritarian state and Xi an authoritarian leader.[455] Some observers, including German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock,[456] have called Xi a dictator, citing the large centralisation of power around him unseen compared to his predecessors.[457][458] Xi has additionally rejected Westernisation as the only way to modernize, instead promoting what he says is \"Chinese-style modernisation\".[459] He has identified five concepts as part of Chinese-style modernisation, including modernisation of a huge population, common prosperity, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development.[460]\n\n\n\n#### Xi Jinping Thought[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping Thought\n\n![](image)A billboard promoting Xi Jinping Thought in Shenzhen\nIn September 2017, the CCP Central Committee decided that Xi's political philosophies, generally referred to as \"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\", would become part of the Party Constitution.[461][462] Xi first made mention of the \"Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\" in his opening day speech delivered to the 19th Party Congress in October 2017. His Politburo Standing Committee colleagues, in their own reviews of Xi's keynote address at the Congress, prepended the name \"Xi Jinping\" in front of \"Thought\".[463] On 24 October 2017, at its closing session, the 19th Party Congress approved the incorporation of Xi Jinping Thought into the Constitution of the CCP,[104] while in March 2018, the National People's Congress changed the state constitution to include Xi Jinping Thought.[464]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Governance of China* in different languages presented at Shanghai Library\nXi himself has described the Thought as part of the broad framework created around socialism with Chinese characteristics, a term coined by Deng Xiaoping that places China in the primary stage of socialism. In official party documentation and pronouncements by Xi's colleagues, the Thought is said to be a continuation of Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, as part of a series of guiding ideologies that embody \"Marxism adopted to Chinese conditions\" and contemporary considerations.[463] It has additionally been described as the \"21st century Marxism\" by two professors in the Central Party School of the CCP.[16] Wang Huning, a top political adviser and a close ally of Xi, has been described as pivotal to developing Xi Jinping Thought.[16] The concepts and context behind Xi Jinping Thought are elaborated in Xi's *The Governance of China* book series, published by the Foreign Languages Press for an international audience. Volume one was published in September 2014, followed by volume two in November 2017.[465]\n\n\nAn app for teaching Xi Jinping Thought had become the most popular smartphone app in China in 2019, as the country's ruling CCP launched a new campaign that calls on its cadres to immerse themselves in the political doctrine every day. *Xuexi Qiangguo* is now the most downloaded item on Apple's domestic App Store, surpassing in demand social media apps such as WeChat and TikTok.[466] In 2021, the government included Xi Jinping Thought in the curriculum including to students from primary schools to university, which created pushback from parents. For much of the preceding 30 years, political ideology and communist doctrine were not a standard taught in Chinese schools until middle school, and textbooks featured a wider set of Chinese leaders with less emphasis on a single leader like Xi.[467]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping, Peng Liyuan and U.S. president Barack Obama in the Lincoln Bedroom\nXi's first marriage was to Ke Lingling, the daughter of Ke Hua, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s. They divorced within a few years.[468] The two were said to fight \"almost every day\", and after the divorce Ke moved to England.[8] In 1987, Xi married the prominent Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan.[469] Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques.[470] Peng Liyuan, a household name in China, was better known to the public than Xi until his political elevation. The couple frequently lived apart due largely to their separate professional lives. Peng has played a much more visible role as China's \"first lady\" compared to her predecessors; for example, Peng hosted U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama on her high-profile visit to China in March 2014.[471]\n\n\nXi and Peng have a daughter named Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University in the spring of 2015. While at Harvard, she used a pseudonym and studied Psychology and English.[472] Xi's family has a home in Jade Spring Hill, a garden and residential area in north-western Beijing run by the CMC.[473]\n\n\nIn June 2012, *Bloomberg News* reported that members of Xi's extended family have substantial business interests, although there was no evidence he had intervened to assist them.[474] The *Bloomberg* website was blocked in mainland China in response to the article.[475] Since Xi embarked on an anti-corruption campaign, *The New York Times* reported members of his family were selling their corporate and real estate investments beginning in 2012.[476] Relatives of highly placed Chinese officials, including seven current and former senior leaders of the Politburo of the CCP, have been named in the Panama Papers, including Deng Jiagui,[477] Xi's brother-in-law. Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became general secretary of the CCP in November 2012.[478]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\nPeng described Xi as hardworking and down-to-earth: \"When he comes home, I've never felt as if there's some leader in the house. In my eyes, he's just my husband.\"[479] In 1992, *The Washington Post* journalist Lena H. Sun had an interview with Xi, then CCP secretary of Fuzhou; Sun described Xi as considerably more at ease and confident than many officials his age, and said that he talked without consulting notes.[480] He was described in a 2011 *The Washington Post* article by those who know him as \"pragmatic, serious, cautious, hard-working, down to earth and low-key\". He was described as a good hand at problem solving and \"seemingly uninterested in the trappings of high office\".[481]\n\n\n\n## Public life[edit]\n\n\nIt is hard to gauge the opinion of the Chinese public on Xi, as no independent surveys exist in China and social media is heavily censored.[482] However, he is believed to be widely popular in the country.[483][484] According to a 2014 poll co-sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, Xi ranked 9 out of 10 in domestic approval ratings.[485] A YouGov poll released in July 2019 found that about 22% of people in mainland China list Xi as the person they admire the most, a plurality, although this figure was less than 5% for residents of Hong Kong.[486] In the spring of 2019, the Pew Research Center made a survey on confidence on Xi Jinping among six-country medians based on Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines and South Korea, which indicated that a median 29% have confidence in Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs, meanwhile a median of 45% have no confidence; these numbers are slightly higher than those of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (23% confidence, 53% no confidence).[487] A poll by Politico and Morning Consult in 2021 found that 5% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Xi, 38% unfavorable, 17% no opinion and 40%, a plurality, never hearing of him.[488]\n\n\nIn 2017, *The Economist* named him the most powerful person in the world.[489] In 2018, *Forbes* ranked him as the most powerful and influential person in the world, replacing Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been ranked so for five consecutive years.[490] Since 2013, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Xi among the list of press freedom predators.[491]\n\n\nUnlike previous Chinese leaders, Chinese state media has given a more encompassing view of Xi's private life, although still strictly controlled. According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi would swim one kilometer and walk every day as long as there was time, and is interested in foreign writers, especially Russian.[420] He is known to love films and TV shows such as *Saving Private Ryan*, *The Departed,* *The Godfather* and *Game of Thrones,*[492][493][494] also praising the independent film-maker Jia Zhangke.[495] The Chinese state media has also cast him as a fatherly figure and a man of the people, determined to stand up for Chinese interests.[418]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Decoration\n | Country/Organisation\n | Date\n | Note\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | The Golden Olympic Order | ![](image) International Olympic Committee | 19 November 2013\n | The highest award of the Olympic movement\n | [496] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold | ![](image) Belgium | 30 March 2014\n | The highest order of Belgium\n | [497] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of the Liberator | ![](image) Venezuela | 20 July 2014\n | The highest order of Venezuela\n | [498] |\n| ![](image) | Order of José Martí | ![](image) Cuba | 22 July 2014\n | Order of Cuba\n | [499] |\n| ![](image) | Nishan-e-Pakistan | ![](image) Pakistan | 21 April 2015\n | The highest civilian award of Pakistan\n | [500] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Abdulaziz al Saud | ![](image) Saudi Arabia | 19 January 2016\n | Saudi Arabian order of merit\n | [501] |\n| ![](image) | Collar of the Order of the Republic of Serbia | ![](image) Serbia | 18 June 2016\n | The highest state order of Serbia\n | [502] |\n| ![](image) | Order for Promotion of Peace and Friendship | ![](image) Belarus | 29 September 2016\n | Order of Belarus\n | [503] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross Medal of Honor\n | ![](image) Peru | 21 November 2016\n | Medal of Peru\n | [504] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Saint Andrew | ![](image) Russia | 3 July 2017\n | The highest order of Russia\n | [505] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Collar of the State of Palestine | ![](image) Palestine | 18 July 2017\n | The highest civilian order of Palestine\n | [506] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Zayed | ![](image) United Arab Emirates | 20 July 2018\n | The highest civilian decoration of the United Arab Emirates\n | [507] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion | ![](image) Senegal | 29 July 2018\n | Order of Senegal\n | [508] |\n| ![](image) | Collar of the Order of the Liberator General San Martin | ![](image) Argentina | 2 December 2018\n | Order of Argentina\n | [509] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Manas | ![](image) Kyrgyzstan | 13 June 2019\n | The highest order of Kyrgyzstan\n | [510] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Crown | ![](image) Tajikistan | 15 June 2019\n | Order of Tajikistan\n | [511] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Golden Eagle | ![](image) Kazakhstan | 14 September 2022\n | The highest order of Kazakhstan\n | [512] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Friendship | ![](image) Uzbekistan | 15 September 2022\n | State award of Uzbekistan\n | [513] |\n|  | Order of South Africa | ![](image) South Africa | 22 August 2023\n | State award of South Africa\n | [514] |\n\n\n### Key to the City[edit]\n\n\nXi holds a \"key to the city\", an honor granted to attending guests to symbolize their significance, in:\n\n\n\n* ![](image)![Iowa](image) Muscatine, Iowa, United States (26 April 1985)[515][516]\n* ![](image) Montego Bay, Jamaica (13 February 2009)[48]\n* ![](image)![](image) Muscatine, Iowa, United States (14 February 2012)[515]\n* ![](image)![](image) San José, Costa Rica (3 June 2013)[517]\n* ![](image)![](image) Mexico City, Mexico (5 June 2013)[518]\n* ![](image)![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina (19 July 2014)[519]\n* ![](image)![](image) Prague, Czech Republic (29 March 2016)[520]\n* ![](image)![Madrid](image) Madrid, Spain (28 November 2018)[521]\n\n\n### Honorary doctorates[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Nazarbayev University (7 September 2013)[522]\n* ![](image) University of Johannesburg (11 April 2019)[523]\n* ![](image) Saint Petersburg State University (6 June 2019)[524]\n* ![](image) King Saud University (8 December 2022)[525]\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* Xi, Jinping (1999). *Theory and Practice on Modern Agriculture*.

A member of the House of Representatives, he previously served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2012 to 2017 and as acting Minister of Defense in 2017. From 2017 to 2020, he also chaired the LDP Policy Research Council.\n\n\nBorn into a political family, Kishida spent part of his childhood in the United States, where he attended elementary school in New York City. After beginning his career in finance, Kishida entered politics and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1993 as a member of the LDP. Kishida was appointed to various posts in the cabinets of prime ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda from 2007 to 2008, and was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2012 after Abe regained the premiership following the 2012 general election, serving for five years and becoming the longest-serving Foreign Affairs Minister in Japanese history. Kishida resigned from the Abe cabinet in 2017 in order to head the LDP's Policy Research Council. Kishida also assumed control of the LDP's more moderate Kōchikai faction in 2012 following the retirement of faction boss Makoto Koga.\n\n\nLong considered a potential future prime minister, Kishida ran in the 2020 LDP leadership election, but lost to Yoshihide Suga. He ran again for the party leadership in 2021, this time winning in a second round run-off against opponent Taro Kono. Kishida was confirmed as Prime Minister by the National Diet four days later on 4 October 2021. He led the LDP to victory in the 2021 general election later that same month, albeit at a slightly reduced majority.\n\n\nKishida has been described as a moderate conservative and has stated that his premiership will focus on a \"new model of capitalism\", by seeking to implement redistributive policies to expand the middle class. On foreign policy he has continued strengthening the Quad Security Dialogue in pursuit of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy, taken steps to repair ties with South Korea and in 2022 instructed the cabinet to increase Japan's military budget by 65% by 2027. His premiership has seen political scandals related to the LDP's links to the Unification Church which came to public attention after the assassination of Shinzo Abe in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nKishida was born to a political family in Shibuya, Tokyo, on 29 July 1957.[1][2][3] His father, Fumitake Kishida, was a government official in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and director of The Small and Medium Enterprise Agency. Since the Kishida family was from Hiroshima, the family returned there every summer. Many members of the Kishida family had died in the atomic bombing and Fumio grew up hearing stories from the atomic bomb survivors.[4] Both his father Fumitake and grandfather Masaki Kishida were former politicians who were members of the House of Representatives.[3] Former Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yoichi Miyazawa is his cousin[5][6] and former prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa is a distant relative.[3]\n\n\nHe went to P.S. 013 Clement C. Moore elementary school in the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens, New York, because his father was posted to a job in the U.S. at the time.[7] He also attended Kōjimachi Elementary School and Kōjimachi Junior High School. Kishida graduated from Kaisei Academy, where he played on the baseball team.[8]\n\n\nFollowing several rejections from the University of Tokyo, Kishida studied law at Waseda University and graduated in 1982.[2][8] At Waseda, he was friends with future politician Takeshi Iwaya.[9][10]\n\n\n\n## Political career\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, September 2014\nAfter working at now-defunct Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and then as a secretary to a member of the House of Representatives, Kishida was elected to the House of Representatives in the 1993 general election, representing the Hiroshima 1st district.[11]\n\n\nKishida served as Minister of Okinawa Affairs from 2007 to 2008, firstly in the Abe Cabinet and later in the Fukuda cabinet.[12] He was appointed state minister in charge of consumer affairs and food safety in the cabinet of then prime minister Yasuo Fukuda in 2008.[3] Kishida was also state minister in charge of science and technology in the Fukuda cabinet.[12]\n\n\nHe was close to Makoto Koga, leader of the Kōchikai faction, one of the oldest inside the LDP, and assumed control of it in October 2012 after Makoto Koga announced his retirement from politics.[3]\n\n\n\n### Abe government\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in March 2017\nFollowing the LDP's victory in the 2012 general election, Kishida was named foreign minister in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe on 26 December 2012.[11][13] He became the longest-serving foreign minister in postwar history, surpassing Abe's father Shintaro Abe.[14] He helped to arrange U.S. President Barack Obama's historic visit to Hiroshima in May 2016, and gained attention in 2017 when he appeared alongside comedian Piko Taro to promote a United Nations program.[9]\n\n\nHe was not in favor of the appointment of Toshihiro Nikai as LDP secretary-general by Abe in 2016 against the wishes of Kishida's own faction, which was seen as an attempt at blocking generational change inside the LDP.[15]\n\n\nIn 2017, Kishida left the Cabinet to take over the chairmanship of the LDP Policy Research Council, a position traditionally seen as a stepping stone to leadership of the party.[16] He sought this position in order to improve his chances to succeed Abe, as the foreign minister post had relatively little influence within the party.[14]\n\n\nKishida considered running in the 2018 LDP presidential election, but he was persuaded by Abe not to run, with a suggestion that Abe would later support Kishida as his successor.[17] By mid-2020, several senior LDP lawmakers had shifted their support from Kishida to Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga. Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso was also popular for sending stimulus payments to households during the COVID-19 pandemic.[18] Kishida ran in the 2020 LDP presidential election but lost out to Suga, who became prime minister;[19] Kishida was not offered a position in the Suga cabinet, although his faction obtained two cabinet seats.[20]\n\n\n\n## Prime Minister of Japan (2021–present)\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida is elected by the Diet, 4 October 2021.\nSee also: 2021 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election and First Kishida Cabinet\n\nFollowing Yoshide Suga's announcement on 3 September 2021 that he would resign, following low approval ratings (at one point below 30%), and a new wave of COVID-19 infections, Kishida and Taro Kono of Shikōkai faction were in the lead to replace him.[21] Suga's decision to not seek re-election as head of the LDP triggered another leadership election in September, just a little more than a year after the previous election in 2020. Throughout the race, Kono was heavily favored to win as he remained in first place among various LDP polls, and he received endorsements by Suga and others.[22]\n\n\nOn 29 September 2021, Kishida defeated Taro Kono in a runoff vote to become the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and replaced outgoing party leader Yoshihide Suga. He received a total of 257 votes (60.19%), from 249 parliamentary members and eight rank-and-file members, to become Japan's next prime minister.[23]\n\n\n\n### 2021 general election and Second Cabinet\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 2021 Japanese general election and Second Kishida Cabinet\n\nThe First Kishida Cabinet took office on 4 October 2021 and consisted of 21 members, including 13 who joined the Cabinet for the first time while also including 2 veterans, Toshimitsu Motegi and Nobuo Kishi, who retained their respective posts from the previous cabinet under Suga;[24] however, on the same day, Kishida announced he would call a general election for 31 October 2021.[25] Kishida gave his first speech as prime minister on 8 October 2021, vowing to fight and end the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan as well as announcing measures to counter the perceived threats by China and North Korea.[26]\n\n\nFollowing the 2021 Japanese general election, Kishida maintained the premiership, although the LDP lost 25 seats.[27] He formed the Second Kishida Cabinet by replacing Toshimitsu Motegi with Yoshimasa Hayashi as the Foreign Minister; Motegi became the party's Secretary-General.[28]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2022, Kishida instructed his government to increase \"national security-related spending\" to 2 percent of Japan's GDP, while increasing the military budget from 5.4 trillion yen ($40 billion) in 2022 to 8.9 trillion yen ($66 billion) by 2027, up 65%. This would lead to a spending a total of around 43 trillion yen ($321 billion) between 2023-2027, up 56% from 2019–2023.[29]\n\n\nKishida set child care as his government's priority for the year 2023. He emphasized the potential consequences of declining birth rates in Japan, and stated that his administration would increase monetary child benefits given to parents.[30] He announced a plan to double the country's children-related budget by June 2023, and instructed government ministers in the administration to outline child care plans by the end of March 2023.[31][32] On 1 June, Kishida's government officially set aside ¥3.5 trillion annually for child care, but was criticized for lack of specific details in his child care plan.[33][34]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Kishida fired an aide after the aide made homophobic comments in local media. According to the report, Masayoshi Arai stated that Japanese people would flee the country if same-sex marriage were permitted. Arai also claimed that Japanese people do not want to have members of the LGBT community as their neighbors.[35]\n\n\nOn 13 March 2023, Kishida's government ended the request for citizens to wear face masks in public, a policy initiated to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan that was made 3 years earlier.[36] On 27 April, Kishida's Health Minister, Katsunobu Katō, announced that the government would downgrade the classification of COVID-19 to be on par with \"seasonal flu\", by 8 May.[37]\n\n\nKishida appointed Kazuo Ueda as Governor of the Bank of Japan in April 2023, who stated he planned to continue the ultra easy monetary policy introduced by the outgoing Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.[38] A few weeks before his next cabinet reshuffle, Kishida stated he wanted to raise the hourly minimum wage in Japan to about ¥1,500 ($10.29) by 2030.[39]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of Japan\n\n![](image)Kishida at the 2022 Quadrilateral Security Dialogue meeting with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese, US president Joe Biden and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi\nIn keeping with the Free and Open Indo-Pacific policy, Kishida has visited Quad nations such as India and Australia to ensure the status quo in the region remains unchanged.[40] Kishida has also visited nations in Europe, along with Canada and the United States, with Japan hosting the 49th G7 summit in May 2023.[41] Kishida has condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and visisted Kyiv in a historic trip.[42] In November 2022, he accused China of violating Japan's sovereignty in the East China Sea and criticised the persecution of the Uyghur minority in China's Xinjiang province.[43] Kishida supported Bangladesh's efforts to repatriate Rohingya refugees to Myanmar.[44] Kishida attended the 2022 NATO summit in Spain, as well as the 2023 NATO summit in Lithuania.[45]\n\n\nIn October 2023, Kishida condemned Hamas' actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Defense and the G7\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: G7 and 49th G7 summit\n\n![](image)Fumio Kishida at the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima, May 2023\nIn November 2022, Kishida instructed his government to increase military spending to 2 percent of Japan's GDP, up from 1 percent previously, by 2027. Following this resolution by the cabinet, Kishida began a tour of members of the Group of Seven in January 2023. Kishida first met with President Emanuel Macron of France on 9 January 2023.[47] The following day, he met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and agreed on a \"strategic partnership\".[48] On 11 January 2023, Kishida met with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in London, where the two signed a joint defence pact.[49] The following day, Kishida met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa to discuss trade and other issues.[50] On 13 January, Kishida visited President Joe Biden of the United States in Washington, D.C.;[51] the previous day Japan's Foreign Minister and Defense Minister met with their American counterparts, where they affirmed the Japan-United States alliance remained unchanged.[52]\n\n\nIn 2023 Japan chaired the Group of Seven, with the 49th G7 summit being hosted in Hiroshima Prefecture in May of that year.[53] As the host leader, Kishida invited various leaders from the \"Global South\", including Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, among others.[54][55] With the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kishida also invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[56] On 19 May 2023, Kishida and the other G7 leaders arrived at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, where they paid respects and visited the museum.[57] That day, the leaders also issued a joint statement on Ukraine, and affirmed their support for Ukraine and the rule of law.[58] The summit concluded on 21 May, and was ultimately considered a success by Kishida.[59][60][61]\n\n\n\n#### Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Russian invasion of Ukraine and 2023 visit by Fumio Kishida to Ukraine\n\n![](image)Kishida inspecting the burial place in the city of BuchaOn 24 February 2022, following the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kishida joined other leaders of the G7 nations in imposing economic sanctions on Russia. Kishida's proposed sanctions were much harsher than the largely symbolic sanctions imposed by the government of Shinzo Abe on Russia following the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. Liberal Democratic Party leaders feared that a lackluster response by Japan to the Ukrainian crisis would result in a lack of support from Japan's European allies in the event of potential Chinese attack against Taiwan.[62] In March 2022, Kishida announced that Japan would accept Ukrainian refugees.[63]\n\n\nIn December 2022 the Kishida government announced a $320 billion increase in military spending, due in part to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[64][65] On January 14, 2023, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called for Kishida to commit \"seppuku\" after he and Joe Biden warned Russia against using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.[66]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Kishida said Japan would provide roughly $5.5 billion in aid to Ukraine during the invasion.[67] Kishida invited President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to a virtual meeting of G7 leaders, which was held on 24 February 2023, the first anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The G7 announced it would introduce \"new coordinated economic actions\" in efforts to support Ukraine.[68] Kishida was the last G7 leader to visit Kyiv during the invasion; pressure grew for him to do so following Biden's visit in February 2023.[69] On 21 March 2023, Kishida visited Ukraine and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[70] Kishida also visited Bucha in Ukraine's Kyiv Oblast, the site of a civilian massacre that was perpetrated by Russia.[71] Kishida was praised for the visit, and said he was \"outraged by the cruelty\".[72] In May 2023, Japan announced it would provide 100 military vehicles to the Ukrainian military.[73] Kishida led G7 leaders in announcing a joint declaration of support for Ukraine, during the 2023 Vilinius summit for NATO.[74]\n\n\n\n#### Indonesia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Indonesia-Japan relations\n\n![](image)Fumio meet President Jokowi in Tokyo, July 2022.\nOn 27 July 2022 Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Wednesday he and President Joko Widodo had agreed during talks to cooperate in a variety of fields, including energy and maritime security. Japan also agreed to provide 43.6 billion yen ($318.25 million) in loans to Indonesia for use in infrastructure projects and disaster prevention, Reuters reported. At the outset of the meeting in Tokyo, Kishida told Jokowi that Japan hopes to work with Indonesia to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific region, a vision that Japan is pursuing amid China's rise. Jokowi, meanwhile, conveyed his condolences over the death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this month, saying the late former leader helped advance bilateral relations to a strategic partnership.[75]\n\n\nOn 14 November 2022 President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) commended Japan's support for Indonesia's G20 Presidency as well as for other concrete projects that have been established.\nPM Kishida also praised Jokowi for welcoming him to a side meeting ahead of the implementation of the G20 Summit to be held on November 15–16.\nRegarding the 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Japan and Indonesia in 2023, Kishida believes that the partnership between the two countries will continue to strengthen.[76]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Japan–South Korea relations and Camp David Principles\n\n![](image)Kishida meeting with South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol in 2023\nOn relations between Japan and South Korea, both Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol have taken steps to mend and expand ties, while attempting to settle historical issues stemming from World War II and the Japanese occupation of Korea.[77] In remarks on 1 March 2023, Yoon said that Japan had gone from 'aggressor to partner'.[78] On 16 March 2023 Kishida held a summit with Yoon in Tokyo to settle war time labor disputes, among other issues.[79][80]\n\n\nOn 7 May 2023, Kishida arrived in Seoul for a two day trip to South Korea.[81] The reciprocal trip was the first between leaders of Japan and South Korea in 12 years.[82] During his visit, Yoon said that the historical issues had to be \"completely settled\".[83] While in Seoul, Kishida expressed sympathies to Koreans who lived under the Japanese Empire.[84] Kishida was criticized by some in South Korea for not directly apologizing during the meeting.[85] The meetings were praised by US President Joe Biden, calling it a \"groundbreaking new chapter of cooperation and partnership\" between both nations.[86]\n\n\nKishida invited President Yoon to attend the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima as an invitee.[54] President Biden also invited Kishida and Yoon to meet in Washington D.C. during the G7 Hiroshima summit for further talks.[87] Kishida met with Yoon and Biden on 18 August during a historic summit hosted by Biden at Camp David in the United States. The three announced the Camp David Principles, a set of strategies to counter the influence of China, North Korea, and Russia as well as limit the risk of economic disruptions in the future.[88] All three nations agreed to further expand military ties, which involved intelligence sharing, annual military drills, and a wider security pact.[89] Biden again praised both leaders for their \"...political courage... to work together.\"[90] The summit additionally reaffirmed a shared goal of a \"free and open Indo-Pacific\", a concept first introduced by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2016.[91] During the summit, Kishida also promised Biden $2 million in relief aid for the wildfires in Hawaii.[92] The summit was a first of its kind and was hailed as the beginning of a new era by the US.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Africa\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with Kenyan President William Ruto, 2 May 2023\nKishida has attempted to deepen ties between Japan and African nations, while also promoting peace and stability in the region. In August 2022, while addressing a summit in Tunisia, Kishida promised $30 billion in aid for the development of African countries for the next 3 years.[94][95]\n\n\nLater on 30 April 2023, Kishida began an African tour and visited the League of Arab States based in Egypt, and met with President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi; Kishida offered a yen loan to fund a metro line project in Cairo.[96] The next day on 1 May, Kishida visited Ghana. During a meeting with President Nana Akufo-Addo, Kishida emphasized the importance of Japanese investment in the country, and bilateral relations in the international arena.[97] Ghana and Japan both agreed to pursue reforms in the UN Security Council as well.[98] While in Ghana, Kishida pledged $500 million in more financial aid to Africa, in perceived contrast from China's Belt and Road Initiative in the continent.[99] On 3 May, Kishida arrived in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. He met with Kenyan President William Ruto, who agreed to deepen cooperation and to bolster economic and energy ties.[100] The two condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and reiterated their desire for a peaceful Indo-Pacific.[101] Kishida announced that Japan would continue to give assistance for infrastructure in Kenya. Ruto and Kishida signed an agreement allowing Kenyans to access jobs in Japan, bolstering economic relations.[102]\n\n\n\n### Assassination of Shinzo Abe and cabinet reshuffle\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Assassination of Shinzo Abe and Second Kishida Cabinet (First Reshuffle)\n\n![](image)Kishida delivering the memorial address at the state funeral of Shinzo Abe\nAfter the assassination of Shinzo Abe on 8 July 2022, Kishida condemned the assassination,[103] but refused to suspend political campaigning so as to demonstrate that democracy would not be impeded by violence. He later blamed insufficient police protection for allowing the murder to occur.[104] Because of media reports on the ties between the LDP and the Unification Church, a Korean cult accused of scamming Japanese followers (including the suspect's mother) out of much of their wealth, Kishida reshuffled his Cabinet on 10 August 2022, which included removing Abe's brother, Nobuo Kishi, from the role of Minister of Defense.[105] Taro Kono was made the Minister of Digital Affairs. While the majority of members of the LDP, including Shinzo Abe and Nobuo Kishi, were related to the church to various degrees, there were no evidences of Kishida having any direct tie with the church or any of its affiliated entities.[106] However, it was reported in the 1 September issue of *Shūkan Bunshun* that Mineo Nakayama [ja], the president of a Kumamoto circle for backing Kishida's bid for the premiership, was also a chairperson of a Unification Church-affiliated group which was advocating for building the Japan-Korea Undersea Tunnel. Both Kishida and Nakayama denied any knowledge of the tunnel advocacy group being related to the Unification Church.[107]\n\n\n\n### Assassination attempt\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Attempted assassination of Fumio Kishida\n\nSee also: 2023 Japan by-elections\n![](image)Kishida (the day after the attack) during a press conference\nOn 15 April 2023, a man threw a cylindrical explosive at Kishida shortly before he was due to make a campaign speech in Wakayama. The device exploded after a short delay during which Kishida was evacuated from the scene unharmed. Ryuji Kimura, a 24-year-old man from Hyogo Prefecture, was arrested at the scene, with cameras showing him holding what appeared to be a second cylindrical object as he was tackled to the ground. The incident took place as Kishida was talking with a candidate of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party just before his scheduled speech. Kishida immediately left by car after the incident and continued with his stump speech elsewhere in the city. He stated at an event later in the day that \"elections are a bedrock of democracy,\" adding that it was extremely unforgivable that such violence took place.[108][109] Kimura was indicted by Wakayama prosecutors on 7 September 2023 for attempted murder, among other charges.[110]\n\n\n\n### Fukushima water release\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Discharge of radioactive water of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant\n\nIn April 2021, the government of Yoshihide Suga, Kishida's predecessor, announced that the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) would eventually begin to discharge stored and treated water from the dismantled Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean, a process that would take 30 years.[111] Kishida's government confirmed they would continue with the water release, in August 2023.[112] Proceeding the water dump, Kishida's government reached an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the levels of tritium in the stored water that would be discharged, and received a comprehensive report affirming the safety of the operation from Rafael Grossi, the IAEA's Secretary-General, in July 2023.[113] Later in August, Grossi stated that the levels of tritium were vastly below the safety standards recommended by the IAEA, and confirmed the water wasn't toxic.[114] Before the dumping, the Ministry of Environment confirmed IAEA standards were being followed, and the levels of radioactive tritium in the water would remain below IAEA dilution regulations.[115] TEPCO announced that dumping had begun on 24 August 2023, beginning the discharge of the water. No errors were reported in the release.[116]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kishida inspecting the Fukushima nuclear plant, 20 August 2023.\nFollowing the announcement of the water release, there was positive and negative feedback from both inside Japan and internationally. Domestic organizations, such as the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, were opposed to the plan.[112] The strongest foreign backlash came from China, which was opposed to the dumping. The Chinese central government placed an outright ban on all Japanese fish products, which accounted for the largest of Japan's fish exports.[117] China was heavily criticized for the ban, and was also accused of hypocrisy and spreading disinformation, as they had released nuclear waste water previously that contained significantly higher levels of tritium.[118] In the days following the release, a number of phone calls regarding the water release from Chinese speakers were made harassing people, companies, and government agencies in Japan.[119] Kishida said the calls were \"deplorable\", and appealed to China to urge its government to ask its citizens to stop the harassing calls.[120] The phone calls came as protests occurred  in China, as well in South Korea and Japan.[121] The Foreign Ministry issued a travel advisory urging Japanese citizens to use caution in China, citing an escalation of harassments and violent protests. Sanae Takaichi, the Minister of State for Economic Security, said the government would consider filing a World Trade Organization complaint in response to the import bans imposed by China.[122] The United States affirmed their support for the water release; American ambassador Rahm Emanuel even visited Fukushima and ate seafood to demonstrate a show of support.[123] In South Korea, various protest were held against the decision. However, the South Korean government did not oppose the plan, and President Yoon also ate seafood from Fukushima to encourage others that it was safe.[124]\n\n\nThrough the early stages of the release, the Environment Ministry conducted numerous tests concerning the levels of tritium in the water as well as in the fish, and stated the levels remained low.[125] The effects on the fish markets were expected to be severe, and Kishida promised to financially support local fisheries.[126] On August 30, Kishida, along with three cabinet ministers, publicly ate fish sashimi from Fukushima in an effort to dispel fears of radioactive contamination.[127] He called it \"safe and delicious\".[128]\n\n\n\n## Political views\n\n[edit]\n\nKishida is the leader of the moderate Kōchikai faction.[1][129] and has been described as a moderate conservative[130] and a centrist politician.[131][10]\n\n\nIn the Diet he is president of the parliamentary league for Public Interest Capitalism[132] and the parliamentary league to Create a New Capitalism,[133] is associated with the Nippon Kaigi parliamentary league[134] and is a founding member of the \"Realization of Selective Surnames System\" Diet group which has the aim of allowing married couples to keep different surnames if they wish.[135]\n\n\n\n### Economic policy\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 2021 LDP presidential race, he called for Japan to strive for a new form of capitalism to reduce income disparity, saying neoliberalism and deregulation had widened economic gaps in society.[136][137] In a parliamentary session on 20 February 2022 he reiterated that the benefits of growth should not belong to a limited group adding that \"[c]apitalism isn't sustainable unless it is something that belongs to all stakeholders\".[138]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, February 2017Kishida is seen as dovish on foreign policy and lukewarm about revising Japan's pacifist constitution.[139][1] Following the political philosophy of his own faction, Kishida has pledged a \"humane diplomacy\" based on the Peace Constitution, the Japan–U.S. alliance, and the Self-Defense Forces and that he will seek to strengthen Japan–U.S. relations and to promote the free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy while counterbalancing Chinese political assertiveness and military presence in the region.[1] Regarding Chinese influence over Taiwan and Hong Kong, Kishida has stated that the Taiwan Strait may be the \"next major diplomatic problem\" following \"China's clampdown on Hong Kong\" and that Japan should seek more cooperation with Taiwan.[140]\n\n\nIn 2017, while serving as foreign minister, Kishida pressured China to push North Korea towards denuclearization.[141] During the race for the leadership of the LDP, Kishida also addressed the issue of Japanese abductees by North Korea and supported a summit between Japan and North Korea to end the issue.[142] Kishida also took a stronger stance than other contenders regarding China and North Korea, saying that Japan should strengthen its defenses, while at the same time recognizing that there is a clash between authoritarianism and democracy in the region, especially with regard to the status of Taiwan.[143]\n\n\nFumio Kishida has requested that the German government remove Friedensstatue [de], a variant of the Statue of Peace, in Berlin. The request has caused considerable controversy in South Korea.[144][145][146][147]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear policy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida delivering a speech in October 2017Kishida is in favor of retaining nuclear power technology, which he says should be considered as a clean energy option, while also calling for the establishment of a $90.7 billion university fund to further stimulate science and promotion of renewable energy.[136]\n\n\nBeing a representative from Hiroshima, Kishida has consistently advocated for Japanese diplomacy to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).[1] In the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kishida rejected former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's proposal for Japan to consider hosting U.S. nuclear weapons as a deterrent, calling it \"unacceptable\" given the country's stance of maintaining the three non-nuclear principles.[148]\n\n\n\n### Social issues\n\n[edit]\n\nKishida stated support for discussions toward allowing married Japanese couples to choose between unified single surnames or separate last names,[149] while on the topic of same-sex marriage Kishida has stated he has not come to support it, saying instead that the public's opinion should be understood before the Diet decides.[150][151] In 2023 he stated that Japan must \"be extremely careful in considering the matter as it could affect the structure of family life in Japan\".[152] In the Diet's budget committee on February 28, 2023, responding to an opposition lawmaker question, he stated that \"I don't think disallowing same-sex couples to marry is unjust discrimination by the state\", repeating his position that a same-sex marriage ban \"is not unconstitutional\" and denying that he is discriminatory adding \"I have never stated I'm against it\". His comment sparked criticism from opposition lawmakers and LGBTQ activists, who questioned whether Kishida was backpedaling from an earlier meeting that month with LGBTQ representatives to show consideration to ultra-conservatives in his party who oppose sexual diversity.[153]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1988, Kishida married Yuko Kishida, the daughter of a Japanese real estate investor, in an arranged marriage. The couple have three sons.[154] In one presentation, Yuko was featured in the LDP messaging immediately after he became the *de facto* PM-designate.[8][155] He is a fan of the manga series *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba* and has pledged to financially support the Japanese animation industry during his premiership.[156] He is also a fan of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp baseball team.[10]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Kishida dismissed his eldest son, Shotaro Kishida, from his role as policy secretary, effective 1 June 2023, for misuse of government resources.[157] Photos had surfaced of Shotaro hosting parties at the Prime Minister's official residence and of him posing as the Prime Minister. Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, called the actions \"inappropriate\".[158]\n\n\n\n## Honours\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![](image) Netherlands: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau (29 October 2014).[159]\n* ![](image) Spain: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (31 March 2017)[160]\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Akimoto, Daisuke (7 September 2021). \"The Arrival of Kishida Diplomacy?\". *The Diplomat*.

A member of the House of Representatives, he previously served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2012 to 2017 and as acting Minister of Defense in 2017. From 2017 to 2020, he also chaired the LDP Policy Research Council.\n\n\nBorn into a political family, Kishida spent part of his childhood in the United States, where he attended elementary school in New York City. After beginning his career in finance, Kishida entered politics and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1993 as a member of the LDP. Kishida was appointed to various posts in the cabinets of prime ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda from 2007 to 2008, and was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2012 after Abe regained the premiership following the 2012 general election, serving for five years and becoming the longest-serving Foreign Affairs Minister in Japanese history. Kishida resigned from the Abe cabinet in 2017 in order to head the LDP's Policy Research Council. Kishida also assumed control of the LDP's more moderate Kōchikai faction in 2012 following the retirement of faction boss Makoto Koga.\n\n\nLong considered a potential future prime minister, Kishida ran in the 2020 LDP leadership election, but lost to Yoshihide Suga. He ran again for the party leadership in 2021, this time winning in a second round run-off against opponent Taro Kono. Kishida was confirmed as Prime Minister by the National Diet four days later on 4 October 2021. He led the LDP to victory in the 2021 general election later that same month, albeit at a slightly reduced majority.\n\n\nKishida has been described as a moderate conservative and has stated that his premiership will focus on a \"new model of capitalism\", by seeking to implement redistributive policies to expand the middle class. On foreign policy he has continued strengthening the Quad Security Dialogue in pursuit of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy, taken steps to repair ties with South Korea and in 2022 instructed the cabinet to increase Japan's military budget by 65% by 2027. His premiership has seen political scandals related to the LDP's links to the Unification Church which came to public attention after the assassination of Shinzo Abe in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nKishida was born to a political family in Shibuya, Tokyo, on 29 July 1957.[1][2][3] His father, Fumitake Kishida, was a government official in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and director of The Small and Medium Enterprise Agency. Since the Kishida family was from Hiroshima, the family returned there every summer. Many members of the Kishida family had died in the atomic bombing and Fumio grew up hearing stories from the atomic bomb survivors.[4] Both his father Fumitake and grandfather Masaki Kishida were former politicians who were members of the House of Representatives.[3] Former Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yoichi Miyazawa is his cousin[5][6] and former prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa is a distant relative.[3]\n\n\nHe went to P.S. 013 Clement C. Moore elementary school in the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens, New York, because his father was posted to a job in the U.S. at the time.[7] He also attended Kōjimachi Elementary School and Kōjimachi Junior High School. Kishida graduated from Kaisei Academy, where he played on the baseball team.[8]\n\n\nFollowing several rejections from the University of Tokyo, Kishida studied law at Waseda University and graduated in 1982.[2][8] At Waseda, he was friends with future politician Takeshi Iwaya.[9][10]\n\n\n\n## Political career\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, September 2014\nAfter working at now-defunct Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and then as a secretary to a member of the House of Representatives, Kishida was elected to the House of Representatives in the 1993 general election, representing the Hiroshima 1st district.[11]\n\n\nKishida served as Minister of Okinawa Affairs from 2007 to 2008, firstly in the Abe Cabinet and later in the Fukuda cabinet.[12] He was appointed state minister in charge of consumer affairs and food safety in the cabinet of then prime minister Yasuo Fukuda in 2008.[3] Kishida was also state minister in charge of science and technology in the Fukuda cabinet.[12]\n\n\nHe was close to Makoto Koga, leader of the Kōchikai faction, one of the oldest inside the LDP, and assumed control of it in October 2012 after Makoto Koga announced his retirement from politics.[3]\n\n\n\n### Abe government\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in March 2017\nFollowing the LDP's victory in the 2012 general election, Kishida was named foreign minister in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe on 26 December 2012.[11][13] He became the longest-serving foreign minister in postwar history, surpassing Abe's father Shintaro Abe.[14] He helped to arrange U.S. President Barack Obama's historic visit to Hiroshima in May 2016, and gained attention in 2017 when he appeared alongside comedian Piko Taro to promote a United Nations program.[9]\n\n\nHe was not in favor of the appointment of Toshihiro Nikai as LDP secretary-general by Abe in 2016 against the wishes of Kishida's own faction, which was seen as an attempt at blocking generational change inside the LDP.[15]\n\n\nIn 2017, Kishida left the Cabinet to take over the chairmanship of the LDP Policy Research Council, a position traditionally seen as a stepping stone to leadership of the party.[16] He sought this position in order to improve his chances to succeed Abe, as the foreign minister post had relatively little influence within the party.[14]\n\n\nKishida considered running in the 2018 LDP presidential election, but he was persuaded by Abe not to run, with a suggestion that Abe would later support Kishida as his successor.[17] By mid-2020, several senior LDP lawmakers had shifted their support from Kishida to Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga. Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso was also popular for sending stimulus payments to households during the COVID-19 pandemic.[18] Kishida ran in the 2020 LDP presidential election but lost out to Suga, who became prime minister;[19] Kishida was not offered a position in the Suga cabinet, although his faction obtained two cabinet seats.[20]\n\n\n\n## Prime Minister of Japan (2021–present)\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida is elected by the Diet, 4 October 2021.\nSee also: 2021 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election and First Kishida Cabinet\n\nFollowing Yoshide Suga's announcement on 3 September 2021 that he would resign, following low approval ratings (at one point below 30%), and a new wave of COVID-19 infections, Kishida and Taro Kono of Shikōkai faction were in the lead to replace him.[21] Suga's decision to not seek re-election as head of the LDP triggered another leadership election in September, just a little more than a year after the previous election in 2020. Throughout the race, Kono was heavily favored to win as he remained in first place among various LDP polls, and he received endorsements by Suga and others.[22]\n\n\nOn 29 September 2021, Kishida defeated Taro Kono in a runoff vote to become the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and replaced outgoing party leader Yoshihide Suga. He received a total of 257 votes (60.19%), from 249 parliamentary members and eight rank-and-file members, to become Japan's next prime minister.[23]\n\n\n\n### 2021 general election and Second Cabinet\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 2021 Japanese general election and Second Kishida Cabinet\n\nThe First Kishida Cabinet took office on 4 October 2021 and consisted of 21 members, including 13 who joined the Cabinet for the first time while also including 2 veterans, Toshimitsu Motegi and Nobuo Kishi, who retained their respective posts from the previous cabinet under Suga;[24] however, on the same day, Kishida announced he would call a general election for 31 October 2021.[25] Kishida gave his first speech as prime minister on 8 October 2021, vowing to fight and end the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan as well as announcing measures to counter the perceived threats by China and North Korea.[26]\n\n\nFollowing the 2021 Japanese general election, Kishida maintained the premiership, although the LDP lost 25 seats.[27] He formed the Second Kishida Cabinet by replacing Toshimitsu Motegi with Yoshimasa Hayashi as the Foreign Minister; Motegi became the party's Secretary-General.[28]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2022, Kishida instructed his government to increase \"national security-related spending\" to 2 percent of Japan's GDP, while increasing the military budget from 5.4 trillion yen ($40 billion) in 2022 to 8.9 trillion yen ($66 billion) by 2027, up 65%. This would lead to a spending a total of around 43 trillion yen ($321 billion) between 2023-2027, up 56% from 2019–2023.[29]\n\n\nKishida set child care as his government's priority for the year 2023. He emphasized the potential consequences of declining birth rates in Japan, and stated that his administration would increase monetary child benefits given to parents.[30] He announced a plan to double the country's children-related budget by June 2023, and instructed government ministers in the administration to outline child care plans by the end of March 2023.[31][32] On 1 June, Kishida's government officially set aside ¥3.5 trillion annually for child care, but was criticized for lack of specific details in his child care plan.[33][34]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Kishida fired an aide after the aide made homophobic comments in local media. According to the report, Masayoshi Arai stated that Japanese people would flee the country if same-sex marriage were permitted. Arai also claimed that Japanese people do not want to have members of the LGBT community as their neighbors.[35]\n\n\nOn 13 March 2023, Kishida's government ended the request for citizens to wear face masks in public, a policy initiated to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan that was made 3 years earlier.[36] On 27 April, Kishida's Health Minister, Katsunobu Katō, announced that the government would downgrade the classification of COVID-19 to be on par with \"seasonal flu\", by 8 May.[37]\n\n\nKishida appointed Kazuo Ueda as Governor of the Bank of Japan in April 2023, who stated he planned to continue the ultra easy monetary policy introduced by the outgoing Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.[38] A few weeks before his next cabinet reshuffle, Kishida stated he wanted to raise the hourly minimum wage in Japan to about ¥1,500 ($10.29) by 2030.[39]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of Japan\n\n![](image)Kishida at the 2022 Quadrilateral Security Dialogue meeting with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese, US president Joe Biden and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi\nIn keeping with the Free and Open Indo-Pacific policy, Kishida has visited Quad nations such as India and Australia to ensure the status quo in the region remains unchanged.[40] Kishida has also visited nations in Europe, along with Canada and the United States, with Japan hosting the 49th G7 summit in May 2023.[41] Kishida has condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and visisted Kyiv in a historic trip.[42] In November 2022, he accused China of violating Japan's sovereignty in the East China Sea and criticised the persecution of the Uyghur minority in China's Xinjiang province.[43] Kishida supported Bangladesh's efforts to repatriate Rohingya refugees to Myanmar.[44] Kishida attended the 2022 NATO summit in Spain, as well as the 2023 NATO summit in Lithuania.[45]\n\n\nIn October 2023, Kishida condemned Hamas' actions during the Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Defense and the G7\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: G7 and 49th G7 summit\n\n![](image)Fumio Kishida at the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima, May 2023\nIn November 2022, Kishida instructed his government to increase military spending to 2 percent of Japan's GDP, up from 1 percent previously, by 2027. Following this resolution by the cabinet, Kishida began a tour of members of the Group of Seven in January 2023. Kishida first met with President Emanuel Macron of France on 9 January 2023.[47] The following day, he met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and agreed on a \"strategic partnership\".[48] On 11 January 2023, Kishida met with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in London, where the two signed a joint defence pact.[49] The following day, Kishida met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa to discuss trade and other issues.[50] On 13 January, Kishida visited President Joe Biden of the United States in Washington, D.C.;[51] the previous day Japan's Foreign Minister and Defense Minister met with their American counterparts, where they affirmed the Japan-United States alliance remained unchanged.[52]\n\n\nIn 2023 Japan chaired the Group of Seven, with the 49th G7 summit being hosted in Hiroshima Prefecture in May of that year.[53] As the host leader, Kishida invited various leaders from the \"Global South\", including Vietnamese Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, among others.[54][55] With the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kishida also invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[56] On 19 May 2023, Kishida and the other G7 leaders arrived at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, where they paid respects and visited the museum.[57] That day, the leaders also issued a joint statement on Ukraine, and affirmed their support for Ukraine and the rule of law.[58] The summit concluded on 21 May, and was ultimately considered a success by Kishida.[59][60][61]\n\n\n\n#### Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Russian invasion of Ukraine and 2023 visit by Fumio Kishida to Ukraine\n\n![](image)Kishida inspecting the burial place in the city of BuchaOn 24 February 2022, following the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kishida joined other leaders of the G7 nations in imposing economic sanctions on Russia. Kishida's proposed sanctions were much harsher than the largely symbolic sanctions imposed by the government of Shinzo Abe on Russia following the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. Liberal Democratic Party leaders feared that a lackluster response by Japan to the Ukrainian crisis would result in a lack of support from Japan's European allies in the event of potential Chinese attack against Taiwan.[62] In March 2022, Kishida announced that Japan would accept Ukrainian refugees.[63]\n\n\nIn December 2022 the Kishida government announced a $320 billion increase in military spending, due in part to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[64][65] On January 14, 2023, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called for Kishida to commit \"seppuku\" after he and Joe Biden warned Russia against using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.[66]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Kishida said Japan would provide roughly $5.5 billion in aid to Ukraine during the invasion.[67] Kishida invited President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to a virtual meeting of G7 leaders, which was held on 24 February 2023, the first anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The G7 announced it would introduce \"new coordinated economic actions\" in efforts to support Ukraine.[68] Kishida was the last G7 leader to visit Kyiv during the invasion; pressure grew for him to do so following Biden's visit in February 2023.[69] On 21 March 2023, Kishida visited Ukraine and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[70] Kishida also visited Bucha in Ukraine's Kyiv Oblast, the site of a civilian massacre that was perpetrated by Russia.[71] Kishida was praised for the visit, and said he was \"outraged by the cruelty\".[72] In May 2023, Japan announced it would provide 100 military vehicles to the Ukrainian military.[73] Kishida led G7 leaders in announcing a joint declaration of support for Ukraine, during the 2023 Vilinius summit for NATO.[74]\n\n\n\n#### Indonesia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Indonesia-Japan relations\n\n![](image)Fumio meet President Jokowi in Tokyo, July 2022.\nOn 27 July 2022 Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Wednesday he and President Joko Widodo had agreed during talks to cooperate in a variety of fields, including energy and maritime security. Japan also agreed to provide 43.6 billion yen ($318.25 million) in loans to Indonesia for use in infrastructure projects and disaster prevention, Reuters reported. At the outset of the meeting in Tokyo, Kishida told Jokowi that Japan hopes to work with Indonesia to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific region, a vision that Japan is pursuing amid China's rise. Jokowi, meanwhile, conveyed his condolences over the death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this month, saying the late former leader helped advance bilateral relations to a strategic partnership.[75]\n\n\nOn 14 November 2022 President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) commended Japan's support for Indonesia's G20 Presidency as well as for other concrete projects that have been established.\nPM Kishida also praised Jokowi for welcoming him to a side meeting ahead of the implementation of the G20 Summit to be held on November 15–16.\nRegarding the 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Japan and Indonesia in 2023, Kishida believes that the partnership between the two countries will continue to strengthen.[76]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Japan–South Korea relations and Camp David Principles\n\n![](image)Kishida meeting with South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol in 2023\nOn relations between Japan and South Korea, both Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol have taken steps to mend and expand ties, while attempting to settle historical issues stemming from World War II and the Japanese occupation of Korea.[77] In remarks on 1 March 2023, Yoon said that Japan had gone from 'aggressor to partner'.[78] On 16 March 2023 Kishida held a summit with Yoon in Tokyo to settle war time labor disputes, among other issues.[79][80]\n\n\nOn 7 May 2023, Kishida arrived in Seoul for a two day trip to South Korea.[81] The reciprocal trip was the first between leaders of Japan and South Korea in 12 years.[82] During his visit, Yoon said that the historical issues had to be \"completely settled\".[83] While in Seoul, Kishida expressed sympathies to Koreans who lived under the Japanese Empire.[84] Kishida was criticized by some in South Korea for not directly apologizing during the meeting.[85] The meetings were praised by US President Joe Biden, calling it a \"groundbreaking new chapter of cooperation and partnership\" between both nations.[86]\n\n\nKishida invited President Yoon to attend the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima as an invitee.[54] President Biden also invited Kishida and Yoon to meet in Washington D.C. during the G7 Hiroshima summit for further talks.[87] Kishida met with Yoon and Biden on 18 August during a historic summit hosted by Biden at Camp David in the United States. The three announced the Camp David Principles, a set of strategies to counter the influence of China, North Korea, and Russia as well as limit the risk of economic disruptions in the future.[88] All three nations agreed to further expand military ties, which involved intelligence sharing, annual military drills, and a wider security pact.[89] Biden again praised both leaders for their \"...political courage... to work together.\"[90] The summit additionally reaffirmed a shared goal of a \"free and open Indo-Pacific\", a concept first introduced by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2016.[91] During the summit, Kishida also promised Biden $2 million in relief aid for the wildfires in Hawaii.[92] The summit was a first of its kind and was hailed as the beginning of a new era by the US.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Africa\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with Kenyan President William Ruto, 2 May 2023\nKishida has attempted to deepen ties between Japan and African nations, while also promoting peace and stability in the region. In August 2022, while addressing a summit in Tunisia, Kishida promised $30 billion in aid for the development of African countries for the next 3 years.[94][95]\n\n\nLater on 30 April 2023, Kishida began an African tour and visited the League of Arab States based in Egypt, and met with President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi; Kishida offered a yen loan to fund a metro line project in Cairo.[96] The next day on 1 May, Kishida visited Ghana. During a meeting with President Nana Akufo-Addo, Kishida emphasized the importance of Japanese investment in the country, and bilateral relations in the international arena.[97] Ghana and Japan both agreed to pursue reforms in the UN Security Council as well.[98] While in Ghana, Kishida pledged $500 million in more financial aid to Africa, in perceived contrast from China's Belt and Road Initiative in the continent.[99] On 3 May, Kishida arrived in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. He met with Kenyan President William Ruto, who agreed to deepen cooperation and to bolster economic and energy ties.[100] The two condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and reiterated their desire for a peaceful Indo-Pacific.[101] Kishida announced that Japan would continue to give assistance for infrastructure in Kenya. Ruto and Kishida signed an agreement allowing Kenyans to access jobs in Japan, bolstering economic relations.[102]\n\n\n\n### Assassination of Shinzo Abe and cabinet reshuffle\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Assassination of Shinzo Abe and Second Kishida Cabinet (First Reshuffle)\n\n![](image)Kishida delivering the memorial address at the state funeral of Shinzo Abe\nAfter the assassination of Shinzo Abe on 8 July 2022, Kishida condemned the assassination,[103] but refused to suspend political campaigning so as to demonstrate that democracy would not be impeded by violence. He later blamed insufficient police protection for allowing the murder to occur.[104] Because of media reports on the ties between the LDP and the Unification Church, a Korean cult accused of scamming Japanese followers (including the suspect's mother) out of much of their wealth, Kishida reshuffled his Cabinet on 10 August 2022, which included removing Abe's brother, Nobuo Kishi, from the role of Minister of Defense.[105] Taro Kono was made the Minister of Digital Affairs. While the majority of members of the LDP, including Shinzo Abe and Nobuo Kishi, were related to the church to various degrees, there were no evidences of Kishida having any direct tie with the church or any of its affiliated entities.[106] However, it was reported in the 1 September issue of *Shūkan Bunshun* that Mineo Nakayama [ja], the president of a Kumamoto circle for backing Kishida's bid for the premiership, was also a chairperson of a Unification Church-affiliated group which was advocating for building the Japan-Korea Undersea Tunnel. Both Kishida and Nakayama denied any knowledge of the tunnel advocacy group being related to the Unification Church.[107]\n\n\n\n### Assassination attempt\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Attempted assassination of Fumio Kishida\n\nSee also: 2023 Japan by-elections\n![](image)Kishida (the day after the attack) during a press conference\nOn 15 April 2023, a man threw a cylindrical explosive at Kishida shortly before he was due to make a campaign speech in Wakayama. The device exploded after a short delay during which Kishida was evacuated from the scene unharmed. Ryuji Kimura, a 24-year-old man from Hyogo Prefecture, was arrested at the scene, with cameras showing him holding what appeared to be a second cylindrical object as he was tackled to the ground. The incident took place as Kishida was talking with a candidate of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party just before his scheduled speech. Kishida immediately left by car after the incident and continued with his stump speech elsewhere in the city. He stated at an event later in the day that \"elections are a bedrock of democracy,\" adding that it was extremely unforgivable that such violence took place.[108][109] Kimura was indicted by Wakayama prosecutors on 7 September 2023 for attempted murder, among other charges.[110]\n\n\n\n### Fukushima water release\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Discharge of radioactive water of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant\n\nIn April 2021, the government of Yoshihide Suga, Kishida's predecessor, announced that the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) would eventually begin to discharge stored and treated water from the dismantled Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean, a process that would take 30 years.[111] Kishida's government confirmed they would continue with the water release, in August 2023.[112] Proceeding the water dump, Kishida's government reached an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the levels of tritium in the stored water that would be discharged, and received a comprehensive report affirming the safety of the operation from Rafael Grossi, the IAEA's Secretary-General, in July 2023.[113] Later in August, Grossi stated that the levels of tritium were vastly below the safety standards recommended by the IAEA, and confirmed the water wasn't toxic.[114] Before the dumping, the Ministry of Environment confirmed IAEA standards were being followed, and the levels of radioactive tritium in the water would remain below IAEA dilution regulations.[115] TEPCO announced that dumping had begun on 24 August 2023, beginning the discharge of the water. No errors were reported in the release.[116]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kishida inspecting the Fukushima nuclear plant, 20 August 2023.\nFollowing the announcement of the water release, there was positive and negative feedback from both inside Japan and internationally. Domestic organizations, such as the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, were opposed to the plan.[112] The strongest foreign backlash came from China, which was opposed to the dumping. The Chinese central government placed an outright ban on all Japanese fish products, which accounted for the largest of Japan's fish exports.[117] China was heavily criticized for the ban, and was also accused of hypocrisy and spreading disinformation, as they had released nuclear waste water previously that contained significantly higher levels of tritium.[118] In the days following the release, a number of phone calls regarding the water release from Chinese speakers were made harassing people, companies, and government agencies in Japan.[119] Kishida said the calls were \"deplorable\", and appealed to China to urge its government to ask its citizens to stop the harassing calls.[120] The phone calls came as protests occurred  in China, as well in South Korea and Japan.[121] The Foreign Ministry issued a travel advisory urging Japanese citizens to use caution in China, citing an escalation of harassments and violent protests. Sanae Takaichi, the Minister of State for Economic Security, said the government would consider filing a World Trade Organization complaint in response to the import bans imposed by China.[122] The United States affirmed their support for the water release; American ambassador Rahm Emanuel even visited Fukushima and ate seafood to demonstrate a show of support.[123] In South Korea, various protest were held against the decision. However, the South Korean government did not oppose the plan, and President Yoon also ate seafood from Fukushima to encourage others that it was safe.[124]\n\n\nThrough the early stages of the release, the Environment Ministry conducted numerous tests concerning the levels of tritium in the water as well as in the fish, and stated the levels remained low.[125] The effects on the fish markets were expected to be severe, and Kishida promised to financially support local fisheries.[126] On August 30, Kishida, along with three cabinet ministers, publicly ate fish sashimi from Fukushima in an effort to dispel fears of radioactive contamination.[127] He called it \"safe and delicious\".[128]\n\n\n\n## Political views\n\n[edit]\n\nKishida is the leader of the moderate Kōchikai faction.[1][129] and has been described as a moderate conservative[130] and a centrist politician.[131][10]\n\n\nIn the Diet he is president of the parliamentary league for Public Interest Capitalism[132] and the parliamentary league to Create a New Capitalism,[133] is associated with the Nippon Kaigi parliamentary league[134] and is a founding member of the \"Realization of Selective Surnames System\" Diet group which has the aim of allowing married couples to keep different surnames if they wish.[135]\n\n\n\n### Economic policy\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 2021 LDP presidential race, he called for Japan to strive for a new form of capitalism to reduce income disparity, saying neoliberalism and deregulation had widened economic gaps in society.[136][137] In a parliamentary session on 20 February 2022 he reiterated that the benefits of growth should not belong to a limited group adding that \"[c]apitalism isn't sustainable unless it is something that belongs to all stakeholders\".[138]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, February 2017Kishida is seen as dovish on foreign policy and lukewarm about revising Japan's pacifist constitution.[139][1] Following the political philosophy of his own faction, Kishida has pledged a \"humane diplomacy\" based on the Peace Constitution, the Japan–U.S. alliance, and the Self-Defense Forces and that he will seek to strengthen Japan–U.S. relations and to promote the free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy while counterbalancing Chinese political assertiveness and military presence in the region.[1] Regarding Chinese influence over Taiwan and Hong Kong, Kishida has stated that the Taiwan Strait may be the \"next major diplomatic problem\" following \"China's clampdown on Hong Kong\" and that Japan should seek more cooperation with Taiwan.[140]\n\n\nIn 2017, while serving as foreign minister, Kishida pressured China to push North Korea towards denuclearization.[141] During the race for the leadership of the LDP, Kishida also addressed the issue of Japanese abductees by North Korea and supported a summit between Japan and North Korea to end the issue.[142] Kishida also took a stronger stance than other contenders regarding China and North Korea, saying that Japan should strengthen its defenses, while at the same time recognizing that there is a clash between authoritarianism and democracy in the region, especially with regard to the status of Taiwan.[143]\n\n\nFumio Kishida has requested that the German government remove Friedensstatue [de], a variant of the Statue of Peace, in Berlin. The request has caused considerable controversy in South Korea.[144][145][146][147]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear policy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida delivering a speech in October 2017Kishida is in favor of retaining nuclear power technology, which he says should be considered as a clean energy option, while also calling for the establishment of a $90.7 billion university fund to further stimulate science and promotion of renewable energy.[136]\n\n\nBeing a representative from Hiroshima, Kishida has consistently advocated for Japanese diplomacy to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).[1] In the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kishida rejected former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's proposal for Japan to consider hosting U.S. nuclear weapons as a deterrent, calling it \"unacceptable\" given the country's stance of maintaining the three non-nuclear principles.[148]\n\n\n\n### Social issues\n\n[edit]\n\nKishida stated support for discussions toward allowing married Japanese couples to choose between unified single surnames or separate last names,[149] while on the topic of same-sex marriage Kishida has stated he has not come to support it, saying instead that the public's opinion should be understood before the Diet decides.[150][151] In 2023 he stated that Japan must \"be extremely careful in considering the matter as it could affect the structure of family life in Japan\".[152] In the Diet's budget committee on February 28, 2023, responding to an opposition lawmaker question, he stated that \"I don't think disallowing same-sex couples to marry is unjust discrimination by the state\", repeating his position that a same-sex marriage ban \"is not unconstitutional\" and denying that he is discriminatory adding \"I have never stated I'm against it\". His comment sparked criticism from opposition lawmakers and LGBTQ activists, who questioned whether Kishida was backpedaling from an earlier meeting that month with LGBTQ representatives to show consideration to ultra-conservatives in his party who oppose sexual diversity.[153]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1988, Kishida married Yuko Kishida, the daughter of a Japanese real estate investor, in an arranged marriage. The couple have three sons.[154] In one presentation, Yuko was featured in the LDP messaging immediately after he became the *de facto* PM-designate.[8][155] He is a fan of the manga series *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba* and has pledged to financially support the Japanese animation industry during his premiership.[156] He is also a fan of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp baseball team.[10]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Kishida dismissed his eldest son, Shotaro Kishida, from his role as policy secretary, effective 1 June 2023, for misuse of government resources.[157] Photos had surfaced of Shotaro hosting parties at the Prime Minister's official residence and of him posing as the Prime Minister. Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, called the actions \"inappropriate\".[158]\n\n\n\n## Honours\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![](image) Netherlands: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau (29 October 2014).[159]\n* ![](image) Spain: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (31 March 2017)[160]\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Akimoto, Daisuke (7 September 2021). \"The Arrival of Kishida Diplomacy?\". *The Diplomat*.

A member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), he previously served as Vice Chancellor in the fourth Merkel cabinet and as Federal Minister of Finance from 2018 to 2021. He was also First Mayor of Hamburg from 2011 to 2018, deputy leader of the SPD from 2009 to 2019, and Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs from 2007 to 2009.\n\n\nScholz began his career as a lawyer specialising in labour and employment law. He became a member of the SPD in the 1970s and was a member of the Bundestag from 1998 to 2011. Scholz served in the Hamburg Government under First Mayor Ortwin Runde in 2001 and became General Secretary of the SPD in 2002, where he served alongside SPD leader and then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. He became his party's Chief Whip in the Bundestag, later entering the First Merkel Government in 2007 as Federal Minister for Labour and Social Affairs. After the SPD moved into the opposition following the 2009 election, Scholz returned to lead the SPD in Hamburg. He was then elected Deputy Leader of the SPD. He led his party to victory in the 2011 Hamburg state election and became First Mayor, a position he held until 2018.\n\n\nAfter the Social Democratic Party entered the fourth Merkel government in 2018, Scholz was appointed as both Minister of Finance and Vice Chancellor of Germany. In 2020, he was nominated as the SPD's candidate for Chancellor of Germany for the 2021 federal election. The party won a plurality of seats in the Bundestag and formed a \"traffic light coalition\" with Alliance 90/The Greens and the Free Democratic Party. On 8 December 2021, Scholz was elected and sworn in as Chancellor by the Bundestag, succeeding Angela Merkel.\n\n\nAs Chancellor, Scholz has overseen Germany's response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite taking a more restrained and cautious response than many other Western leaders, Scholz oversaw a significant increase in the German defence budget, weapons shipments to Ukraine, and the cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Three days after the invasion, Scholz set out the principles of a new German defence policy in his Zeitenwende speech.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nScholz was born on 14 June 1958, in Osnabrück, Lower Saxony, and grew up in Hamburg's Rahlstedt district.[3] His parents worked in the textile industry.[4] He has two younger brothers, Jens Scholz, an anesthesiologist and CEO of the University Medical Center Schleswig Holstein;[5] and Ingo Scholz, a tech entrepreneur. \n\n\nOlaf Scholz attended the Bekassinenau elementary school in Oldenfelde, and then switched to the Großlohering elementary school in Großlohe. After graduating from high school in 1977, he began studying law at the University of Hamburg in 1978 as part of a one-stage legal training course.[6] He later found employment as a lawyer specialising in labour and employment law, working at the law firm Zimmermann, Scholz und Partner.[7] Scholz joined the Social Democratic Party at the age of 17.[3]\n\n\nScholz's family is traditionally Lutheran, and he was baptized in the Protestant Church in Germany. He holds largely secular political views, and left the Church in adulthood, but has emphasised a need for appreciation of Germany's Christian heritage and culture.[8]\n\n\n\n## Political career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Early political career\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Young socialist, 1975–1989\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz at the Young Socialists Congress, 1984\nScholz joined the SPD in 1975 as a student, where he came into contact with the Jusos, the youth organization of the SPD. From 1982 to 1988, he was Deputy Federal Chairman of the Jusos. Scholz was also Vice President of the International Union of Socialist Youth from 1987 to 1989. He supported the Freudenberger Kreis, a Marxist wing of the Jusos' university groups, arguing that society should \"overcome the capitalist economy\" in one of his publications.[9] In it, Scholz criticized the \"aggressive-imperialist NATO\", the Federal Republic as the \"European stronghold of big business\" and the social-liberal coalition, which puts the \"bare maintenance of power above any form of substantive dispute\".[10] Referring to this period in his life, Scholz has later said that he \"made almost all possible mistakes at some point.\"[9]\n\n\nOn 4 January 1984, Scholz and other Juso leaders attended a meeting in East Germany with Egon Krenz, then secretary of the Central Committee of the SED, and Herbert Häber, member of the Politburo of the SED-Central Committee.[*citation needed*] In 1987, Scholz crossed the inner-German border again and stood up for disarmament agreements as Juso-Vice at an FDJ peace rally in Wittenberg.[11]\n\n\n\n#### Member of the Bundestag, 1998–2001\n\n[edit]\n\nScholz was elected to his first political office as a Deputy Member of the Bundestag representing the constituency of Hamburg-Altona in 1998, aged 40.[12] During his tenure, Scholz served on the Committee for Labor and Social Matters. In the committee of inquiry into the visa affair of the Bundestag, he was chairman of the SPD parliamentary group.[13] Scholz resigned his mandate on 6 June 2001, to take office as Senator.[*clarification needed*] Because his seat was an overhang seat, it was not filled until the 2002 German federal election.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Senator for the Interior of Hamburg, 2001\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 30 May 2001, Scholz succeeded Hartmuth Wrocklage to become Senator for the Interior of Hamburg in the Senate led by Mayor Ortwin Runde. Wrocklage had resigned due to allegations of nepotism. He also succeeded Wrocklage as Deputy Member of the Bundesrat.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring his brief time as Senator, Scholz controversially[*clarification needed*] approved the involuntary use of emetics to gather evidence from suspected drug dealers.[14] The Hamburg Medical Chamber expressed disapproval of this practice due to potential health risks.[15]\n\n\nScholz left office in October 2001, after the defeat of his party at the 2001 Hamburg state election and the election of Ole von Beust as First Mayor. His successor was Ronald Schill, who had won on a Law and order platform, with an emphasis on harsh penalties for drug dealers.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Federal and state political career\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Member of the Bundestag, 2002–2011\n\n[edit]\n\nScholz was elected again to the Bundestag in the 2002 German federal election. From 2002 to 2004, Scholz also served as General Secretary of the SPD; he resigned from that office when party leader and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, facing disaffection within his own party and hampered by persistently low public approval ratings, announced he would step down as Leader of the Social Democratic Party.[18]\n\n\nScholz was one of a series of politicians who sparked debate over the German journalistic norm of allowing interviewees to \"authorize\" and amend quotes before publication. This came after his press team insisted on extensively editing an interview with *Die Tageszeitung* in 2003.[19][20] *Die Tageszeitung* editor Bascha Mika condemned the norm as a \"betrayal of the claim to a free press\", and the newspaper ultimately published the interview with Scholz's answers blacked out.[21][22]\n\n\nScholz served as the SPD spokesperson on the inquiry committee investigating the 2005 German Visa Affair. Following the federal election later that year, he served as First Parliamentary Secretary of the SPD Bundestag Group. He also became Chief Whip of the Social Democratic Party. In this capacity, he worked closely with the CDU Chief Whip Norbert Röttgen to manage and defend the grand coalition led by Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Bundestag.[23] Scholz also served as a member of the Parliamentary Oversight Panel, which provides parliamentary oversight of the German federal intelligence services; the BND, MAD and BfV.[24]\n\n\n\n#### Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, 2007–2009\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007, Scholz was appointed to serve as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs in the first Merkel Government, succeeding Franz Müntefering.[25][26]\n\n\nFollowing the 2009 federal election, when the SPD left the Government, Scholz was elected as Deputy Leader of the SPD, replacing Frank-Walter Steinmeier. [*citation needed*] Between 2009 and 2011, he was also a member of the SPD group's Afghanistan/Pakistan Task Force.[27] In 2010, he participated in the annual Bilderberg Meeting in Sitges, Spain.[28]\n\n\n\n#### First Mayor of Hamburg, 2011–2018\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz in March 2011, on the government benches in the Hamburg Parliament, shortly after his election as First Mayor\nIn 2011, Scholz was the lead SPD candidate at the Hamburg state election, which the SPD won with 48.3% of the votes, taking 62 of 121 seats in the Hamburg Parliament.[29] Scholz resigned as a Member of the Bundestag on 11 March 2011, days after his formal election as First Mayor of Hamburg; Dorothee Stapelfeldt, also a Social Democrat, was appointed his Deputy First Mayor.[30][31][32]\n\n\nIn his capacity as First Mayor, Scholz represented Hamburg and Germany internationally. On 7 June 2011, Scholz attended the state dinner hosted by President Barack Obama in honor of Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House.[33] As host of Hamburg's annual St. Matthias' Day banquet for the city's civic and business leaders, he brought several notable guests of honour to the city, including Jean-Marc Ayrault, Prime Minister of France, in 2013; David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in 2016; and Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, in 2017.[34] From 2015 until 2018, Scholz also served as Commissioner of the Federal Republic of Germany for Cultural Affairs under the Treaty on Franco-German Cooperation.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz and the spouses of the heads of state and government at the G20 in Hamburg, 2017\nIn 2013, Scholz opposed a public initiative aiming at a complete buyback of energy grids that the city of Hamburg had sold to utilities Vattenfall Europe AG and E.ON decades before; he argued this would overburden the city, whose debt stood at more than 20 billion euros at the time.[36]\n\n\nScholz was asked to participate in exploratory talks between the CDU, CSU and SPD parties to form a coalition government following the 2013 federal election.[37] In the subsequent negotiations, he led the SPD delegation in the financial policy working group; his co-chair from the CDU/CSU was Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble.[38] Alongside fellow Social Democrats Jörg Asmussen and Thomas Oppermann, Scholz was reported in the media to be a possible successor to Schäuble in the post of Finance Minister at the time; whilst Schäuble remained in post, the talks to form a coalition were ultimately successful.[39]\n\n\nIn a paper compiled in late 2014, Scholz and Schäuble proposed redirecting revenue from the solidarity surcharge on income and corporate tax (*Solidaritätszuschlag*) to subsidize the federal states' interest payments.[40]\n\n\nUnder Scholz's leadership, the Social Democrats won the 2015 state election in Hamburg, receiving around 47% of the vote.[41] He formed a coalition government with the Green Party, with Green leader Katharina Fegebank being appointed to serve as Deputy First Mayor.[42][43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz speaking at the Global Citizen Festival 2017 in Hamburg\nIn 2015, Scholz led Hamburg's bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics with an estimated budget of €11.2 billion (US$12.6 billion), competing against Los Angeles, Paris, Rome, and Budapest. In a referendum, the citizens of Hamburg later rejected the city's candidacy, with more than half voting against the project.[44][45] Later that year, Scholz – alongside Minister-President Torsten Albig of Schleswig-Holstein – negotiated a debt-restructuring deal with the European Commission. The deal allowed German regional lender HSH Nordbank to offload €6.2 billion in problematic assets, primarily underperforming ship loans, onto its government majority owners and avoid being shut down, saving around 2,500 jobs.[46]\n\n\nIn 2017, Scholz was criticised for his handling of riots that took place during the G20 summit in Hamburg.[7]\n\n\nIn late 2021, Scholz was widely criticised for his handling of the CumEx tax fraud at M. M. Warburg & Co. when he was the mayor of Hamburg.[47][48]\n\n\n\n#### Vice Chancellor and Minister of Finance, 2018–2021\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz (SPD), Angela Merkel (CDU) and Horst Seehofer (CSU) presenting the 2018 coalition agreement for Germany's fourth Merkel cabinet\nAfter a lengthy period of inter-party negotiations following the 2017 federal election, during which the CDU, CSU and SPD agreed to continue in coalition, Scholz was appointed Federal Minister of Finance. Scholz was sworn in alongside the rest of the fourth Merkel cabinet on 14 March 2018, also taking the role of Vice Chancellor of Germany under Angela Merkel.[49] Within his first months in office, Scholz became one of Germany's most popular politicians, reaching an approval rating of 50%.[50]\n\n\nIn 2019, Scholz ran for leader of the SPD, but lost to Norbert Walter-Borjans.[51]\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, Scholz drafted a series of financial rescue packages for the country's economy, including a €130 billion stimulus package in June 2020. The stimulus package included support for businesses and freelancers as well as a decision to keep factories open. This is often credited as having prevented mass layoffs, and the effects of the COVID-19 financial crisis on the German economy were initially relatively low.[52][53] Scholz also oversaw the allocation of funding received from Next Generation EU, the European Union's €750 billion COVID-19 recovery fund. 90% of the €28 billion available to Germany was invested into climate protection and digitization.[54]\n\n\nAt the G7 summit in June 2021, the G7 agreed on a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15%, which had been proposed by Scholz.[55][56] Scholz is credited as having convinced President of the U.S. Joe Biden to agree to the proposal, which his predecessor Donald Trump had been opposed to.[57] Also in June 2021, Scholz oversaw the Federal Central Tax Office's purchase of information regarding German citizens using Dubai for tax avoidance and evasion.[58]\n\n\nScholz was criticized in the context of the Wirecard scandal; serious misconduct by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), which is under the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Finance, is alleged to have contributed to the longevity of the fraudulent business.[59][60] During Scholz's time in office, the Ministry of Finance was one of the subjects of parliamentary inquiry into the scandal, but Scholz has denied any personal responsibility.[61][62] Having vowed to strengthen financial market supervision, he replaced BaFin president Felix Hufeld.[63][64]\n\n\n\n### Political views in the 2010s\n\n[edit]\n\nWithin the SPD, Scholz is widely viewed as forming part of the moderate wing of the party.[7] Because of his flat enunciation and mechanical-sounding choice of words in press conferences and interviews, Scholz has been nicknamed \"the Scholzomat\" by some media outlets. In 2013, he said that he found the nickname \"very appropriate\".[65][66] In January 2019, Scholz stated that he sees China primarily as an economic partner.[67] He tried to persuade Chinese Vice Premier Liu He that China should be more open to German firms,[68] and he supported the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment between the EU and China.[69] In September 2022, he condemned the treatment of ethnic Uyghurs in China's Xinjiang.[70]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Scholz condemned the Turkish invasion of the Kurdish-controlled northeastern areas of Syria, otherwise known as Rojava.[71]\n\n\n\n#### Economic and financial policy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz and US Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin in 2018\nScholz has been campaigning for a financial transaction tax for several years. Experts have criticized parts of this plan, arguing that it would disproportionately affect small shareholders.[72][73][74][75] In December 2019, Scholz pushed for the introduction of this tax at European Union level. According to a draft legislation, share purchases should be taxed when they involve shares in companies with a market capitalization over €1 billion.[76] Journalist Hermann-Josef Tenhagen criticized this version of the transaction tax on the basis that it would disproportionately affect lower-income individuals.[77] A report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy commissioned by the Federal Government in 2020 certified the same deficiencies in the tax concept that Tenhagen had already pointed out.[78]\n\n\nDuring his tenure as minister of finance, Scholz prioritized not taking on new government debt and limiting public spending.[50] In 2018, he suggested the creation of an EU-wide unemployment insurance system to make the Eurozone more resilient to future economic shocks.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Environment and climate policy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2019, Scholz negotiated the climate package in a key role for the SPD. To this he said: \"What we have presented is a great achievement\", whereas climate scientists almost unanimously criticized the result as insufficient.[80][81][82][83][84]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Scholz held a phone call with US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, discussing a lift of US sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. In exchange, Scholz offered 1 billion euros in subsidies to liquid gas terminals in northern Germany for US liquid gas imports.[85][86][87] The move sparked controversy with regards to the SPD's stance towards renewable energy.[88][89]\n\n\nThe revised Climate Protection Act introduced by Olaf Scholz's cabinet as Mayor of Hamburg provides for a 65% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, an 88% reduction by 2040 and climate neutrality by 2045.[90]\n\n\nScholz has advocated for the expansion of renewable energy capacities to replace fossil fuels.[91] In May 2021, Scholz proposed the establishment of an international climate club, which should serve to develop common minimum standards for climate policy measures and a coordinated approach. In addition, uniform rules for the carbon accounting of goods should apply among members.[92]\n\n\nAs part of the coalition agreement that led to Scholz becoming chancellor, the Social Democrats, Free Democrats, and Green party agreed to accelerate Germany's phaseout of coal to the year 2030, in line with the target set by the Powering Past Coal Alliance. The country's previous target had been to end the use of coal by 2038. In addition, the agreement set a phaseout of power generation from natural gas by 2040. The agreement also included provisions for the prohibition on natural gas heating in new buildings and replacement of natural gas systems in existing buildings. An end to the sale of combustion vehicles would come in 2035, in line with the target set by the European Commission.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Relationship with the United States\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2019, Scholz criticized US sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, saying: \"Such sanctions are a serious interference in the internal affairs of Germany and Europe and their sovereignty.\"[94]\n\n\nScholz has expressed support for a longstanding agreement that allows American tactical nuclear weapons to be stored and maintained on American bases within Germany.[95][96]\n\n\n\n#### Candidate for party co-leadership, 2019\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2019 Social Democratic Party of Germany leadership election\n\nIn June 2019, Scholz initially ruled out a candidacy for the party co-leadership following the resignation of Andrea Nahles. He explained that a simultaneous activity as Federal Minister of Finance and party leader was \"not possible in terms of time\".[97][98][99] However, in August, Scholz announced his intention to run for party chairmanship with Klara Geywitz.[100][101] He said that many of his preferred candidates had not run for office, expressing a sense of \"responsibility\".[102] Of the six candidate duos standing for election, the Geywitz-Scholz due received the most votes in the first round of the membership elections on 26 October 2019, with 22.7%. They qualified for the runoff election with the second-placed team Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, which had received 21.0% of the vote.[103]\n\n\nOn 30 November 2019, it was announced that Esken and Walter-Borjans had received 53.1% of the vote in the runoff election, with Geywitz and Scholz only receiving 45.3%.[104] This was seen as an upset victory for the left-wing of the SPD, including skeptics of the grand coalition with the CDU. Esken and Walter-Borjans were little-known to the public at large, Esken being a backbencher in the Bundestag and Walter-Borjans being the former Minister of Finance of North Rhine-Westphalia from 2010 to 2017. Scholz on the other hand had the backing of much of the party establishment.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Chancellor candidate, 2021\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 2021 German federal election\n\n![](image)Scholz at an election campaign event\nOn 10 August 2020, SPD party leadership agreed that it would nominate Scholz to be the party's candidate for Chancellor of Germany at the 2021 federal election.[105] Scholz is usually grouped with the moderate wing of the SPD,[106] and his nomination was seen by *Die Tageszeitung* as marking a decline of the party's left.[107]\n\n\nScholz led the SPD to a narrow victory in the election, with the party receiving 25.8% of the second votes and 206 seats in the Bundestag.[108] Following this victory, Scholz was widely considered to be the most likely next Chancellor of Germany in a traffic light coalition with The Greens and the Free Democratic Party.[109]\n\n\nOn 24 November, the SPD, Green and FDP reached a coalition agreement, naming Scholz as the new German chancellor.[110]\n\n\n\n## Chancellor of Germany, 2021–present\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Scholz cabinet\n\n![](image)Scholz and Finnish Prime Minister Marin in 2022\n![](image)Scholz meets President Biden in March 2023.\nScholz was elected Chancellor by the Bundestag on 8 December 2021, with 395 votes in favour and 303 against.[111] His new government was appointed on the same day by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.[112] At 63 years, 177 days of age, Scholz is the oldest person to become Chancellor of Germany since Ludwig Erhard, who was 66 years, 255 days old when he assumed office on 17 October 1963.\n\n\nIn December 2021, Scholz travelled to Warsaw for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, where they discussed the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would bring Russian gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany and bypass Poland, and Poland's dispute with the European Union over the primacy of EU law. Scholz backed Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants seeking entry from Belarus.[113]\n\n\nScholz extended into 2022 the suspension of the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia.[114] The decision was made to \"no longer approve any export sales to countries as long as they are directly involved\" in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.[115] In September 2022, Scholz visited the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, seeking to deepen ties with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and find alternative sources of energy.[116] Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received Scholz in Jeddah.[117] Scholz's government approved new arms export deals to Saudi Arabia, despite a ban imposed as a result of the Saudi war in Yemen and the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi.[118]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brasília, Brazil on 30 January 2023\nScholz called the US \"Europe's closest and most important partner\". Upon assuming the chancellorship in December 2021, he stated he would soon be meeting with President Joe Biden, saying: \"It is now clear what binds us together.\"[96]\n\n\nOn 22 February 2022, Scholz announced that Germany would be halting its approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in response to Russia's recognition of two self-declared separatist republics within Ukraine.[119] Scholz spoke against allowing the EU to cut Russia off from the SWIFT global interbank payment system.[120]\n\n\nIn an emergency meeting of the Bundestag on 27 February, Scholz made the Zeitenwende speech, announcing a complete reversal of German military and foreign policy, including the commencement of weapons shipments to Ukraine and a 100 billion euro increase in Germany's defense budget.[121] One reporter called it a path to \"an emergency military modernisation, defence spending, energy independence from Russia, lethal assistance for Ukraine and EU financing for weaponry.\" However, in a press conference on 19 April Scholz spoke about slowing Germany's provision of weaponry to Ukraine, which was seen as reducing the scale of the policy change.[122]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Scholz said that his government remains committed to phasing out nuclear power despite rising energy prices and Germany's dependence on energy imports from Russia.[123] Former Chancellor Angela Merkel committed Germany to a nuclear power phase-out after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.[124]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Scholz expressed disagreement with the words of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who compared Israel's treatment of Palestinians to \"apartheid\" in South Africa.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, India on 25 February 2023\nEnergy-intensive German industry and German exporters were hit particularly hard by the 2021–present global energy crisis.[126][127] Scholz said: \"Of course we knew, and we know, that our solidarity with Ukraine will have consequences.\"[128] On 29 September 2022, Germany presented a €200 billion plan to support industry and households.[129]\n\n\nOn 14 March 2023, Scholz met with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in Berlin. They discussed the export of natural gas from Azerbaijan to Germany and the European Union. Scholz said that \"Azerbaijan is becoming an increasingly important partner for both Germany and the European Union\" and stated that Germany does not recognize the Armenian separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent republic.[130]\n\n\nIn early May 2023, he met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Addis Ababa to normalize relations between Germany and Ethiopia, which had been strained by the Tigray War between the Ethiopian government and rebels in Tigray.[131]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Scholz called on all parties involved to resolve the Cyprus dispute, which escalated after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 and the subsequent occupation of the northern part of the island.[132]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv, 17 October 2023\nScholz condemned Hamas' actions during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense.[133] He criticized the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, saying that \"their silence is shameful.\"[134] On 17 October 2023, Scholz arrived in Israel and on the same day warned Iran and Hezbollah not to get involved in the war between Israel and Hamas. He said that \"Germany and Israel are united by the fact that they are democratic constitutional states. Our actions are based on law and order, even in extreme situations.\"[135] On 12 November 2023, Scholz rejected calls for \"an immediate ceasefire or long pause\" in Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, saying it would \"mean ultimately that Israel leaves Hamas the possibility of recovering and obtaining new missiles.\"[136]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 vaccine mandate\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring his campaign in the 2021 election, Scholz opposed a COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Since late November 2021, he has expressed support for mandatory vaccination for adults, scheduled to be voted during the first months of 2022 by the federal parliament, and for the closure of non-essential retail stores to unvaccinated adults, based on the 2G-Regel, decreed by state governments in December 2021.[137][138][139][140][141]\n\n\nOn 13 January 2022, Scholz told lawmakers in the Bundestag that Germany should make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for all adults.[142] Later that month, he warned that the coronavirus would not \"miraculously\" disappear, and said Germany would not be able to get out of the pandemic without compulsory vaccinations.[143] The opposition Christian Democratic Union criticized the government for not taking a firm decision on a vaccine mandate. The far-right Alternative for Germany party wants Scholz's government to ban vaccine mandates.[144]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with Poland\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz and Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki in 2021\nIn December 2021, Scholz rejected the Polish government's claim for further World War II reparations.[145] As a consequence of Nazi German aggression in World War II, Poland lost about a fifth of its population and much of its industry and infrastructure was destroyed.[146][147] According to the German government, there is no legal basis for further compensation payments.[148] In a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Scholz said \"We have concluded treaties that are valid and have settled the past issues and the compensation\".[148] Scholz also pointed out that Germany \"continues to be willing to pay very, very high contributions to the EU budget\", from which Poland has benefited considerably since its accession to the EU.[148]\n\n\n\n### Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz and Putin in Moscow on 15 February 2022\nIn January 2022, *The New York Times* reported intensifying concerns from the US and other NATO allies about the Scholz government's \"evident hesitation to take forceful measures\" against Russia in the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis.[149]\n\n\nThe Scholz government initially refused to send weapons to Ukraine, citing existing German policy and financial support for the Eastern European country.[150] As late as 15 February, Scholz was quoted by TASS as saying \"the way out of the crisis in Ukraine is to implement the Steinmeier formula\", a mechanism of granting a special status to Donbass.[151] On 26 February, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Scholz reversed his decision and pledged a supply of anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to Ukraine.[152]\n\n\nBefore the 24 February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Scholz rejected Ukraine's demands for weapons deliveries on 6 February, saying Germany \"has for many years taken the clear stance that we do not deliver to crisis regions.\"[153] The Russian invasion drastically changed German policy with regard to defense spending, aiding Ukraine and the nation's energy security.\n\n\nScholz greatly increased German defense expenditure. Three days after the invasion started, he announced in the Zeitenwende speech the creation of a one-off 100 billion euro fund for the Bundeswehr.[154] This represents a major shift in German foreign policy, as Germany had long refused to meet the required spending of 2% of its GDP on defense, as is required by NATO.[155] In addition to increasing defense spending for his own country, in an address to Germany's parliament on 23 March, Scholz emphasized support for aiding Ukraine in its resistance to Russian invasion.[156]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz and Macron visit Kyiv on 16 June 2022\nWith regard to supporting Ukraine and taking action against Russia, Scholz was trailing behind others. On 26 February 2022, he was the last of several EU leaders to continue opposition against kicking Russia out of the SWIFT international payment system.[157] However, Germany did send some effective weapons to Ukraine. By 17 March about 2,000 portable missile weapons against tanks and aircraft had been sent.[158] In his 23 March speech, Scholz claimed that Germany would \"try everything we can until peace prevails again on our continent\" including taking hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees across German borders.[156] Like most other NATO leaders, he declined to impose a no-fly zone, as that would probably draw NATO into a direct military conflict with Russia.[156]\n\n\nApart from increasing defense spending and aiding Ukraine, the invasion also helped the German government to admit the dangers of relying on Russian gas. By 3 March 2022, Scholz had announced plans to build two new LNG terminals.[159] Economy minister Habeck then visited Norway and on 19 March Qatar, one of the world's largest exporters of liquefied natural gas.[160][161] Here he signed a long term agreement about importing Qatari gas.[162] Amid pressure to prohibit Russian gas imports across Europe, Scholz still refused to end German imports of Russian gas in the first days of April.[163] A few days later, he said Germany was working on ending the import of Russian energy.[164] He opposed a reversal of Germany's scheduled end to nuclear power, saying the technical challenges were too great.[165]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz at the NATO Summit in Vilnius on 12 July 2023\nIn early April 2022 news of the Bucha massacre shocked public opinion in Europe. On 6 April Guy Verhofstadt got a lot of attention with a passionate speech about Ukraine before the European parliament. He ended it by accusing the German government of \"dragging its feet\" with regard to taking action against Russia.[166] That same month, Germany policy changed and the chancellor avowed that Germany would provide Ukraine with more than 1 billion euro to spend on military resources.[167] Scholz rejected a plan made by Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock to deliver 100 Marder Infantry fighting vehicles from German stocks to Ukraine.[168][*better source needed*]\n\n\nFrom May 2022, the aid to Ukraine became increasingly significant. The rhetoric of the chancellor also began to change. On 9 May 2022, Scholz said that Russians and Ukrainians once fought together during World War II against Nazi Germany's \"murderous National Socialist regime,\" but now \"Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine and destroy its culture and identity... [and] even regards his barbaric war of aggression as being on a par with the fight against National Socialism. That is a falsification of history and a disgraceful distortion.\"[169] On 16 June 2022, Scholz visited the Ukrainian Capital, Kyiv, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. They talked about various issues such as the war in Ukraine and Ukraine's membership into the EU.[170][171] This comes as a reverse of his previous stance to not visit Ukraine, after Zelensky rebuked the German President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier over his contribution to stronger Moscow-Berlin ties.[172][173]\n\n\n\n![](image)International trips by Olaf Scholz Germany\n1 visit\n2 visits\n3 to 7 visits\n8 to 10 visits\n11 and more visits\nNo known visits\n\nBy 1 September 2022 the actual volume of German arms deliveries to Ukraine was only exceeded by that of deliveries by the United States and the United Kingdom.[174] The verdict was that, \"based on these statistics, Berlin had ultimately positioned itself as a reliable partner of Ukraine.\"[174] However, it \"could also be argued that Berlin's communication to affirm its Ukraine stance and explain its foreign policy goals had been nothing short of an unmitigated disaster.\"[174] By then, the January 2023 debate about supplying tanks to Ukraine was still to come.\n\n\n\n## Other activities\n\n[edit]\n\n### International organizations\n\n[edit]\n\n* European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), ex-officio member of the board of governors (2018–2021)[175]\n* European Investment Bank (EIB), ex-officio member of the board of governors (2018–2021)[176]\n* European Stability Mechanism, member of the board of governors (2018–2021)[177]\n* Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), ex-officio member of the board of governors (2018–2021)[178]\n* International Monetary Fund (IMF), ex-officio alternate member of the board of governors (2018–2021)[179]\n\n\n### Corporate boards\n\n[edit]\n\n* KfW, ex-officio member of the Board of Supervisory Directors (2018–2021)[180]\n* RAG-Stiftung, ex-officio member of the board of trustees (2018–2021)[181]\n* HafenCity Hamburg GmbH, ex-officio chairman of the supervisory board (−2018)[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Non-profits\n\n[edit]\n\n* Lebendige Stadt Foundation [Wikidata],[182] member of the board of trustees (2009–2021)\n* Deutsche Nationalstiftung [Wikidata], member of the Senate[183]\n* Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES), member[184]\n* German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), chairman of the Task Force on International Aviation Policy[185]\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nOlaf Scholz is married to fellow SPD politician Britta Ernst.

A member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), he previously served as Vice Chancellor in the fourth Merkel cabinet and as Federal Minister of Finance from 2018 to 2021. He was also First Mayor of Hamburg from 2011 to 2018, deputy leader of the SPD from 2009 to 2019, and Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs from 2007 to 2009.\n\n\nScholz began his career as a lawyer specialising in labour and employment law. He became a member of the SPD in the 1970s and was a member of the Bundestag from 1998 to 2011. Scholz served in the Hamburg Government under First Mayor Ortwin Runde in 2001 and became General Secretary of the SPD in 2002, where he served alongside SPD leader and then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. He became his party's Chief Whip in the Bundestag, later entering the First Merkel Government in 2007 as Federal Minister for Labour and Social Affairs. After the SPD moved into the opposition following the 2009 election, Scholz returned to lead the SPD in Hamburg. He was then elected Deputy Leader of the SPD. He led his party to victory in the 2011 Hamburg state election and became First Mayor, a position he held until 2018.\n\n\nAfter the Social Democratic Party entered the fourth Merkel government in 2018, Scholz was appointed as both Minister of Finance and Vice Chancellor of Germany. In 2020, he was nominated as the SPD's candidate for Chancellor of Germany for the 2021 federal election. The party won a plurality of seats in the Bundestag and formed a \"traffic light coalition\" with Alliance 90/The Greens and the Free Democratic Party. On 8 December 2021, Scholz was elected and sworn in as Chancellor by the Bundestag, succeeding Angela Merkel.\n\n\nAs Chancellor, Scholz has overseen Germany's response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite taking a more restrained and cautious response than many other Western leaders, Scholz oversaw a significant increase in the German defence budget, weapons shipments to Ukraine, and the cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Three days after the invasion, Scholz set out the principles of a new German defence policy in his Zeitenwende speech.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nScholz was born on 14 June 1958, in Osnabrück, Lower Saxony, and grew up in Hamburg's Rahlstedt district.[3] His parents worked in the textile industry.[4] He has two younger brothers, Jens Scholz, an anesthesiologist and CEO of the University Medical Center Schleswig Holstein;[5] and Ingo Scholz, a tech entrepreneur. \n\n\nOlaf Scholz attended the Bekassinenau elementary school in Oldenfelde, and then switched to the Großlohering elementary school in Großlohe. After graduating from high school in 1977, he began studying law at the University of Hamburg in 1978 as part of a one-stage legal training course.[6] He later found employment as a lawyer specialising in labour and employment law, working at the law firm Zimmermann, Scholz und Partner.[7] Scholz joined the Social Democratic Party at the age of 17.[3]\n\n\nScholz's family is traditionally Lutheran, and he was baptized in the Protestant Church in Germany. He holds largely secular political views, and left the Church in adulthood, but has emphasised a need for appreciation of Germany's Christian heritage and culture.[8]\n\n\n\n## Political career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Early political career\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Young socialist, 1975–1989\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz at the Young Socialists Congress, 1984\nScholz joined the SPD in 1975 as a student, where he came into contact with the Jusos, the youth organization of the SPD. From 1982 to 1988, he was Deputy Federal Chairman of the Jusos. Scholz was also Vice President of the International Union of Socialist Youth from 1987 to 1989. He supported the Freudenberger Kreis, a Marxist wing of the Jusos' university groups, arguing that society should \"overcome the capitalist economy\" in one of his publications.[9] In it, Scholz criticized the \"aggressive-imperialist NATO\", the Federal Republic as the \"European stronghold of big business\" and the social-liberal coalition, which puts the \"bare maintenance of power above any form of substantive dispute\".[10] Referring to this period in his life, Scholz has later said that he \"made almost all possible mistakes at some point.\"[9]\n\n\nOn 4 January 1984, Scholz and other Juso leaders attended a meeting in East Germany with Egon Krenz, then secretary of the Central Committee of the SED, and Herbert Häber, member of the Politburo of the SED-Central Committee.[*citation needed*] In 1987, Scholz crossed the inner-German border again and stood up for disarmament agreements as Juso-Vice at an FDJ peace rally in Wittenberg.[11]\n\n\n\n#### Member of the Bundestag, 1998–2001\n\n[edit]\n\nScholz was elected to his first political office as a Deputy Member of the Bundestag representing the constituency of Hamburg-Altona in 1998, aged 40.[12] During his tenure, Scholz served on the Committee for Labor and Social Matters. In the committee of inquiry into the visa affair of the Bundestag, he was chairman of the SPD parliamentary group.[13] Scholz resigned his mandate on 6 June 2001, to take office as Senator.[*clarification needed*] Because his seat was an overhang seat, it was not filled until the 2002 German federal election.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Senator for the Interior of Hamburg, 2001\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 30 May 2001, Scholz succeeded Hartmuth Wrocklage to become Senator for the Interior of Hamburg in the Senate led by Mayor Ortwin Runde. Wrocklage had resigned due to allegations of nepotism. He also succeeded Wrocklage as Deputy Member of the Bundesrat.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring his brief time as Senator, Scholz controversially[*clarification needed*] approved the involuntary use of emetics to gather evidence from suspected drug dealers.[14] The Hamburg Medical Chamber expressed disapproval of this practice due to potential health risks.[15]\n\n\nScholz left office in October 2001, after the defeat of his party at the 2001 Hamburg state election and the election of Ole von Beust as First Mayor. His successor was Ronald Schill, who had won on a Law and order platform, with an emphasis on harsh penalties for drug dealers.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Federal and state political career\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Member of the Bundestag, 2002–2011\n\n[edit]\n\nScholz was elected again to the Bundestag in the 2002 German federal election. From 2002 to 2004, Scholz also served as General Secretary of the SPD; he resigned from that office when party leader and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, facing disaffection within his own party and hampered by persistently low public approval ratings, announced he would step down as Leader of the Social Democratic Party.[18]\n\n\nScholz was one of a series of politicians who sparked debate over the German journalistic norm of allowing interviewees to \"authorize\" and amend quotes before publication. This came after his press team insisted on extensively editing an interview with *Die Tageszeitung* in 2003.[19][20] *Die Tageszeitung* editor Bascha Mika condemned the norm as a \"betrayal of the claim to a free press\", and the newspaper ultimately published the interview with Scholz's answers blacked out.[21][22]\n\n\nScholz served as the SPD spokesperson on the inquiry committee investigating the 2005 German Visa Affair. Following the federal election later that year, he served as First Parliamentary Secretary of the SPD Bundestag Group. He also became Chief Whip of the Social Democratic Party. In this capacity, he worked closely with the CDU Chief Whip Norbert Röttgen to manage and defend the grand coalition led by Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Bundestag.[23] Scholz also served as a member of the Parliamentary Oversight Panel, which provides parliamentary oversight of the German federal intelligence services; the BND, MAD and BfV.[24]\n\n\n\n#### Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, 2007–2009\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2007, Scholz was appointed to serve as Minister of Labour and Social Affairs in the first Merkel Government, succeeding Franz Müntefering.[25][26]\n\n\nFollowing the 2009 federal election, when the SPD left the Government, Scholz was elected as Deputy Leader of the SPD, replacing Frank-Walter Steinmeier. [*citation needed*] Between 2009 and 2011, he was also a member of the SPD group's Afghanistan/Pakistan Task Force.[27] In 2010, he participated in the annual Bilderberg Meeting in Sitges, Spain.[28]\n\n\n\n#### First Mayor of Hamburg, 2011–2018\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz in March 2011, on the government benches in the Hamburg Parliament, shortly after his election as First Mayor\nIn 2011, Scholz was the lead SPD candidate at the Hamburg state election, which the SPD won with 48.3% of the votes, taking 62 of 121 seats in the Hamburg Parliament.[29] Scholz resigned as a Member of the Bundestag on 11 March 2011, days after his formal election as First Mayor of Hamburg; Dorothee Stapelfeldt, also a Social Democrat, was appointed his Deputy First Mayor.[30][31][32]\n\n\nIn his capacity as First Mayor, Scholz represented Hamburg and Germany internationally. On 7 June 2011, Scholz attended the state dinner hosted by President Barack Obama in honor of Chancellor Angela Merkel at the White House.[33] As host of Hamburg's annual St. Matthias' Day banquet for the city's civic and business leaders, he brought several notable guests of honour to the city, including Jean-Marc Ayrault, Prime Minister of France, in 2013; David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, in 2016; and Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, in 2017.[34] From 2015 until 2018, Scholz also served as Commissioner of the Federal Republic of Germany for Cultural Affairs under the Treaty on Franco-German Cooperation.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz and the spouses of the heads of state and government at the G20 in Hamburg, 2017\nIn 2013, Scholz opposed a public initiative aiming at a complete buyback of energy grids that the city of Hamburg had sold to utilities Vattenfall Europe AG and E.ON decades before; he argued this would overburden the city, whose debt stood at more than 20 billion euros at the time.[36]\n\n\nScholz was asked to participate in exploratory talks between the CDU, CSU and SPD parties to form a coalition government following the 2013 federal election.[37] In the subsequent negotiations, he led the SPD delegation in the financial policy working group; his co-chair from the CDU/CSU was Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble.[38] Alongside fellow Social Democrats Jörg Asmussen and Thomas Oppermann, Scholz was reported in the media to be a possible successor to Schäuble in the post of Finance Minister at the time; whilst Schäuble remained in post, the talks to form a coalition were ultimately successful.[39]\n\n\nIn a paper compiled in late 2014, Scholz and Schäuble proposed redirecting revenue from the solidarity surcharge on income and corporate tax (*Solidaritätszuschlag*) to subsidize the federal states' interest payments.[40]\n\n\nUnder Scholz's leadership, the Social Democrats won the 2015 state election in Hamburg, receiving around 47% of the vote.[41] He formed a coalition government with the Green Party, with Green leader Katharina Fegebank being appointed to serve as Deputy First Mayor.[42][43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz speaking at the Global Citizen Festival 2017 in Hamburg\nIn 2015, Scholz led Hamburg's bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics with an estimated budget of €11.2 billion (US$12.6 billion), competing against Los Angeles, Paris, Rome, and Budapest. In a referendum, the citizens of Hamburg later rejected the city's candidacy, with more than half voting against the project.[44][45] Later that year, Scholz – alongside Minister-President Torsten Albig of Schleswig-Holstein – negotiated a debt-restructuring deal with the European Commission. The deal allowed German regional lender HSH Nordbank to offload €6.2 billion in problematic assets, primarily underperforming ship loans, onto its government majority owners and avoid being shut down, saving around 2,500 jobs.[46]\n\n\nIn 2017, Scholz was criticised for his handling of riots that took place during the G20 summit in Hamburg.[7]\n\n\nIn late 2021, Scholz was widely criticised for his handling of the CumEx tax fraud at M. M. Warburg & Co. when he was the mayor of Hamburg.[47][48]\n\n\n\n#### Vice Chancellor and Minister of Finance, 2018–2021\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz (SPD), Angela Merkel (CDU) and Horst Seehofer (CSU) presenting the 2018 coalition agreement for Germany's fourth Merkel cabinet\nAfter a lengthy period of inter-party negotiations following the 2017 federal election, during which the CDU, CSU and SPD agreed to continue in coalition, Scholz was appointed Federal Minister of Finance. Scholz was sworn in alongside the rest of the fourth Merkel cabinet on 14 March 2018, also taking the role of Vice Chancellor of Germany under Angela Merkel.[49] Within his first months in office, Scholz became one of Germany's most popular politicians, reaching an approval rating of 50%.[50]\n\n\nIn 2019, Scholz ran for leader of the SPD, but lost to Norbert Walter-Borjans.[51]\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, Scholz drafted a series of financial rescue packages for the country's economy, including a €130 billion stimulus package in June 2020. The stimulus package included support for businesses and freelancers as well as a decision to keep factories open. This is often credited as having prevented mass layoffs, and the effects of the COVID-19 financial crisis on the German economy were initially relatively low.[52][53] Scholz also oversaw the allocation of funding received from Next Generation EU, the European Union's €750 billion COVID-19 recovery fund. 90% of the €28 billion available to Germany was invested into climate protection and digitization.[54]\n\n\nAt the G7 summit in June 2021, the G7 agreed on a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15%, which had been proposed by Scholz.[55][56] Scholz is credited as having convinced President of the U.S. Joe Biden to agree to the proposal, which his predecessor Donald Trump had been opposed to.[57] Also in June 2021, Scholz oversaw the Federal Central Tax Office's purchase of information regarding German citizens using Dubai for tax avoidance and evasion.[58]\n\n\nScholz was criticized in the context of the Wirecard scandal; serious misconduct by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), which is under the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of Finance, is alleged to have contributed to the longevity of the fraudulent business.[59][60] During Scholz's time in office, the Ministry of Finance was one of the subjects of parliamentary inquiry into the scandal, but Scholz has denied any personal responsibility.[61][62] Having vowed to strengthen financial market supervision, he replaced BaFin president Felix Hufeld.[63][64]\n\n\n\n### Political views in the 2010s\n\n[edit]\n\nWithin the SPD, Scholz is widely viewed as forming part of the moderate wing of the party.[7] Because of his flat enunciation and mechanical-sounding choice of words in press conferences and interviews, Scholz has been nicknamed \"the Scholzomat\" by some media outlets. In 2013, he said that he found the nickname \"very appropriate\".[65][66] In January 2019, Scholz stated that he sees China primarily as an economic partner.[67] He tried to persuade Chinese Vice Premier Liu He that China should be more open to German firms,[68] and he supported the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment between the EU and China.[69] In September 2022, he condemned the treatment of ethnic Uyghurs in China's Xinjiang.[70]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Scholz condemned the Turkish invasion of the Kurdish-controlled northeastern areas of Syria, otherwise known as Rojava.[71]\n\n\n\n#### Economic and financial policy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz and US Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin in 2018\nScholz has been campaigning for a financial transaction tax for several years. Experts have criticized parts of this plan, arguing that it would disproportionately affect small shareholders.[72][73][74][75] In December 2019, Scholz pushed for the introduction of this tax at European Union level. According to a draft legislation, share purchases should be taxed when they involve shares in companies with a market capitalization over €1 billion.[76] Journalist Hermann-Josef Tenhagen criticized this version of the transaction tax on the basis that it would disproportionately affect lower-income individuals.[77] A report by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy commissioned by the Federal Government in 2020 certified the same deficiencies in the tax concept that Tenhagen had already pointed out.[78]\n\n\nDuring his tenure as minister of finance, Scholz prioritized not taking on new government debt and limiting public spending.[50] In 2018, he suggested the creation of an EU-wide unemployment insurance system to make the Eurozone more resilient to future economic shocks.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Environment and climate policy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2019, Scholz negotiated the climate package in a key role for the SPD. To this he said: \"What we have presented is a great achievement\", whereas climate scientists almost unanimously criticized the result as insufficient.[80][81][82][83][84]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Scholz held a phone call with US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, discussing a lift of US sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. In exchange, Scholz offered 1 billion euros in subsidies to liquid gas terminals in northern Germany for US liquid gas imports.[85][86][87] The move sparked controversy with regards to the SPD's stance towards renewable energy.[88][89]\n\n\nThe revised Climate Protection Act introduced by Olaf Scholz's cabinet as Mayor of Hamburg provides for a 65% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, an 88% reduction by 2040 and climate neutrality by 2045.[90]\n\n\nScholz has advocated for the expansion of renewable energy capacities to replace fossil fuels.[91] In May 2021, Scholz proposed the establishment of an international climate club, which should serve to develop common minimum standards for climate policy measures and a coordinated approach. In addition, uniform rules for the carbon accounting of goods should apply among members.[92]\n\n\nAs part of the coalition agreement that led to Scholz becoming chancellor, the Social Democrats, Free Democrats, and Green party agreed to accelerate Germany's phaseout of coal to the year 2030, in line with the target set by the Powering Past Coal Alliance. The country's previous target had been to end the use of coal by 2038. In addition, the agreement set a phaseout of power generation from natural gas by 2040. The agreement also included provisions for the prohibition on natural gas heating in new buildings and replacement of natural gas systems in existing buildings. An end to the sale of combustion vehicles would come in 2035, in line with the target set by the European Commission.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Relationship with the United States\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2019, Scholz criticized US sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, saying: \"Such sanctions are a serious interference in the internal affairs of Germany and Europe and their sovereignty.\"[94]\n\n\nScholz has expressed support for a longstanding agreement that allows American tactical nuclear weapons to be stored and maintained on American bases within Germany.[95][96]\n\n\n\n#### Candidate for party co-leadership, 2019\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2019 Social Democratic Party of Germany leadership election\n\nIn June 2019, Scholz initially ruled out a candidacy for the party co-leadership following the resignation of Andrea Nahles. He explained that a simultaneous activity as Federal Minister of Finance and party leader was \"not possible in terms of time\".[97][98][99] However, in August, Scholz announced his intention to run for party chairmanship with Klara Geywitz.[100][101] He said that many of his preferred candidates had not run for office, expressing a sense of \"responsibility\".[102] Of the six candidate duos standing for election, the Geywitz-Scholz due received the most votes in the first round of the membership elections on 26 October 2019, with 22.7%. They qualified for the runoff election with the second-placed team Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, which had received 21.0% of the vote.[103]\n\n\nOn 30 November 2019, it was announced that Esken and Walter-Borjans had received 53.1% of the vote in the runoff election, with Geywitz and Scholz only receiving 45.3%.[104] This was seen as an upset victory for the left-wing of the SPD, including skeptics of the grand coalition with the CDU. Esken and Walter-Borjans were little-known to the public at large, Esken being a backbencher in the Bundestag and Walter-Borjans being the former Minister of Finance of North Rhine-Westphalia from 2010 to 2017. Scholz on the other hand had the backing of much of the party establishment.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Chancellor candidate, 2021\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 2021 German federal election\n\n![](image)Scholz at an election campaign event\nOn 10 August 2020, SPD party leadership agreed that it would nominate Scholz to be the party's candidate for Chancellor of Germany at the 2021 federal election.[105] Scholz is usually grouped with the moderate wing of the SPD,[106] and his nomination was seen by *Die Tageszeitung* as marking a decline of the party's left.[107]\n\n\nScholz led the SPD to a narrow victory in the election, with the party receiving 25.8% of the second votes and 206 seats in the Bundestag.[108] Following this victory, Scholz was widely considered to be the most likely next Chancellor of Germany in a traffic light coalition with The Greens and the Free Democratic Party.[109]\n\n\nOn 24 November, the SPD, Green and FDP reached a coalition agreement, naming Scholz as the new German chancellor.[110]\n\n\n\n## Chancellor of Germany, 2021–present\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Scholz cabinet\n\n![](image)Scholz and Finnish Prime Minister Marin in 2022\n![](image)Scholz meets President Biden in March 2023.\nScholz was elected Chancellor by the Bundestag on 8 December 2021, with 395 votes in favour and 303 against.[111] His new government was appointed on the same day by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.[112] At 63 years, 177 days of age, Scholz is the oldest person to become Chancellor of Germany since Ludwig Erhard, who was 66 years, 255 days old when he assumed office on 17 October 1963.\n\n\nIn December 2021, Scholz travelled to Warsaw for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, where they discussed the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which would bring Russian gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany and bypass Poland, and Poland's dispute with the European Union over the primacy of EU law. Scholz backed Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants seeking entry from Belarus.[113]\n\n\nScholz extended into 2022 the suspension of the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia.[114] The decision was made to \"no longer approve any export sales to countries as long as they are directly involved\" in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.[115] In September 2022, Scholz visited the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, seeking to deepen ties with the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and find alternative sources of energy.[116] Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received Scholz in Jeddah.[117] Scholz's government approved new arms export deals to Saudi Arabia, despite a ban imposed as a result of the Saudi war in Yemen and the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi.[118]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in Brasília, Brazil on 30 January 2023\nScholz called the US \"Europe's closest and most important partner\". Upon assuming the chancellorship in December 2021, he stated he would soon be meeting with President Joe Biden, saying: \"It is now clear what binds us together.\"[96]\n\n\nOn 22 February 2022, Scholz announced that Germany would be halting its approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in response to Russia's recognition of two self-declared separatist republics within Ukraine.[119] Scholz spoke against allowing the EU to cut Russia off from the SWIFT global interbank payment system.[120]\n\n\nIn an emergency meeting of the Bundestag on 27 February, Scholz made the Zeitenwende speech, announcing a complete reversal of German military and foreign policy, including the commencement of weapons shipments to Ukraine and a 100 billion euro increase in Germany's defense budget.[121] One reporter called it a path to \"an emergency military modernisation, defence spending, energy independence from Russia, lethal assistance for Ukraine and EU financing for weaponry.\" However, in a press conference on 19 April Scholz spoke about slowing Germany's provision of weaponry to Ukraine, which was seen as reducing the scale of the policy change.[122]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Scholz said that his government remains committed to phasing out nuclear power despite rising energy prices and Germany's dependence on energy imports from Russia.[123] Former Chancellor Angela Merkel committed Germany to a nuclear power phase-out after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.[124]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Scholz expressed disagreement with the words of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who compared Israel's treatment of Palestinians to \"apartheid\" in South Africa.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, India on 25 February 2023\nEnergy-intensive German industry and German exporters were hit particularly hard by the 2021–present global energy crisis.[126][127] Scholz said: \"Of course we knew, and we know, that our solidarity with Ukraine will have consequences.\"[128] On 29 September 2022, Germany presented a €200 billion plan to support industry and households.[129]\n\n\nOn 14 March 2023, Scholz met with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in Berlin. They discussed the export of natural gas from Azerbaijan to Germany and the European Union. Scholz said that \"Azerbaijan is becoming an increasingly important partner for both Germany and the European Union\" and stated that Germany does not recognize the Armenian separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh as an independent republic.[130]\n\n\nIn early May 2023, he met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Addis Ababa to normalize relations between Germany and Ethiopia, which had been strained by the Tigray War between the Ethiopian government and rebels in Tigray.[131]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Scholz called on all parties involved to resolve the Cyprus dispute, which escalated after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 and the subsequent occupation of the northern part of the island.[132]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Tel Aviv, 17 October 2023\nScholz condemned Hamas' actions during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense.[133] He criticized the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, saying that \"their silence is shameful.\"[134] On 17 October 2023, Scholz arrived in Israel and on the same day warned Iran and Hezbollah not to get involved in the war between Israel and Hamas. He said that \"Germany and Israel are united by the fact that they are democratic constitutional states. Our actions are based on law and order, even in extreme situations.\"[135] On 12 November 2023, Scholz rejected calls for \"an immediate ceasefire or long pause\" in Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, saying it would \"mean ultimately that Israel leaves Hamas the possibility of recovering and obtaining new missiles.\"[136]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 vaccine mandate\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring his campaign in the 2021 election, Scholz opposed a COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Since late November 2021, he has expressed support for mandatory vaccination for adults, scheduled to be voted during the first months of 2022 by the federal parliament, and for the closure of non-essential retail stores to unvaccinated adults, based on the 2G-Regel, decreed by state governments in December 2021.[137][138][139][140][141]\n\n\nOn 13 January 2022, Scholz told lawmakers in the Bundestag that Germany should make COVID-19 vaccinations mandatory for all adults.[142] Later that month, he warned that the coronavirus would not \"miraculously\" disappear, and said Germany would not be able to get out of the pandemic without compulsory vaccinations.[143] The opposition Christian Democratic Union criticized the government for not taking a firm decision on a vaccine mandate. The far-right Alternative for Germany party wants Scholz's government to ban vaccine mandates.[144]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with Poland\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz and Polish Prime Minister Morawiecki in 2021\nIn December 2021, Scholz rejected the Polish government's claim for further World War II reparations.[145] As a consequence of Nazi German aggression in World War II, Poland lost about a fifth of its population and much of its industry and infrastructure was destroyed.[146][147] According to the German government, there is no legal basis for further compensation payments.[148] In a meeting with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Scholz said \"We have concluded treaties that are valid and have settled the past issues and the compensation\".[148] Scholz also pointed out that Germany \"continues to be willing to pay very, very high contributions to the EU budget\", from which Poland has benefited considerably since its accession to the EU.[148]\n\n\n\n### Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Scholz and Putin in Moscow on 15 February 2022\nIn January 2022, *The New York Times* reported intensifying concerns from the US and other NATO allies about the Scholz government's \"evident hesitation to take forceful measures\" against Russia in the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis.[149]\n\n\nThe Scholz government initially refused to send weapons to Ukraine, citing existing German policy and financial support for the Eastern European country.[150] As late as 15 February, Scholz was quoted by TASS as saying \"the way out of the crisis in Ukraine is to implement the Steinmeier formula\", a mechanism of granting a special status to Donbass.[151] On 26 February, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Scholz reversed his decision and pledged a supply of anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to Ukraine.[152]\n\n\nBefore the 24 February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Scholz rejected Ukraine's demands for weapons deliveries on 6 February, saying Germany \"has for many years taken the clear stance that we do not deliver to crisis regions.\"[153] The Russian invasion drastically changed German policy with regard to defense spending, aiding Ukraine and the nation's energy security.\n\n\nScholz greatly increased German defense expenditure. Three days after the invasion started, he announced in the Zeitenwende speech the creation of a one-off 100 billion euro fund for the Bundeswehr.[154] This represents a major shift in German foreign policy, as Germany had long refused to meet the required spending of 2% of its GDP on defense, as is required by NATO.[155] In addition to increasing defense spending for his own country, in an address to Germany's parliament on 23 March, Scholz emphasized support for aiding Ukraine in its resistance to Russian invasion.[156]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz and Macron visit Kyiv on 16 June 2022\nWith regard to supporting Ukraine and taking action against Russia, Scholz was trailing behind others. On 26 February 2022, he was the last of several EU leaders to continue opposition against kicking Russia out of the SWIFT international payment system.[157] However, Germany did send some effective weapons to Ukraine. By 17 March about 2,000 portable missile weapons against tanks and aircraft had been sent.[158] In his 23 March speech, Scholz claimed that Germany would \"try everything we can until peace prevails again on our continent\" including taking hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees across German borders.[156] Like most other NATO leaders, he declined to impose a no-fly zone, as that would probably draw NATO into a direct military conflict with Russia.[156]\n\n\nApart from increasing defense spending and aiding Ukraine, the invasion also helped the German government to admit the dangers of relying on Russian gas. By 3 March 2022, Scholz had announced plans to build two new LNG terminals.[159] Economy minister Habeck then visited Norway and on 19 March Qatar, one of the world's largest exporters of liquefied natural gas.[160][161] Here he signed a long term agreement about importing Qatari gas.[162] Amid pressure to prohibit Russian gas imports across Europe, Scholz still refused to end German imports of Russian gas in the first days of April.[163] A few days later, he said Germany was working on ending the import of Russian energy.[164] He opposed a reversal of Germany's scheduled end to nuclear power, saying the technical challenges were too great.[165]\n\n\n\n![](image)Scholz at the NATO Summit in Vilnius on 12 July 2023\nIn early April 2022 news of the Bucha massacre shocked public opinion in Europe. On 6 April Guy Verhofstadt got a lot of attention with a passionate speech about Ukraine before the European parliament. He ended it by accusing the German government of \"dragging its feet\" with regard to taking action against Russia.[166] That same month, Germany policy changed and the chancellor avowed that Germany would provide Ukraine with more than 1 billion euro to spend on military resources.[167] Scholz rejected a plan made by Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock to deliver 100 Marder Infantry fighting vehicles from German stocks to Ukraine.[168][*better source needed*]\n\n\nFrom May 2022, the aid to Ukraine became increasingly significant. The rhetoric of the chancellor also began to change. On 9 May 2022, Scholz said that Russians and Ukrainians once fought together during World War II against Nazi Germany's \"murderous National Socialist regime,\" but now \"Putin wants to overthrow Ukraine and destroy its culture and identity... [and] even regards his barbaric war of aggression as being on a par with the fight against National Socialism. That is a falsification of history and a disgraceful distortion.\"[169] On 16 June 2022, Scholz visited the Ukrainian Capital, Kyiv, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi to meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. They talked about various issues such as the war in Ukraine and Ukraine's membership into the EU.[170][171] This comes as a reverse of his previous stance to not visit Ukraine, after Zelensky rebuked the German President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier over his contribution to stronger Moscow-Berlin ties.[172][173]\n\n\n\n![](image)International trips by Olaf Scholz Germany\n1 visit\n2 visits\n3 to 7 visits\n8 to 10 visits\n11 and more visits\nNo known visits\n\nBy 1 September 2022 the actual volume of German arms deliveries to Ukraine was only exceeded by that of deliveries by the United States and the United Kingdom.[174] The verdict was that, \"based on these statistics, Berlin had ultimately positioned itself as a reliable partner of Ukraine.\"[174] However, it \"could also be argued that Berlin's communication to affirm its Ukraine stance and explain its foreign policy goals had been nothing short of an unmitigated disaster.\"[174] By then, the January 2023 debate about supplying tanks to Ukraine was still to come.\n\n\n\n## Other activities\n\n[edit]\n\n### International organizations\n\n[edit]\n\n* European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), ex-officio member of the board of governors (2018–2021)[175]\n* European Investment Bank (EIB), ex-officio member of the board of governors (2018–2021)[176]\n* European Stability Mechanism, member of the board of governors (2018–2021)[177]\n* Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), ex-officio member of the board of governors (2018–2021)[178]\n* International Monetary Fund (IMF), ex-officio alternate member of the board of governors (2018–2021)[179]\n\n\n### Corporate boards\n\n[edit]\n\n* KfW, ex-officio member of the Board of Supervisory Directors (2018–2021)[180]\n* RAG-Stiftung, ex-officio member of the board of trustees (2018–2021)[181]\n* HafenCity Hamburg GmbH, ex-officio chairman of the supervisory board (−2018)[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Non-profits\n\n[edit]\n\n* Lebendige Stadt Foundation [Wikidata],[182] member of the board of trustees (2009–2021)\n* Deutsche Nationalstiftung [Wikidata], member of the Senate[183]\n* Friedrich Ebert Foundation (FES), member[184]\n* German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), chairman of the Task Force on International Aviation Policy[185]\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nOlaf Scholz is married to fellow SPD politician Britta Ernst. The couple lived in Hamburg's Altona district before moving to Potsdam in 2018.[186]\n\n\nScholz was raised in the Protestant Church in Germany and later left it.[187] At his inauguration as chancellor in 2021, Scholz took the oath of office without a reference to God (the second chancellor to do so after Gerhard Schröder). He is the first chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany who isn't a member of a church.[188]\n\n\nOn 4 September 2023, Scholz announced that he would be wearing an eyepatch following a jogging accident.[189][190][191]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Senate Scholz II\n* Senate Scholz I\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Bundesrat session 764\n2. **^** Bundesrat session 769\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Cliffe, Jeremy (3 September 2021). \"How Olaf Scholz and the SPD could lead Germany's next government\". *New Statesman*.

Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.\n\n\nModi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. His account of helping his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably corroborated. At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.[c]\n\n\nIn 2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[d] and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. A little over 1,000 people were killed, according to official records, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.[10] A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[e] While his policies as chief minister, which were credited for encouraging economic growth, were praised, Modi's administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[f] In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and it reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated the 2016 demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and introduced the Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.\n\n\nModi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[13][14] and the deaths of six Indian personnel to friendly fire was later revealed: but the action had nationalist appeal.[15] Modi's party comfortably won the 2019 general election which followed.[16] In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, an Indian-administred portion of the disputed Kashmir region,[17][18] and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs,[19][20][21] sometimes with the complicity of police forces controlled by the Modi administration.[22][23] Three controversial farm laws, led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which 4.7 million Indians died, according to the World Health Organization's estimates.[24][25]\n\n\nUnder Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of democratic institutions, individual rights, and freedom of expression.[26][27][g] As prime minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings.[33][34][35] Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally, over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[h]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nNarendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (1923–2022).[42][b][43]\n\n\nAccording to Modi, as a child, he had to work in his father's tea shop on the platform of Vadnagar railway station,[44] but the evidence of his neighbours does not entirely corroborate this statement.[45][46] During a protest against the government, his brother, Prahlad Modi, contradicted that he ever sold tea. According to him, his father had brought up six of his children by selling tea and people were making a big mistake by calling the Prime Minister a \"chai wala\" (tea seller).[47]\n\n\nModi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967; his teachers described him as an average student and a keen, gifted debater with an interest in theatre.[48] He preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[49][50]\n\n\nWhen Modi was eight years old, he was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local *shakhas* (training sessions). There, he met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, who inducted Modi as a *balswayamsevak* (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor.[51] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who in 1980 helped found the BJP's Gujarat unit.[52]\n\n\nIn a custom traditional to Narendra Modi's caste, his family arranged a betrothal to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18.[53][54] Soon afterwards, he abandoned his wife,[55] and left home. The couple never divorced but the marriage was not in his public pronouncements for many decades.[54] In April 2014, shortly before the national election in which he gained power, Modi publicly affirmed he was married and that his spouse was Jashodaben.[56] The marriage was unconsummated and Modi kept it secret because he would not have been able to become a *pracharak* in the puritanical RSS.[57][58]\n\n\nModi spent the following two years travelling across northern and north-eastern India.[59] In interviews, he has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. His stays at each ashram were brief because he lacked the required college education.[60] Vivekananda has had a large influence in Modi's life.[61]\n\n\nIn mid 1968, Modi reached Belur Math but was turned away, after which he visited Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. He then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before returning to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968 to 1969. In either late 1969 or early 1970, he returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad,[62][63] where he lived with his uncle and worked in his uncle's canteen at Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[64]\n\n\nIn Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city.[65][66][67] Modi's first-known political activity as an adult was in 1971 when he joined a Jana Sangh Satyagraha in Delhi led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to enlist to fight in the Bangladesh Liberation War.[68][69] The Indira Gandhi-led central government prohibited open support for the Mukti Bahini; according to Modi, he was briefly held in Tihar Jail.[70][71][72] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Modi left his uncle's employ and became a full-time *pracharak* (campaigner) for the RSS,[73] working under Inamdar.[74] Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest in New Delhi against the Indian government, for which he was arrested; because of this arrest, Inamdar decided to mentor Modi.[74] According to Modi, he was part of a Satyagraha that led to a political war.[71][i]\n\n\nIn 1978, Modi received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in political science from the School of Open Learning[77] at the Delhi University.[57][78] In 1983, he received a Master of Arts (MA) degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class[79][80] as an external distance learning student.[81] There is a controversy surrounding the authenticity of his BA and MA degrees.[82][83][j]\n\n\n\n## Early political career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India that lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \"the Emergency\", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[87][88] Modi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[89] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once as a Sikh.[90] He became involved in the printing of pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[91][92] He was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals who were wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[93] During this period, Modi wrote a Gujarati-language book titled *Sangharsh Ma Gujarat* (*In the Struggles of Gujarat*), which describes events during the Emergency.[94][95] While in this role, Modi met trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes and several other national political figures.[96]\n\n\nModi became an RSS *sambhag pracharak* (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing activities in Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he researched and wrote the RSS's history of the Emergency. Shortly after, he returned to Gujarat and in 1985, the RSS assigned him to the BJP. In 1987, Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably; according to biographers, Modi's planning was responsible for the win.[97][98] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the party; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role. Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi with Atal Bihari Vajpayee in c. 2001\nModi rose within the party and was named a member of its National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise Advani's Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991–1992 *Ekta Yatra* (Journey for Unity).[48][100][101] Modi took a brief break from politics in 1992 to establish a school in Ahmedabad, and due to friction with Shankersinh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat.[101] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani; as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly election.[102][103] In November of that year, Modi was appointed BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[104] The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha election.[48] Modi, who was on the selection committee for the 1998 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as central to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 election,[105] and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.[106]\n\n\n\n## Chief Minister of Gujarat\n\n[edit]\n\n### Taking office\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[105][107][108] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement.[48] Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government. Modi declined an offer to become Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee he was \"going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\". On 3 October 2001, Modi replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the upcoming December 2002 election.[109] On 7 October, Modi was sworn in[110] and he entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 after winning a by-election in Rajkot II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC.[111]\n\n\n\n### 2002 Gujarat riots\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2002 Gujarat riots\n\nOn 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[k][114] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims who were returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[115][116] In a public statement, Modi said local Muslims were responsible for the incident.[7][115][117] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a *bandh* (general strike) across the state.[118][119] Riots began during the *bandh* and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[115][118][119] The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[115][120] The state government later stated 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed during the riots;[116] independent sources put the death toll at over 2,000,[115][114][121] the vast majority of them Muslims.[114] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[122] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilation of women.[6][123]\n\n\nScholars consider the Government of Gujarat to have been complicit in the riots,[7][124] and it has received much criticism for its handling of the situation;[125] some scholars explicitly blame Modi.[6][126][127] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets; these measures failed to prevent the violence from escalating.[118][119] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the *bandh* despite such actions being illegal at the time.[7] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, which were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[128] Muslim victims of the riots were subjected to further discrimination when the state government announced their compensation would be half that offered to Hindu victims; this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[129] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[6][117][130] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom and others have called it an example of state terrorism.[131][132][133] According to Martha Nussbaum, \"There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law\".[6]\n\n\nModi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, he said, \"What is happening is a chain of action and reaction\".[6] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[134] In March 2008, the Supreme Court of India reopened several cases related to the riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[125][135][136] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri, the widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre, in April 2009, the court also asked the SIT to investigate Modi's complicity in the killings.[135] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[135][137] In July 2011, the court-appointed *amicus curiae* Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, Ramachandran said Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[138][139] The Supreme Court sent the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013, the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding there was no evidence against Modi.[140] In 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition by Zakia Jafri in which she challenged the clean chit given to Modi in the riots by the SIT, and upheld previous rulings that no evidence against him was found.[141][142][143]\n\n\n\n### Later terms as Chief Minister\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2002 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election\n\nFollowing the violence, calls for Modi to resign as chief minister were made from politicians within and outside the state, including leaders of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party—partners in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition—and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[144] Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa but it was not accepted.[145] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[146] In the election, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[147] Modi made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[148][149][150][151] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among voters.[146] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride,[5][148] a strategy that led to the BJP winning 127 of the 182[147] seats—a two-thirds majority—in the state assembly.[5][148] He won Maninagar constituency, defeating Congress candidate Yatin Oza.[152] On 22 December 2002, Modi was sworn in for a second term.[153]\n\n\nDuring Modi's second term, the government's rhetoric shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development.[107][5][148] He curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).[154] When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration, Modi ordered the BKS's eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[154][155] Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. He wrote a foreword to a 2014 textbook by Dinanath Batra, which made the unscientific claim that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[156][157]\n\n\nModi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Indian general election, following which, Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[158][159] Western nations also raised questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims: the US State Department barred him from entering the United States in accordance with the recommendations of that country's Commission on International Religious Freedom,[160][161] the only person to be denied a US visa under this law.[160] The UK and the European Union (EU) refused to admit Modi because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[162] and the EU[163] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister in 2014, the US lifted its ban and invited him to Washington, D.C.[164][165]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi meeting with then-Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh in 2004\nDuring the run-up to the 2007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election and the 2009 Indian general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[166] Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \"for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act.[167] In 2007, Modi wrote *Karmayog*, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, he said scavenging is a \"spiritual experience\" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits.[168][169] The book was not circulated at that time because of the election code of conduct.[170] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Gujarat government authorised the deployment of 30 high-speed boats for coastal surveillance.[171] In July 2007, Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post.[172] The BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.[173]\n\n\nDespite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's campaigns in 2007 and 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections contained elements of Hindu nationalism. He attended only Hindu religious ceremonies and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign, Modi twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.[148] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[148] Modi's 2012 campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including Afzal Guru and the death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the 2012 assembly election.[148] During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[148] While campaigning for the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies, allowing him to reach a large number of people,[146] something he repeated in the 2014 general election. Modi won the constituency of Maninagar, defeating Shweta Bhatt of the INC.[174] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure.[175] After his election as Prime Minister of India, Modi resigned as the Gujarat chief minister and as MLA for Maninagar. Anandiben Patel succeeded Modi as chief minister.[176]\n\n\n\n### Development projects\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Sardar Sarovar Dam during a 2006 height increase\nAs chief minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, which is usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. Modi's policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in Gujarat. He established financial and technology parks in the state and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion (equivalent to ₹20 trillion or US$240 billion in 2023) were signed.[107]\n\n\nThe governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[177] Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[178] As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India.[177] The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[179] led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.[180] Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project irrigated only 4–6% of the area intended.[177] In 2008, Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano car after popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Following Tata, several other companies relocated to Gujarat.[181]\n\n\nThe Modi government finished the process of taking electricity to every village in Gujarat its predecessor had almost completed.[182] Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Early protests by farmers ended when those who benefitted found their electricity supply had stabilised[177] but, according to an assessment study, corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[183]\n\n\n\n### Development debate\n\n[edit]\n\n![Modi speaking at flower-decked podium](image)Modi addressing graduates of the Gujarat National Law University in 2012 \nA contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat's economic development during Modi's tenure as chief minister.[184] The state's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate averaged 10% during his tenure, a rate similar to those of other highly industrialised states, and above that of India as a whole.[181] Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office; some scholars have stated growth did not much accelerate during his tenure.[185] Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank's \"ease of doing business\" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.[186] In 2013, a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights, and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states, ranked Gujarat first among Indian states for \"economic freedom\".[181][187] In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.[5] Tax breaks and land for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states. Modi's policies of making Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones in which labour laws were greatly weakened.[148]\n\n\nDespite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in India with respect to rates of poverty, and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the \"alarming\" category on the India State Hunger Index.[188][189] A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found Gujarat under Modi had a poor record in immunisation of children.[190]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.[129] It showed a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.[129] The quality of education in government schools in Gujarat ranked below that of many Indian states.[129] The state government's social policies generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.[129] Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas and those from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013, the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index.[9] Under Modi, the state government spent less than the national average on education and healthcare.[129]\n\n\n\n### Allegations of bribery\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring its raids in 2013 and 2014, the CBI seized some diaries from two big Indian companies, Sahara Group and Aditya Birla Group. These diaries contained references of alleged payments made to leaders belonging to as many as 18 political parties including BJP, Congress, JDU, BJD etc.[191][192] Among these were some entries mentioning \"Gujarat CM\" and \"Ahmadabad Modiji\".[193][194][192] Citing these entries, on 21 December 2016, the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that Modi received cash bribes worth ₹65 crore from Sahara Group and Aditya Birla Group when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.[195][196] In November 2016, advocate Prashant Bhushan had filed a plea in the Supreme Court of India asking for investigation of the alleged bribe payments made to some senior public servants including Modi.[197][198] A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Arun Kumar Mishra dismissed the plea in January 2017 stating that the evidence provided was insufficient.[199][200] Later on, Justice Mishra was criticised by a section of advocates and activists for siding with the Modi government in multiple judgements during his tenure at the Supreme Court.[201][202] *The Wire* questioned the manner in which the Supreme Court buried the Sahara-Birla diaries' investigation.[203]\n\n\n\n## Premiership campaigns\n\n[edit]\n\n### 2014 Indian general election\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2014 Indian general election\n\n![](image)Narendra Modi hands over his resignation as Maninagar MLA to the Speaker of the Gujarat Vidhan Sabha.\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) BJP announces Shri Narendra Modi as its Prime Ministerial candidate for Loksabha Elections. Bharatiya Janata Party on YouTube, 13 September 2013 |\n\n\nIn September 2013, Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[204][205] Several BJP leaders,[206] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani who cited concern with leaders who were \"concerned with their personal agendas\", expressed opposition to Modi's candidature.[207] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's 2009 general election campaign.[208][209] Several people who voted for the BJP stated they would have voted for another party if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate.[204][210][211] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.[206][212] The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi meets his mother after winning the 2014 Indian general election\nDuring the campaign, Modi focused on corruption scandals under the previous Congress government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat.[206] He projected himself as a person who could bring about \"development\" without focusing on specific policies.[206] His message found support among young and middle-class people. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism.[209] Prior to the election, Modi's media image had centred around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots but during the campaign, the BJP focused on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development.[209] The BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders who publicly opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose and Ram Manohar Lohia.[157] Hindutva remained a part of the campaign; BJP leaders used Hindutva-based rhetoric in several states.[213][206][210][38] Communal tensions were played upon, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Northeast India.[213] A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP's election manifesto.[38]\nThe BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.[189] Modi's campaign blitz cost around ₹50 billion (US$600 million)[184] and the BJP received extensive financial support from corporate donors.[214] In addition to more-conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media[184][206] and addressed more than 1,000 rallies via hologram appearances.[38]\n\n\nThe BJP won 31 percent of the vote,[37] and more-than-doubled its number of seats in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984.[209][210] Voter dissatisfaction with the Congress and with regional parties in North India, and support from the RSS were reasons for the BJP's success.[210][206] In states such as Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, and its Muslim vote increased to 10 percent. The BJP performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims.[210] The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties towards the right-wing.[38][184][210][215][216] Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.[217]\n\n\nModi was a candidate for the Lok Sabha constituencies Varanasi and Vadodara.[218] He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi by 371,784 votes and Madhusudan Mistry of the Congress in Vadodara by 570,128 votes.[219] India's president appointed Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, Prime Minister of India.[220][221] To comply with the law prohibiting MPs from representing more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat.[222]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Indian general election\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2019 Indian general election\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) BJP announced manifesto and Shri Narendra Modi as prime minister candidate. Bharatiya Janata Party on YouTube, 8 April 2019. |\n\n\nOn 13 October 2018, Modi was named the BJP candidate for prime minister in the 2019 general election.[223] The BJP's chief campaigner was its president Amit Shah. Modi launched the party's *Main Bhi Chowkidar* (\"I too am a watchman\") campaign ahead of the general election, against the INC's campaign slogan *Chowkidar Chor Hai* (\"The watchman is a thief\").[224] In 2018, the Telugu Desam Party split from the NDA over the campaign for special status for Andhra Pradesh.[225]\n\n\nAmit Shah launched the BJP's election campaign on 8 April 2019. In the campaign, the opposition targeted Modi on allegations of corruption over the Rafale deal with the Government of France, highlighting the controversy surrounding the deal.[226] Modi's campaign focused on defence and national security, especially after the Pulwama attack and the retaliatory Balakot airstrike, which was counted as an achievement of his administration.[16][227] Other topics in the campaign were development and good foreign relations in the first premiership.[228]\n\n\nModi contested the Lok Sabha election as a candidate for Varanasi; he won the seat by a margin of 479,505 votes, defeating Shalini Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP), who stood as a candidate for the SP-BSP alliance.[229][230] Modi was unanimously appointed prime minister for a second time by the National Democratic Alliance[231] after the alliance won the election for the second time with 353 seats in the Lok Sabha; the BJP alone won 303 seats.[232][233]\n\n\n\n## Prime Minister\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Premiership of Narendra Modi\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the premiership of Narendra Modi.\n![](image)Modi taking the oath of office as the Prime Minister of India, with President Pranab Mukherjee administering the oath\n![](image)Modi taking the oath of office as the Prime Minister of India for the second time, with President Ram Nath Kovind administering the oath\nAfter the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a landslide in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister (PM) of India on 26 May 2014, becoming the first Indian PM to be born after the country's independence from the British Empire in 1947.[234] Modi's second term as PM began in 2019 following the NDA's 2019 Lok Sabha election win. On 6 December 2020, he became the fourth-longest-serving Prime Minister of India and the longest-serving non-Congress prime minister.[235]\n\n\n\n### Governance and other initiatives\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Prime Minister Modi walking towards the dais to address the Nation at Red Fort, on the occasion of 75th Independence Day, in Delhi on 15 August 2021\nModi's first year as PM saw significant centralisation of power.[157][236] Modi, who initially lacked a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament, passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[237] His administration enacted a bill to increase its control over the appointment of judges and reducing that of the judiciary.[37] In December 2014, he abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog),[238][239] concentrating the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the PM.[237][238][239][240][241] The Planning Commission had in previous years been criticised for creating inefficiency in the government and of not fulfilling its role of improving social welfare but since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.[239]\n\n\nIn its first year of administration, the Modi government launched investigations through the Intelligence Bureau into numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the grounds these organisations were slowing economic growth. The investigations were criticised as a witch hunt. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres, and environmental nonprofit organisation Sierra Club and Avaaz were among the groups that were investigated.[157][240] Cases of sedition and terrorism laws were filed against individuals who criticised the government.[157][242] This led to discontent within the BJP about his style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.[157][237]\n\n\nModi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments in the previous 64 years.[243][244][245] Modi launched the Digital India programme with the goal of ensuring government services are available electronically, build infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boost manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promote digital literacy.[246][247]\n\n\nIn 2019, a law to reserve 10 percent of educational admission and government jobs for economically disadvantaged individuals was passed.[248][249] In 2016, Modi's administration launched the Ujjwala scheme to provide free liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to rural households. The scheme led to an additional 24% of Indian households having access to LPG in 2019 as compared to 2014.[250] In 2022, the government eliminated LPG subsidies for all citizens except those covered by the Ujjwala program.[251]\n\n\nSince May 2023, ethnic tensions between some groups have resulted in violent clashes in Manipur. After 1 month of the violence, nearly 100 were killed and more than 36,000 people were displaced.[252] Narendra Modi has been criticised for his lack of reaction towards the violence.[253]\n\n\n\n### Hindutva\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Hindutva\n\n![](image)Modi pays obeisance at Tirumala Temple in Andhra Pradesh. \nThe activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after Modi's appointment as prime minister, sometimes with the government's support.[254][255] These activities included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the supposed Islamic practice of \"Love Jihad\" and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right-wing organisation Hindu Mahasabha.[256][257] Government officials, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion programmes.[213]\n\n\nLinks between the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) grew stronger under Modi. The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP's electoral campaigns while the Modi administration appointed RSS-affiliated individuals to prominent government positions.[258] In 2014, Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, became the chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).[38] Historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the BJP, questioned Rao's credentials as a historian and stated the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism.[38][259][260] During its first term, the Modi administration appointed other RSS members to lead universities and research institutions, and recruitment of faculty members favouring the RSS increased. According to scholars Nandini Sundar and Kiran Bhatty, many of these appointees did not possess the qualifications for their positions.[261] The Modi administration also made numerous changes in government-approved history textbooks that de-emphasised the role of Jawaharlal Nehru and glorified that of Modi while also portraying Indian society as harmonious, and without conflict and inequity.[261][262]\n\n\nIn 2019, the Modi administration passed a citizenship law that provides a route to Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians,[263][264] but does not grant eligibility to Muslims.[265][266][267] This was first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law; it attracted global criticism and prompted widespread protests that were halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[261][267][268] Counter-demonstrations against the protests developed into the 2020 Delhi riots, caused chiefly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims.[269][270] Fifty-three people were killed in the protests, two-thirds of whom were Muslim.[271][272][273][274][275] On 5 August 2020, Modi visited Ayodhya after the Supreme Court in 2019 ordered contested land in Ayodhya to be handed to a trust to build a Hindu temple and ordered the government to give alternative 5 acres (2.0 ha) of land to the Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque.[276] Modi became the first PM to visit temples at Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanuman Garhi.[277]\n\n\nSoon after Modi returned to power in 2019, he took three actions the RSS had long called for.[261] The practice of Triple Talaq was made illegal and became a punishable act from 1 August 2019.[278][279][280] The administration repealed Article 370 of the Indian constitution that granted autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, and also abrogated its statehood, reorganising it into the union territories Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.[261][281] The region was placed under a lockdown and internet services were suspended and were not completely restored until February 2021.[282] Thousands of people, including hundreds of political leaders, were detained.[283][284][285][286] The Supreme Court of India did not hear constitutional challenges to the reorganisation or the Citizenship Amendment Act. According to Bhatty and Sundar, this is an example of the subversion of the Supreme Court and other major institutions, which were filled with appointees favouring the BJP.[261]\n\n\n\n### Economy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)BRICS leaders in 2019. Left to right: Xi (China), Putin (Russia), Bolsonaro (Brazil), Modi and Ramaphosa (South Africa) \nThe Modi government's economic policies focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, and were based on a neoliberal framework.[240][287] Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including defence and railways.[240][288][289] Other proposed reforms included making the forming of unions more difficult for workers, and making recruitment and dismissal easier for employers;[287] some of these proposals were abandoned after protests.[290] The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions—including one affiliated with the BJP—struck.[287] The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (Indian Workers Union), a constituent of the Sangh Parivar (Family of the RSS), stated the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers.[240]\n\n\nThe funds dedicated to poverty-reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly reduced by Modi's administration.[157] The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6 percent of GDP during the previous Congress government to 12.6 percent during Modi's first year in office, and spending on health and family welfare declined by 15 percent.[240] The government lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold and jewellery.[240] In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices.[291] During Modi's first term, his government reduced spending on education as share of the budget: over five years, education spending dropped from 0.7 percent of GDP to 0.5 percent.[292][293][294] The percentage of the budget spent on children's nutrition, education, health, and associated programmes was almost halved between 2014 and 2022.[295] Capital expenditure on transport infrastructure significantly rose, increasing from less than 0.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 1.7 percent in 2023.[296]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.[240][297] Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative but critics said it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market.[240] Modi's administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it.[298] The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in Parliament but was eventually allowed to lapse.[237] Modi's government passed the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence, subsuming around 17 taxes and became effective on 1 July 2017.[299]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi at the launch of the Make in India programme\nIn his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money.[300] On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes with the intention of curbing corruption, black money, terrorism and the use of counterfeit currency.[301] The move led to severe cash shortages,[302][303][304] and a steep decline in the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50,[305] and sparked widespread protests throughout the country.[306] It is estimated 1.5 million jobs were lost and that one percent of the country's GDP was wiped out.[307] Several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash.[308][309] In the subsequent year, the number of income tax returns filed for individuals rose by 25 percent and the number of digital transactions steeply increased.[310][311]\n\n\nModi's administration has observed a decline in GDP growth and increasing joblessness compared to the previous administration under Manmohan Singh.[312] During the first eight years of Modi's premiership, India's GDP grew at an average rate of 5.5% percent compared tho the rate of 7.03 percent under the previous government.[313] Income inequality increased.[314] An internal government report said in 2017, unemployment increased to its highest level in 45 years. The loss of jobs was attributed to the 2016 banknote demonetisation, and the effects of the Goods and Services Tax.[315][316] GDP growth was 6.12 percent in the 2018–19 financial year, with an inflation rate of 3.4 percent.[317] In the year 2019–20, the GDP growth rate slowed to 4.18 percent, while inflation increased to 4.7 percent.[318] The Indian economy shrunk by 6.6 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–21, and was estimated to grow at 8.2 percent the following financial year.[319]\n\n\n\n### Health and sanitation\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Swachh Bharat Mission\n\nIn his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the central government's healthcare spending.[190] In January 2015, the Modi government launched its New Health Policy (NHP), which did not increase the government's spending on healthcare but emphasised the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including a reduction in child and maternal mortality rates.[320] The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices, received nearly 20 percent less funding[321][322] in 2015 than in the previous year. The Modi administration reduced the healthcare budget by a further 15% in its second year.[323] The healthcare budget for the following year rose by 19%; private insurance providers positively viewed the budget but public health experts criticised its emphasis on the role of private healthcare providers and said it represented a shift away from public health facilities.[324] The healthcare budget rose by 11.5% in 2018; the change included an allocation of ₹20 billion (US$240 million) for a government-funded health insurance program and a decrease in the budget of the National Health Mission.[325]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi discussing the COVID-19 pandemic with Chief Ministers via videoconferencing in June 2020\nModi emphasised his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health.[320] On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (\"Clean India\") campaign. The campaign's stated goals included the elimination of open defecation and manual scavenging within five years.[326][327] As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them.[328][329][330] The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants,[331] and planned to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects faced allegations of corruption and severe difficulty in getting people to use the newly constructed toilets.[327][328][329] Sanitation cover in India increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 84.1% in May 2018 but use of the new sanitary facilities was lower than the government's targets.[332] In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated at least 180,000 diarrhoeal deaths in rural India were averted after the launch of the sanitation effort.[333]\n\n\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modi administration invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005.[334][335] The same month, all commercial domestic and international flights were suspended.[336] Modi announced a 14-hour curfew on 22 March,[337] and followed with a three-week \"total lockdown\" two days later.[338][339] Restrictions were gradually lifted beginning in April, and were completely revoked in November 2020.[336][340][341] A second wave of the pandemic that began in March 2021 was significantly more devastating than the first; some parts of India experienced shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies.[342] In late April India reported over 400,000 cases in a 24-hour period, the first country to do so.[343] India began its vaccination programme in January 2021;[344][345] in January 2022, India announced it had administered about 1.7 billion doses of vaccines and that more than 720 million people were fully vaccinated.[346] In May 2022, the WHO estimated 4.7 million people had died of COVID-19 in India, mostly during the second wave in mid 2021—almost 10 times the Indian government's estimate. The Modi administration rejected the WHO's estimate.[24][25] India's death toll was thus the highest worldwide, accounting for more than 20% of all Covid deaths.[347]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Foreign policy of Narendra Modi and trips as prime minister\n\n![](image)Modi with U.S. President Donald Trump at Namaste Trump rally in Ahmedabad, India\nForeign policy played a small role in Modi's election campaign and did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto.[348] Modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding Congress government, focused on improving economic ties, security and regional relations.[348] Modi continued Manmohan Singh's policy of \"multi-alignment\".[348] The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially East Asia, with the use of slogans such as \"Make in India\" and \"Digital India\". The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel.[l]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi meeting Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi in New Delhi in January 2018 \nIndia's relationship with the United States improved after Narendra Modi became PM.[350] During the run-up to the general election, there was wide-ranging scepticism about future of the strategic bilateral relationship under Modi's premiership; in 2005, while Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi was denied a US visa during the presidency of George W. Bush for his poor human-rights record.[160][161] Sensing Modi's victory well before the election, US Ambassador to India Nancy Powell contacted Modi as part of greater *rapprochement* from the West. Following Modi's 2014 appointment as India's PM, President Obama congratulated him over the telephone and invited Modi to visit the US.[351] The Modi government enjoyed a positive relationship with the US during the presidencies of Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump.[352][353]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi with Australian PM Anthony Albanese during the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event.\nDuring the first few months after his appointment as PM, Modi visited a number of countries in support of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN and G20 summits.[348] One of Modi's first visits as PM was to Nepal, during which he promised one billion US dollars in aid.[354] Modi also made several visits to the US;[355] this was described as an unexpected development because of the US's earlier denial of a US travel visa to Modi over his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. The visits were expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.[355]\n\n\nIn 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land-exchange deal with Bangladesh in the India–Bangladesh enclaves, which the government of Manmohan Singh had initiated.[237] Modi's administration brought renewed attention to India's \"Look East Policy\", which was instituted in 1991. The policy, which was renamed the \"Act East Policy\", involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia.[356] The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar through the Indian state of Manipur; this represented a break with India's historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade.[356] China–India relations rapidly deteriorated following the 2020 China–India skirmishes.[357] Modi pledged aid of $900 million to Afghanistan, which he visited twice and was honoured with Afghanistan's highest civilian honour in 2016.[358][359] In September 2022, Modi appeared to have developed a strong personal relationship with Russia's President Vladimir Putin.[360][361][362]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Modi excercised Cricket Diplomacy by hosting his counterpart Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese for a **Friendship through Cricket** event to celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties at the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. [363]\n\n\n\n#### G20 Presidency\n\n[edit]\n\nIndia hosted the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit, during which the African Union joined the G20 as a permanent member.[364] In an interview on 26 August 2023, Prime Minister Modi expressed optimism about the G20 countries' evolving agenda under India's presidency, shifting toward a human-centric development approach that aligns with the concerns of the Global South, including addressing climate change, debt restructuring through the G20's Common Framework for Debt, and a strategy for regulation of global cryptocurrencies.[365][366][367]\n\n\nNews sources CNN, Reuters and the *Washington Post* reported that in the lead up to the G20 meeting, the Indian authorities, including the Archaeological Survey of India embarked on a mass demolition drive against homeless shelters and slum neighborhoods across New Delhi resulting in the eviction of its marginalized residents[368][369][370] The Indian government's press agency Press Information Bureau rejected the claims, and said that they were done as per the Supreme court of India orders and not linked to the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit.[371]\n\n\n\n### Defence\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Benjamin Netanyahu, at the time Prime Minister of Israel, and Modi visiting the Technology Exhibition, at Tel Aviv, Israel in 2017\nIndia's nominal military spending steadily increased under Modi.[372] During Modi's tenure, the military budget declined, both as a fraction of GDP and when adjusted for inflation.[373][374] A substantial portion of the military budget was devoted to personnel costs commentators wrote the budget was constraining Indian military modernisation.[373][375][374]\n\n\nModi promised to be \"tough on Pakistan\" during his election campaign and repeatedly called Pakistan an exporter of terrorism.[376][377][378] On 29 September 2016, the Modi administration said Indian Army had conducted a surgical strike on terror launch pads in Azad Kashmir; the Indian media said up to 50 terrorists and Pakistani soldiers had been killed in the strike.[379][380][381] Pakistan denied any surgical strikes to have taken place.[382] Subsequent reports said India's statement about the scope of the strike and the number of casualties had been exaggerated.[376][383][384] In February 2019, India carried out airstrikes against a supposed terrorist camp in Pakistan; no targets of significance were hit.[385][386] Further military skirmishes, including cross-border shelling and the loss of an Indian aircraft, occurred.[387][388][389] Eight months after the incident, the Modi administration admitted that six Indian military personnel had been killed by friendly fire.[390]\n\n\n\n![](image)PM Modi along with Quad leaders in Washington\nIn May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops engaged in an aggressive skirmishes along the Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed Pangong Lake, Ladakh, and the Tibet Autonomous Region and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes took place in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).[391] In 2020, skirmishes between the nations led to many border clashes, responses and reactions from both sides.[392] A series of talks between India and China were held, using military and diplomatic means for peace.[393] The first border clash reported in 2021 was on 20 January; this was referred to as a minor border clash in Sikkim.[394] Modi has been criticised for maintaining silence over ceding about 2,000 sq km land to China since June 2020.[395][396][397]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Modi signed an agreement with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to extend military technical cooperation.[398] The Modi government bought the S-400 missile system, an anti-missile striking system, strengthening the relationship between the two nations.[399] India refused to condemn the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and stayed neutral.[398][400] The Indian government's Operation Ganga initiative sought to return Indians stranded in Ukraine during the war. More than 19,000 Indian nationals were evacuated,[401][402] including some from neighbouring countries.[403]\n\n\n\n### Environment\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Modi (right) at CoP21 Climate Conference, in Paris, announcing the founding of an International Solar Alliance (ISA). November 2015.\nWhile naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the Ministry of Environment and Forests the \"Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change\", and more-than-halved its money allocation in his administration's first budget.[404] The new ministry removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection, and others related to industrial activity.[240] The government also tried to reconstitute the National Board for Wildlife so it would no longer have representatives from NGOs but the Supreme Court of India blocked this move.[405] Other changes included a reduction of ministry oversight on small mining projects and ending the requirement for approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. Modi also lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in India's most-polluted areas.[405] The changes were welcomed by businesspeople but criticised by environmentalists.[406]\n\n\nSpeaking with Assamese students in 2014, Modi downplayed climate change, saying, \"Climate has not changed. We have changed. Our habits have changed. Our habits have got spoiled. Due to that, we have destroyed our entire environment.\"[407] Later in his administration, however, he has called for climate action,[408][409] especially with the proliferation of clean energy.[410][411] In 2015, Modi proposed the International Solar Alliance initiative to encourage investment in solar energy.[412] Holding developed countries responsible,[413] Modi and his government have said India has had a negligible historical role in climate change. At the COP26 conference, Modi announced India would target carbon neutrality by 2070 and expand its renewable energy capacity.[414] Indian environmentalists and economists applauded the decision, describing it as bold climate action.[415] India has become the only major economy to be on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals.[416] It has achieved 10 percent of ethanol blending five months ahead of schedule.[417]\n\n\n\n### Democratic backsliding\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding.[g] According to one study, \"The BJP government incrementally but systemically attacked nearly all existing mechanisms that are in place to hold the political executive to account, either by ensuring that these mechanisms became subservient to the political executive or were captured by party loyalists\".[29][418] The Modi government has used state power to intimidate and stifle critics in the media and academia, undermining freedom of expression and alternative sources of information.[419][30] His administration has been criticised for using a democratic mandate to undermine democratic processes, including focusing on Hindu-nationalist priorities rather than economic development. Modi's second term as PM, in particular, saw the erosion of civil rights and press freedom.[420]\n\n\n\n## Public perception and image\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Public image of Narendra Modi\n\n![](image)Modi at Yoga Day celebrations in New Delhi, 21 June 2015\nNarendra Modi has received consistently high approval ratings during his premiership;[33] he is often ranked in popular opinion polls as the greatest prime minister in Indian history.[421][422][423]\n\n\n\n### Image\n\n[edit]\n\nModi is a vegetarian and teetotaller,[424][425] who has a frugal lifestyle, and is a workaholic and introvert.[426] On 31 August 2012, he posted on Google Hangouts, becoming the first Indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat.[427][428] Modi has been called a fashion icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved *kurta*, and for a suit with his name repeatedly embroidered in the pinstripes, which he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention, and criticism.[429][430][431] Scholars and biographers have described Modi's personality as energetic, eccentric, arrogant and charismatic.[37][432]\n\n\nThe nomination of Modi for the prime-ministership drew attention to his reputation as \"one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians\".[184][433][434] During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader who would be able to take difficult decisions.[184][204][206][210][211] Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, an unusual tactic for the BJP and RSS.[206] Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and development.[435] Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy.[8] Modi's hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government also continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[8][37][157][206]\n\n\n\n### Approval ratings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Opinion polling on the Narendra Modi premiership\n\n![](image)Modi interacting with the school children after delivering his address on Independence Day in New Delhi, 15 August 2017\nDuring his premiership, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of respondents rating him \"very favourably\" and 93% approving of his government.[436] Modi's approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% during his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani.[437] At the end of his second year in office, an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him \"very favourably\".[438][439] At the end of his third year in office, a further Pew Research poll showed Modi with an overall approval rating of 88%, his highest yet, with 69% of people polled rating him \"very favourably\".[440] A poll conducted by *The Times of India* in May 2017 showed 77% of respondents rated Modi as \"very good\" and \"good\".[441] In early 2017, a survey by Pew Research Center showed Modi to be the most popular figure in Indian politics.[442] In a weekly analysis by Morning Consult called the Global Leader Approval Rating Tracker, Modi had the highest net approval rating as of 22 December 2020 of all government leaders in the 13 countries being tracked.[443][444]\n\n\n\n### In popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Category:Cultural depictions of Narendra Modi\n\n*Modi Kaka Ka Gaon* (Modi uncle's town), a 2017 Indian Hindi-language drama film by Tushar Amrish Goel, is the first biopic about Modi. It stars Vikas Mahante in the titular role.[445] *PM Narendra Modi*, a 2019 Hindi-language biographical drama film by Omung Kumar, stars Vivek Oberoi in the titular role and covers Modi's rise to the premiership.[446] An Indian web series called *Modi: Journey of a Common Man*, which is based on the same premise, was released in May 2019 on the video streaming platform Eros Now with Ashish Sharma portraying Modi.[447]\n\n\n*7 RCR* (*7, Race Course Road*), a 2014 Indian docudrama political television series which charts the political careers of prominent Indian politicians, covered Modi's rise to the PM's office in the episodes \"Story of Narendra Modi from 1950 to 2001\", \"Story of Narendra Modi in Controversial Years from 2001 to 2013\", \"Truth Behind Brand Modi\", \"Election Journey of Narendra Modi to 7 RCR\", and \"Masterplan of Narendra Modi's NDA Govt\", with Sangam Rai in the role of Modi.[448] India: The Modi Question, a 2023 BBC documentary, examines Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots and his record as Prime Minister of India. The Indian government banned the documentary, drawing widespread criticism.[449][450][451][452]\n\n\nOther portrayals of Modi include those by Rajit Kapur in the film *Uri: The Surgical Strike* (2019) and Vikram Gokhale in the web-television series *Avrodh: The Siege Within* (2020), both of which are based on the 2016 Uri attack and the subsequent Indian surgical strikes.[453][454] Gokhale reprised the role in the sequel *Avrodh: The Siege Within 2* (2022)*,* which is based on the 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation.[455] Pratap Singh played a character based on Modi in *Chand Bujh Gaya* (2005) which is set against the backdrop of the Gujarat riots.[456]\n\n\nModi appeared in an episode of Discovery Channel's show *Man vs Wild* with the host Bear Grylls,[457][458] becoming the second world leader after Barack Obama to appear in the reality show.[459] In the show, Modi treks through jungles, and talks about nature and wildlife conservation with Grylls.[460] The episode was recorded in Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand, and was broadcast in India and 180 other countries.[461] Modi hosts *Mann Ki Baat*, a monthly radio programme on All India Radio, and has conducted the competition *Pariksha Pe Charcha*, and discussions for students and the issues they face in examinations.[462][463]\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of awards and honours received by Narendra Modi\n\nIn March 2012 and June 2014, Narendra Modi appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of *Time Magazine*, becoming one of the few Indian politicians to have done so.[464][465] In 2014, *CNN-News18* (formally *CNN-IBN*) news network awarded Modi Indian of the Year.[466] In June 2015, Modi was featured on the cover of Time Magazine.[467] In 2014, 2015, 2017, 2020 and 2021, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World.[468] *Forbes Magazine* ranked him the 15th Most Powerful Person in the World in 2014 and the 9th Most Powerful Person in the World in 2015, 2016 and 2018.[469] In 2015, Modi was ranked the 13th Most Influential Person in the World by *Bloomberg Markets Magazine*.[470] In 2021 *Time* called Modi the third \"pivotal leader\" of independent India after Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, who \"dominated the country's politics like no one since them\".[471][472] Modi was ranked fifth on *Fortune Magazine*'s first annual list of the \"World's Greatest Leaders\" in 2015.[473][474] In 2017, Gallup International Association (GIA) conducted a poll and ranked Modi third-top leader of the world.[475][476] In 2016, a wax statue of Modi was unveiled at Madame Tussauds wax museum in London.[477][478]\n\n\n\n![](image)Narendra Modi's wax statue at Madame Tussauds, London\nIn 2015, Modi was named one of *Time*'s \"30 Most Influential People on the Internet\" because he was the second-most-followed politician on Twitter and Facebook.[479] In 2018, he was the third-most-followed world leader on Twitter and the most-followed world leader on Facebook and Instagram.[480][481][482] In October 2018, Modi received United Nations' highest environmental award, the Champions of the Earth, for policy leadership by \"pioneering work in championing\" the International Solar Alliance and \"new areas of levels of cooperation on environmental action\".[483][484] Modi was conferred the 2018 Seoul Peace Prize in recognition of \"his dedication to improving international co-operation, raising global economic growth, accelerating the Human Development of the people of India by fostering economic growth and furthering the development of democracy through anti-corruption and social integration efforts\". He is the first Indian to win the award.[485][486]\n\n\nFollowing his second swearing-in ceremony as Prime Minister of India, a picture of Modi was displayed on the facade of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) building in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.[487] The Texas India Forum hosted a community event in honour of Modi on 22 September 2019 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. The event was attended by over 50,000 people and several American politicians, including President Donald Trump, making it the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope.[488][489] At the event, Modi was presented with the Key to the City of Houston by Mayor Sylvester Turner.[490] The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Modi the Global Goalkeeper Award on 24 September 2019 in New York City, in recognition of the Swachh Bharat Mission and \"the progress India has made in providing safe sanitation under his leadership\".[491][492][493]\n\n\nIn 2020, Modi was among eight world leaders who were awarded the parody Ig Nobel Prize in Medical Education \"for using the COVID-19 viral pandemic to teach the world that politicians can have a more immediate effect on life and death than scientists and doctors can\".[494] On 21 December 2020, US President Donald Trump awarded Modi the Legion of Merit for improving India–United States relations.[495][496][497][498] On 24 February 2021, Gujarat Cricket Association renamed Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad—the largest cricket stadium in the world—Narendra Modi Stadium.[499]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Electoral history of Narendra Modi\n\n\n\nElection results\n| Year\n | Office\n | Constituency\n | Party\n | Votes for Modi\n | %\n | Opponent\n | Party\n | Votes\n | %\n | Result\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002 | Member of the Legislative Assembly | Rajkot II | Bharatiya Janata Party | ![](image) | 45,298\n | 57.32\n | Ashwinbhai Narbheshankar Mehta\n | Indian National Congress | ![](image) | 30,570\n | 38.68\n | Won\n | [500] |\n| 2002 | Maninagar | 113,589\n | 73.29\n | Yatinbhai Oza | 38,256\n | 24.68\n | Won\n | [501] |\n| 2007 | 139,568\n | 69.53\n | Dinsha Patel | 52,407\n | 26.11\n | Won\n | [502] |\n| 2012 | 120,470\n | 75.38\n | Shweta Sanjiv Bhat\n | 34,097\n | 21.34\n | Won\n | [174] |\n| 2014 | Member of the Lok Sabha | Vadodara | 845,464\n | 72.75\n | Madhusudan Mistry | 275,336\n | 23.69\n | Won\n | [503] |\n| 2014 | Varanasi | 581,022\n | 56.37\n | Arvind Kejriwal | Aam Aadmi Party | ![](image) | 209,238\n | 20.30\n | Won\n | [218] |\n| 2019 | 674,664\n | 63.62\n | Shalini Yadav\n | Samajwadi Party |  | 195,159\n | 18.40\n | Won\n | [504] |\n\n\n## Writing career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, Modi published a Gujarati book titled *Jyotipunj*, which contains profiles of RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as *Pujniya Shri Guruji* (\"Guru worthy of worship\").[505] According to *The Economic Times*, Modi's intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers, and to reassure RSS members he remained ideologically aligned with them.\n\n\nAfter becoming the Prime Minister he also authored a book called Exam Warriors, a guide for children to commendably face exams. Modi has written eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.[506]\n\n\n\n## Private life\n\n[edit]\n\nModi used to maintain a close and publicised relationship with his centenarian mother, Hiraben.[507]\n\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see Bibliography of Narendra Modi.\n\n* Modi, Narendra (2004). *Aapaatkaal Mein Gujarat* (in Hindi) (Samskarana 1 ed.).

Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.\n\n\nModi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. His account of helping his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably corroborated. At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.[c]\n\n\nIn 2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[d] and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. A little over 1,000 people were killed, according to official records, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.[10] A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[e] While his policies as chief minister, which were credited for encouraging economic growth, were praised, Modi's administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[f] In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and it reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated the 2016 demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and introduced the Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.\n\n\nModi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[13][14] and the deaths of six Indian personnel to friendly fire was later revealed: but the action had nationalist appeal.[15] Modi's party comfortably won the 2019 general election which followed.[16] In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, an Indian-administred portion of the disputed Kashmir region,[17][18] and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs,[19][20][21] sometimes with the complicity of police forces controlled by the Modi administration.[22][23] Three controversial farm laws, led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which 4.7 million Indians died, according to the World Health Organization's estimates.[24][25]\n\n\nUnder Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of democratic institutions, individual rights, and freedom of expression.[26][27][g] As prime minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings.[33][34][35] Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally, over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[h]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nNarendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (1923–2022).[42][b][43]\n\n\nAccording to Modi, as a child, he had to work in his father's tea shop on the platform of Vadnagar railway station,[44] but the evidence of his neighbours does not entirely corroborate this statement.[45][46] During a protest against the government, his brother, Prahlad Modi, contradicted that he ever sold tea. According to him, his father had brought up six of his children by selling tea and people were making a big mistake by calling the Prime Minister a \"chai wala\" (tea seller).[47]\n\n\nModi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967; his teachers described him as an average student and a keen, gifted debater with an interest in theatre.[48] He preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[49][50]\n\n\nWhen Modi was eight years old, he was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local *shakhas* (training sessions). There, he met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, who inducted Modi as a *balswayamsevak* (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor.[51] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who in 1980 helped found the BJP's Gujarat unit.[52]\n\n\nIn a custom traditional to Narendra Modi's caste, his family arranged a betrothal to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18.[53][54] Soon afterwards, he abandoned his wife,[55] and left home. The couple never divorced but the marriage was not in his public pronouncements for many decades.[54] In April 2014, shortly before the national election in which he gained power, Modi publicly affirmed he was married and that his spouse was Jashodaben.[56] The marriage was unconsummated and Modi kept it secret because he would not have been able to become a *pracharak* in the puritanical RSS.[57][58]\n\n\nModi spent the following two years travelling across northern and north-eastern India.[59] In interviews, he has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. His stays at each ashram were brief because he lacked the required college education.[60] Vivekananda has had a large influence in Modi's life.[61]\n\n\nIn mid 1968, Modi reached Belur Math but was turned away, after which he visited Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. He then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before returning to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968 to 1969. In either late 1969 or early 1970, he returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad,[62][63] where he lived with his uncle and worked in his uncle's canteen at Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[64]\n\n\nIn Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city.[65][66][67] Modi's first-known political activity as an adult was in 1971 when he joined a Jana Sangh Satyagraha in Delhi led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to enlist to fight in the Bangladesh Liberation War.[68][69] The Indira Gandhi-led central government prohibited open support for the Mukti Bahini; according to Modi, he was briefly held in Tihar Jail.[70][71][72] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Modi left his uncle's employ and became a full-time *pracharak* (campaigner) for the RSS,[73] working under Inamdar.[74] Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest in New Delhi against the Indian government, for which he was arrested; because of this arrest, Inamdar decided to mentor Modi.[74] According to Modi, he was part of a Satyagraha that led to a political war.[71][i]\n\n\nIn 1978, Modi received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in political science from the School of Open Learning[77] at the Delhi University.[57][78] In 1983, he received a Master of Arts (MA) degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class[79][80] as an external distance learning student.[81] There is a controversy surrounding the authenticity of his BA and MA degrees.[82][83][j]\n\n\n\n## Early political career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India that lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \"the Emergency\", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[87][88] Modi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[89] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once as a Sikh.[90] He became involved in the printing of pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[91][92] He was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals who were wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[93] During this period, Modi wrote a Gujarati-language book titled *Sangharsh Ma Gujarat* (*In the Struggles of Gujarat*), which describes events during the Emergency.[94][95] While in this role, Modi met trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes and several other national political figures.[96]\n\n\nModi became an RSS *sambhag pracharak* (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing activities in Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he researched and wrote the RSS's history of the Emergency. Shortly after, he returned to Gujarat and in 1985, the RSS assigned him to the BJP. In 1987, Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably; according to biographers, Modi's planning was responsible for the win.[97][98] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the party; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role. Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi with Atal Bihari Vajpayee in c. 2001\nModi rose within the party and was named a member of its National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise Advani's Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991–1992 *Ekta Yatra* (Journey for Unity).[48][100][101] Modi took a brief break from politics in 1992 to establish a school in Ahmedabad, and due to friction with Shankersinh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat.[101] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani; as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly election.[102][103] In November of that year, Modi was appointed BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[104] The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha election.[48] Modi, who was on the selection committee for the 1998 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as central to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 election,[105] and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.[106]\n\n\n\n## Chief Minister of Gujarat\n\n[edit]\n\n### Taking office\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[105][107][108] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement.[48] Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government. Modi declined an offer to become Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee he was \"going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\". On 3 October 2001, Modi replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the upcoming December 2002 election.[109] On 7 October, Modi was sworn in[110] and he entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 after winning a by-election in Rajkot II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC.[111]\n\n\n\n### 2002 Gujarat riots\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2002 Gujarat riots\n\nOn 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[k][114] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims who were returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[115][116] In a public statement, Modi said local Muslims were responsible for the incident.[7][115][117] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a *bandh* (general strike) across the state.[118][119] Riots began during the *bandh* and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[115][118][119] The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[115][120] The state government later stated 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed during the riots;[116] independent sources put the death toll at over 2,000,[115][114][121] the vast majority of them Muslims.[114] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[122] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilation of women.[6][123]\n\n\nScholars consider the Government of Gujarat to have been complicit in the riots,[7][124] and it has received much criticism for its handling of the situation;[125] some scholars explicitly blame Modi.[6][126][127] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets; these measures failed to prevent the violence from escalating.[118][119] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the *bandh* despite such actions being illegal at the time.[7] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, which were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[128] Muslim victims of the riots were subjected to further discrimination when the state government announced their compensation would be half that offered to Hindu victims; this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[129] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[6][117][130] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom and others have called it an example of state terrorism.[131][132][133] According to Martha Nussbaum, \"There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law\".[6]\n\n\nModi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, he said, \"What is happening is a chain of action and reaction\".[6] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[134] In March 2008, the Supreme Court of India reopened several cases related to the riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[125][135][136] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri, the widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre, in April 2009, the court also asked the SIT to investigate Modi's complicity in the killings.[135] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[135][137] In July 2011, the court-appointed *amicus curiae* Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, Ramachandran said Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[138][139] The Supreme Court sent the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013, the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding there was no evidence against Modi.[140] In 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition by Zakia Jafri in which she challenged the clean chit given to Modi in the riots by the SIT, and upheld previous rulings that no evidence against him was found.[141][142][143]\n\n\n\n### Later terms as Chief Minister\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2002 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election\n\nFollowing the violence, calls for Modi to resign as chief minister were made from politicians within and outside the state, including leaders of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party—partners in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition—and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[144] Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa but it was not accepted.[145] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[146] In the election, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[147] Modi made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[148][149][150][151] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among voters.[146] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride,[5][148] a strategy that led to the BJP winning 127 of the 182[147] seats—a two-thirds majority—in the state assembly.[5][148] He won Maninagar constituency, defeating Congress candidate Yatin Oza.[152] On 22 December 2002, Modi was sworn in for a second term.[153]\n\n\nDuring Modi's second term, the government's rhetoric shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development.[107][5][148] He curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).[154] When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration, Modi ordered the BKS's eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[154][155] Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. He wrote a foreword to a 2014 textbook by Dinanath Batra, which made the unscientific claim that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[156][157]\n\n\nModi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Indian general election, following which, Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[158][159] Western nations also raised questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims: the US State Department barred him from entering the United States in accordance with the recommendations of that country's Commission on International Religious Freedom,[160][161] the only person to be denied a US visa under this law.[160] The UK and the European Union (EU) refused to admit Modi because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[162] and the EU[163] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister in 2014, the US lifted its ban and invited him to Washington, D.C.[164][165]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi meeting with then-Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh in 2004\nDuring the run-up to the 2007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election and the 2009 Indian general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[166] Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \"for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act.[167] In 2007, Modi wrote *Karmayog*, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, he said scavenging is a \"spiritual experience\" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits.[168][169] The book was not circulated at that time because of the election code of conduct.[170] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Gujarat government authorised the deployment of 30 high-speed boats for coastal surveillance.[171] In July 2007, Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post.[172] The BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.[173]\n\n\nDespite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's campaigns in 2007 and 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections contained elements of Hindu nationalism. He attended only Hindu religious ceremonies and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign, Modi twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.[148] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[148] Modi's 2012 campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including Afzal Guru and the death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the 2012 assembly election.[148] During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[148] While campaigning for the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies, allowing him to reach a large number of people,[146] something he repeated in the 2014 general election. Modi won the constituency of Maninagar, defeating Shweta Bhatt of the INC.[174] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure.[175] After his election as Prime Minister of India, Modi resigned as the Gujarat chief minister and as MLA for Maninagar. Anandiben Patel succeeded Modi as chief minister.[176]\n\n\n\n### Development projects\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Sardar Sarovar Dam during a 2006 height increase\nAs chief minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, which is usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. Modi's policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in Gujarat. He established financial and technology parks in the state and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth ₹6.6 trillion (equivalent to ₹20 trillion or US$240 billion in 2023) were signed.[107]\n\n\nThe governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[177] Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[178] As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India.[177] The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[179] led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.[180] Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project irrigated only 4–6% of the area intended.[177] In 2008, Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano car after popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Following Tata, several other companies relocated to Gujarat.[181]\n\n\nThe Modi government finished the process of taking electricity to every village in Gujarat its predecessor had almost completed.[182] Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Early protests by farmers ended when those who benefitted found their electricity supply had stabilised[177] but, according to an assessment study, corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[183]\n\n\n\n### Development debate\n\n[edit]\n\n![Modi speaking at flower-decked podium](image)Modi addressing graduates of the Gujarat National Law University in 2012 \nA contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat's economic development during Modi's tenure as chief minister.[184] The state's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate averaged 10% during his tenure, a rate similar to those of other highly industrialised states, and above that of India as a whole.[181] Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office; some scholars have stated growth did not much accelerate during his tenure.[185] Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank's \"ease of doing business\" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.[186] In 2013, a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights, and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states, ranked Gujarat first among Indian states for \"economic freedom\".[181][187] In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.[5] Tax breaks and land for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states. Modi's policies of making Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones in which labour laws were greatly weakened.[148]\n\n\nDespite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in India with respect to rates of poverty, and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the \"alarming\" category on the India State Hunger Index.[188][189] A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found Gujarat under Modi had a poor record in immunisation of children.[190]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.[129] It showed a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.[129] The quality of education in government schools in Gujarat ranked below that of many Indian states.[129] The state government's social policies generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.[129] Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas and those from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013, the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index.[9] Under Modi, the state government spent less than the national average on education and healthcare.[129]\n\n\n\n### Allegations of bribery\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring its raids in 2013 and 2014, the CBI seized some diaries from two big Indian companies, Sahara Group and Aditya Birla Group. These diaries contained references of alleged payments made to leaders belonging to as many as 18 political parties including BJP, Congress, JDU, BJD etc.[191][192] Among these were some entries mentioning \"Gujarat CM\" and \"Ahmadabad Modiji\".[193][194][192] Citing these entries, on 21 December 2016, the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that Modi received cash bribes worth ₹65 crore from Sahara Group and Aditya Birla Group when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.[195][196] In November 2016, advocate Prashant Bhushan had filed a plea in the Supreme Court of India asking for investigation of the alleged bribe payments made to some senior public servants including Modi.[197][198] A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Arun Kumar Mishra dismissed the plea in January 2017 stating that the evidence provided was insufficient.[199][200] Later on, Justice Mishra was criticised by a section of advocates and activists for siding with the Modi government in multiple judgements during his tenure at the Supreme Court.[201][202] *The Wire* questioned the manner in which the Supreme Court buried the Sahara-Birla diaries' investigation.[203]\n\n\n\n## Premiership campaigns\n\n[edit]\n\n### 2014 Indian general election\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2014 Indian general election\n\n![](image)Narendra Modi hands over his resignation as Maninagar MLA to the Speaker of the Gujarat Vidhan Sabha.\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) BJP announces Shri Narendra Modi as its Prime Ministerial candidate for Loksabha Elections. Bharatiya Janata Party on YouTube, 13 September 2013 |\n\n\nIn September 2013, Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[204][205] Several BJP leaders,[206] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani who cited concern with leaders who were \"concerned with their personal agendas\", expressed opposition to Modi's candidature.[207] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's 2009 general election campaign.[208][209] Several people who voted for the BJP stated they would have voted for another party if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate.[204][210][211] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.[206][212] The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi meets his mother after winning the 2014 Indian general election\nDuring the campaign, Modi focused on corruption scandals under the previous Congress government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat.[206] He projected himself as a person who could bring about \"development\" without focusing on specific policies.[206] His message found support among young and middle-class people. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism.[209] Prior to the election, Modi's media image had centred around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots but during the campaign, the BJP focused on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development.[209] The BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders who publicly opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose and Ram Manohar Lohia.[157] Hindutva remained a part of the campaign; BJP leaders used Hindutva-based rhetoric in several states.[213][206][210][38] Communal tensions were played upon, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Northeast India.[213] A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP's election manifesto.[38]\nThe BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.[189] Modi's campaign blitz cost around ₹50 billion (US$600 million)[184] and the BJP received extensive financial support from corporate donors.[214] In addition to more-conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media[184][206] and addressed more than 1,000 rallies via hologram appearances.[38]\n\n\nThe BJP won 31 percent of the vote,[37] and more-than-doubled its number of seats in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984.[209][210] Voter dissatisfaction with the Congress and with regional parties in North India, and support from the RSS were reasons for the BJP's success.[210][206] In states such as Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, and its Muslim vote increased to 10 percent. The BJP performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims.[210] The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties towards the right-wing.[38][184][210][215][216] Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.[217]\n\n\nModi was a candidate for the Lok Sabha constituencies Varanasi and Vadodara.[218] He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi by 371,784 votes and Madhusudan Mistry of the Congress in Vadodara by 570,128 votes.[219] India's president appointed Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, Prime Minister of India.[220][221] To comply with the law prohibiting MPs from representing more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat.[222]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Indian general election\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2019 Indian general election\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) BJP announced manifesto and Shri Narendra Modi as prime minister candidate. Bharatiya Janata Party on YouTube, 8 April 2019. |\n\n\nOn 13 October 2018, Modi was named the BJP candidate for prime minister in the 2019 general election.[223] The BJP's chief campaigner was its president Amit Shah. Modi launched the party's *Main Bhi Chowkidar* (\"I too am a watchman\") campaign ahead of the general election, against the INC's campaign slogan *Chowkidar Chor Hai* (\"The watchman is a thief\").[224] In 2018, the Telugu Desam Party split from the NDA over the campaign for special status for Andhra Pradesh.[225]\n\n\nAmit Shah launched the BJP's election campaign on 8 April 2019. In the campaign, the opposition targeted Modi on allegations of corruption over the Rafale deal with the Government of France, highlighting the controversy surrounding the deal.[226] Modi's campaign focused on defence and national security, especially after the Pulwama attack and the retaliatory Balakot airstrike, which was counted as an achievement of his administration.[16][227] Other topics in the campaign were development and good foreign relations in the first premiership.[228]\n\n\nModi contested the Lok Sabha election as a candidate for Varanasi; he won the seat by a margin of 479,505 votes, defeating Shalini Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP), who stood as a candidate for the SP-BSP alliance.[229][230] Modi was unanimously appointed prime minister for a second time by the National Democratic Alliance[231] after the alliance won the election for the second time with 353 seats in the Lok Sabha; the BJP alone won 303 seats.[232][233]\n\n\n\n## Prime Minister\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Premiership of Narendra Modi\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the premiership of Narendra Modi.\n![](image)Modi taking the oath of office as the Prime Minister of India, with President Pranab Mukherjee administering the oath\n![](image)Modi taking the oath of office as the Prime Minister of India for the second time, with President Ram Nath Kovind administering the oath\nAfter the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a landslide in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister (PM) of India on 26 May 2014, becoming the first Indian PM to be born after the country's independence from the British Empire in 1947.[234] Modi's second term as PM began in 2019 following the NDA's 2019 Lok Sabha election win. On 6 December 2020, he became the fourth-longest-serving Prime Minister of India and the longest-serving non-Congress prime minister.[235]\n\n\n\n### Governance and other initiatives\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Prime Minister Modi walking towards the dais to address the Nation at Red Fort, on the occasion of 75th Independence Day, in Delhi on 15 August 2021\nModi's first year as PM saw significant centralisation of power.[157][236] Modi, who initially lacked a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament, passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[237] His administration enacted a bill to increase its control over the appointment of judges and reducing that of the judiciary.[37] In December 2014, he abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog),[238][239] concentrating the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the PM.[237][238][239][240][241] The Planning Commission had in previous years been criticised for creating inefficiency in the government and of not fulfilling its role of improving social welfare but since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.[239]\n\n\nIn its first year of administration, the Modi government launched investigations through the Intelligence Bureau into numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the grounds these organisations were slowing economic growth. The investigations were criticised as a witch hunt. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres, and environmental nonprofit organisation Sierra Club and Avaaz were among the groups that were investigated.[157][240] Cases of sedition and terrorism laws were filed against individuals who criticised the government.[157][242] This led to discontent within the BJP about his style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.[157][237]\n\n\nModi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments in the previous 64 years.[243][244][245] Modi launched the Digital India programme with the goal of ensuring government services are available electronically, build infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boost manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promote digital literacy.[246][247]\n\n\nIn 2019, a law to reserve 10 percent of educational admission and government jobs for economically disadvantaged individuals was passed.[248][249] In 2016, Modi's administration launched the Ujjwala scheme to provide free liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to rural households. The scheme led to an additional 24% of Indian households having access to LPG in 2019 as compared to 2014.[250] In 2022, the government eliminated LPG subsidies for all citizens except those covered by the Ujjwala program.[251]\n\n\nSince May 2023, ethnic tensions between some groups have resulted in violent clashes in Manipur. After 1 month of the violence, nearly 100 were killed and more than 36,000 people were displaced.[252] Narendra Modi has been criticised for his lack of reaction towards the violence.[253]\n\n\n\n### Hindutva\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Hindutva\n\n![](image)Modi pays obeisance at Tirumala Temple in Andhra Pradesh. \nThe activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after Modi's appointment as prime minister, sometimes with the government's support.[254][255] These activities included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the supposed Islamic practice of \"Love Jihad\" and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right-wing organisation Hindu Mahasabha.[256][257] Government officials, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion programmes.[213]\n\n\nLinks between the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) grew stronger under Modi. The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP's electoral campaigns while the Modi administration appointed RSS-affiliated individuals to prominent government positions.[258] In 2014, Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, became the chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).[38] Historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the BJP, questioned Rao's credentials as a historian and stated the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism.[38][259][260] During its first term, the Modi administration appointed other RSS members to lead universities and research institutions, and recruitment of faculty members favouring the RSS increased. According to scholars Nandini Sundar and Kiran Bhatty, many of these appointees did not possess the qualifications for their positions.[261] The Modi administration also made numerous changes in government-approved history textbooks that de-emphasised the role of Jawaharlal Nehru and glorified that of Modi while also portraying Indian society as harmonious, and without conflict and inequity.[261][262]\n\n\nIn 2019, the Modi administration passed a citizenship law that provides a route to Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians,[263][264] but does not grant eligibility to Muslims.[265][266][267] This was first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law; it attracted global criticism and prompted widespread protests that were halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[261][267][268] Counter-demonstrations against the protests developed into the 2020 Delhi riots, caused chiefly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims.[269][270] Fifty-three people were killed in the protests, two-thirds of whom were Muslim.[271][272][273][274][275] On 5 August 2020, Modi visited Ayodhya after the Supreme Court in 2019 ordered contested land in Ayodhya to be handed to a trust to build a Hindu temple and ordered the government to give alternative 5 acres (2.0 ha) of land to the Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque.[276] Modi became the first PM to visit temples at Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanuman Garhi.[277]\n\n\nSoon after Modi returned to power in 2019, he took three actions the RSS had long called for.[261] The practice of Triple Talaq was made illegal and became a punishable act from 1 August 2019.[278][279][280] The administration repealed Article 370 of the Indian constitution that granted autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, and also abrogated its statehood, reorganising it into the union territories Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.[261][281] The region was placed under a lockdown and internet services were suspended and were not completely restored until February 2021.[282] Thousands of people, including hundreds of political leaders, were detained.[283][284][285][286] The Supreme Court of India did not hear constitutional challenges to the reorganisation or the Citizenship Amendment Act. According to Bhatty and Sundar, this is an example of the subversion of the Supreme Court and other major institutions, which were filled with appointees favouring the BJP.[261]\n\n\n\n### Economy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)BRICS leaders in 2019. Left to right: Xi (China), Putin (Russia), Bolsonaro (Brazil), Modi and Ramaphosa (South Africa) \nThe Modi government's economic policies focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, and were based on a neoliberal framework.[240][287] Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including defence and railways.[240][288][289] Other proposed reforms included making the forming of unions more difficult for workers, and making recruitment and dismissal easier for employers;[287] some of these proposals were abandoned after protests.[290] The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions—including one affiliated with the BJP—struck.[287] The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (Indian Workers Union), a constituent of the Sangh Parivar (Family of the RSS), stated the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers.[240]\n\n\nThe funds dedicated to poverty-reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly reduced by Modi's administration.[157] The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6 percent of GDP during the previous Congress government to 12.6 percent during Modi's first year in office, and spending on health and family welfare declined by 15 percent.[240] The government lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold and jewellery.[240] In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices.[291] During Modi's first term, his government reduced spending on education as share of the budget: over five years, education spending dropped from 0.7 percent of GDP to 0.5 percent.[292][293][294] The percentage of the budget spent on children's nutrition, education, health, and associated programmes was almost halved between 2014 and 2022.[295] Capital expenditure on transport infrastructure significantly rose, increasing from less than 0.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 1.7 percent in 2023.[296]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.[240][297] Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative but critics said it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market.[240] Modi's administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it.[298] The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in Parliament but was eventually allowed to lapse.[237] Modi's government passed the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence, subsuming around 17 taxes and became effective on 1 July 2017.[299]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi at the launch of the Make in India programme\nIn his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money.[300] On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes with the intention of curbing corruption, black money, terrorism and the use of counterfeit currency.[301] The move led to severe cash shortages,[302][303][304] and a steep decline in the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50,[305] and sparked widespread protests throughout the country.[306] It is estimated 1.5 million jobs were lost and that one percent of the country's GDP was wiped out.[307] Several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash.[308][309] In the subsequent year, the number of income tax returns filed for individuals rose by 25 percent and the number of digital transactions steeply increased.[310][311]\n\n\nModi's administration has observed a decline in GDP growth and increasing joblessness compared to the previous administration under Manmohan Singh.[312] During the first eight years of Modi's premiership, India's GDP grew at an average rate of 5.5% percent compared tho the rate of 7.03 percent under the previous government.[313] Income inequality increased.[314] An internal government report said in 2017, unemployment increased to its highest level in 45 years. The loss of jobs was attributed to the 2016 banknote demonetisation, and the effects of the Goods and Services Tax.[315][316] GDP growth was 6.12 percent in the 2018–19 financial year, with an inflation rate of 3.4 percent.[317] In the year 2019–20, the GDP growth rate slowed to 4.18 percent, while inflation increased to 4.7 percent.[318] The Indian economy shrunk by 6.6 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–21, and was estimated to grow at 8.2 percent the following financial year.[319]\n\n\n\n### Health and sanitation\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Swachh Bharat Mission\n\nIn his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the central government's healthcare spending.[190] In January 2015, the Modi government launched its New Health Policy (NHP), which did not increase the government's spending on healthcare but emphasised the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including a reduction in child and maternal mortality rates.[320] The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices, received nearly 20 percent less funding[321][322] in 2015 than in the previous year. The Modi administration reduced the healthcare budget by a further 15% in its second year.[323] The healthcare budget for the following year rose by 19%; private insurance providers positively viewed the budget but public health experts criticised its emphasis on the role of private healthcare providers and said it represented a shift away from public health facilities.[324] The healthcare budget rose by 11.5% in 2018; the change included an allocation of ₹20 billion (US$240 million) for a government-funded health insurance program and a decrease in the budget of the National Health Mission.[325]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi discussing the COVID-19 pandemic with Chief Ministers via videoconferencing in June 2020\nModi emphasised his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health.[320] On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (\"Clean India\") campaign. The campaign's stated goals included the elimination of open defecation and manual scavenging within five years.[326][327] As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them.[328][329][330] The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants,[331] and planned to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. The construction projects faced allegations of corruption and severe difficulty in getting people to use the newly constructed toilets.[327][328][329] Sanitation cover in India increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 84.1% in May 2018 but use of the new sanitary facilities was lower than the government's targets.[332] In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated at least 180,000 diarrhoeal deaths in rural India were averted after the launch of the sanitation effort.[333]\n\n\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modi administration invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005.[334][335] The same month, all commercial domestic and international flights were suspended.[336] Modi announced a 14-hour curfew on 22 March,[337] and followed with a three-week \"total lockdown\" two days later.[338][339] Restrictions were gradually lifted beginning in April, and were completely revoked in November 2020.[336][340][341] A second wave of the pandemic that began in March 2021 was significantly more devastating than the first; some parts of India experienced shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies.[342] In late April India reported over 400,000 cases in a 24-hour period, the first country to do so.[343] India began its vaccination programme in January 2021;[344][345] in January 2022, India announced it had administered about 1.7 billion doses of vaccines and that more than 720 million people were fully vaccinated.[346] In May 2022, the WHO estimated 4.7 million people had died of COVID-19 in India, mostly during the second wave in mid 2021—almost 10 times the Indian government's estimate. The Modi administration rejected the WHO's estimate.[24][25] India's death toll was thus the highest worldwide, accounting for more than 20% of all Covid deaths.[347]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Foreign policy of Narendra Modi and trips as prime minister\n\n![](image)Modi with U.S. President Donald Trump at Namaste Trump rally in Ahmedabad, India\nForeign policy played a small role in Modi's election campaign and did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto.[348] Modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding Congress government, focused on improving economic ties, security and regional relations.[348] Modi continued Manmohan Singh's policy of \"multi-alignment\".[348] The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially East Asia, with the use of slogans such as \"Make in India\" and \"Digital India\". The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel.[l]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi meeting Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi in New Delhi in January 2018 \nIndia's relationship with the United States improved after Narendra Modi became PM.[350] During the run-up to the general election, there was wide-ranging scepticism about future of the strategic bilateral relationship under Modi's premiership; in 2005, while Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi was denied a US visa during the presidency of George W. Bush for his poor human-rights record.[160][161] Sensing Modi's victory well before the election, US Ambassador to India Nancy Powell contacted Modi as part of greater *rapprochement* from the West. Following Modi's 2014 appointment as India's PM, President Obama congratulated him over the telephone and invited Modi to visit the US.[351] The Modi government enjoyed a positive relationship with the US during the presidencies of Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump.[352][353]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi with Australian PM Anthony Albanese during the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event.\nDuring the first few months after his appointment as PM, Modi visited a number of countries in support of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN and G20 summits.[348] One of Modi's first visits as PM was to Nepal, during which he promised one billion US dollars in aid.[354] Modi also made several visits to the US;[355] this was described as an unexpected development because of the US's earlier denial of a US travel visa to Modi over his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. The visits were expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.[355]\n\n\nIn 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land-exchange deal with Bangladesh in the India–Bangladesh enclaves, which the government of Manmohan Singh had initiated.[237] Modi's administration brought renewed attention to India's \"Look East Policy\", which was instituted in 1991. The policy, which was renamed the \"Act East Policy\", involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia.[356] The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar through the Indian state of Manipur; this represented a break with India's historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade.[356] China–India relations rapidly deteriorated following the 2020 China–India skirmishes.[357] Modi pledged aid of $900 million to Afghanistan, which he visited twice and was honoured with Afghanistan's highest civilian honour in 2016.[358][359] In September 2022, Modi appeared to have developed a strong personal relationship with Russia's President Vladimir Putin.[360][361][362]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Modi excercised Cricket Diplomacy by hosting his counterpart Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese for a **Friendship through Cricket** event to celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties at the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. [363]\n\n\n\n#### G20 Presidency\n\n[edit]\n\nIndia hosted the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit, during which the African Union joined the G20 as a permanent member.[364] In an interview on 26 August 2023, Prime Minister Modi expressed optimism about the G20 countries' evolving agenda under India's presidency, shifting toward a human-centric development approach that aligns with the concerns of the Global South, including addressing climate change, debt restructuring through the G20's Common Framework for Debt, and a strategy for regulation of global cryptocurrencies.[365][366][367]\n\n\nNews sources CNN, Reuters and the *Washington Post* reported that in the lead up to the G20 meeting, the Indian authorities, including the Archaeological Survey of India embarked on a mass demolition drive against homeless shelters and slum neighborhoods across New Delhi resulting in the eviction of its marginalized residents[368][369][370] The Indian government's press agency Press Information Bureau rejected the claims, and said that they were done as per the Supreme court of India orders and not linked to the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit.[371]\n\n\n\n### Defence\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Benjamin Netanyahu, at the time Prime Minister of Israel, and Modi visiting the Technology Exhibition, at Tel Aviv, Israel in 2017\nIndia's nominal military spending steadily increased under Modi.[372] During Modi's tenure, the military budget declined, both as a fraction of GDP and when adjusted for inflation.[373][374] A substantial portion of the military budget was devoted to personnel costs commentators wrote the budget was constraining Indian military modernisation.[373][375][374]\n\n\nModi promised to be \"tough on Pakistan\" during his election campaign and repeatedly called Pakistan an exporter of terrorism.[376][377][378] On 29 September 2016, the Modi administration said Indian Army had conducted a surgical strike on terror launch pads in Azad Kashmir; the Indian media said up to 50 terrorists and Pakistani soldiers had been killed in the strike.[379][380][381] Pakistan denied any surgical strikes to have taken place.[382] Subsequent reports said India's statement about the scope of the strike and the number of casualties had been exaggerated.[376][383][384] In February 2019, India carried out airstrikes against a supposed terrorist camp in Pakistan; no targets of significance were hit.[385][386] Further military skirmishes, including cross-border shelling and the loss of an Indian aircraft, occurred.[387][388][389] Eight months after the incident, the Modi administration admitted that six Indian military personnel had been killed by friendly fire.[390]\n\n\n\n![](image)PM Modi along with Quad leaders in Washington\nIn May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops engaged in an aggressive skirmishes along the Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed Pangong Lake, Ladakh, and the Tibet Autonomous Region and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes took place in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).[391] In 2020, skirmishes between the nations led to many border clashes, responses and reactions from both sides.[392] A series of talks between India and China were held, using military and diplomatic means for peace.[393] The first border clash reported in 2021 was on 20 January; this was referred to as a minor border clash in Sikkim.[394] Modi has been criticised for maintaining silence over ceding about 2,000 sq km land to China since June 2020.[395][396][397]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Modi signed an agreement with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to extend military technical cooperation.[398] The Modi government bought the S-400 missile system, an anti-missile striking system, strengthening the relationship between the two nations.[399] India refused to condemn the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and stayed neutral.[398][400] The Indian government's Operation Ganga initiative sought to return Indians stranded in Ukraine during the war. More than 19,000 Indian nationals were evacuated,[401][402] including some from neighbouring countries.[403]\n\n\n\n### Environment\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Modi (right) at CoP21 Climate Conference, in Paris, announcing the founding of an International Solar Alliance (ISA). November 2015.\nWhile naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the Ministry of Environment and Forests the \"Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change\", and more-than-halved its money allocation in his administration's first budget.[404] The new ministry removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection, and others related to industrial activity.[240] The government also tried to reconstitute the National Board for Wildlife so it would no longer have representatives from NGOs but the Supreme Court of India blocked this move.[405] Other changes included a reduction of ministry oversight on small mining projects and ending the requirement for approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. Modi also lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in India's most-polluted areas.[405] The changes were welcomed by businesspeople but criticised by environmentalists.[406]\n\n\nSpeaking with Assamese students in 2014, Modi downplayed climate change, saying, \"Climate has not changed. We have changed. Our habits have changed. Our habits have got spoiled. Due to that, we have destroyed our entire environment.\"[407] Later in his administration, however, he has called for climate action,[408][409] especially with the proliferation of clean energy.[410][411] In 2015, Modi proposed the International Solar Alliance initiative to encourage investment in solar energy.[412] Holding developed countries responsible,[413] Modi and his government have said India has had a negligible historical role in climate change. At the COP26 conference, Modi announced India would target carbon neutrality by 2070 and expand its renewable energy capacity.[414] Indian environmentalists and economists applauded the decision, describing it as bold climate action.[415] India has become the only major economy to be on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals.[416] It has achieved 10 percent of ethanol blending five months ahead of schedule.[417]\n\n\n\n### Democratic backsliding\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding.[g] According to one study, \"The BJP government incrementally but systemically attacked nearly all existing mechanisms that are in place to hold the political executive to account, either by ensuring that these mechanisms became subservient to the political executive or were captured by party loyalists\".[29][418] The Modi government has used state power to intimidate and stifle critics in the media and academia, undermining freedom of expression and alternative sources of information.[419][30] His administration has been criticised for using a democratic mandate to undermine democratic processes, including focusing on Hindu-nationalist priorities rather than economic development. Modi's second term as PM, in particular, saw the erosion of civil rights and press freedom.[420]\n\n\n\n## Public perception and image\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Public image of Narendra Modi\n\n![](image)Modi at Yoga Day celebrations in New Delhi, 21 June 2015\nNarendra Modi has received consistently high approval ratings during his premiership;[33] he is often ranked in popular opinion polls as the greatest prime minister in Indian history.[421][422][423]\n\n\n\n### Image\n\n[edit]\n\nModi is a vegetarian and teetotaller,[424][425] who has a frugal lifestyle, and is a workaholic and introvert.[426] On 31 August 2012, he posted on Google Hangouts, becoming the first Indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat.[427][428] Modi has been called a fashion icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved *kurta*, and for a suit with his name repeatedly embroidered in the pinstripes, which he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention, and criticism.[429][430][431] Scholars and biographers have described Modi's personality as energetic, eccentric, arrogant and charismatic.[37][432]\n\n\nThe nomination of Modi for the prime-ministership drew attention to his reputation as \"one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians\".[184][433][434] During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader who would be able to take difficult decisions.[184][204][206][210][211] Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, an unusual tactic for the BJP and RSS.[206] Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and development.[435] Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy.[8] Modi's hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government also continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[8][37][157][206]\n\n\n\n### Approval ratings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Opinion polling on the Narendra Modi premiership\n\n![](image)Modi interacting with the school children after delivering his address on Independence Day in New Delhi, 15 August 2017\nDuring his premiership, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of respondents rating him \"very favourably\" and 93% approving of his government.[436] Modi's approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% during his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani.[437] At the end of his second year in office, an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him \"very favourably\".[438][439] At the end of his third year in office, a further Pew Research poll showed Modi with an overall approval rating of 88%, his highest yet, with 69% of people polled rating him \"very favourably\".[440] A poll conducted by *The Times of India* in May 2017 showed 77% of respondents rated Modi as \"very good\" and \"good\".[441] In early 2017, a survey by Pew Research Center showed Modi to be the most popular figure in Indian politics.[442] In a weekly analysis by Morning Consult called the Global Leader Approval Rating Tracker, Modi had the highest net approval rating as of 22 December 2020 of all government leaders in the 13 countries being tracked.[443][444]\n\n\n\n### In popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Category:Cultural depictions of Narendra Modi\n\n*Modi Kaka Ka Gaon* (Modi uncle's town), a 2017 Indian Hindi-language drama film by Tushar Amrish Goel, is the first biopic about Modi. It stars Vikas Mahante in the titular role.[445] *PM Narendra Modi*, a 2019 Hindi-language biographical drama film by Omung Kumar, stars Vivek Oberoi in the titular role and covers Modi's rise to the premiership.[446] An Indian web series called *Modi: Journey of a Common Man*, which is based on the same premise, was released in May 2019 on the video streaming platform Eros Now with Ashish Sharma portraying Modi.[447]\n\n\n*7 RCR* (*7, Race Course Road*), a 2014 Indian docudrama political television series which charts the political careers of prominent Indian politicians, covered Modi's rise to the PM's office in the episodes \"Story of Narendra Modi from 1950 to 2001\", \"Story of Narendra Modi in Controversial Years from 2001 to 2013\", \"Truth Behind Brand Modi\", \"Election Journey of Narendra Modi to 7 RCR\", and \"Masterplan of Narendra Modi's NDA Govt\", with Sangam Rai in the role of Modi.[448] India: The Modi Question, a 2023 BBC documentary, examines Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots and his record as Prime Minister of India. The Indian government banned the documentary, drawing widespread criticism.[449][450][451][452]\n\n\nOther portrayals of Modi include those by Rajit Kapur in the film *Uri: The Surgical Strike* (2019) and Vikram Gokhale in the web-television series *Avrodh: The Siege Within* (2020), both of which are based on the 2016 Uri attack and the subsequent Indian surgical strikes.[453][454] Gokhale reprised the role in the sequel *Avrodh: The Siege Within 2* (2022)*,* which is based on the 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation.[455] Pratap Singh played a character based on Modi in *Chand Bujh Gaya* (2005) which is set against the backdrop of the Gujarat riots.[456]\n\n\nModi appeared in an episode of Discovery Channel's show *Man vs Wild* with the host Bear Grylls,[457][458] becoming the second world leader after Barack Obama to appear in the reality show.[459] In the show, Modi treks through jungles, and talks about nature and wildlife conservation with Grylls.[460] The episode was recorded in Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand, and was broadcast in India and 180 other countries.[461] Modi hosts *Mann Ki Baat*, a monthly radio programme on All India Radio, and has conducted the competition *Pariksha Pe Charcha*, and discussions for students and the issues they face in examinations.[462][463]\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of awards and honours received by Narendra Modi\n\nIn March 2012 and June 2014, Narendra Modi appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of *Time Magazine*, becoming one of the few Indian politicians to have done so.[464][465] In 2014, *CNN-News18* (formally *CNN-IBN*) news network awarded Modi Indian of the Year.[466] In June 2015, Modi was featured on the cover of Time Magazine.[467] In 2014, 2015, 2017, 2020 and 2021, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World.[468] *Forbes Magazine* ranked him the 15th Most Powerful Person in the World in 2014 and the 9th Most Powerful Person in the World in 2015, 2016 and 2018.[469] In 2015, Modi was ranked the 13th Most Influential Person in the World by *Bloomberg Markets Magazine*.[470] In 2021 *Time* called Modi the third \"pivotal leader\" of independent India after Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, who \"dominated the country's politics like no one since them\".[471][472] Modi was ranked fifth on *Fortune Magazine*'s first annual list of the \"World's Greatest Leaders\" in 2015.[473][474] In 2017, Gallup International Association (GIA) conducted a poll and ranked Modi third-top leader of the world.[475][476] In 2016, a wax statue of Modi was unveiled at Madame Tussauds wax museum in London.[477][478]\n\n\n\n![](image)Narendra Modi's wax statue at Madame Tussauds, London\nIn 2015, Modi was named one of *Time*'s \"30 Most Influential People on the Internet\" because he was the second-most-followed politician on Twitter and Facebook.[479] In 2018, he was the third-most-followed world leader on Twitter and the most-followed world leader on Facebook and Instagram.[480][481][482] In October 2018, Modi received United Nations' highest environmental award, the Champions of the Earth, for policy leadership by \"pioneering work in championing\" the International Solar Alliance and \"new areas of levels of cooperation on environmental action\".[483][484] Modi was conferred the 2018 Seoul Peace Prize in recognition of \"his dedication to improving international co-operation, raising global economic growth, accelerating the Human Development of the people of India by fostering economic growth and furthering the development of democracy through anti-corruption and social integration efforts\". He is the first Indian to win the award.[485][486]\n\n\nFollowing his second swearing-in ceremony as Prime Minister of India, a picture of Modi was displayed on the facade of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) building in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.[487] The Texas India Forum hosted a community event in honour of Modi on 22 September 2019 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. The event was attended by over 50,000 people and several American politicians, including President Donald Trump, making it the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope.[488][489] At the event, Modi was presented with the Key to the City of Houston by Mayor Sylvester Turner.[490] The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Modi the Global Goalkeeper Award on 24 September 2019 in New York City, in recognition of the Swachh Bharat Mission and \"the progress India has made in providing safe sanitation under his leadership\".[491][492][493]\n\n\nIn 2020, Modi was among eight world leaders who were awarded the parody Ig Nobel Prize in Medical Education \"for using the COVID-19 viral pandemic to teach the world that politicians can have a more immediate effect on life and death than scientists and doctors can\".[494] On 21 December 2020, US President Donald Trump awarded Modi the Legion of Merit for improving India–United States relations.[495][496][497][498] On 24 February 2021, Gujarat Cricket Association renamed Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad—the largest cricket stadium in the world—Narendra Modi Stadium.[499]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Electoral history of Narendra Modi\n\n\n\nElection results\n| Year\n | Office\n | Constituency\n | Party\n | Votes for Modi\n | %\n | Opponent\n | Party\n | Votes\n | %\n | Result\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002 | Member of the Legislative Assembly | Rajkot II | Bharatiya Janata Party | ![](image) | 45,298\n | 57.32\n | Ashwinbhai Narbheshankar Mehta\n | Indian National Congress | ![](image) | 30,570\n | 38.68\n | Won\n | [500] |\n| 2002 | Maninagar | 113,589\n | 73.29\n | Yatinbhai Oza | 38,256\n | 24.68\n | Won\n | [501] |\n| 2007 | 139,568\n | 69.53\n | Dinsha Patel | 52,407\n | 26.11\n | Won\n | [502] |\n| 2012 | 120,470\n | 75.38\n | Shweta Sanjiv Bhat\n | 34,097\n | 21.34\n | Won\n | [174] |\n| 2014 | Member of the Lok Sabha | Vadodara | 845,464\n | 72.75\n | Madhusudan Mistry | 275,336\n | 23.69\n | Won\n | [503] |\n| 2014 | Varanasi | 581,022\n | 56.37\n | Arvind Kejriwal | Aam Aadmi Party | ![](image) | 209,238\n | 20.30\n | Won\n | [218] |\n| 2019 | 674,664\n | 63.62\n | Shalini Yadav\n | Samajwadi Party |  | 195,159\n | 18.40\n | Won\n | [504] |\n\n\n## Writing career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, Modi published a Gujarati book titled *Jyotipunj*, which contains profiles of RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as *Pujniya Shri Guruji* (\"Guru worthy of worship\").[505] According to *The Economic Times*, Modi's intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers, and to reassure RSS members he remained ideologically aligned with them.\n\n\nAfter becoming the Prime Minister he also authored a book called Exam Warriors, a guide for children to commendably face exams. Modi has written eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.[506]\n\n\n\n## Private life\n\n[edit]\n\nModi used to maintain a close and publicised relationship with his centenarian mother, Hiraben.[507]\n\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see Bibliography of Narendra Modi.\n\n* Modi, Narendra (2004). *Aapaatkaal Mein Gujarat* (in Hindi) (Samskarana 1 ed.).
