Operated by the New York City Department of Education, these specialized schools offer tuition-free accelerated academics to city residents. It is one of the most selective public high schools in New York City, New York State, and the United States.\n\n\nStuyvesant was established as an all-boys school in the East Village of Manhattan in 1904. An entrance examination was mandated for all applicants starting in 1934, and the school started accepting female students in 1969. Stuyvesant moved to its current location at Battery Park City in 1992 because the student body had become too large to be suitably accommodated in the original campus. The old building now houses several high schools.\n\n\nAdmission to Stuyvesant involves passing the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. Every March, the 800 to 850 applicants with the highest SHSAT scores out of the around 30,000 students who apply to Stuyvesant are accepted.[11] The school has a wide range of extracurricular activities,[12] including a theater competition called SING! and two student publications.\n\n\nNotable alumni include former United States Attorney General Eric Holder, physicists Brian Greene and Lisa Randall, economist Thomas Sowell, mathematician Paul Cohen, chemist Roald Hoffmann, genome researcher Eric Lander, Angel Investor Naval Ravikant, Oscar-winning actor James Cagney, comedian Billy Eichner, and chess grandmaster Robert Hess. Stuyvesant is one of only six secondary schools worldwide that has educated four or more Nobel laureates.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Planning[edit]\n\n\nNew York City's Superintendent of Schools, William Henry Maxwell, had first written about the need to construct manual trade schools in New York City in 1887.[13] At the time, C. B. J. Snyder was designing many of the city's public school buildings using multiple architectural styles.[14]:\u200a3 The first trade school in the city was Manual Training High School in Brooklyn, which opened in 1893.[14]:\u200a4 By 1899, Maxwell was advocating for a manual trade school in Manhattan.[13]:\u200a16\n\n\nIn January 1903, Maxwell and Snyder submitted a report to the New York City Board of Education in which they suggested the creation of a trade school in Manhattan.[15] The Board of Education approved the plans in April 1904. They suggested that the school occupy a plot on East 15th Street, west of First Avenue. However, that plot did not yet contain a school building, and so the new trade school was initially housed within PS\u00a047's former building at 225 East 23rd Street.[14]:\u200a4 The Board of Education also wrote that the new trade school would be \"designated as the Stuyvesant High School, as being reminiscent of the locality.\"[14] Stuyvesant Square, Stuyvesant Street, and later Stuyvesant Town (which was built in 1947) are all located near the proposed 15th Street school building. All of these locations were named after Peter Stuyvesant,[16] the last Dutch governor of New Netherland and owner of the area's Stuyvesant Farm.[17]:\u200a4 The appellation was selected in order to avoid confusion with Brooklyn's Manual Training High School.[14]:\u200a8\n\n\n\n### Opening and boys' school[edit]\n\n\nStuyvesant High School opened in September 1904 as Manhattan's first manual trade school for boys.[14]:\u200a5 At the time of its opening, the school consisted of 155 students and 12 teachers.[17]\n\n\nAt first, the school provided a core curriculum of \"English, Latin, modern languages, history, mathematics, physics, chemistry, [and] music,\" as well as a physical education program and a more specialized track of \"woodworking, metalworking, mechanical drawing, [and] freehand drawing.\"[14]:\u200a5 However, in June 1908, Maxwell announced that the trade school curriculum would be separated from the core curriculum and a discrete trade school would operate in the Stuyvesant building during the evening.[14]:\u200a5[18] Thereafter, Stuyvesant became renowned for excellence in math and science. In 1909, eighty percent of the school's alumni went to college, compared to other schools, which only sent 25% to 50% of their graduates to college.[14]:\u200a5[19]\n\n\nBy 1919, officials started restricting admission based on scholastic achievement.[20] Stuyvesant implemented a double session plan in 1919 to accommodate the rising number of students: some students would attend in the morning, while others would take classes in the afternoon and early evening. All students studied a full set of courses. These double sessions ran until Spring 1957.[20][21] The school implemented a system of entrance examinations in 1934.[22] The examination program, developed with the assistance of Columbia University, was expanded in 1938 to include the newly founded Bronx High School of Science.[14]:\u200a5[22]\n\n\nIn 1956, a team of six students designed and began construction of a cyclotron. A low-power test of the device succeeded six years later. A later attempt at full-power operation, however, knocked out the power to the school and surrounding buildings.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### Co-educational school[edit]\n\n\nIn 1967, Alice de Rivera filed a lawsuit against the Board of Education, alleging that she had been banned from taking Stuyvesant's entrance exam because of her gender.[25] The lawsuit was decided in the student's favor, and Stuyvesant was required to accept female students.[14]:\u200a6 The first female students were accepted in September 1969, when Stuyvesant offered admission to 14 girls and enrolled 12 of them.[17] The next year, 223 female students were accepted to Stuyvesant.[14]:\u200a6 By 2015, females represented 43% of the total student body.[26]\n\n\nIn 1972, the New York State Legislature passed the Hecht\u2013Calandra Act, which designated Brooklyn Technical High School, Bronx High School of Science, Stuyvesant High School, and the High School of Music & Art (now Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School) as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant.[27] The exam, named the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), tested the mathematical and verbal abilities of students who were applying to any of the specialized high schools. The only exception was for applicants to LaGuardia High School, who were accepted by audition rather than examination.[27]\n\n\n\n#### September 11 attacks[edit]\n\n\nThe current school building is about 0.5 miles (0.8\u00a0km) away from the site of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The school was evacuated during the attack. Although the smoke cloud coming from the World Trade Center engulfed the building at one point, there was no structural damage to the building, and there were no reports of physical injuries. Less than an hour after the collapse of the second World Trade Center tower, concern over a bomb threat at the school prompted an evacuation of the surrounding area, as reported live on the *Today* show.[28] When classes resumed on September 21, 2001,[29] students were moved to Brooklyn Technical High School while the Stuyvesant building served as a base of operations for rescue and recovery workers. This caused serious congestion at Brooklyn Tech, and required the students to attend in two shifts, with the Stuyvesant students attending the evening shift.[30] Normal classes resumed nearly a month after the attack, on October 9.[31]\n\n\n\n![A southward view of Stuyvesant High School from Hudson River Park. The Hudson River is seen at right, and the skyscrapers of the new World Trade Center can be seen in the background.](image)A southward view of Stuyvesant High School from Hudson River Park, with the new World Trade Center in the distance\nBecause Stuyvesant was so close to the World Trade Center site, there were concerns of asbestos exposure. The U.S. EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building. However, the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association contested the accuracy of the assessment.[32] Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported\u2014he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 class president Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after being diagnosed with cancer.[33] While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero,[34] there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni has been lobbying for health benefits since 2006 as a result.[33] In 2019, during a hearing on the reauthorization of the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund, alumnus Lila Nordstrom testified before the House Judiciary Committee about the conditions at Stuyvesant on and after 9/11.[35]\n\n\nNine alumni were killed in the World Trade Center attack.[36] Another alumnus, Richard Ben-Veniste of the class of 1960, was on the 9/11 Commission.[37] On October 2, 2001, the school newspaper, *The Spectator*, created a special 24-page full-color 9/11 insert containing student photos, reflections and stories. On November 20, 2001, the magazine was distributed for free to the greater metropolitan area, enclosed within 830,000 copies of *The New York Times*.[38] In the months after the attacks, Annie Thoms, an English teacher at Stuyvesant and the theater adviser at the time, suggested that the students take accounts of staff and students' reactions during and after September 11, 2001, and turn them into a series of monologues. Thoms then published these monologues as *With Their Eyes: September 11\u2014The View from a High School at Ground Zero*.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Later history[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2003\u20132004 school year, Stuyvesant celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding with a full year of activities. Events included a procession from the 15th Street building to the Chambers Street one, a meeting of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology, an all-class reunion, and visits and speeches from notable alumni.[40]\n\n\nIn the 21st century, keynote graduation speakers have included Attorney General Eric Holder (2001),[41] former President Bill Clinton (2002),[42] United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan (2004),[43] *Late Night* comedian Conan O'Brien (2006),[44] *Humans of New York* founder Brandon Stanton (2015), actor George Takei (2016), and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson (2018).\n\n\n\n## Buildings[edit]\n\n\n### 15th Street building[edit]\n\n\n![A grayscale postcard showing the Old Stuyvesant Campus in Manhattan's East Village. The postcard's vantage point is from down the street from the old building and depicts the five-story stone facade of the building.](image)Postcard art featuring the 15th Street Stuyvesant building, now known as the Old Stuyvesant Campus\nIn August 1904, the Board of Education authorized Snyder to design a new facility for Stuyvesant High School at 15th Street.[45] The new school would be shaped like the letter \"H\" in order to maximize the number of windows on the building.[14]:\u200a3 The cornerstone for the new building was laid in September 1905.[46] Approximately $1.5 million was spent on constructing the school, including $600,000 for the exterior alone.[47] In 1907, Stuyvesant moved to the new building on 15th Street.[17] The new building had a capacity of 2,600 students, more than double that of the existing school building at 23rd Street.[46] It contained 25 classrooms devoted to skilled industrial trades such as joinery, as well as 53 regular classrooms and a 1,600-seat auditorium.[47]\n\n\n\n![A view of the facade of the Old Stuyvesant Campus in 2021. There have been few modifications to the facade compared to the 1909 postcard view. The school name remains engraved in the pediment.](image)The Old Stuyvesant Campus on East 15th Street, as seen in 2021\nDuring the 1950s, the building underwent a $2 million renovation to update its classrooms, shops, libraries, and cafeterias.[22]\n\n\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, when New York City public schools, in general, were marked by violence and low grades among their students, Stuyvesant had a reputation for being a top-notch school. However, the school building was deteriorating due to overuse and lack of maintenance. A *New York Times* report stated that the building had \"held out into old age with minimal maintenance and benign neglect until its peeling paint, creaking floorboards and antiquated laboratories became an embarrassment.\" The five-story building could not cater adequately to the several thousand students, leading the New York City Board of Education to make plans to move the school to a new building in Battery Park City, near lower Manhattan's Financial District.[17] The 15th Street building remains in use as the \"Old Stuyvesant Campus,\" housing three schools: the Institute for Collaborative Education,[48] the High School for Health Professions and Human Services,[49] and PS\u00a0226.[50]\n\n\n\n### Current building[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, New York City Mayor Ed Koch and New York State Governor Mario Cuomo jointly announced the construction of a new Stuyvesant High School building in Battery Park City. The Battery Park City Authority donated 1.5 acres (0.61\u00a0ha) of land for the new building.[51] The authority was not required to hire the lowest bidder, which meant that the construction process could be accelerated in return for a higher cost.[51] The building was designed by the architectural firms of Gruzen Samton Steinglass and Cooper, Robertson & Partners.[52] The structure's main architect, Alexander Cooper of Cooper, Robertson & Partners, had also designed much of Battery Park City.[51]\n\n\n\n![View of Stuyvesant High School's facade from about a quarter-mile away.

The bridge connects the east side of West Street to Stuyvesant High School on the street's west side.](image)\nThe new building (*left*) as seen from the corner of Chambers and West streets. The Tribeca Bridge (*right*) is used as one of the building's entrances.\n\nStuyvesant's principal at the time, Abraham Baumel, visited the country's most advanced laboratories to gather ideas about what to include in the new Stuyvesant building's 12 laboratory rooms. The new 10-story building also included banks of escalators, glass-walled studios on the roof, and a four-story northern wing with a swimming pool, five gymnasiums, and an auditorium.[51] Construction began in 1989. When it opened in 1992, the building was New York City's first new high school building in ten years. The new Stuyvesant Campus cost $150 million, making it the most expensive high school building ever built in the city at the time.[17] The library has a capacity of 40,000 volumes and overlooks Battery Park City.[53]\n\n\nShortly after the building was completed, the $10-million Tribeca Bridge was built to allow students to enter the building without having to cross the busy West Street. The building was designed to be fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act and is listed as such by the New York City Department of Education. As a result, the building is one of the 5 additional sites of P721M, a school for students with multiple disabilities who are between the ages of 15 and 21.[54]\n\n\nIn 1997, the eastern end of the mathematics floor was dedicated to Richard Rothenberg, the math department chairman who had died from a sudden heart attack earlier that year. Sculptor Madeleine Segall-Marx was commissioned to create the Rothenberg Memorial in his honor. She created a mathematics wall entitled \"Celebration\", consisting of 50 wooden boxes\u2014one for each year of his life\u2014behind a glass wall, featuring mathematical concepts and reflections on Rothenberg.[55]\n\n\nIn 2006, Robert Ira Lewy of the class of 1960 made a gift worth $1 million to found the Dr. Robert Ira Lewy M.D. Multimedia Center.[56] and donated his personal library in 2007.[57] In late 2010, the school library merged with the New York Public Library (NYPL) network in a four-year pilot program, in which all students of the school received a student library card so they could check books out of the school library or any other public library in the NYPL system.[58]\n\n\nAn escalator collapse at Stuyvesant High School on September 13, 2018 injured 10 people, including 8 students.[59][60]\n\n\n\n#### *Mnemonics*[edit]\n\n\n![A wall in the school decorated with a mural named \"Mnemonics.\" The mural was created in 1992 by Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel.](image)*Mnemonics*, 1992 (Kristin Jones/Andrew Ginzel)\nDuring construction, the Battery Park City Authority, the Percent for Art Program of the City of New York, the Department of Cultural Affairs, and the New York City Board of Education commissioned *Mnemonics*, an artwork by public artists Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel. Four hundred hollow glass blocks were dispersed randomly from the basement to the tenth floor of the new Stuyvesant High School building. Each block contains relics providing evidence of geographical, natural, cultural, and social worlds, from antiquity to the present time.[61]\n\n\nThe blocks are set into the hallway walls and scattered throughout the building. Each block is inscribed with a brief description of its contents or context. The items displayed include a section of the Great Wall of China, fragments of the Mayan pyramids, leaves from the sacred Bo tree, water from the Nile and Ganges Rivers, a Revolutionary War button, pieces of the 15th Street Stuyvesant building, a report card of a student who studied in the old building, and fragments of monuments from around the world, various chemical compounds, and memorabilia from each of the 88 years' history of the 15th Street building. Empty blocks were also installed to be filled with items chosen by each of the graduating classes up through 2080.[61] The installation received the Award for Excellence in Design from the Art Commission of the City of New York.[62]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe New York City Subway's Chambers Street station, served by the 1, \u200b2, and \u200b3 trains, is located nearby, as well as the Chambers Street\u2013World Trade Center station served by the A, \u200bC, and \u200bE trains.[63] Additionally, New York City Bus's M9, M20 and M22 routes stop near Stuyvesant.[64] Students residing a certain distance from the school are provided full-fare or half-fare student MetroCards for public transportation at the start of each term, based on how far away the student resides from the school.[65]\n\n\n\n\n## Enrollment[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of 2022[66]\n| Race and ethnicity\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asian | 71.7%\n | 71.7 |\n| White | 18.3%\n | 18.3 |\n| Hispanic | 3.8%\n | 3.8 |\n| Two or more Races | 3.5%\n | 3.5 |\n| Black | 1.4%\n | 1.4 |\n| American Indian/Alaska Native | 0.7%\n | 0.7 |\n| Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander | 0.6%\n | 0.6 |\n| Sex\n | Total\n |\n| Male\n | 58%\n | 58 |\n| Female\n | 42%\n | 42 |\n| Income\n | Total\n |\n| Economically disadvantaged\n | 48%\n | 48 |\n\n\n### Entrance examination[edit]\n\n\nStuyvesant has a total enrollment of over 3,000 students[67] and is open to residents of New York City entering ninth or tenth grade. Enrollment is based solely on performance on the three-hour Specialized High Schools Admissions Test,[68]:\u200a25 which is administered annually. Approximately 28,000 students took the test in 2017.[68]:\u200a10 The list of schools using the SHSAT has since grown to include eight of New York's nine specialized high schools. The test score necessary for admission to Stuyvesant has consistently been higher than that needed for admission to the other schools using the test.[69] Admission is currently based on an individual's score on the examination and the pre-submitted ranking of Stuyvesant among the other specialized schools. Ninth- and rising tenth\u2013grade students are also eligible to take the test for enrollment, but far fewer students are admitted that way.[70] The test covers math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension) skills. Former Mayor John Lindsay and community activist group Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) have argued that the exam may be biased against African and Hispanic Americans,[71] while attempts to eliminate the exam have been criticized as discriminatory against Asian Americans.[72]\n\n\n\n![A view of the steel-and-glass main entrance to Stuyvesant High School. There is a sign above the entrance with the school's name in large capital letters.](image)Main entrance to Stuyvesant High School on Chambers Street, as seen in 2021.\n### Demographics and SHSAT controversy[edit]\n\n\nFor most of the 20th century, the student body at Stuyvesant was heavily Jewish. A significant influx of Asian students began in the 1970s; by 2019, 74% of the students in attendance were Asian-American (53% from families with low incomes).[72] In the 2013 academic year, the student body was 72.43% Asian, 21.44% Caucasian, 1.03% African American, 2.34% Hispanic, and 3% unknown/other.[73] The paucity of Black and Hispanic students at Stuyvesant has often been an issue for some city administrators. In 1971, Mayor John Lindsay argued that the test was culturally biased against black and Hispanic students and sought to implement an affirmative action program.[27] However, protests by parents forced the plan to be scrapped and led to the passage of the Hecht-Calandra Act, which preserved admissions by examination only.[74] A small number of students judged to be economically disadvantaged and who came within a few points of the cut-off score were given an extra chance to pass the test.[75]\n\n\nCommunity activist group ACORN published two reports in 1996, titled *Secret Apartheid* and *Secret Apartheid II*. In these reports, ACORN called the SHSAT \"permanently suspect\" and described it as a \"product of an institutional racism,\" saying that black and Hispanic students did not have access to proper test preparation materials.[71] Along with Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, they began an initiative for more diversity in the city's gifted and specialized schools, in particular demanding the SHSAT be suspended altogether until the Board of Education was able to show all children have had access to appropriate materials to prepare themselves. Students published several editorials in response to ACORN's claims, stating the admissions system at the school was based on student merit, not race.[24][76]\n\n\nA number of students take preparatory courses offered by private companies such as The Princeton Review and Kaplan in order to perform better on the SHSAT, often leaving those unable to afford such classes at a disadvantage. To bridge this gap and boost minority admissions, the Board of Education started the Math Science Institute in 1995,[77] a free program to prepare students for the admissions test.[78] Students attend preparatory classes through the program, now known as the Specialized High School Institute (also known as DREAM),[79] at several schools around the city from the summer after sixth grade until the eighth-grade exam. Despite the implementation of these free programs for improving underprivileged children's enrollment, black and Hispanic enrollment continued to decline.[80] After further expansion of those free test prep programs, there was still no increase in percentages to the attendance of black and Hispanic children.[72] As of 2019[update], fewer than 1% of freshman openings were given to black students, while over 66% were given to Asian-American students, most of whom had similar socioeconomic backgrounds to those of the black students.[72][81]\n\n\nThe New York City Department of Education reported in 2003 that public per student spending at Stuyvesant is slightly lower than the city average.[82] Stuyvesant also receives private contributions.[83]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\nThe college-preparatory curriculum at Stuyvesant mostly includes four years of English, history, and laboratory-based sciences. The sciences courses include requisite biology, chemistry, and physics classes. Students also take four years of mathematics.[84] Students also take three years of a single foreign language; a semester each of introductory art, music, health, and technical drawing; one semester of computer science; and two lab-based technology courses.[84] Several exemptions from technology education exist for seniors.[85][86] Stuyvesant offers students a broad selection of elective courses. Some of the more notable offerings include astronomy, New York City history, Women's Voices, and the mathematics of financial markets.[87] Most students complete the New York City Regents courses by junior year and take calculus during their senior year. However, the school offers math courses through differential equations for the more advanced students. A year of technical drawing was formerly required; students learned how to draft by hand in its first semester and how to draft using a computer in the second. Now, students take a one-semester compacted version of the former drafting course, as well as a semester of introductory computer science. For the class of 2015, the one-semester computer science course was replaced with a two-semester course.[84]\n\n\n\n![](image)The escalators from the seventh to ninth floors. A Stuyvesant art class created the banner in the background.\nAs a specialized high school, Stuyvesant offers a wide range of Advanced Placement (AP) courses.[88] These courses focus on math, science, history, English, or foreign languages. This gives students various opportunities to earn college credit. AP computer science students can also take three additional computer programming courses after the completion of the AP course: systems level programming, computer graphics, and software development.[89] In addition, there is a one-year computer networking class which can earn students Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) certification.[90]\n\n\nStuyvesant's foreign language offerings include Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Latin, and Spanish.[91] In 2005, the school also started offering courses in Arabic after the school's Muslim Student Association had raised funds to support the course.[92] Stuyvesant's biology and geo-science department offers courses in molecular biology, human physiology, medical ethics, medical and veterinary diagnosis, human disease, anthropology and sociobiology, vertebrate zoology, laboratory techniques, medical human genetics, botany, the molecular basis of cancer, nutrition science, and psychology.[93] The chemistry and physics departments include classes in organic chemistry, physical chemistry, astronomy, engineering mechanics, and electronics.[94]\n\n\nAlthough Stuyvesant is primarily known for its math and science focus, the school also has a comprehensive humanities program. The English Department offers students courses in British and classical literature, Shakespearean literature, science fiction, philosophy, existentialism, debate, acting, journalism, creative writing, and poetry.[95] The Social Studies core requires two years of global history (or one year of global followed by one year of European history), one year of American history, as well as a semester each of economics and government. Humanities electives include American foreign policy; civil and criminal law, prejudice and persecution, and race, ethnicity and gender issues.[96]\n\n\nIn 2004, Stuyvesant entered into an agreement with City College of New York in which the college funds advanced after-school courses that are taken for college credit but taught by Stuyvesant teachers. Some of these courses include linear algebra, advanced Euclidean geometry, and women's history.[97][98]\n\n\nPrior to the 2005 revision of the SAT, Stuyvesant graduates had an average score of 1408 out of 1600 (685 in the verbal section of the test, 723 in the math section).[82] In 2010, the average score on the SAT for Stuyvesant students was 2087 out of 2400,[99] while the class of 2013 had an average SAT score of 2096.[100] As of 2023[update], Stuyvesant students' average SAT score was 1510 of 1600 points.[101] Stuyvesant also administers more Advanced Placement exams than any other high school in the world, as well as the highest number of students who reach the AP courses' \"mastery level\".[102] As of 2018[update], there are 31 AP classes offered, with a little more than half of all students taking at least one AP class, and about 98% of students pass their AP tests.[101]\n\n\n\n## Extracurricular activities[edit]\n\n\n![View of the end of the Tribeca pedestrian bridge. There are four steel-and-glass doors in the center of the picture, marking the entrance to the school. The bridge is entirely enclosed by glass panes with metal beams on three sides, as well as a steel floor.](image)Entrance from the Tribeca Bridge\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nStuyvesant fields 32 varsity teams, including the swimming, golf, bowling, volleyball, soccer, basketball, gymnastics, wrestling, fencing, baseball/softball, American handball, tennis, track/cross country, cricket, football, and lacrosse teams.[103] In addition, Stuyvesant has ultimate teams for the boys' varsity, boys' junior varsity, and girls' varsity divisions.[104]\n\n\nIn September 2007, the Stuyvesant football team was given a home field at Pier 40, located north of the school at Houston Street and West Street. In 2008, the baseball team was granted use of the pier after construction and delivery of an artificial turf pitching mound that met Public Schools Athletic League specifications.[105] Stuyvesant also has its own swimming pool, but it does not contain its own running track or tennis court.[106] Unlike most American high schools, most sports teams at Stuyvesant are individually known by different names. Only the football, cheerleading, girls' table tennis, baseball, girls' handball, and boys' lacrosse teams retain the traditional Pegleg monikers.[103]\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\nThe student body of Stuyvesant is represented by the Stuyvesant Student Union,[107] a student government. It comprises a group of students (elected each year for each grade) who serve the student body in two important areas: improving student life by promoting and managing extracurricular activities (clubs and publications), by organizing out-of-school activity such as city excursions or fundraisers; and providing a voice to the student body in all discussion of school policy with the administration.[108]\n\n\n\n### Clubs and publications[edit]\n\n\nStuyvesant allows students to join clubs, publications, and teams under a system similar to that of many colleges.[109] As of 2015[update], the school had 150 student clubs.[110]\n\n\n\n#### *The Spectator*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Spectator (Stuyvesant High School)\n\n*The Spectator* is Stuyvesant's official in-school newspaper, which is published biweekly and is independent from the school.[111] There are over 250 students who help with publication.[111] At the beginning of the fall and spring terms, there are recruitments, but interested students may join at any time.[112]\n\n\nFounded in 1915, *The Spectator* is one of Stuyvesant's oldest publications.[113] It has a long-standing connection with its older namesake, Columbia University's *Columbia Daily Spectator*, and has been recognized by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism's Columbia Scholastic Press Association.[114]\n\n\n\n#### *The Voice*[edit]\n\n\n![A picture of the black-and-white cover of the May 1977 issue of \"The Voice.\" The word \"Voice\" is printed in bubble letters at the top of the cover. The cover picture is of a male with his hands extended away from his body as a police officer interacts with him. The cover story's title, \"Your Rights,\" is located on the picture's left-hand side.](image)Cover of the May 1977 issue of *The Voice*\n*The Voice* was founded in the 1973\u20131974 academic year as an independent publication only loosely sanctioned by school officials.[113] It had the appearance of a magazine and gained a large readership. *The Voice* attracted a considerable amount of controversy and a First Amendment lawsuit, after which the administration forced it to go off-campus and to turn commercial in 1975\u20131976.[113]\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1975\u20131976 academic year, *The Voice* decided to publish the results of a confidential random survey measuring the \"sexual attitudes, preferences, knowledge and experience\" of the students.[115] The administration refused to permit *The Voice* to distribute the questionnaire, and the Board of Education refused to intervene, believing that \"irreparable psychological damage\" would be occasioned on some of the students receiving it.[115] The editor-in-chief of *The Voice*, Jeff Trachtman, brought a First Amendment challenge to this decision in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in front of Judge Constance Baker Motley.[115]\n\n\nMotley, relying on the relatively recent Supreme Court precedent *Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District* (holding that \"undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression\"),[116] ordered the Board of Education to come up with an arrangement permitting the distribution of the survey to the juniors and seniors.[115] However, Motley's ruling was overturned on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.[117] Judge J. Edward Lumbard, joined by Judge Murray Gurfein and over an impassioned dissent by Judge Walter R. Mansfield, held that the distribution of the questionnaires was properly disallowed by the administration since there was the basis for the belief that it might \"result in significant emotional harm to a number of students throughout the Stuyvesant population.\"[117] The Supreme Court denied certiorari review.[118]\n\n\n\n### SING![edit]\n\n\n![A black-and-white playbill for the SING V program in 1977. There are two double-black-outlined boxes on a white background. The top box text is \"the STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL UNION proudly presents,\" then the icon for SING V in stencil letters, followed by the performance dates. The bottom box, which contains three-quarter circles at its corners, consists of a crude sketch of a backstage area.](image)SING V program, 1977\nThe annual theater competition known as SING! pits seniors, juniors, and \"soph-frosh\" (freshmen and sophomores working together) against each other in a contest to put on the best performance. SING! started in 1947 at Midwood High School in Brooklyn[119][120] and has expanded to many New York City high schools since then.[121] SING! at Stuyvesant started as a small event in 1973,[122] and since then, has grown to a school-wide event; in 2005, nearly 1,000 students participated. The entire production is written, directed, produced, and funded by students.[122] Their involvement ranges from being members of the production's casts, choruses, or costume and tech crews to Step, Hip-Hop, Swing, Modern, Belly, Flow, Tap or Latin dance groups. SING! begins in late January to February and culminates in final performances on three nights in March/April.[122] Scoring is done on each night's performances and the winner is determined by the overall total.[122] In 2023, soph-frosh won SING! for the first time in the tradition's fifty-one year history.\n\n\n\n## Reputation[edit]\n\n\nStuyvesant has produced many notable alumni, including four Nobel laureates.[123][124] In 2017, Stuyvesant was ranked 71st in national rankings by *U.S. News & World Report*, and 21st among STEM high schools.[125] According to a September 2002 high school ranking by *Worth* magazine, 3.67% of Stuyvesant students went on to attend Harvard, Yale, and Princeton universities, ranking it as the 9th top public high school in the United States and 120th among all schools, public or private.[126] In December 2007, *The Wall Street Journal* studied the freshman classes at eight selective colleges and reported that Stuyvesant sent 67 students to these schools, comprising 9.9% of its 674 seniors.[127] In recent years, the Stuyvesant Spectator has reported on college admissions of the graduating classes, with Class of 2021 having 133 students offered admission to Ivy League institutions.[128]\n\n\nStuyvesant, along with other similar schools, has regularly been excluded from *Newsweek'*s annual list of the Top 100 Public High Schools. The May 8, 2008, issue states the reason as being, \"because so many of their students score well above average on the SAT and ACT.\"[129][130] *U.S. News & World Report*, however, included Stuyvesant on its list of \"Best High Schools\" published in December 2009, ranking 31st.[131] In its 2010 progress report, the New York City Department of Education assigned it an \"A\", the highest possible grade.[132]\n\n\nStuyvesant has contributed to the education of several Nobel laureates, winner of the Fields Medal, and other accomplished alumni. In recent years, it has had the second highest number of National Merit Scholarship semi-finalists, behind Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia.[133] From 2002 to 2010, Stuyvesant has produced 103 semi-finalists and 13 finalists on the Intel Science Talent Search, the second most of any secondary school in the United States behind the Bronx High School of Science.[134] In 2014, Stuyvesant had 11 semifinalists for the Intel Search, the highest number of any school in the U.S.[110]\n\n\nIn the 2010s, exam schools, including Stuyvesant, have been the subject of studies questioning their academic effectiveness.[135] A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Duke University economists compared high school outcomes for Stuyvesant students who barely passed the SHSAT score required for admission, to those of applicants just below that score, using the latter as a natural control group of peers who attended other schools. The study found no discernible average difference in the two groups' later performance on New York state exams.[136]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Stuyvesant High School people\n\nSee also: Category:Stuyvesant High School alumni\n\nNotable scientists among Stuyvesant alumni include mathematicians Bertram Kostant (1945)[137] and \nPaul Cohen (1950),[138] string theorist Brian Greene (1980),[139] physicist Lisa Randall (1980),[140] and genomic researcher Eric Lander (1974).[141] Other prominent alumni include civil rights leader Bob Moses,[142] *MAD Magazine* editor Nick Meglin (1953),[143] entertainers such as songwriter and Steely Dan founder Walter Becker, Thelonious Monk (1935),[144] and actors Lucy Liu (1986),[145] Tim Robbins (1976),[146] and James Cagney (1918),[147] comedian Paul Reiser (1973),[148] playwright Arthur M. Jolly (1987),[149] sports anchor Mike Greenberg (1985), and basketball player and bookmaker Jack Molinas (1949).[150] In business, government and politics, former United States Attorney General Eric Holder (1969) is a Stuyvesant alumnus,[151] as are Senior Advisor to President Obama David Axelrod (1972),[152] former adviser to President Clinton Dick Morris (1964),[153] and founder of 5W Public Relations Ronn Torossian (1992).[154]\n\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning author Frank McCourt taught English at Stuyvesant before the publication of his memoirs *Angela's Ashes*, *'Tis*, and *Teacher Man*. *Teacher Man*'s third section, titled *Coming Alive in Room 205*, concerns McCourt's time at Stuyvesant, and mentions a number of students and faculty.[155] Former New York City Council member Eva Moskowitz (1982) graduated from the school,[156] as did the creator of the BitTorrent protocol, Bram Cohen (1993).[157] A notable Olympic medalist from the school was foil fencer Albert Axelrod.[158] Economist Thomas Sowell was also a student of Stuyvesant High School, but dropped out at age 17 because of financial difficulties and problems in his home.[159] Russian journalist Vladimir Pozner Jr., known in the West for his appearances on Nightline, U.S.\u2013Soviet Space Bridge and Phil Donahue, was also a student of Stuyvesant High School.\n\n\nFour Nobel laureates are Stuyvesant alumni:[123]\n\n\n\n* Joshua Lederberg (1941)\u00a0\u2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1958[160]\n* Robert Fogel (1944)\u00a0\u2013 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 1993[161]\n* Roald Hoffmann (1954)\u00a0\u2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1981[162]\n* Richard Axel (1963) \u2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 2004[163]\n\n\n## In the media[edit]\n\n\nIn the film *The Glass Wall*, the character Freddie Zakoyla attended \"Peter Stuyvesant High School.\"\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)New York City portal\n* ![icon](image)Schools portal\n\n\n* Education in New York City\n* Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks\n* List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 14th to 59th Streets\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Stuyvesant High School\". *Geographic Names Information System*.

It is operated by the New York City Department of Education. Admission to Bronx Science involves passing the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. \n\n\nFounded in 1938 in the Bronx, New York City, Bronx Science is located in what is now Kingsbridge Heights, also known as Jerome Park, a neighborhood in the northwest portion of the Bronx. Although originally known for its focus on mathematics and science, Bronx Science also emphasizes the humanities and social sciences and continually attracts students with a wide variety of interests beyond math and science. \n\n\nWith nine Nobel Prize-winning alumni, seven in physics, one in chemistry, and one in economics, it has produced the most Nobel laureates in science of any secondary school in the world. Bronx Science alumni have also won two Turing Awards, sometimes unofficially referred to as the Nobel Prize in computer science; six National Medals of Science, the nation's highest scientific honor; and eight Pulitzer Prizes.\n\n\nThe Bronx High School of Science is often called **Bronx Science**, **Bronx Sci**, **BX Sci**, and sometimes just **Science**.[3][4] It was formerly called **Science High** and its founder, Morris Meister, is said to have frequently called the school \"The High School of Science.\"[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The old Bronx Science logo\n![](image)The former Gothic building at Creston Avenue and 184th Street that housed the school from its founding in 1938 until 1959\n![](image)Dedication of the new building in 1957\nBronx High School of Science was founded in 1938 as a specialized science and math high school for boys, by resolution of the New York City Panel for Educational Policy, with Morris Meister as the first principal of the school. They were given use of an antiquated Gothic-gargoyled edifice located at Creston Avenue and 184th Street, in the Fordham Road-Grand Concourse area of the Bronx. The building, built in 1918 for Evander Childs High School, had been successively occupied by Walton High School (1930) and by an annex of DeWitt Clinton High School (1935). The initial faculty were composed in part by a contingent from Stuyvesant High School.[6]\n\n\nMeister put his imprint on the school from its formation, for example selecting as school colors \"green to represent chlorophyll and gold the sun, both of which are essential to the chain of life.\"[7]\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the Parents Association and Principal Morris Meister campaigned for a new building. The number of students exceeded the capacity of the building on 184th Street, so the top floor of Public School 85 on Marion Avenue and 187th Street was used as the \"Annex.\"[8]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nAfter twenty years, plans were finally completed for a new $8 million building, which was designed by the architectural firm of Emery Roth and Sons.[9] The new building was on 205th Street near Bedford Park Boulevard, in a predominantly institutional area, between DeWitt Clinton High School and its large football field on one side, and Harris Field and Hunter College (now Lehman College) on the other. On March 3, 1959, students and faculty occupied the new building for the first time, solving the problem of how to move the books from the old library to the new in typical Bronx Science manner: on Friday afternoon each student took home five library books from the old building, and on Monday returned them to the new one.\n\n\nThey entered a school equipped with more modern classrooms, laboratories, and technical studio areas. The main lobby entrance featured a 63-foot (19\u00a0m), Venetian glass mosaic mural overhead, depicting major figures from the history of science such as Marie Curie and Charles Darwin under the protective hands of a God-like figure representing knowledge, with this quote from John Dewey: \"Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination.\" The mural, *Humanities Protecting Biology, Physics, Chemistry*, is an original work by Frank J. Reilly. Legions of students over the years, bemoaning the lack of swimming facilities, have sarcastically referred to the mural as \"the Science swimming pool\", perpetuating the thesis that a choice was made to fund a mural rather than a pool in the new building.[10]\n\n\nIn the first spring of the move, rumors swept the school that various Bronx youth street gangs were coming to the school, and that the Fordham Baldies would shave the hair of Science students. This never happened. Another incident did happen that spring: The first time Science girls appeared on the outdoor physical education field in gym clothes, some students from the neighboring, all-male DeWitt Clinton High School charged the separation fence between their field and the Science field. The fence held, but the female students exercised indoors for the remainder of that year.\n\n\nWhen Bronx Science celebrated its silver anniversary in June 1963, President John F. Kennedy hailed it as \"a significant and pathfinding example of a special program devoted to the development of the student gifted in science and mathematics.\" Kennedy had recently selected a 1943 Bronx High School of Science graduate, Harold Brown, as Director of Defense Research and Engineering; Brown would later serve as United States Secretary of Defense under President Jimmy Carter.\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bronx Science is the only specialized New York City high school with a campus\n![](image)A hallway on the first floor of Bronx Science\n![](image)A math and computer programming class at the school in 1960, featuring an IBM 650 op code chart (upper right). Bronx High School of Science was one of the first high schools to teach computer courses. The school had a keypunch machine, students ran their programs at the Watson lab at Columbia University, and the school obtained its own computer, an IBM 1620, a year and a half later.\nBronx Science students take a college preparatory curriculum that includes four years of science, English, and social studies; three (usually four) years of math; two or three years of foreign language; and a year of fine arts, with required courses and a wide selection of electives, including honors and advanced placement (AP) classes, which allow students to place out of introductory college science courses. Over 100 unique courses are offered. All New York State Regents classes are offered, with the exception of earth science.[11]\n\n\nIn the biological sciences, Bronx Science offers a special honors biology course, in addition to the Regents-level course, which includes additional laboratory exposure and intensive content. If students have already taken the Living Environment regents in 8th grade, they may take Regents-level or honors chemistry in freshman year. All students must take at least one year of a biological lab science at Bronx Science, a requirement that can be satisfied either by freshman biology or, if students took biology in middle school, one of the many advanced electives offered, including AP Biology, AP Environmental Science, AP Psychology; non-AP advanced courses include animal behavior, cell biology, epidemiology, forensic science, microbiology, neuroscience, and nutritional science. Post-AP level classes in evolution, genetics, and psychology are also offered. In the physical science department, AP Chemistry and AP Physics are both offered, and both may be taken alongside introductory Regents-level courses in those respective classes. Electives offered include astronomy and astrophysics, electrical engineering, green design, organic chemistry, and post-AP Physics.[11] In 2022, the school prepared to accept an astronomical observatory.[12]\n\n\nFreshmen at Bronx Science are required to take one-semester courses in research literacy and engineering, while sophomores take one-semester courses consisting of coding and rhetoric. Collectively, these are referred to as Foundational courses. Sophomore students may satisfy this requirement by instead taking a class in the research program, a three-year long program that culminates in an independent research project and final research paper that is submitted to Regeneron and other prestigious competitions in senior year. The research program is divided into biology, math, physical science/engineering, and social science research.[11]\n\n\nThe mathematics department offers standard AP courses in AB/BC calculus, statistics, and computer science. Students can take precalculus alongside honors algebra 2 and trigonometry in their sophomore year, allowing them to take AP Calculus in their junior year. Post-AP courses in mathematics include multivariable calculus, linear algebra and differential equations, video game development, app development, game theory, and a newly introduced course in financial and actuarial math.[11]\n\n\nStudents are required to take four years of English. AP English Language and AP English Literature are offered, along with journalism workshop and yearbook design. In junior year, students have the option to take the unique AP American Studies course, an interdisciplinary course that correlates the AP English Language and AP United States History courses, while in senior year, the AP English Literature course is divided into courses in creative writing and traditional literature. Four years of social studies or history classes are required. AP European History and AP World History are both offered in sophomore year in preparation for the Global History Regents, while juniors can take AP United States History to satisfy the U.S. history requirement. Senior social studies classes consist of several combinations of AP classes in U.S. Government and Politics, Comparative Government and Politics, Microeconomics, and Macroeconomics. Additional classes in social studies, which must be taken along with these ones, include AP Human Geography, race and gender, and unique classes in Holocaust leadership and speech and debate leadership. A minimum of 2 years of languages are required, if students had previously taken a year of language prior to high school. Bronx Science offers French, Spanish, Latin, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese. At one time Hebrew, Russian, Korean, and German were also offered. AP German Language and Culture is the only AP class not offered at Bronx Science.[11]\n\n\nStudents must also obtain credits from two terms of a class in the fine arts or the equivalent. The fine arts requirement is usually satisfied during Bronx Science's Summer Program which offers Drama, Music, and Art. Students usually \"double up\" on two of these courses to satisfy the fine arts requirement for once and all during the time period of one summer. Students are expected to satisfy the arts requirement by the end of sophomore year. Students can also take art or music electives during the school year to satisfy the fine arts requirement by taking a music elective such as jazz band or an arts elective such as AP Art History or AP Studio Art during the regular school year. Health and physical education courses are also required, and the Health requirement may also be fulfilled during the Bronx Science Summer Program in addition to the two fine arts courses.[11]\n\n\n\n### Advanced placement courses[edit]\n\n\nBronx Science offers all of the AP courses, except for AP German Language and Culture and the AP Capstone program. The courses include:[11]\n\n\n\n* **English**\u00a0\u2013 AP English Literature and Composition, AP English Language and Composition\n* **Social Sciences**\u00a0\u2013 AP U.S. History, AP European History, AP World History (2 Years), AP U.S. Government & Politics, AP Microeconomics, AP Macroeconomics, AP Micro/Macroeconomics, AP Comparative Government & Politics with Economics, AP United States Government & Politics with Economics, AP Human Geography, AP Psychology\n* **Mathematics**\u00a0\u2013 AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, AP Statistics, AP Computer Science\n* **Science**\u00a0\u2013 AP Biology, AP Environmental Science, AP Chemistry, AP Physics 1&2 (without Calculus), AP Physics C (with Calculus)\n* **Language**\u00a0\u2013 AP Spanish Language, AP Spanish Literature, AP French Language and Culture, AP Italian Language and Culture, AP Latin (Caesar and Virgil), AP Chinese Language and Culture, AP Japanese Language and Culture\n* **Arts**\u00a0\u2013 AP Studio Art, AP Art History, AP Music Theory\n\n\n### School publications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bronx Science students working on *The Science Survey*, one of several school publications**The Science Survey** is Bronx Science's entirely student-run newspaper.[13][14][15] Students manage everything: reporting, layout, design, editing, and final production, under the supervision of the journalism advisor. The paper is printed using funds from its advertisers, with no fiscal school support. The paper is distributed on average five times per year at no charge. *The Science Survey* has been the name of the Bronx Science student newspaper since the founding of the school in 1938.\n\n\n**Dynamo** is the literary magazine sponsored by the English Department, consisting of original poems and stories submitted by students from all grades.[16] *The Observatory* is Bronx Science's prize-winning yearbook.[17] The yearbook office has a custom-built web server to manage its production, powered by MediaWiki and Coppermine software.\n\n\nOther department-produced publications include the annual **Math Bulletin**,[18] consisting of student term papers, original student mathematics research, and topics in mathematics; *Exposition*, an annual production of the Social Studies Department; and *Reactions*,[19] written by physical science students.\n\n\n\n## Reputation[edit]\n\n\nBronx Science has received international recognition. In 2020, Newsweek's rankings of the top 5,000 STEM High Schools in the United States (public and private), listed Bronx Science as the 4th best STEM school in the nation.[20]\n\n\nIn 2014, the school ranked 34th out of all high schools nationwide and 1st in New York;[21] nationwide, Bronx Science ranked 33rd in 2008 and 58th in 2009.[22] It attracts an intellectually gifted blend of culturally, ethnically,[23][24] and economically diverse students from New York City.[25] As of 2012[update], Bronx Science is ranked as one of the \"22 top-performing schools\"[26] in America on The Washington Post as well as number 50 out of a list of the best 1,000 high schools in the country on The Daily Beast's \"America's Best High Schools\"[27] list. In 2014 it was ranked second highest on *Cities Journal*'s list of the \"15 Best High Schools in New York\",[28] along with Stuyvesant (ranked third)[29] and Brooklyn Tech (ranked eighth).[30]\n\n\nThe average SAT score in 2012 was 2,010 out of 2,400.[31] Almost all Bronx Science graduates continue on to four-year colleges, and it is a \"feeder school\", with many graduates going on to Ivy League schools and other institutions of higher learning each year.[32] Bronx Science has counted 132 finalists in the Regeneron (formerly Intel) Science Talent Search, the largest number of any high school.[33] Nine graduates have won Nobel Prizes\u2014more than any other secondary education institution in the world[34]\u2014and seven have won Pulitzer Prizes.[35][36] Of the nine Nobel Prizes earned by graduates, seven of them are in physics, which earned Bronx Science a designation by the American Physical Society as a \"Historic Physics Site\" in 2010.[37][38]\n\n\nBronx Science is a member of the National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools (NCSSS).[39] Together with Stuyvesant High School and Brooklyn Technical High School, it is one of the three original specialized science high schools operated by the New York City Department of Education.[40]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe New York City Subway's Bedford Park Boulevard (B and \u200bD trains) and Bedford Park Boulevard\u2013Lehman College (4 train) stations are located nearby.[41] Additionally, New York City Bus's Bx10, Bx22, Bx26 and Bx28 routes stop near Bronx Science.[42]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Bronx High School of Science alumni\n\nMany people who attended the Bronx High School of Science have achieved distinction in their respective fields, including winning the Nobel and Pulitzer Prizes, the Academy, Emmy and Turing Awards, the U.S. National Medal of Science, political office and numerous professional society honors.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nBronx Science was the primary rival of Millard Fillmore High School in *Head of the Class*, a television series that aired from 1986 to 1991.\n\n\nBronx Science formed the basis for the Midtown School of Science and Technology in *Spider-Man: Homecoming*, part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[43]\n\n\nThe 2019 Spike Lee produced film, *See You Yesterday* takes place primarily at Bronx Science.[44]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \n\"Search for Public Schools - Bronx High School of Science (360008701922)\". *National Center for Education Statistics*.

It is one of the three original specialized high schools operated by the New York City Department of Education, along with Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx High School of Science. Brooklyn Tech is considered one of the country's most prestigious and selective high schools.[4][5]\n\n\nAdmission to Brooklyn Tech involves taking the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test and scoring the cutoff for Brooklyn Tech. Each November, about 30,000 eighth and ninth graders take the 3-hour test for admittance to eight of the nine specialized high schools. About 1,400 to 1,500 students are admitted each year.\n\n\nBrooklyn Tech counts top scientists, inventors, innovators, *Fortune* 500 company CEOs and founders, high-ranking diplomats, academic scholars, literary and media figures, professional athletes, National Medal recipients, Nobel laureates, and Olympic medalists among its alumni.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\nAdmission to Brooklyn Tech is based exclusively on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), open to all eighth-grade and first-time ninth-grade New York City students. The test has math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension and grammar) sections. Of the approximately 30,000 students taking the SHSAT for September 2011 admission, with 23,085 students listing Brooklyn Tech as a choice on their application, about 1,951 offers were made (the most of any of the specialized high schools, partly due to the school's size).[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Graduation requirements[edit]\n\n\nPer the New York State graduation requirements, students can earn a local diploma, a Regents diploma, or an advanced Regents diploma.\n\n\nTo earn a Brooklyn Tech diploma, students must meet \"service credit\" requirements (which can be dated to at least the 1950s and likely earlier) in addition to the Advanced Regents Diploma requirements.\n\n\nBeginning with the class of 2010, each student must meet the following requirements by the end of their senior year to receive a Brooklyn Tech diploma:[8]\n\n\nI. A minimum of 50 hours of community service outside of the school or through specified club activities.\n\n\nII. A minimum of 32 service credits earned through participation in Tech clubs, teams, and/or participation in designated school related events.\n\n\nService credits are earned as follows:\n\n\n\n1. 8 service credits per term to all students in Legacy Clubs; Student Government (SGO); Student Productions; and/or PSAL Teams (including Cheerleading),\n2. 6 service credits per term to all students working on office squads; participating in Student Leadership; who hold membership in a chapter of an honor society; and/or are in clubs that represent Brooklyn Tech in some significant activities,\n3. 4 service credits per term to all students who participate in all other clubs not referred to above.\n4. Service Credits numbering less than a maximum of 4 can be given to students who participate in unique, yet insignificant activities as determined by a member of faculty.\n\n\n### Reputation[edit]\n\n\nBrooklyn Tech is one of the most elite, prestigious and selective high schools in the United States.[4][5] Together with Stuyvesant High School and Bronx High School of Science, it is one of the three original Specialized High Schools of New York City, operated by the New York City Department of Education, all three of which *The Washington Post* cited in 2006 as among the country's best magnet schools (a category the school is often placed in, though its founding predates the concept of a \"magnet school\", whose intended purpose was not the same).[9] Admission is by competitive examination. As a public school, BTHS has no tuition fee, but only students who reside in New York City are allowed to attend, as per the Hecht-Calandra Act.[a]\n\n\nBrooklyn Tech ranked 2nd in New York State on the 2021 *U.S. News & World Report* \"Best High Schools\" list, making it the highest ranked Specialized High School.[10] In 2008, *Newsweek* listed it among five public high schools that were not in the magazine's 13 \"Public Elite\" ranking, explaining, \"*Newsweek*'s Challenge Index is designed to recognize schools that challenge average students, and not magnet or charter schools that draw only the best students in their areas. These [...] were excluded from the list of top high schools because [...] their sky-high SAT and ACT scores indicate they have few or no average students\".[11] Brooklyn Technical High School consistently appears in the *U.S. News and World Reports* list of the top 50 High Schools in the United States.[12]\n\n\nBrooklyn Tech is a founding member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology. Routinely, 99% of its graduates are accepted to four-year colleges[13] with the 2020 graduating class being offered more than $150 million in scholarships and grants.[14] In 2011, *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Brooklyn Tech among the nation's 50 best high schools for mathematics and science.[15] It was ranked #2 on *Niche*'s \"Standout High Schools in America\" list.[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn 1918, Dr. Albert L. Colston, chair of the Math Department at Manual Training High School, recommended establishing a technical high school for Brooklyn boys. His plan envisioned a heavy concentration of math, science, and drafting courses with parallel paths leading either to college or to a technical career in industry. By 1922, Dr. Colston's concept was approved by the Board of Education, and Brooklyn Technical High School opened in a converted warehouse at 49 Flatbush Avenue Extension, with 2,400 students. This location, in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge, is the reason the school seal bears that bridge's image, rather than the more obvious symbol for the borough, the Brooklyn Bridge. Brooklyn Tech would occupy one more location before settling into its site at 29 Fort Greene Place, for which the groundbreaking was held in 1930.[17]\n\n\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\n\nAtypical for American high schools, Brooklyn Tech uses a system of college-style majors. The curriculum consists of two years of general studies with a technical and engineering emphasis, followed by two years of a student-chosen major.\n\n\nThe curriculum remained largely unchanged until the end of Dr. Colston's 20-year term as principal in 1942. Upon his retirement, Tech was led briefly by acting principal Ralph Breiling, who was succeeded by Principal Harold Taylor in 1944. Tech's modernization would come under Principal William Pabst, who assumed stewardship in 1946 after serving as chair of the Electrical Department. Pabst created new majors and refined older ones, allowing students to select science and engineering preparatory majors including Aeronautical, Architecture, Chemical, Civil, Electrical (later including Electronics and Broadcast), Industrial Design, Mechanical, Structural, and Arts and Sciences. A general College Preparatory curriculum was added later.\n\n\nPrincipal Pabst retired in 1964. A railroad club was established by the late Vincent Gorman, a social studies teacher, and students attended fan trips, tours of rail repair facilities and participated in the restoration of steam engine #103 and a historic rail passenger car at the former Empire State Railroad Museum. In August 1965, a ten-year-old boy named Carl Johnson drowned in the swimming pool at Brooklyn Tech while swimming with his day-camp group.[*citation needed*] The next year, more than 30 graduating Seniors in the school (including many student leaders) complained that Tech's curriculum was old and outdated. Their primary complaint was that the curriculum was geared toward the small minority of students who were not planning on attending college.[*citation needed*] In 1967, the schools of New York City got to view television in the classrooms for the first time, thanks to the 420-foot WNYE-TV tower atop Brooklyn Tech.\n\n\nFor the school year beginning in the last half of 1970, young women began attending;[18] all three NYC specialized and test-required science high schools were now coeducational.\n\n\n\n### Incorporation into specialized high school system and later years[edit]\n\n\nIn 1972, Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, Stuyvesant High School, and High School for Performing Arts become incorporated by the New York State Legislature as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant. The exam would become known as the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) and tested students in Math and English. With its statewide recognition, the school had to become co-educational. Previous to this, Brooklyn Tech was All Boys, and had a sister school, Bay Ridge High School which was all girls.[19]\n\n\nIn 1973, Tech celebrated its 50th anniversary with a dinner-dance at the Waldorf Astoria. To further commemorate the anniversary, a monument was erected, with a time capsule beneath it, in the north courtyard. The monument has eight panels, each with a unique design representing each of Tech's eight majors at that point.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1983, Matt Mandery's appointment as principal made him the first Tech alumnus to hold that position.[20] The following year, Tech received the Excellence in Education award from the U.S. Department of Education.[*citation needed*] The Alumni Association was formally created during this time,[20] and coalitions were formed with the New York City Department of Transportation.[*citation needed*] Mandery oversaw the addition of a Bio-Medical major to the curriculum. John Tobin followed as principal in 1987, abolished the Materials Science department, and closed the seventh-floor foundry.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the mid-1980s, a violent street gang known as the Decepticons were founded at Brooklyn Tech.[21][22] As well, in 2000, the city issued a special report concerning the lack of notification to law enforcement during a string of robberies within the high school, including armed robbery with knives and stun guns.[23]\n\n\n\n### Recent years[edit]\n\n\nIn March 1998, an alumni group led by Leonard Riggio, class of 1958, announced plans for a fund-raising campaign to raise $10 million to support their alma mater financially through facilities upgrades, the establishment of curriculum enhancements, faculty training, and a university-type endowment.[24] The endowment fundraiser, the first of its kind for an American public school, received front-page attention in *The New York Times* and sparked a friendly competition amongst the specialized high schools, with both Bronx Science and Stuyvesant announcing their own $10 million campaigns within weeks of the Brooklyn Tech announcement. In November 2005, the Brooklyn Tech Alumni Association announced the completion of the fundraising phase of what they had termed the Campaign for Brooklyn Tech.[25] In April 2008, the Brooklyn Tech Alumni Foundation launched a second endowment campaign.[26]\n\n\nSixteen alumni died in the September 11 attacks in 2001. They are Dennis Cross '59, Ronald F. Orsini '60, Joel Miller '63, Sheldon R. Kanter '66, Stephen Johnson '75, Danny Libretti '76, Dominick E. Calia '79, Dipti Patel '81, Andre Fletcher '82, Courtney W. Walcott '82, Gerard Jean Baptiste '83, Wai C. Chung '84, Paul Innella '85, Michael McDonnell '85, Thomas Tong '87, and Paul Ortiz '98.[27]\n\n\nSince 2001, Brooklyn Tech has undergone refurbishing such as the renovation of the school's William L. Mack Library entrance, located on the fifth-floor center section. As well, two computer labs were added. The school also reinstated a class devoted to the study of Shakespeare, which students can elect to take in their senior year.\n\n\n\n#### Lee McCaskill[edit]\n\n\nDr. Lee D. McCaskill, the appointed principal in 1992, served for 14 years, during which Tech saw the installation of more computer classrooms and the switch from the traditional mechanical drawing by hand to teaching the use of computer-aided design programs.\n\n\nIn 2000, the Special Commissioner of Investigation for the NYC School District wrote a report condemning Brooklyn Technical High School administrators for failing to report several armed robberies that took place in the bathrooms and stairwells.[28]\n\n\nIn 2003, *The New York Times* published an investigative article that noted \"longstanding tensions\" between the faculty and Principal McCaskill, \"spilled into the open in October, with news reports that several teachers accused him of repeatedly sending sexually explicit e-mail messages from his school computer to staff members.\" While the article praised him for his addition of music and sports programs, it mostly described the principal as autocratic, controlling the school \"largely through fear and intimidation,\" and documented acts of personal vindictiveness toward teachers; severe censorship of the student newspaper and of assigned English texts, including the refusal to let the Pulitzer Prize-finalist novel *Continental Drift* by Russell Banks be used for a class; and of bureaucratic mismanagement.[29] A follow-up column in 2004 found that there was increased teacher exodus, specifically documenting Principal McCaskill's campaign against Alice Alcala, who described as one of the city's leading Shakespeare teachers. Alcala had won Brooklyn Tech a $10,000 grant and brought in the Royal National Theatre of Great Britain for student workshops, but after Alcala had done so, McCaskill repeatedly denied her access to the auditorium and gave her low performance rankings. Shortly after, Alcala left for Manhattan's Murry Bergtraum High School, where she brought in $1,800 in grants for Shakespeare education; meanwhile, at Brooklyn Tech, there was no longer any course solely devoted to Shakespeare, according to the column.[30]\n\n\nIn two newspaper articles in 2005, it was revealed that a $10,000 grant obtained by Dr. Sylvia Weinberger in 2001 to refurbish the obsolete radio studio remained unused. New classroom computers were covered in plastic rather than installed because the classrooms had yet to be wired for them.[31][32]\n\n\nThe Office of Special Investigations of the New York City Department of Education launched an investigation of McCaskill on February 2, 2006, concerning unpaid enrollment of New Jersey resident McCaskill's daughter in a New York City public school, which is illegal for non-residents of the city. Dr. McCaskill produced a lease claiming that he rented an apartment in Brooklyn, but the copyright date on the lease was after the signatures were dated.[33] On February 6, McCaskill announced his resignation from Brooklyn Tech and agreed to pay $19,441 in restitution.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA week later special commissioner Richard J. Condon rebuked the Department of Education for allowing McCaskill to retire, still collecting $125,282 in accrued vacation time, just days before the OSI completed its investigation. Condon also recommended that Cathy Furman McCaskill, the principal's wife, be dismissed from her position as a teacher at Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn for her part in submitting fake leases and other fraudulent documents to indicate the family lived in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn.[34][35] The next day, the Department of Education announced that it would fire her.[36] After retiring from Brooklyn Tech, McCaskill became principal of Hillside High School in New Jersey, where in 2013, he resigned following accusations he spanked a female student.[37]\n\n\n\n#### Randy Asher[edit]\n\n\nOn February 7, 2006, the Department of Education named Randy Asher, founding principal of the High School for Math, Science and Engineering (HSMSE), as interim acting principal.[38] Asher had previously served as Brooklyn Tech's assistant principal in mathematics from 2000 to 2002 before leaving to become founding principal of HSMSE. During his time as principal, the total student enrollment increased from 4,200 to 5,700.[39] In the beginning of January 2017, Asher abruptly left Tech to take on a new position as an NYC Education Department senior advisor to help reduce the Absent Teacher Reserve.[39] Throughout Asher's tenure, the school's reputation was sullied by several allegations of sexual harassment and assault of students by faculty members, resulting in the termination of Sean Shaynak (an aerospace engineering teacher hired by Asher) and the reassignment of English teacher and school newspaper advisor David Lo.[40][41] Music teacher Marisa Cazanave abruptly resigned in the fall of 2016 when faced with charges of having an inappropriate relationship with a male student.[42] The school was also rocked by allegations of racism against black students and Asher faced mounting student pressure on social media to fix the situation.[43] Following Asher's departure, former assistant principal David Newman took on the new position as acting principal of the specialized high school. In February 2020, Newman was appointed principal.[44]\n\n\n\n## Building and facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brooklyn Tech as seen from Ashland Place in Fort Greene\n![](image)Brooklyn Tech as seen from the corner of DeKalb Avenue and Fort Greene Place\n![](image)The 420-foot WNYE-FM transmitting tower atop the school\nThe school, built on its present site in 1932 at a cost of $6 million, is 12 stories high, and covers over half a city block. Brooklyn Technical High School is directly across the street from Fort Greene Park. Facilities at BTHS include:\n\n\n\n* Gymnasia on the first and eighth floors, with a mezzanine running track above the larger first floor gym and a weight room on the third floor boys locker room. The eighth floor gym had a bowling alley lane and an adjacent wire-mesh enclosed rooftop sometimes used for handball, golf and for tennis practice.\n* 25-yard swimming pool in the basement\n* Wood, machine, sheet metal and other specialized shops. A program involves a shop where an actual house is built and framed by students. Most have been converted into normal classrooms or computer labs, except for a few robotics shops, such as the Ike Heller Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Robotics Center.\n* A foundry on the seventh floor, with a floor of molding sand used for creating sand casting molds and equipped with furnaces, kilns, ovens and ancillary equipment for metal smelting. Students made wooden patterns in pattern making, which were used to make sand molds which were cast in the foundry and machined to specification in the machine shops. It was closed in the late 1980s.[45]\n* Materials testing lab, used during the basic materials science (Strength of Materials) class. Included industrial capacity Universal Testing Machine and brinell hardness tester and polishing and microscopic examination rooms. During the 1960s, students attended \"inspection training shop\" and were taught to use x-ray analysis to detect metal fatigue failures, use of vernier measuring instruments, micrometers, and go-no-go gauges.\n* Aeronautical lab, featuring a large wind tunnel, During the 1960s, a T-6 Texan U.S. Air Force surplus aircraft in the building was used for student aeronautical mechanic instruction.\n* Radio studio and 18,000 watt transmitter licensed by the Federal Communications Commission as WNYE (FM). The studio has not been used since the 1980s.\n* 3,100-seat auditorium, with two balconies\u2014the 4th largest auditorium in New York City[46]\n* Recital hall on the ninth floor\n* Drafting, both pencil and ink technical drawing and freehand drawing rooms\n* Library with defunct fireplaces\n* Football field on Fulton and Clermont Streets. The Football Field, named in honor of Brooklyn Tech Alumnus Charles Wang, was opened in 2001, with the home opener played October 6, 2001, against DeWitt Clinton High School.[47]\n* Access to Fort Greene Park for outdoor track, tennis, etc.\n* Mock courtroom for use by the Law & Society major and the Mock Trial Team.\n* The 420-foot WNYE-FM tower atop the school is three times taller than the building. The entire structure combined is 597 feet (182 meters) tall.[48] It was the tallest structure in Brooklyn, beating out AVA DoBro by only one foot, but beaten in 2017 with the completion of The Hub, which is 13 feet taller.\n* In 1934, the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), which later became the Works Projects Administration (WPA), commissioned artist Maxwell B. Starr to paint a mural in the foyer depicting the evolution of man and science throughout history.\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe New York City Subway's Fulton Street (G train) and Lafayette Avenue (C train) stations are located nearby, as well as more BMT and IRT services at DeKalb Avenue and Atlantic Terminal, which also serves the Long Island Rail Road.[49] Additionally, New York City Bus's B25, B26, B38 and B52 routes stop near Brooklyn Tech.[50] Students residing a certain distance from the school are provided full-fare or half-fare student MetroCards for public transportation on their first day of school at BTHS, as well as the first day of each school term onward.[51]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\nBrooklyn Tech uses a college-style system of majors, unusual for an American high school. Below is the list of majors at Brooklyn Tech.[52]\n\n\n\n* Aerospace engineering\n* Architectural engineering\n* Biological sciences\n* Chemical engineering\n* Civil engineering\n* Media communications\n* Electrical engineering\n* Environmental science research\n* Finance\n* Industrial design\n* Law and society\n* LIU advanced health professions\n* LIU PharmD\n* Applied mathematics\n* Mechatronics and robotics\n* Pharmaceutical sciences\n* Physics\n* Social science research\n* Software engineering\n\nStudents are placed into a major during the second semester of their sophomore year after ranking all the majors in order of preference. These majors include courses, typically Advanced Placement or Project Lead the Way (PLTW) courses, that concentrate in that specific area of interest given to students during their last two years at Tech. Each major has a different formula (PI index) used to rank students according to their ranking preference of the majors and their current averages from freshman and sophomore year. A student with a higher PI index for their second preference if they did not get into their first, will get priority over another student with a lower average on the same major preference.[53]\n\n\nBret Stephens, an opinion columnist, wrote in *The New York Times* that \"The success of Brooklyn Tech only casts an unflattering light on every other corner of the public school bureaucracy.\"[54]\n\n\n\n## Extracurricular activities[edit]\n\n\nBrooklyn Tech fields 30 junior-varsity and varsity teams in the Public School Athletic League (PSAL). The school's historic team name has been the Engineers. The school colors are navy blue and white. The school's more than 100 organizations include the Brooklyn Tech Amateur Radio Club (club station call sign W2CXN), Civil Air Patrol Brooklyn Tech Cadet Squadron, chess, debate, football, wrestling, forensics (speech), hockey, mock trial, robotics, and rowing[55] teams and clubs, and The Survey,[2] the official school newspaper. Tech has a literary art journal, Horizons, for those who want to express themselves through art, poetry, photography, and prose.[56] The Model United Nations provides students with a venue for discussing foreign affairs and also hosts a conference each year called TechMUN.[57][56] Other clubs cater to a wide range of topics such as anime, the Stock Market, *Dance Dance Revolution*, ultimate Frisbee, politics, quilting, fashion, debate (which offers Public Forum, Congress and Policy), table tennis and animal rights. The cheerleading squad is named the Enginettes. In 2012, Tech students created a Junior State of America Chapter at their school.[56] Brooklyn Tech has its own student union, to address issues on a student level. Tech has a variety of community service clubs, such as Key Club, Red Cross Club, and BETA.[56] Tech students put on a musical each spring.[56]\n\n\nThere are two step teams, Lady Dragons and Organized C.H.A.O.S.[56]\n\n\nThe school has several Coordinator of Student Activities (COSA).[58]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nA list of notable alumni of Brooklyn Technical High School is listed below. Brooklyn Technical High School also has a unique Hall of Fame, which lists alumni who have contributed significantly to STEM.[59] Such alumni are noted below.\n\n\n\n* Gary Ackerman '60\u00a0\u2013 United States Representative, New York (1983\u20132013)\n* Warren Adler '45\u00a0\u2013 novelist[60]\n* David Antin, '50 \u2013 poet, art critic, professor\n* Henry L.

Stuyvesant High School - Founded in 1904 as Manhattan's first manual trade school for boys. It was established by resolution of the New York City Board of Education with an initial enrollment of 155 students and 12 teachers.\n\n2. Brooklyn Technical High School - Founded in 1922 after Dr. Albert L. Colston, chair of the Math Department at Manual Training High School, recommended establishing a technical high school for Brooklyn boys in 1918. The school opened with 2,400 students in a converted warehouse.\n\n3. Bronx High School of Science - Founded in 1938 as a specialized science and math high school for boys, with Morris Meister as the first principal.\n\nThese were the three original specialized high schools in New York City. In 1972, they were officially designated as specialized high schools by the Hecht-Calandra Act, which established the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) as the sole criterion for admission.\n\nAll three schools initially admitted only male students but later became co-educational:\n- Stuyvesant began accepting female students in 1969\n- Brooklyn Tech began accepting female students in 1970\n- Bronx Science began accepting female students in 1946\n\nAdditional specialized high schools were added later, but these were the original three established in the early-to-mid 20th century.",
