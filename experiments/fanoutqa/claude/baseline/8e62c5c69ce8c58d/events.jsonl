He studied history at Harvard University and then attended Harvard Law School, where he was managing editor of the *Harvard Law Review*. He served as a law clerk for Circuit Judge Henry Friendly and Justice William Rehnquist before taking a position in the attorney general's office during the Reagan Administration. He went on to serve the Reagan Administration and the George H. W. Bush Administration in the Department of Justice and the Office of the White House Counsel, during which he was nominated by George H. W. Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but no vote on his nomination was held.[10] Roberts then spent 14 years in private law practice. During this time, he argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court.[11] Notably, he represented 19 states in *United States v. Microsoft Corp.*[12]\n\n\nRoberts became a federal judge in 2003, when President George W. Bush appointed him to the District of Columbia Circuit. During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13] In 2005, Bush nominated Roberts to the Supreme Court, initially to be an associate justice to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist died shortly afterward, however, before Roberts's Senate confirmation hearings had begun. Bush then withdrew Roberts's nomination and instead nominated him to become Chief Justice, choosing Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor.\n\n\nRoberts has authored the majority opinion in many important cases, including decisions relating to elections, federal agencies, presidential power, the Affordable Care Act, and race-based college admissions.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRoberts was born on January 27, 1955, in Buffalo, New York, to Rosemary (*née* Podrasky; 1929–2019) and John Glover \"Jack\" Roberts Sr. (1928–2008). His father had Irish and Welsh ancestry, and his mother was a descendant of Slovak immigrants from Szepes, Hungary.[14] He has an elder sister, Kathy, and two younger sisters: Peggy and Barbara.[15] Roberts spent his early childhood years in Hamburg, New York, where his father worked as an electrical engineer for the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at its factory in Lackawanna.[16]\n\n\nIn 1965, ten-year-old Roberts and his family moved to Long Beach, Indiana, where his father became manager of a new steel plant in nearby Burns Harbor.[17] Roberts attended La Lumiere School, an academically rigorous Catholic boarding school in La Porte, Indiana,[17][18] where he captained the school's football team. Roberts additionally participated in track and field and was a regional champion in wrestling. He also participated in choir and drama, and was a co-editor for the school newspaper The Torch.[17] He graduated as class valedictorian in 1973.[17]\n\n\nRoberts enrolled at Harvard University as a history major, entering as a sophomore with second-year standing based on his exemplary academic achievements in high school.[19] He lived in Straus Hall and Leverett House,[20] returning home each summer to earn money working at the steel plant his father managed.[17] Roberts was described as a serious student; one classmate recalled, \"John loved history, and said he'd be a history professor, but he also mentioned law\".[20] One of his first papers, \"Marxism and Bolshevism: Theory and Practice\", won Harvard's William Scott Ferguson Prize for the most outstanding essay by a sophomore history major,[19] and his senior year paper, \"The Utopian Conservative: A Study of Continuity and Change in the Thought of Daniel Webster\", won a Bowdoin Prize.[21] He graduated in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, and membership in Phi Beta Kappa.[22]\n\n\nRoberts had originally planned to pursue a Ph.D. in history and become a history professor but instead decided to attend Harvard Law School to pursue a legal career. Classmate David B. Wilkins described him as \"more conservative than the typical Harvard Law student in the 1970s\", though he had been well-liked among fellow students.[20] Roberts became managing editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1979 with a J.D., *magna cum laude*.[17][19]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Ronald Reagan greeting Roberts in the Oval Office while Roberts was serving as an associate White House Counsel (1983)\nAfter graduating from law school, Roberts was a law clerk for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1979 to 1980, then for Justice (later Chief Justice in 1986) William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1980 to 1981.[17]\n\n\nFollowing his clerkships, Roberts began working for the U.S. government in the Administration of President Ronald Reagan, first from 1981 to 1982 as a special assistant to U.S. Attorney General William French Smith, then from 1982 to 1986 as an associate with the White House Counsel.[17] He then entered private practice in Washington, D.C., as an associate at the law firm of Hogan & Hartson (now Hogan Lovells) and worked in the field of corporate law.[23]\n\n\nIn 1989, Roberts joined the Administration of president George H. W. Bush as Principal Deputy Solicitor General.[24] He served as the acting solicitor general for the case of *Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC* when the solicitor general, Ken Starr, had a conflict of interest. In the case, Roberts argued against policies of the FCC intended to increase minority ownership of broadcast licenses, arguing that the racial preferences were unconstitutional. Roberts's decision to argue that a federal agency's policy was unconstitutional surprised many lawyers within the Solicitor General's office.[25][26][27] In 1992, Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but no Senate vote was held, and Roberts's nomination expired at the end of the 102nd Congress.[10]\n\n\nFollowing Bush's defeat by Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election, Roberts left government service and returned to Hogan & Hartson as a partner. He became the head of the firm's appellate practice, and also became an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. During this time, Roberts argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court, prevailing in 25 of them.[28] He represented 19 states in *United States v. Microsoft*.[12] Those cases include:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Case\n | Argued\n | Decided\n | Represented\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *First Options v.

Evans*, which was described in 2005 as \"the movement's most important legal victory\". Roberts's involvement with the case was minimal, as he later stated that he had been involved for less than ten hours in preparing oral arguments.[29] He also argued on behalf of the homeless, in a case which became one of Roberts's \"few appellate losses.\"[*further explanation needed*][30] He also represented, pro bono, a man who was sentenced to death for killing eight people in Florida.[31][32]\n\n\nDuring the late 1990s, while working for Hogan & Hartson, Roberts served as a member of the steering committee of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the conservative Federalist Society (although Roberts says he has never been a Federalist Society member).[33] In 2000, Roberts advised Jeb Bush, then governor of Florida, concerning Bush's actions in the Florida election recount during the presidential election.[34]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Roberts as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (c. 2003)\nOn May 9, 2001, President George W. Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to replace judge James L. Buckley, who had recently retired.[35] However, the Democratic Party had a majority in the Senate at the time and was in conflict with Bush over his judicial nominees. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy refused to give Roberts a hearing in the 107th Congress.[36] The GOP regained control of the Senate on January 7, 2003, and Bush resubmitted Roberts's nomination that day. Roberts was confirmed on May 8, 2003,[37] and received his commission on June 2, 2003.[38] During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13]\n\n\n\n### Fourth and Fifth amendments[edit]\n\n\n*Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority*, 386 F.3d 1148,[39] involved a 12-year-old girl who was arrested, searched, handcuffed, and fingerprinted after she violated a publicly advertised zero tolerance \"no eating\" policy in a Washington Metro station by eating a single french fry.[40] She was released to her mother three hours later.[41] She sued, alleging that an adult would have only received a citation for the same offense, while children must be detained until parents are notified. The D.C. Circuit unanimously affirmed the district court's dismissal of the girl's lawsuit, which was predicated on alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure) and Fifth Amendment (equal protection).\n\n\n\"No one is very happy about the events that led to this litigation,\" Roberts wrote. Because age discrimination is evaluated using a rational basis test, however, only weak state interests were required to justify the policy, and the panel concluded they were present. \"Because parents and guardians play an essential role in that rehabilitative process, it is reasonable for the District to seek to ensure their participation, and the method chosen—detention until the parent is notified and retrieves the child—certainly does that, in a way issuing a citation might not.\" The court concluded that the policy and detention were constitutional, noting that \"the question before us ... is not whether these policies were a bad idea, but whether they violated the Fourth and Fifth amendments to the Constitution,\" language reminiscent of Justice Potter Stewart's dissent in *Griswold v. Connecticut*. \"We are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine,\" Stewart had written; \"[w]e are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution. And that, I cannot do.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Military tribunals[edit]\n\n\nIn *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld*, Roberts was part of a unanimous circuit panel overturning the district court ruling and upholding military tribunals set up by the Bush Administration for trying terrorism suspects known as enemy combatants. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, writing for the court, ruled that Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a driver for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden,[42] could be tried by a military court because:\n\n\n\n1. the military commission had the approval of the United States Congress;\n2. the Third Geneva Convention is a treaty between nations and as such it does not confer individual rights and remedies enforceable in U.S. courts;\n3. even if the convention could be enforced in U.S. courts, it would not be of assistance to Hamdan at the time because, for a conflict such as the war against Al-Qaeda (considered by the court as a separate war from that against Afghanistan itself) that is not between two countries, it guarantees only a certain standard of judicial procedure without speaking to the jurisdiction in which the prisoner must be tried.\n\n\nThe court held open the possibility of judicial review of the results of the military commission after the current proceedings ended.[43] This decision was overturned on June 29, 2006, by the Supreme Court in a 5–3 decision, with Roberts not participating due to his prior participation in the case as a circuit judge.[44]\n\n\n\n### Environmental regulation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **require cleanup** to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. The specific problem is: **Reference format.** Please help improve this section if you can. *(May 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nRoberts wrote a dissent in *Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton*,[45] a case involving the protection of a rare California toad under the Endangered Species Act. When the court denied a rehearing en banc,(D.C. Cir. 2003)[45] Roberts dissented, arguing that the panel opinion was inconsistent with *United States v. Lopez* and *United States v. Morrison* in that it incorrectly focused on whether the *regulation* substantially affects interstate commerce rather than on whether the regulated *activity* does. In Roberts's view, the Commerce Clause of the Constitution did not permit the government to regulate activity affecting what he called \"a hapless toad\" that \"for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California.\" He said that reviewing the panel decision would allow the court \"alternative grounds for sustaining application of the Act that may be more consistent with Supreme Court precedent.\"[46]\n\n\n\n## Appointment to Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: John Roberts Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President George W. Bush announces Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice (2005).\nOn July 19, 2005, President Bush nominated Roberts to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill a vacancy to be created by the impending retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Roberts's nomination was the first Supreme Court nomination since Stephen Breyer in 1994.\n\n\nOn September 3, 2005, while Roberts's confirmation was pending before the Senate, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist died. Two days later, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination as O'Connor's successor and announced Roberts's new nomination as Chief Justice.[47]\n\n\n\n### Roberts's testimony on his jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Roberts said that he did not have a comprehensive jurisprudential philosophy, and he did \"not think beginning with an all-encompassing approach to constitutional interpretation is the best way to faithfully construe the document.\"[48][49] Roberts compared judges to baseball umpires: \"[I]t's my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.\"[50] Among the issues he discussed during the hearings were:\n\n\n\n#### Commerce Clause[edit]\n\n\nIn Senate hearings, Roberts has stated:\n\n\n\n\n> Starting with *McCulloch v. Maryland*, Chief Justice John Marshall gave a very broad and expansive reading to the powers of the Federal Government and explained generally that if the ends be legitimate, then any means chosen to achieve them are within the power of the Federal Government, and cases interpreting that, throughout the years, have come down. Certainly, by the time *Lopez* was decided, many of us had learned in law school that it was just sort of a formality to say that interstate commerce was affected and that cases weren't going to be thrown out that way. *Lopez* certainly breathed new life into the Commerce Clause.\n> I think it remains to be seen, in subsequent decisions, how rigorous a showing, and in many cases, it is just a showing. It's not a question of an abstract fact, does this affect interstate commerce or not, but has this body, the Congress, demonstrated the impact on interstate commerce that drove them to legislate? That's a very important factor. It wasn't present in *Lopez* at all. I think the members of Congress had heard the same thing I had heard in law school, that this is unimportant—and they hadn't gone through the process of establishing a record in that case.[49]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Federalism[edit]\n\n\nRoberts stated the following about federalism in a 1999 radio interview:\n\n\n\n\n> We have gotten to the point these days where we think the only way we can show we're serious about a problem is if we pass a federal law, whether it is the Violence Against Women Act or anything else. The fact of the matter is conditions are different in different states, and state laws can be more relevant is I think exactly the right term, more attuned to the different situations in New York, as opposed to Minnesota, and that is what the Federal system is based on.[51]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Reviewing Acts of Congress[edit]\n\n\nAt a Senate hearing, Roberts stated:\n\n\n\n\n> The Supreme Court has, throughout its history, on many occasions described the deference that is due to legislative judgments. Justice Holmes described assessing the constitutionality of an act of Congress as the gravest duty that the Supreme Court is called upon to perform. ... It's a principle that is easily stated and needs to be observed in practice, as well as in theory.\n> Now, the Court, of course, has the obligation, and has been recognized since *Marbury v. Madison*, to assess the constitutionality of acts of Congress, and when those acts are challenged, it is the obligation of the Court to say what the law is. The determination of when deference to legislative policy judgments goes too far and becomes abdication of the judicial responsibility, and when scrutiny of those judgments goes too far on the part of the judges and becomes what I think is properly called judicial activism, that is certainly the central dilemma of having an unelected, as you describe it correctly, undemocratic judiciary in a democratic republic.[49]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### *Stare decisis*[edit]\n\n\nOn the subject of *stare decisis*, referring to *Brown v. Board of Education*, the decision overturning school segregation, Roberts said that \"the Court in that case, of course, overruled a prior decision. I don't think that constitutes judicial activism because obviously if the decision is wrong, it should be overruled. That's not activism. That's applying the law correctly.\"[52]\n\n\n\n#### *Roe v. Wade*[edit]\n\n\nWhile working as a lawyer for the Reagan Administration, Roberts wrote legal memos defending administration policies on abortion.[53] At his nomination hearing Roberts testified that the legal memos represented the views of the administration he was representing at the time and not necessarily his own.[54] \"Senator, I was a staff lawyer; I didn't have a position,\" Roberts said.[54] As a lawyer in the George H. W. Bush Administration, Roberts signed a legal brief urging the court to overturn *Roe v. Wade*.[55]\n\n\nIn private meetings with senators before his confirmation, Roberts testified that *Roe* was settled law, but added that it was subject to the legal principle of *stare decisis,*[56] meaning that while the Court must give some weight to the precedent, it was not legally bound to uphold it.\n\n\nIn his Senate testimony, Roberts said that, while sitting on the Appellate Court, he had an obligation to respect precedents established by the Supreme Court, including the right to an abortion. He stated: \"*Roe v. Wade* is the settled law of the land. ... There is nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying that precedent, as well as *Casey*.\" Following the traditional reluctance of nominees to indicate which way they might vote on an issue likely to come before the Supreme Court, he did not explicitly say whether he would vote to overturn either.[48] However, Jeffrey Rosen adds, \"I wouldn't bet on Chief Justice Roberts's siding unequivocally with the anti-*Roe* forces.\"[57]\n\n\n\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOn September 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Roberts's nomination by a vote of 13–5, with Senators Ted Kennedy, Richard Durbin, Charles Schumer, Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein voting against. Roberts was confirmed by the full Senate on September 29 by a margin of 78–22.[58] All Republicans and the one Independent voted for Roberts; the Democrats split evenly, 22–22. Roberts was confirmed by what was, historically, a narrow margin for a Supreme Court justice.[59] However, all subsequent confirmation votes have been even more narrow.[60][61][62][63]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roberts Court\n\n![](image)Roberts is sworn in as Chief Justice by Justice John Paul Stevens in the East Room of the White House as President Bush and Roberts's wife Jane look on, September 29, 2005.\nRoberts took the Constitutional oath of office, administered by Associate Justice John Paul Stevens at the White House, on September 29, 2005. On October 3, he took the judicial oath provided for by the Judiciary Act of 1789 at the United States Supreme Court building.\n\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said that Roberts \"pretty much run[s] the show the same way\" as Rehnquist, albeit \"let[ting] people go on a little longer at conference ... but [he'll] get over that.\"[64] Roberts has been portrayed as a consistent advocate for conservative principles by analysts such as Jeffrey Toobin.[65] Garrett Epps has described Roberts's prose as \"crystalline, vivid, and often humorous\".[66]\n\n\nSeventh Circuit judge Diane Sykes, surveying Roberts's first term on the Court, concluded that his jurisprudence \"appears to be strongly rooted in the discipline of traditional legal method, evincing a fidelity to text, structure, history, and the constitutional hierarchy. He exhibits the restraint that flows from the careful application of established decisional rules and the practice of reasoning from the case law. He appears to place great stock in the process-oriented tools and doctrinal rules that guard against the aggregation of judicial power and keep judicial discretion in check: jurisdictional limits, structural federalism, textualism, and the procedural rules that govern the scope of judicial review.\"[67] Roberts has been said to operate under an approach of judicial minimalism in his decisions,[68] having stated, \"[i]f it is not necessary to decide more to a case, then in my view it is necessary not to decide more to a case.\"[69] His decision making and leadership demonstrates an intent to preserve the Court's power and legitimacy while dually maintaining judicial independence.[70] Roberts was ranked 50th in the 2016 Forbes ranking of \"The World's Most Powerful People.\"[71]\n\n\nIn November 2018, the Associated Press approached Roberts for comment after President Donald Trump described a jurist who ruled against his asylum policy as an \"Obama judge\". In response, Roberts asserted that \"[w]e do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\" His remarks were widely interpreted as a rebuke of President Trump's comments.[72][73][74] As Chief Justice, Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, which began on January 16 and ended on February 5, 2020.[75] Roberts did not, however, preside over Trump's second impeachment trial, believing that the Constitution only requires that the chief justice preside in the trial of the sitting president and not of a former president.[76]\n\n\nAlthough Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, Roberts is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when *Bush v. Gore* is compared to Roberts's vote for the ACA: his vote in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) caused the press to contrast his Court with the Rehnquist Court.[77] Roberts's judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin Scalia's and Clarence Thomas's.[78][79][77] He wishes more consensus from the Court.[78] At the beginning of his tenure, Roberts's voting pattern closely aligned with Samuel Alito's.[80] However, in recent years, his voting pattern has closely resembled Brett Kavanaugh's, who is generally seen as far more moderate than Alito.[81]\n\n\nAfter the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, several commentators wrote that Roberts was no longer the leading justice. As the five other conservative justices could outvote the rest, he supposedly could no longer preside over a moderately conservative course while respecting precedent.[82][83] This view was espoused again after the 2022 *Dobbs* decision, which overturned rulings from 1973 and 1992.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in *Gonzales v. Oregon*, which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.\n\n\nOn March 6, 2006, Roberts wrote the unanimous decision in *Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights* that colleges accepting federal money must allow military recruiters on campus, despite university objections to the Clinton Administration-initiated \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy.\n\n\n\n### Campaign finance[edit]\n\n\nFollowing his concurrence in *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010), Roberts wrote the plurality opinion in another landmark campaign finance case called *McCutcheon v. FEC* (2014). In *McCutcheon* the Court ruled that \"aggregate limits\" on the combined amount a donor could give to various federal candidates or party committees violated the First Amendment.[66][86]\n\n\n\n### Fourth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nRoberts wrote his first dissent in *Georgia v. Randolph* (2006). The majority's decision prohibited police from searching a home if both occupants are present but one objected and the other consented. Roberts criticized the majority opinion as inconsistent with prior case law and for partly basing its reasoning on its perception of social custom. He said the social expectation test was flawed because the Fourth Amendment protects a legitimate expectation of privacy, not social expectations.[87]\n\n\nIn *Utah v. Strieff* (2016), Roberts joined the majority in ruling (5–3) that a person with an outstanding warrant may be arrested and searched, and that any evidence discovered based on that search is admissible in court; the majority opinion held that this remains true even when police act unlawfully by stopping a person without reasonable suspicion, before learning of the existence of the outstanding warrant.[88]\n\n\nIn *Carpenter v. United States*, a landmark decision involving privacy of cellular phone data, Roberts wrote the majority opinion in a 5–4 ruling that searches of cellular phone data generally require a warrant.[89]\n\n\n\n### Notice and opportunity to be heard[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Roberts has often sided with Scalia and Thomas, he also provided a crucial vote against their mutual position in *Jones v. Flowers*, siding with liberal justices of the court in ruling that, before a home is seized and sold in a tax-forfeiture sale, due diligence must be demonstrated and proper notification needs to be sent to the owners. Dissenting justices were Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, while Roberts's opinion was joined by David Souter, Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Samuel Alito did not participate.\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn *Gonzales v. Carhart* (2007), Roberts voted with the majority to uphold the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a five-justice majority, distinguished *Stenberg v. Carhart*, and concluded that the Court's previous decision in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* did not prevent Congress from banning the procedure. The decision left the door open for future as-applied challenges, and did not address the broader question of whether Congress had the authority to pass the law.[90] Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Casey* should be reversed; Roberts declined to join that opinion.\n\n\nIn 2018, Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined four more liberal justices in declining to hear a case brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood,[91] thereby letting stand lower court rulings in favor of Planned Parenthood.[92] Roberts also joined with liberal justices in 5–4 decisions temporarily blocking a Louisiana abortion restriction (2019)[93] and later striking down that law (*June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo* (2020)).[94][95] The law at issue in *June* was similar to one the court struck down in *Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt* (2016), which Roberts had voted to uphold;[96][97] in his *June* opinion, Roberts wrote that while he believed *Whole Woman's Health* was wrongly decided he was joining the majority in *June* out of respect for *stare decisis*.[96] It was the first time in his 15 years on the Supreme Court that Roberts had cast a vote to invalidate a law that regulated abortion.[98] In September 2021, the Supreme Court declined an emergency petition to temporarily block enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy except to save the mother's life. In a 5–4 vote, Roberts joined Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in the minority.[99]\nIn 2022, Roberts declined to join the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which overturned *Roe v. Wade*. Roberts wrote a concurring opinion supporting only the decision to uphold the Mississippi abortion statute, stating that the right to an abortion should \"extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further\". Roberts also declined to join the dissenting opinion of Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nOn November 4, 2016, Roberts was the deciding vote in a 5–3 decision to stay an execution.[100] On February 7, 2019, Roberts was part of the majority in a 5–4 decision rejecting a Muslim inmate's request to delay execution in order to have an imam present with him during the execution.[101] Also, in February 2019, Roberts sided with Justice Kavanaugh and the court's four liberal justices in a 6–3 decision to block the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[102][103]\n\n\n\n### Affirmative action[edit]\n\n\nRoberts opposes the use of race in assigning students to particular schools, including for purposes such as maintaining integrated schools.[104] He sees such plans as discrimination in violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and *Brown v. Board of Education*.[104][105] In *Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1*, the Court considered two voluntarily adopted school district plans that relied on race to determine which schools certain children may attend. The Court had held in *Brown* that \"racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional,\"[106] and later, that \"racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, ... are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests,\"[107] and that this \"[n]arrow tailoring ... require[s] serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.\"[108] Roberts cited these cases in writing for the *Parents Involved* majority, concluding that the school districts had \"failed to show that they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals.\"[109] In a section of the opinion joined by four other justices, Roberts added that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Roberts in 2021\nOn June 29, 2023, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* and *Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina*, which held that race-based affirmative action in both public and private universities violates the Equal Protection Clause.[110]\n\n\n\n### Free speech[edit]\n\n\nRoberts authored the 2007 student free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, ruling that a student in a public school-sponsored activity does not have the right to advocate drug use on the basis that the right to free speech does not invariably prevent the exercise of school discipline.[111]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2010, in *United States v. Stevens*, the Supreme Court struck down an animal cruelty law. Roberts, writing for an 8–1 majority, found that a federal statute criminalizing the commercial production, sale, or possession of depictions of cruelty to animals was an unconstitutional abridgment of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Court held that the statute was substantially overbroad; for example, it could allow prosecutions for selling photos of out-of-season hunting.[112]\n\n\n\n### Health care reform[edit]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2012, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, which upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by a 5–4 vote. The Court indicated that although the \"individual mandate\" component of the Act could not be upheld under the Commerce Clause, the mandate could be construed as a tax and was therefore ruled to be valid under Congress's authority to \"lay and collect taxes.\"[113][114] The Court overturned a portion of the law related to the withholding of funds from states that did not comply with the expansion of Medicaid; Roberts wrote that \"Congress is not free ... to penalize states that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.\"[114]\nSources within the Supreme Court state that Roberts switched his vote regarding the individual mandate sometime after an initial vote[115][116] and that Roberts largely wrote both the majority and minority opinions.[117] This extremely unusual circumstance has also been used to explain why the minority opinion was also unsigned, itself a rare phenomenon from the Supreme Court.[117]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Hollingsworth v. Perry* (2013), Roberts wrote the 5–4 majority opinion holding that Petitioners, appealing a lower court ruling that California's Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, lacked standing to sue, with the result that same-sex marriages resumed in California.[118] Roberts dissented in *United States v. Windsor* in which the 5-4 majority ruled that key parts of the Defense of Marriage Act were unconstitutional.[119] The case stated the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages that have been approved by certain states. He dissented in the *Obergefell v. Hodges* case in which Kennedy wrote for the majority, again 5–4, that same-sex couples had a right to marry.[120] In *Pavan v. Smith*, the Supreme Court \"summarily overruled\" the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision that the state did not have to list same-sex spouses on birth certificates; Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch dissented, but Roberts joined the majority.[121] In the cases of *Bostock v. Clayton County, Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda,* and *R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission* (2020), heard together, Roberts ruled with the 6–3 majority deciding that businesses cannot discriminate against LGBT people in matters of employment.[122] In October 2020, Roberts joined the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to reject an appeal from Kim Davis, who refused to provide marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[123]\n\n\nIn *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia* (2021), Roberts joined the justices in a unanimous decision in favor of a Catholic adoption agency which had been denied a contract by the City of Philadelphia for its policy refusing to adopt to same-sex couples; he was also part of the majority that declined to reconsider or overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[124] Also in 2021, he was one of the six justices who declined to hear an appeal by a Washington State florist who refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage; because four votes are required to hear a case, the lower court judgments against the florist remain in place.[125][126][127] In November 2021, Roberts voted with the majority of justices in a 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[128] Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented; the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the transgender patient.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Voting Rights Act[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may relate to a different subject or has undue weight on an aspect of the subject.** Please help relocate relevant information and remove irrelevant ones. *(August 2022)*\n |\n\n\nDuring his tenure as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roberts has struck down voting rights protections provided by the Voting Rights Act.[131][132][133] In *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013), Roberts struck down requirements that states and localities with a history of racially motivated voter suppression obtain federal preclearance before implementing any changes to voting laws. Research shows that preclearance had led to increases in minority congressional representation and minority turnout.[134][135] Five years after the ruling, nearly 1,000 U.S. polling places had closed, many of them in predominantly African-American counties. There were also cuts to early voting, purges of voter rolls and imposition of strict voter ID laws.[136][137] A 2020 study found that jurisdictions that had previously been covered by preclearance substantially increased their voter registration purges after the *Shelby* decision.[138] Virtually all restrictions on voting subsequent to the ruling were enacted by Republicans.[139]\n\n\nIn 2023, Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined the liberals in Allen v. Milligan, a 5-4 decision holding that Alabama's congressional redistricting plan violated Section 2 of the VRA. Writing for the majority, Roberts concluded that Alabama must draw an additional majority-minority district, and determined that Section 2 of the Act is constitutional in the redistricting context. Writing for himself and the three liberal justices, Roberts also wrote that \"[t]he contention that mapmakers must be entirely 'blind' to race has no footing in our §2 case law.\"[140]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(May 2023)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2007, Roberts received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, where he delivered a commencement address that same year.[141]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRoberts and his wife, Jane Sullivan, were married on July 27, 1996.[142] Sullivan is a lawyer who became a prominent legal recruiter at the firms of Major, Lindsey & Africa and Mlegal.[143] Along with Clarence Thomas, she is on the board of trustees at her alma mater, the College of the Holy Cross. The couple lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland, an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C., and they have two adopted children: John \"Jack\" and Josephine \"Josie\".[144][17]\n\n\nRoberts is one of 15 Catholic justices—out of 115 justices total—in the history of the Supreme Court.[145] Of those fifteen justices, six (Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett) are currently serving.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Roberts had a seizure at his vacation home in St. George, Maine[146][147]\nand stayed overnight at a hospital in Rockport, Maine;[148]\ndoctors found no identifiable cause.[146][147][149][150]\nRoberts had suffered a similar seizure in 1993[146][147][149]\nbut an official Supreme Court statement said that a neurological evaluation \"revealed no cause for concern.\" Federal judges are not required by law to release information about their health.[146]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2020, Roberts fell at a Maryland country club; his forehead required sutures and he stayed overnight in the hospital for observation. Doctors ruled out a seizure and believed dehydration had made Roberts light-headed.[151]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a disclosure Roberts submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee prior to his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Roberts's net worth was more than $6 million, including $1.6 million in stocks.[*citation needed*] In joining the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2003, he took a pay cut from $1 million a year to $164,000; as Chief Justice his salary is $286,700 as of 2022.[152]\n\n\nIn 2010, Roberts sold his stock in Pfizer because he was set to hear two pending cases involving the company.[153]\n\n\n\n## Published works[edit]\n\n\n* Roberts, John (1978). \"Developments in the Law: Zoning – III.

He studied history at Harvard University and then attended Harvard Law School, where he was managing editor of the *Harvard Law Review*. He served as a law clerk for Circuit Judge Henry Friendly and Justice William Rehnquist before taking a position in the attorney general's office during the Reagan Administration. He went on to serve the Reagan Administration and the George H. W. Bush Administration in the Department of Justice and the Office of the White House Counsel, during which he was nominated by George H. W. Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but no vote on his nomination was held.[10] Roberts then spent 14 years in private law practice. During this time, he argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court.[11] Notably, he represented 19 states in *United States v. Microsoft Corp.*[12]\n\n\nRoberts became a federal judge in 2003, when President George W. Bush appointed him to the District of Columbia Circuit. During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13] In 2005, Bush nominated Roberts to the Supreme Court, initially to be an associate justice to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist died shortly afterward, however, before Roberts's Senate confirmation hearings had begun. Bush then withdrew Roberts's nomination and instead nominated him to become Chief Justice, choosing Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor.\n\n\nRoberts has authored the majority opinion in many important cases, including decisions relating to elections, federal agencies, presidential power, the Affordable Care Act, and race-based college admissions.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRoberts was born on January 27, 1955, in Buffalo, New York, to Rosemary (*née* Podrasky; 1929–2019) and John Glover \"Jack\" Roberts Sr. (1928–2008). His father had Irish and Welsh ancestry, and his mother was a descendant of Slovak immigrants from Szepes, Hungary.[14] He has an elder sister, Kathy, and two younger sisters: Peggy and Barbara.[15] Roberts spent his early childhood years in Hamburg, New York, where his father worked as an electrical engineer for the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at its factory in Lackawanna.[16]\n\n\nIn 1965, ten-year-old Roberts and his family moved to Long Beach, Indiana, where his father became manager of a new steel plant in nearby Burns Harbor.[17] Roberts attended La Lumiere School, an academically rigorous Catholic boarding school in La Porte, Indiana,[17][18] where he captained the school's football team. Roberts additionally participated in track and field and was a regional champion in wrestling. He also participated in choir and drama, and was a co-editor for the school newspaper The Torch.[17] He graduated as class valedictorian in 1973.[17]\n\n\nRoberts enrolled at Harvard University as a history major, entering as a sophomore with second-year standing based on his exemplary academic achievements in high school.[19] He lived in Straus Hall and Leverett House,[20] returning home each summer to earn money working at the steel plant his father managed.[17] Roberts was described as a serious student; one classmate recalled, \"John loved history, and said he'd be a history professor, but he also mentioned law\".[20] One of his first papers, \"Marxism and Bolshevism: Theory and Practice\", won Harvard's William Scott Ferguson Prize for the most outstanding essay by a sophomore history major,[19] and his senior year paper, \"The Utopian Conservative: A Study of Continuity and Change in the Thought of Daniel Webster\", won a Bowdoin Prize.[21] He graduated in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, and membership in Phi Beta Kappa.[22]\n\n\nRoberts had originally planned to pursue a Ph.D. in history and become a history professor but instead decided to attend Harvard Law School to pursue a legal career. Classmate David B. Wilkins described him as \"more conservative than the typical Harvard Law student in the 1970s\", though he had been well-liked among fellow students.[20] Roberts became managing editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1979 with a J.D., *magna cum laude*.[17][19]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Ronald Reagan greeting Roberts in the Oval Office while Roberts was serving as an associate White House Counsel (1983)\nAfter graduating from law school, Roberts was a law clerk for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1979 to 1980, then for Justice (later Chief Justice in 1986) William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1980 to 1981.[17]\n\n\nFollowing his clerkships, Roberts began working for the U.S. government in the Administration of President Ronald Reagan, first from 1981 to 1982 as a special assistant to U.S. Attorney General William French Smith, then from 1982 to 1986 as an associate with the White House Counsel.[17] He then entered private practice in Washington, D.C., as an associate at the law firm of Hogan & Hartson (now Hogan Lovells) and worked in the field of corporate law.[23]\n\n\nIn 1989, Roberts joined the Administration of president George H. W. Bush as Principal Deputy Solicitor General.[24] He served as the acting solicitor general for the case of *Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC* when the solicitor general, Ken Starr, had a conflict of interest. In the case, Roberts argued against policies of the FCC intended to increase minority ownership of broadcast licenses, arguing that the racial preferences were unconstitutional. Roberts's decision to argue that a federal agency's policy was unconstitutional surprised many lawyers within the Solicitor General's office.[25][26][27] In 1992, Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but no Senate vote was held, and Roberts's nomination expired at the end of the 102nd Congress.[10]\n\n\nFollowing Bush's defeat by Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election, Roberts left government service and returned to Hogan & Hartson as a partner. He became the head of the firm's appellate practice, and also became an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. During this time, Roberts argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court, prevailing in 25 of them.[28] He represented 19 states in *United States v.

Evans*, which was described in 2005 as \"the movement's most important legal victory\". Roberts's involvement with the case was minimal, as he later stated that he had been involved for less than ten hours in preparing oral arguments.[29] He also argued on behalf of the homeless, in a case which became one of Roberts's \"few appellate losses.\"[*further explanation needed*][30] He also represented, pro bono, a man who was sentenced to death for killing eight people in Florida.[31][32]\n\n\nDuring the late 1990s, while working for Hogan & Hartson, Roberts served as a member of the steering committee of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the conservative Federalist Society (although Roberts says he has never been a Federalist Society member).[33] In 2000, Roberts advised Jeb Bush, then governor of Florida, concerning Bush's actions in the Florida election recount during the presidential election.[34]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Roberts as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (c. 2003)\nOn May 9, 2001, President George W. Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to replace judge James L. Buckley, who had recently retired.[35] However, the Democratic Party had a majority in the Senate at the time and was in conflict with Bush over his judicial nominees. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy refused to give Roberts a hearing in the 107th Congress.[36] The GOP regained control of the Senate on January 7, 2003, and Bush resubmitted Roberts's nomination that day. Roberts was confirmed on May 8, 2003,[37] and received his commission on June 2, 2003.[38] During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13]\n\n\n\n### Fourth and Fifth amendments[edit]\n\n\n*Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority*, 386 F.3d 1148,[39] involved a 12-year-old girl who was arrested, searched, handcuffed, and fingerprinted after she violated a publicly advertised zero tolerance \"no eating\" policy in a Washington Metro station by eating a single french fry.[40] She was released to her mother three hours later.[41] She sued, alleging that an adult would have only received a citation for the same offense, while children must be detained until parents are notified. The D.C. Circuit unanimously affirmed the district court's dismissal of the girl's lawsuit, which was predicated on alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure) and Fifth Amendment (equal protection).\n\n\n\"No one is very happy about the events that led to this litigation,\" Roberts wrote. Because age discrimination is evaluated using a rational basis test, however, only weak state interests were required to justify the policy, and the panel concluded they were present. \"Because parents and guardians play an essential role in that rehabilitative process, it is reasonable for the District to seek to ensure their participation, and the method chosen—detention until the parent is notified and retrieves the child—certainly does that, in a way issuing a citation might not.\" The court concluded that the policy and detention were constitutional, noting that \"the question before us ... is not whether these policies were a bad idea, but whether they violated the Fourth and Fifth amendments to the Constitution,\" language reminiscent of Justice Potter Stewart's dissent in *Griswold v. Connecticut*. \"We are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine,\" Stewart had written; \"[w]e are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution. And that, I cannot do.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Military tribunals[edit]\n\n\nIn *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld*, Roberts was part of a unanimous circuit panel overturning the district court ruling and upholding military tribunals set up by the Bush Administration for trying terrorism suspects known as enemy combatants. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, writing for the court, ruled that Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a driver for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden,[42] could be tried by a military court because:\n\n\n\n1. the military commission had the approval of the United States Congress;\n2. the Third Geneva Convention is a treaty between nations and as such it does not confer individual rights and remedies enforceable in U.S. courts;\n3. even if the convention could be enforced in U.S. courts, it would not be of assistance to Hamdan at the time because, for a conflict such as the war against Al-Qaeda (considered by the court as a separate war from that against Afghanistan itself) that is not between two countries, it guarantees only a certain standard of judicial procedure without speaking to the jurisdiction in which the prisoner must be tried.\n\n\nThe court held open the possibility of judicial review of the results of the military commission after the current proceedings ended.[43] This decision was overturned on June 29, 2006, by the Supreme Court in a 5–3 decision, with Roberts not participating due to his prior participation in the case as a circuit judge.[44]\n\n\n\n### Environmental regulation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **require cleanup** to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. The specific problem is: **Reference format.** Please help improve this section if you can. *(May 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nRoberts wrote a dissent in *Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton*,[45] a case involving the protection of a rare California toad under the Endangered Species Act. When the court denied a rehearing en banc,(D.C. Cir. 2003)[45] Roberts dissented, arguing that the panel opinion was inconsistent with *United States v. Lopez* and *United States v. Morrison* in that it incorrectly focused on whether the *regulation* substantially affects interstate commerce rather than on whether the regulated *activity* does. In Roberts's view, the Commerce Clause of the Constitution did not permit the government to regulate activity affecting what he called \"a hapless toad\" that \"for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California.\" He said that reviewing the panel decision would allow the court \"alternative grounds for sustaining application of the Act that may be more consistent with Supreme Court precedent.\"[46]\n\n\n\n## Appointment to Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: John Roberts Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President George W. Bush announces Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice (2005).\nOn July 19, 2005, President Bush nominated Roberts to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill a vacancy to be created by the impending retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Roberts's nomination was the first Supreme Court nomination since Stephen Breyer in 1994.\n\n\nOn September 3, 2005, while Roberts's confirmation was pending before the Senate, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist died. Two days later, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination as O'Connor's successor and announced Roberts's new nomination as Chief Justice.[47]\n\n\n\n### Roberts's testimony on his jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Roberts said that he did not have a comprehensive jurisprudential philosophy, and he did \"not think beginning with an all-encompassing approach to constitutional interpretation is the best way to faithfully construe the document.\"[48][49] Roberts compared judges to baseball umpires: \"[I]t's my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.\"[50] Among the issues he discussed during the hearings were:\n\n\n\n#### Commerce Clause[edit]\n\n\nIn Senate hearings, Roberts has stated:\n\n\n\n\n> Starting with *McCulloch v. Maryland*, Chief Justice John Marshall gave a very broad and expansive reading to the powers of the Federal Government and explained generally that if the ends be legitimate, then any means chosen to achieve them are within the power of the Federal Government, and cases interpreting that, throughout the years, have come down. Certainly, by the time *Lopez* was decided, many of us had learned in law school that it was just sort of a formality to say that interstate commerce was affected and that cases weren't going to be thrown out that way. *Lopez* certainly breathed new life into the Commerce Clause.\n> I think it remains to be seen, in subsequent decisions, how rigorous a showing, and in many cases, it is just a showing. It's not a question of an abstract fact, does this affect interstate commerce or not, but has this body, the Congress, demonstrated the impact on interstate commerce that drove them to legislate? That's a very important factor. It wasn't present in *Lopez* at all. I think the members of Congress had heard the same thing I had heard in law school, that this is unimportant—and they hadn't gone through the process of establishing a record in that case.[49]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Federalism[edit]\n\n\nRoberts stated the following about federalism in a 1999 radio interview:\n\n\n\n\n> We have gotten to the point these days where we think the only way we can show we're serious about a problem is if we pass a federal law, whether it is the Violence Against Women Act or anything else. The fact of the matter is conditions are different in different states, and state laws can be more relevant is I think exactly the right term, more attuned to the different situations in New York, as opposed to Minnesota, and that is what the Federal system is based on.[51]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Reviewing Acts of Congress[edit]\n\n\nAt a Senate hearing, Roberts stated:\n\n\n\n\n> The Supreme Court has, throughout its history, on many occasions described the deference that is due to legislative judgments. Justice Holmes described assessing the constitutionality of an act of Congress as the gravest duty that the Supreme Court is called upon to perform. ... It's a principle that is easily stated and needs to be observed in practice, as well as in theory.\n> Now, the Court, of course, has the obligation, and has been recognized since *Marbury v. Madison*, to assess the constitutionality of acts of Congress, and when those acts are challenged, it is the obligation of the Court to say what the law is. The determination of when deference to legislative policy judgments goes too far and becomes abdication of the judicial responsibility, and when scrutiny of those judgments goes too far on the part of the judges and becomes what I think is properly called judicial activism, that is certainly the central dilemma of having an unelected, as you describe it correctly, undemocratic judiciary in a democratic republic.[49]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### *Stare decisis*[edit]\n\n\nOn the subject of *stare decisis*, referring to *Brown v. Board of Education*, the decision overturning school segregation, Roberts said that \"the Court in that case, of course, overruled a prior decision. I don't think that constitutes judicial activism because obviously if the decision is wrong, it should be overruled. That's not activism. That's applying the law correctly.\"[52]\n\n\n\n#### *Roe v. Wade*[edit]\n\n\nWhile working as a lawyer for the Reagan Administration, Roberts wrote legal memos defending administration policies on abortion.[53] At his nomination hearing Roberts testified that the legal memos represented the views of the administration he was representing at the time and not necessarily his own.[54] \"Senator, I was a staff lawyer; I didn't have a position,\" Roberts said.[54] As a lawyer in the George H. W. Bush Administration, Roberts signed a legal brief urging the court to overturn *Roe v. Wade*.[55]\n\n\nIn private meetings with senators before his confirmation, Roberts testified that *Roe* was settled law, but added that it was subject to the legal principle of *stare decisis,*[56] meaning that while the Court must give some weight to the precedent, it was not legally bound to uphold it.\n\n\nIn his Senate testimony, Roberts said that, while sitting on the Appellate Court, he had an obligation to respect precedents established by the Supreme Court, including the right to an abortion. He stated: \"*Roe v. Wade* is the settled law of the land. ... There is nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying that precedent, as well as *Casey*.\" Following the traditional reluctance of nominees to indicate which way they might vote on an issue likely to come before the Supreme Court, he did not explicitly say whether he would vote to overturn either.[48] However, Jeffrey Rosen adds, \"I wouldn't bet on Chief Justice Roberts's siding unequivocally with the anti-*Roe* forces.\"[57]\n\n\n\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOn September 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Roberts's nomination by a vote of 13–5, with Senators Ted Kennedy, Richard Durbin, Charles Schumer, Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein voting against. Roberts was confirmed by the full Senate on September 29 by a margin of 78–22.[58] All Republicans and the one Independent voted for Roberts; the Democrats split evenly, 22–22. Roberts was confirmed by what was, historically, a narrow margin for a Supreme Court justice.[59] However, all subsequent confirmation votes have been even more narrow.[60][61][62][63]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roberts Court\n\n![](image)Roberts is sworn in as Chief Justice by Justice John Paul Stevens in the East Room of the White House as President Bush and Roberts's wife Jane look on, September 29, 2005.\nRoberts took the Constitutional oath of office, administered by Associate Justice John Paul Stevens at the White House, on September 29, 2005. On October 3, he took the judicial oath provided for by the Judiciary Act of 1789 at the United States Supreme Court building.\n\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said that Roberts \"pretty much run[s] the show the same way\" as Rehnquist, albeit \"let[ting] people go on a little longer at conference ... but [he'll] get over that.\"[64] Roberts has been portrayed as a consistent advocate for conservative principles by analysts such as Jeffrey Toobin.[65] Garrett Epps has described Roberts's prose as \"crystalline, vivid, and often humorous\".[66]\n\n\nSeventh Circuit judge Diane Sykes, surveying Roberts's first term on the Court, concluded that his jurisprudence \"appears to be strongly rooted in the discipline of traditional legal method, evincing a fidelity to text, structure, history, and the constitutional hierarchy. He exhibits the restraint that flows from the careful application of established decisional rules and the practice of reasoning from the case law. He appears to place great stock in the process-oriented tools and doctrinal rules that guard against the aggregation of judicial power and keep judicial discretion in check: jurisdictional limits, structural federalism, textualism, and the procedural rules that govern the scope of judicial review.\"[67] Roberts has been said to operate under an approach of judicial minimalism in his decisions,[68] having stated, \"[i]f it is not necessary to decide more to a case, then in my view it is necessary not to decide more to a case.\"[69] His decision making and leadership demonstrates an intent to preserve the Court's power and legitimacy while dually maintaining judicial independence.[70] Roberts was ranked 50th in the 2016 Forbes ranking of \"The World's Most Powerful People.\"[71]\n\n\nIn November 2018, the Associated Press approached Roberts for comment after President Donald Trump described a jurist who ruled against his asylum policy as an \"Obama judge\". In response, Roberts asserted that \"[w]e do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\" His remarks were widely interpreted as a rebuke of President Trump's comments.[72][73][74] As Chief Justice, Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, which began on January 16 and ended on February 5, 2020.[75] Roberts did not, however, preside over Trump's second impeachment trial, believing that the Constitution only requires that the chief justice preside in the trial of the sitting president and not of a former president.[76]\n\n\nAlthough Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, Roberts is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when *Bush v. Gore* is compared to Roberts's vote for the ACA: his vote in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) caused the press to contrast his Court with the Rehnquist Court.[77] Roberts's judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin Scalia's and Clarence Thomas's.[78][79][77] He wishes more consensus from the Court.[78] At the beginning of his tenure, Roberts's voting pattern closely aligned with Samuel Alito's.[80] However, in recent years, his voting pattern has closely resembled Brett Kavanaugh's, who is generally seen as far more moderate than Alito.[81]\n\n\nAfter the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, several commentators wrote that Roberts was no longer the leading justice. As the five other conservative justices could outvote the rest, he supposedly could no longer preside over a moderately conservative course while respecting precedent.[82][83] This view was espoused again after the 2022 *Dobbs* decision, which overturned rulings from 1973 and 1992.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in *Gonzales v. Oregon*, which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.\n\n\nOn March 6, 2006, Roberts wrote the unanimous decision in *Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights* that colleges accepting federal money must allow military recruiters on campus, despite university objections to the Clinton Administration-initiated \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy.\n\n\n\n### Campaign finance[edit]\n\n\nFollowing his concurrence in *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010), Roberts wrote the plurality opinion in another landmark campaign finance case called *McCutcheon v. FEC* (2014). In *McCutcheon* the Court ruled that \"aggregate limits\" on the combined amount a donor could give to various federal candidates or party committees violated the First Amendment.[66][86]\n\n\n\n### Fourth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nRoberts wrote his first dissent in *Georgia v. Randolph* (2006). The majority's decision prohibited police from searching a home if both occupants are present but one objected and the other consented. Roberts criticized the majority opinion as inconsistent with prior case law and for partly basing its reasoning on its perception of social custom. He said the social expectation test was flawed because the Fourth Amendment protects a legitimate expectation of privacy, not social expectations.[87]\n\n\nIn *Utah v. Strieff* (2016), Roberts joined the majority in ruling (5–3) that a person with an outstanding warrant may be arrested and searched, and that any evidence discovered based on that search is admissible in court; the majority opinion held that this remains true even when police act unlawfully by stopping a person without reasonable suspicion, before learning of the existence of the outstanding warrant.[88]\n\n\nIn *Carpenter v. United States*, a landmark decision involving privacy of cellular phone data, Roberts wrote the majority opinion in a 5–4 ruling that searches of cellular phone data generally require a warrant.[89]\n\n\n\n### Notice and opportunity to be heard[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Roberts has often sided with Scalia and Thomas, he also provided a crucial vote against their mutual position in *Jones v. Flowers*, siding with liberal justices of the court in ruling that, before a home is seized and sold in a tax-forfeiture sale, due diligence must be demonstrated and proper notification needs to be sent to the owners. Dissenting justices were Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, while Roberts's opinion was joined by David Souter, Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Samuel Alito did not participate.\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn *Gonzales v. Carhart* (2007), Roberts voted with the majority to uphold the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a five-justice majority, distinguished *Stenberg v. Carhart*, and concluded that the Court's previous decision in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* did not prevent Congress from banning the procedure. The decision left the door open for future as-applied challenges, and did not address the broader question of whether Congress had the authority to pass the law.[90] Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Casey* should be reversed; Roberts declined to join that opinion.\n\n\nIn 2018, Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined four more liberal justices in declining to hear a case brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood,[91] thereby letting stand lower court rulings in favor of Planned Parenthood.[92] Roberts also joined with liberal justices in 5–4 decisions temporarily blocking a Louisiana abortion restriction (2019)[93] and later striking down that law (*June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo* (2020)).[94][95] The law at issue in *June* was similar to one the court struck down in *Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt* (2016), which Roberts had voted to uphold;[96][97] in his *June* opinion, Roberts wrote that while he believed *Whole Woman's Health* was wrongly decided he was joining the majority in *June* out of respect for *stare decisis*.[96] It was the first time in his 15 years on the Supreme Court that Roberts had cast a vote to invalidate a law that regulated abortion.[98] In September 2021, the Supreme Court declined an emergency petition to temporarily block enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy except to save the mother's life. In a 5–4 vote, Roberts joined Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in the minority.[99]\nIn 2022, Roberts declined to join the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which overturned *Roe v. Wade*. Roberts wrote a concurring opinion supporting only the decision to uphold the Mississippi abortion statute, stating that the right to an abortion should \"extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further\". Roberts also declined to join the dissenting opinion of Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nOn November 4, 2016, Roberts was the deciding vote in a 5–3 decision to stay an execution.[100] On February 7, 2019, Roberts was part of the majority in a 5–4 decision rejecting a Muslim inmate's request to delay execution in order to have an imam present with him during the execution.[101] Also, in February 2019, Roberts sided with Justice Kavanaugh and the court's four liberal justices in a 6–3 decision to block the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[102][103]\n\n\n\n### Affirmative action[edit]\n\n\nRoberts opposes the use of race in assigning students to particular schools, including for purposes such as maintaining integrated schools.[104] He sees such plans as discrimination in violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and *Brown v. Board of Education*.[104][105] In *Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1*, the Court considered two voluntarily adopted school district plans that relied on race to determine which schools certain children may attend. The Court had held in *Brown* that \"racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional,\"[106] and later, that \"racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, ... are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests,\"[107] and that this \"[n]arrow tailoring ... require[s] serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.\"[108] Roberts cited these cases in writing for the *Parents Involved* majority, concluding that the school districts had \"failed to show that they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals.\"[109] In a section of the opinion joined by four other justices, Roberts added that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Roberts in 2021\nOn June 29, 2023, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* and *Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina*, which held that race-based affirmative action in both public and private universities violates the Equal Protection Clause.[110]\n\n\n\n### Free speech[edit]\n\n\nRoberts authored the 2007 student free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, ruling that a student in a public school-sponsored activity does not have the right to advocate drug use on the basis that the right to free speech does not invariably prevent the exercise of school discipline.[111]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2010, in *United States v. Stevens*, the Supreme Court struck down an animal cruelty law. Roberts, writing for an 8–1 majority, found that a federal statute criminalizing the commercial production, sale, or possession of depictions of cruelty to animals was an unconstitutional abridgment of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Court held that the statute was substantially overbroad; for example, it could allow prosecutions for selling photos of out-of-season hunting.[112]\n\n\n\n### Health care reform[edit]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2012, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, which upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by a 5–4 vote. The Court indicated that although the \"individual mandate\" component of the Act could not be upheld under the Commerce Clause, the mandate could be construed as a tax and was therefore ruled to be valid under Congress's authority to \"lay and collect taxes.\"[113][114] The Court overturned a portion of the law related to the withholding of funds from states that did not comply with the expansion of Medicaid; Roberts wrote that \"Congress is not free ... to penalize states that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.\"[114]\nSources within the Supreme Court state that Roberts switched his vote regarding the individual mandate sometime after an initial vote[115][116] and that Roberts largely wrote both the majority and minority opinions.[117] This extremely unusual circumstance has also been used to explain why the minority opinion was also unsigned, itself a rare phenomenon from the Supreme Court.[117]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Hollingsworth v. Perry* (2013), Roberts wrote the 5–4 majority opinion holding that Petitioners, appealing a lower court ruling that California's Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, lacked standing to sue, with the result that same-sex marriages resumed in California.[118] Roberts dissented in *United States v. Windsor* in which the 5-4 majority ruled that key parts of the Defense of Marriage Act were unconstitutional.[119] The case stated the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages that have been approved by certain states. He dissented in the *Obergefell v. Hodges* case in which Kennedy wrote for the majority, again 5–4, that same-sex couples had a right to marry.[120] In *Pavan v. Smith*, the Supreme Court \"summarily overruled\" the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision that the state did not have to list same-sex spouses on birth certificates; Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch dissented, but Roberts joined the majority.[121] In the cases of *Bostock v. Clayton County, Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda,* and *R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission* (2020), heard together, Roberts ruled with the 6–3 majority deciding that businesses cannot discriminate against LGBT people in matters of employment.[122] In October 2020, Roberts joined the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to reject an appeal from Kim Davis, who refused to provide marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[123]\n\n\nIn *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia* (2021), Roberts joined the justices in a unanimous decision in favor of a Catholic adoption agency which had been denied a contract by the City of Philadelphia for its policy refusing to adopt to same-sex couples; he was also part of the majority that declined to reconsider or overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[124] Also in 2021, he was one of the six justices who declined to hear an appeal by a Washington State florist who refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage; because four votes are required to hear a case, the lower court judgments against the florist remain in place.[125][126][127] In November 2021, Roberts voted with the majority of justices in a 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[128] Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented; the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the transgender patient.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Voting Rights Act[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may relate to a different subject or has undue weight on an aspect of the subject.** Please help relocate relevant information and remove irrelevant ones. *(August 2022)*\n |\n\n\nDuring his tenure as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roberts has struck down voting rights protections provided by the Voting Rights Act.[131][132][133] In *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013), Roberts struck down requirements that states and localities with a history of racially motivated voter suppression obtain federal preclearance before implementing any changes to voting laws. Research shows that preclearance had led to increases in minority congressional representation and minority turnout.[134][135] Five years after the ruling, nearly 1,000 U.S. polling places had closed, many of them in predominantly African-American counties. There were also cuts to early voting, purges of voter rolls and imposition of strict voter ID laws.[136][137] A 2020 study found that jurisdictions that had previously been covered by preclearance substantially increased their voter registration purges after the *Shelby* decision.[138] Virtually all restrictions on voting subsequent to the ruling were enacted by Republicans.[139]\n\n\nIn 2023, Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined the liberals in Allen v. Milligan, a 5-4 decision holding that Alabama's congressional redistricting plan violated Section 2 of the VRA. Writing for the majority, Roberts concluded that Alabama must draw an additional majority-minority district, and determined that Section 2 of the Act is constitutional in the redistricting context. Writing for himself and the three liberal justices, Roberts also wrote that \"[t]he contention that mapmakers must be entirely 'blind' to race has no footing in our §2 case law.\"[140]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(May 2023)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2007, Roberts received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, where he delivered a commencement address that same year.[141]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRoberts and his wife, Jane Sullivan, were married on July 27, 1996.[142] Sullivan is a lawyer who became a prominent legal recruiter at the firms of Major, Lindsey & Africa and Mlegal.[143] Along with Clarence Thomas, she is on the board of trustees at her alma mater, the College of the Holy Cross. The couple lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland, an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C., and they have two adopted children: John \"Jack\" and Josephine \"Josie\".[144][17]\n\n\nRoberts is one of 15 Catholic justices—out of 115 justices total—in the history of the Supreme Court.[145] Of those fifteen justices, six (Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett) are currently serving.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Roberts had a seizure at his vacation home in St. George, Maine[146][147]\nand stayed overnight at a hospital in Rockport, Maine;[148]\ndoctors found no identifiable cause.[146][147][149][150]\nRoberts had suffered a similar seizure in 1993[146][147][149]\nbut an official Supreme Court statement said that a neurological evaluation \"revealed no cause for concern.\" Federal judges are not required by law to release information about their health.[146]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2020, Roberts fell at a Maryland country club; his forehead required sutures and he stayed overnight in the hospital for observation. Doctors ruled out a seizure and believed dehydration had made Roberts light-headed.[151]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a disclosure Roberts submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee prior to his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Roberts's net worth was more than $6 million, including $1.6 million in stocks.[*citation needed*] In joining the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2003, he took a pay cut from $1 million a year to $164,000; as Chief Justice his salary is $286,700 as of 2022.[152]\n\n\nIn 2010, Roberts sold his stock in Pfizer because he was set to hear two pending cases involving the company.[153]\n\n\n\n## Published works[edit]\n\n\n* Roberts, John (1978). \"Developments in the Law: Zoning – III.

He was nominated by President George H. W. Bush to succeed Thurgood Marshall and has served since 1991. After Marshall, Thomas is the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court and has been its longest-serving member since Anthony Kennedy's retirement in 2018. Since Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, he is also the Court's oldest member.\n\n\nThomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor Gullah community near Savannah. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a priest in the Catholic Church but was frustrated over the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a clergyman to attend the College of the Holy Cross and, later Yale Law School, where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, notably Thomas Sowell. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an assistant attorney general in Missouri and later entered private practice there. He became a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John Danforth in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education in 1981. President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the next year.\n\n\nPresident George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and the EEOC.[5] Hill alleged that Thomas made multiple sexual and romantic overtures to her despite her repeatedly telling him to stop. Thomas and his supporters denied the allegation, asserting that Hill and her political supporters had fabricated the accusation to prevent the appointment of a black conservative. The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin in a century.[6]\n\n\nSince the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana). He is widely considered the Court's most conservative member.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nThomas was born on June 23, 1948, in his parents' wooden shack in Pin Point, Georgia.[11][12] Pin Point was a small community near Savannah founded by freedmen in the 1880s.[13] He was the second of three children of M. C. Thomas, a farm worker, and Leola Williams,[11] Myers Anderson's illegitimate daughter who, after her mother's death, had been sent from Liberty County, Georgia to live with an aunt in Pin Point.[14][15][16] His older sister Emma was born in 1946, his younger brother Myers in 1949.[17]\n\n\nThe family were descendants of enslaved people and spoke Gullah as a first language.[18] Thomas's earliest known ancestors were slaves named Sandy and Peggy, who were born in the late 18th century and owned by wealthy planter Josiah Wilson of Liberty County.[19]\n\n\n\nWhen Leola was pregnant with Thomas's older sister, she was expelled from her Baptist church and dropped out of high school after the 10th grade. Her father ordered her to marry M. C. in January 1947. They divorced in 1951.[17] M.C. moved to Savannah and later to Pennsylvania, visiting his children only once after the divorce. Custody of the children was awarded to Leola's aunt. Leola went to work as a maid in Savannah during the week, returning to Pin Point on the weekends. When the aunt's house burnt down in 1955, Leola took the boys to live with her in the room she rented in a tenement with an outdoor toilet in Savannah, leaving her daughter with the aunt in Pin Point.[20][21][22] Finding herself unable to raise two little boys by herself,[23] and unable to get public assistance because her father was wealthy,[22] she asked her father for help. He initially refused but agreed after his wife threatened to throw him out.[24][23]\n\n![](image)Thomas's 1967 high school yearbook pictureThomas and his brother went to live with Anderson and his wife in 1955 and experienced amenities such as indoor plumbing and regular meals for the first time.[25] Despite having little formal education, Anderson had built a successful business delivering coal, oil, and ice.[24] He converted to Catholicism, and sent Thomas to be educated at a series of segregated Catholic schools. Thomas attended the predominantly black St. Pius X High School in Chatham County[26] for two years before transferring to St. John Vianney's Minor Seminary on the Isle of Hope, where he was the segregated boarding school's first black student.[27][28] Though he experienced hazing, he performed well academically.[15] He spent many hours at the Carnegie Library, the only library for blacks in Savannah before libraries were desegregated in 1961.[29][30][32]\n\n\nWhen racial unrest led to widespread protest and marches in Savannah from 1960 to 1963, Anderson used his wealth to bail out demonstrators and took his grandchildren to meetings promoted by the NAACP.[33]\n\n\nWhen Thomas was ten years old, Anderson began putting his grandsons to work during the summers, helping him build a house on a plot of farmland he owned, building fences, and doing farm work.[34] He believed in hard work and self-reliance,[35] never showed his grandsons affection,[34] beat them frequently according to Leola, and impressed the importance of a good education on them.[36] Anderson taught Thomas that \"all of our rights as human beings came from God, not man\", and that racial segregation was a violation of divine law.[37]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nDuring his freshman year from 1967 to 1968, Thomas attended Conception Seminary College, a Catholic seminary in Missouri, with the intent to become a priest; no one in Thomas's family had attended college before.[38][27] After Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, he overheard a student say, \"Good. I hope the S.O.B. dies\" and \"[t]hat's what they should do to all the niggers\".[39][40][41] Thomas thought the church did not do enough to combat racism and resolved to abandon the priesthood.[42][39] He left the seminary at the end of the semester.[39]\n\n\nAt a nun's suggestion, Thomas enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross, an elite Catholic college in Massachusetts, as a sophomore transfer student on a full academic scholarship.[43][44] He was one of the college's first black students, being one of 20 recruited by President John E. Brooks in 1968 in a group that also included future attorney Ted Wells, running back Eddie Jenkins, Jr., and novelist Edward P. Jones.[45] Without financial support from his grandfather, Thomas defrayed his expenses by working as a waiter and dishwasher in the college's dining hall.[46][47] He later recalled, \"I was 19. My only hope was Holy Cross College\".[48]\n\n\n\nProfessors at Holy Cross remembered Thomas as a determined, diligent student. He kept to a strict routine of studying alone and stayed back during holidays to continue working.[49] Thomas C. Lawler, an English professor at Holy Cross,[50] recalled him as having \"never talked very much in class. He was the kind of person you really might not notice\".[51] By contrast, he was outspoken at BSU meetings, distinguishing himself as a contrarian who often feuded with Ted Wells. Future NFL running back Ed Jenkins, a BSU member, said Thomas \"could turn on a dime and reduce you to intellectual rubble\".[52][53] Edward P. Jones, who lived across from Thomas as a sophomore, reflected that \"there was a fierce determination I sensed from him [Thomas], that he was going to get as much as he could and get as far, ultimately, as he could\".[54] \n\n![](image)Dinand Library at the College of the Holy Cross, where Thomas studied for college[55]\nThomas became a vocal student activist as an undergraduate. He became acquainted with Black separatism, the Black Muslim Movement, the Black power movement, helped draft the Black Student Union (BSU), and displayed a poster of Malcolm X in his dormitory room.[56] When some black students were disproportionately punished in comparison with white students for the same violation, he suggested a walkout in protest. The BSU adopted his idea, and Thomas, along with 60 other black students, departed campus.[57][58] Some of the priests negotiated with the protesting black students to reenter the school.[27] When administrators granted amnesty to all protesters, Thomas returned to the college, later also to attend anti-war marches. In April 1970, he participated in the violent 1970 Harvard Square riots.[59] He has credited his protests for his turn toward conservatism and subsequent disillusionment with leftist movements.[60][61][54]\n\n\nHaving struggled with English as a native speaker of Gullah, Thomas chose to major in English literature.[46][62] He became a member of Alpha Sigma Nu, the Jesuit honor society, and the Purple Key Society, of which he was the only black member.[63] The college's focus on a liberal arts education introduced him to the works of black intellectuals such as Richard Wright, whose literary works Thomas sympathized with.[64] He also admired Malcolm X and recalled reading *The Autobiography of Malcolm X* to the point of wearing down the pages of his copy.[65]\n\n\nThomas graduated on June 4, 1971, with a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*,[63] ranked ninth in his class.[66][67] In his junior year, he was named a Fenwick Scholar, one of the highest honors at Holy Cross; in his senior year, he decided to pursue a career in law. Due to his academic achievements, he applied to and was accepted at Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[66][68] In 1971, Thomas matriculated at Yale Law School as one of 12 black students.[69] Yale offered him the best financial aid package, and he was attracted to the civil rights activism of some of its faculty members.[70][71] Finding it difficult to keep up with the school's expectations, he struggled to connect with other students who came from upper-class backgrounds. He enrolled in the most difficult courses and became a student of property law scholar Quintin Johnstone, who became his favorite professor.[72][73] Johnstone remembered Thomas as having \"performed very well\" and Dean Guido Calabresi described him and fellow student Hillary Clinton as \"both excellent students [who] had the same kind of reputation\".[74] He received several student deferments from the military draft with the classification 1-A after graduation, but failed the medical exam due to the curvature of his spine.[75]\n\n\nThomas obtained his Juris Doctor on May 20, 1974.[76] After graduation, he sought to enter private practice as a corporate lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia.[77] He has said that the law firms he applied to did not take his degree seriously, assuming he obtained it because of affirmative action.[78] According to Thomas, the law firms also \"asked pointed questions, unsubtly suggesting that they doubted I was as smart as my grades indicated\".[79] In his 2007 memoir, he wrote: \"I peeled a fifteen-cent sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of my law degree to remind myself of the mistake I'd made by going to Yale. I never did change my mind about its value.\"[80]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas is sworn in as Assistant Secretary of Education for the Office for Civil Rights in 1981\nWith no job offers from major law firms, Thomas took a position as an associate with Missouri attorney general John Danforth, who offered him the prospect of practicing what he liked.[81] Thomas moved to Saint Louis to study for the Missouri bar, and was admitted on September 13, 1974.[82] He remained financially destitute even after leaving Yale, trying unsuccessfully on one occasion to make money by selling his blood at a blood bank, and hoped that by working for Danforth he might later acquire a job in private practice.[83][84]\n\n\nFrom 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an assistant attorney general of Missouri—the only African-American member of Danforth's staff. He worked first in the office's criminal appeals division and later in the revenue and taxation division. Thomas conducted lawsuits independently, gaining a reputation as a fair but controversial prosecutor.[85] Years later, after he joined the Supreme Court, Thomas recalled his position in Missouri as \"the best job I've ever had\".[86]\n\n\n\nWhen Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney in Monsanto's legal department in Saint Louis. He found the job unsatisfying, so left to rejoin Danforth in Washington, D.C., as a legislative assistant.[87] From 1979 to 1981, he handled energy issues for the Senate Commerce Committee. Thomas soon drew the attention of officials in the newly elected Reagan Administration as a Black conservative.[88] Pendleton James, Reagan's personnel director, offered Thomas the position of assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Education. Initially reluctant, Thomas agreed after Danforth and others pressed him to take the post.[89]\n\n![](image)Thomas in his office on May 18, 1981President Ronald Reagan nominated Thomas as assistant secretary of education for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on May 1, 1981.[90][91] The Senate received the nomination on May 28, 1981, and Thomas was quickly confirmed before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on June 19, succeeding Cynthia Brown at the age of 32.[92][93] He held the position for a brief period before James offered him a new position as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a promotion that Thomas believed, as with his position in the OCR, was because of his race.[94] After James consulted the President, Thomas hesitantly took up the chair with Reagan's approval.[95]\n\n\nThomas chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 1982 to 1990. As chairman, he was tasked with enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in an agency that had been mutually resented by both Democrats and Republicans. He announced a reorganization of the EEOC and upgraded its record-keeping under an uncompromising leadership that eschewed racial quotas.[94][96] Concerned by the EEOC's limited statutory authority, Thomas sought to impose criminal penalties for employers who practiced employment discrimination, moving to shift funding towards agency investigators. Though he had been critical of affirmative action, Thomas also opposed the Reagan Administration's agenda to remove affirmative action policies, believing it to be a detraction from socioeconomic issues.[97][98]\n\n\nDuring Thomas's tenure, settlement award amounts to victims of discrimination tripled, while the number of suits filed decreased. The EEOC's lack of the use of goals and timetables drew criticism from civil rights advocates, who lobbied representatives to review the EEOC's practices; Thomas testified before Congress more than 50 times. Near the end of his final term, the EEOC came under congressional scrutiny for the mishandling of age-discrimination cases.[99][100]\n\n\n\n## District of Columbia Court of Appeals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with President Ronald Reagan in 1986, while serving as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity CommissionIn early 1989, President George H. W. Bush expressed interest in nominating Thomas to a federal judgeship. Thomas, now at age 41, initially rejected the position, believing himself unready to make a lifetime commitment to being a judge. White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu advocated for his nomination, and Judge Laurence Silberman advised Thomas to accept an appointment.[101] Anticipating Thomas's nomination, a liberal coalition—including the Alliance for Justice and the National Organization for Women (NOW)—emerged to oppose his candidacy.[102]\n\n\nOn October 30, 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[103][104] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65]\n\n\nIn February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[102] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[105]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Thomas was nominated to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall (*pictured*), who announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, due to ill health. Marshall would later give advice to Thomas after the confirmation.[106][107]\nWhen Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\nLiberal interest groups sought to challenge Thomas's nomination by paralleling the same strategy used against Robert Bork's confirmation.[112] Abortion-rights groups, including the National Abortion Rights Action League and the NOW, were concerned that Thomas would be among those to overrule *Roe v. Wade*.[113] Republican officials in turn emphasized his personal history and gathered support from African American interest groups, including the NAACP.[114] Other civil rights organizations, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Urban League, were convinced not to oppose Thomas, believing that he was Bush's last black nominee. On July 31, 1991, the board of directors of the NAACP voted against endorsing Thomas, announcing their opposition to his confirmation the same day.[115]\n\n\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) appraised Thomas as \"qualified\" for the Supreme Court.[116][a] The Bush Administration anticipated that the organization would rate Thomas more poorly than it thought he deserved, so pressured the ABA for at least the mid-level qualified rating while simultaneously discrediting it as partisan.[119] The ABA did rate Thomas as qualified, although with one of the lowest levels of support for a Supreme Court nominee.[120][121] It gave its highest rankings to Thomas in integrity and judicial temperament, and a mid-grade in professional competence.[122]\n\n\nOn September 10, 1991, formal confirmation hearings began before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[123][124] Thomas testified for 25 hours, the second-longest of any Supreme Court nominee.[125] He was reticent when answering senators' questions, recalling what had happened to Robert Bork when Bork expounded on his judicial philosophy during his confirmation hearings four years earlier.[126] As many of his earlier writings frequently referenced natural law, his views on the legal theory became a focus of the hearings. Thomas said he regarded natural law as a \"philosophical background\" to the Constitution.[127][128][129]\n\n\nNinety witnesses testified in favor of or against Thomas.[130] On September 27, 1991, the Judiciary Committee voted 13–1 to send his nomination to the full Senate without recommendation. A motion earlier in the day to give the nomination a favorable recommendation had failed, 7–7,[131] forwarding it to a full Senate vote.[130][132]\n\n\n\n### Anita Hill accusations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Clarence Thomas Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Anita Hill Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 1October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 2October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the committee's confirmation hearings, the Senate was debating whether to give final approval to Thomas's nomination. An FBI interview with Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas at the EEOC, was soon leaked to the press and allegations of sexual harassment followed.[133][134] As a result, on October 8, the final vote was postponed, and the confirmation hearings were reopened. It was only the third time in the Senate's history that such an action was taken and the first since 1925, when Justice Harlan F. Stone's nomination was recommitted to the Judiciary Committee.[132]\n\n\n\nHill was raised in Oklahoma and, like Thomas, graduated from Yale Law School.[135] She told James Brudney, a fellow Yale alumnus, about alleged sexual advances Thomas had made, telling him that she also did not wish to testify or make the allegations public to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hill requested to the staff of Senator Joe Biden, the chair of the committee, that her allegations be made anonymously if she chose to testify and that Thomas not be informed of them, which Biden declined. Hill then notified Democratic staffers the day after the hearings had ended that she wished to make her allegations known to the committee.[136]\n\n![](image)Hill testifying during the second confirmation hearingsHill's allegations were corroborated by Susan Hoerchner, a judge in California, who also wished to remain anonymous.[137][138] Hoerchner called Harriet Grant, a chief counsel to Biden, to inform him of her allegations. She recalled that Thomas told Hill in an elevator at the EEOC that he would ruin her career if she spoke about his behavior.[139] When Grant told Hill and Hoerchner that the FBI would be involved, they were reluctant to be investigated. Hill declined to speak with the FBI, as she feared it would misconstrue her words, so instead arranged to deliver a written statement. The statement described how Thomas pressured her to date him, and included descriptions of him speaking about sexual interests involving pornographic films.[140] Hill also alleged that Thomas spoke of sex at work despite her being uncomfortable with the subject, adding, \"I sensed that my discomfort with his discussions only urged him on, as though my reaction of feeling ill at ease and vulnerable was what he wanted\".[141] The FBI report of its investigation was not made public. The White House announced that the FBI had found the allegations \"without foundation\". Congressional officials who had seen the report told the *New York Times* that \"the bureau could not draw any conclusion because of the 'he said, she said' nature of the subject\".[142][143] The use of the FBI was contentious in the Judiciary Committee because it answers to the president, who was sponsoring Thomas. Biden used the FBI instead of the committee's investigators to avoid the appearance of partisanship.[144]\n\n\n#### Second hearing[edit]\n\n\nThe hearings reconvened on October 11, 1991. Thomas was scheduled to go first, followed by a questioning of Hill by the committee.[145] He denied that he had said or done anything to Hill \"that could have been mistaken for sexual harassment\" and said that he would not answer any questions about his private life so as not to \"provide the rope for my own lynching\".[146]\n\n\nHill then testified for seven hours that ten years earlier Thomas had subjected her to comments of a sexual nature, calling it \"behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court\".[147][148][149] Her testimony included graphic details, and some senators questioned her aggressively.[150][151] Hill accused Thomas of making two sexually offensive remarks to her: comparing his penis to that of Long Dong Silver, a black porn star, and saying he had discovered a pubic hair on his Coca-Cola can.[152][153]\n\n\n\n> \n> And from my standpoint as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, [this proceeding] is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks that in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to the old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the United States Senate rather than hung from a tree.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThomas, testifying as part of his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee[154]\n\nIn the evening, Thomas was recalled before the committee. He again denied the allegations and was prompted by Senator Orrin Hatch's questioning to launch a speech that criticized the proceeding as a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks\".[155] The speech resonated with Southern blacks and stimulated Thomas's supporters,[156] with public opinion shifting in his favor afterward.[157][158]\n\n\nHill was the only person to publicly testify that Thomas had sexually harassed her.[159] Angela Wright, who worked under Thomas at the EEOC and had alleged that \"Thomas had continually pressured her to date him and made sexual comments about women's bodies\",[160][161] and a corroborating witness she had named were not called to testify.[160] Their written depositions were entered into the congressional records unrebutted.[162][163][164] Sukari Hardnett, a former Thomas assistant, wrote to the Senate committee that although Thomas had not harassed her, \"If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female.\"[165]\n\n\nIn addition to Hill and Thomas, the committee heard from several other witnesses over October 11–13.[132] A former colleague, Nancy Altman, who shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education, testified that she heard virtually everything Thomas said over the course of two years and never heard a sexist or offensive comment from him. Altman did not find it credible that Thomas could have engaged in the conduct Hill alleged without any of the dozens of women he worked with noticing it.[166] Senator Alan K. Simpson, a member of the committee, asked why Hill met, dined with, and spoke by phone with Thomas on various occasions after they no longer worked together.[167][168] After the confirmation hearings ended, the event became a focus of divided scholarship, with authors who revisited it reaching varying conclusions.[158]\n\n\n\n### Senate votes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas was sworn in as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court by Justice Byron White on October 23, 1991. His wife, Virginia Thomas, looks on in the foreground.On October 15, 1991, the Senate voted to confirm Thomas as an associate justice, 52–48.[132] Thomas received the votes of 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats, while 46 Democrats and two Republicans voted to reject his nomination.[169]\n\n\nThe 99 days during which Thomas's nomination was pending in the Senate was the second-longest of the 16 nominees receiving a final vote since 1975, second only to Bork's 108 days.[132] The vote to confirm Thomas was the narrowest margin for approval in more than 100 years.[170]\n\n\nThomas received his commission on October 23 and took the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, becoming the Court's 106th justice.[171][b] He was sworn in by Justice Byron White in a ceremony initially scheduled for October 21, which was postponed because of the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist's wife, Natalie.[173][174][175] His first set of law clerks included future judges Gregory Katsas and Gregory Maggs and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau.[176][177]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Vote to confirm the Thomas nomination\n |\n| --- |\n| October 15, 1991\n | Party\n | Total votes\n |\n| Democratic | Republican |\n| **Yea** | **11** | **41** | **52** |\n| Nay\n | 46\n | 02\n | 48\n |\n| **Result: Confirmed** |\n\n\n## Supreme Court of the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait, 2004\nAfter joining the Supreme Court, Thomas emerged as a member of the Court's conservative wing.[178] He aligned himself with Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom he shared an originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, and sided with him in 92 percent of cases during his first 13 years on the bench.[c] Over time, Thomas and Scalia's jurisprudence separated,[d] with Thomas favoring stronger emphasis on the Constitution's original understanding and demonstrating greater willingness to overrule precedent.[186] His appointment represented a decline in the Court's liberal wing, which then comprised only Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun.[187][188]\n\n\nIn his early days on the Court, Thomas adopted a bold style of legal jurisprudence that alienated him from Justices Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor. He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic which embodied his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[189][190]\n\n\nThomas is a proponent of original meaning, incorporating what had been Scalia's narrower approach to the doctrine and the original intent of the Framers of the Constitution, including those espoused in the Declaration of Independence. As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[191][e] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in *stare decisis*, period\".[194][195][f] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[197] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9]\n\n\nThomas has been called the most conservative member of the Supreme Court,[190][198][199] though others gave Scalia that designation while they served on the Court together.[200][201] Thomas's influence, particularly among conservatives, was perceived to have significantly increased during Donald Trump's presidency,[202][203] and Trump appointed many of his former clerks to political positions and judgeships.[204][205][206] As the Supreme Court became more conservative, Thomas and his legal views became more influential on the Court.[207][208][209] This influence increased further by 2022, with Thomas authoring an opinion expanding Second Amendment rights and contributing to the Court's overruling of *Roe v. Wade*. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stare decisis in the U.S. legal system\n![](image)The Roberts Court in 2006Thomas believes the Court should not follow erroneous precedent, a view not currently held by other justices.[213] He has called to reconsider *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan* (1964), and criticized *Roe v. Wade* (1973) and *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963). At a 2013 Federalist Society dinner, Judge Diane S. Sykes asked Thomas whether \"*stare decisis* doesn't hold much force for you?\" He responded, \"Oh, it sure does, but not enough to keep me from going to the Constitution\".[214][215] In 2019, *The New York Times* reported that data gathered by political scientist Stephen L. Wasby of the University at Albany found that Thomas wrote \"more than 250 concurring or dissenting opinions seriously questioning precedents, calling for their reconsideration or suggesting that they be overruled\".[214]\n\n\n\nIn the 2010 gun regulation case *McDonald v. City of Chicago*, Thomas sought to repeal past precedents and insisted that \"*stare decisis* is only an 'adjunct' of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means\".[216] In *Gamble v. United States* (2019), he joined the majority opinion, which revisited an exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause, writing separately to state his position against the Court's prevailing view of multi-factor analysis regarding whether to follow precedent:[217]\n\n\n> In my view, if the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous—i.e., one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text—the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent. Federal courts may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision as precedent, but only when traditional tools of legal interpretation show that the earlier decision adopted a textually permissible interpretation of the law. A demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power.[218]\n> \n> \n\nIn *Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt* (2019),[g] Thomas wrote the 5–4 decision overruling *Nevada v. Hall* (1979), which said states could be sued in courts of other states. In his majority opinion, he noted that *stare decisis* \"is not an inexorable command\". Thomas explicitly disavowed the concept of reliance interests as justification for adhering to precedent. In dissent from *Hyatt III*, Justice Breyer asked what other decisions might eventually be overruled, and suggested *Roe v. Wade* might be among them. Breyer stated that it is best to leave precedents alone unless they are widely seen as erroneous or become impractical.[219]\n\n\n#### Executive power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks with Akhil Reed Amar of the Constitutional Accountability Center in 2012\nThomas has supported a broad interpretation of executive power and has theorized about its constitutional aspects.[9] In *Hamdi v. Rumsfeld* (2004),[h] he dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that courts should have had complete deference to the executive decision to determine that Yaser Esam Hamdi was an enemy combatant.[220] He wrote in *Hamdi* that the president does not have the singular authority to detain a citizen who was captured while in enemy service.[221] In addition, Thomas noted that \"structural advantages [of the Presidency] are most important in the national-security and foreign-affairs contexts\" and thus \"the Founders intended that the President have primary responsibility—along with the necessary power—to protect the national security and to conduct the nation's foreign relations\".[222]\n\n\nThomas was one of three justices to dissent in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* (2006),[i] which concerned whether the president can establish military tribunals to try detained enemy combatants for war crimes conspiracy. As in *Hamdi*, he relied on *The Federalist Papers* in proposing that the president is responsible for protecting national security.[223][224]\n\n\nIn *Zivotofsky v. Kerry* (2015), Thomas relied on the Articles of Confederation for his opinion. He wrote, \"the President is not confined to those powers expressly identified in [the Constitution]\", concluding that residual foreign affairs were vested in the president, not Congress.[225] Rather than finding the original intent or original understanding, Thomas wrote in the case that he sought the \"understanding of executive power [that] prevailed in America\" at the time of the founding.[226]\n\n\nIn the Ninth Circuit case *East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump* (2018), which placed an injunction on the Trump administration's asylum policy, Thomas dissented from a denial of stay application. The Ninth Circuit imposed an injunction on the Trump administration's policy granting asylum only to refugees entering from a designated port of entry, ruling that it violated the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Ninth Circuit Judge Jay Bybee's majority opinion concluded that denial of the ability to apply for asylum regardless of entry point is \"the hollowest of rights that an alien must be allowed to apply for asylum regardless of whether she arrived through a port of entry if another rule makes her categorically ineligible for asylum based on precisely that fact.\" Gorsuch, Alito, Kavanaugh also dissented in the decision to deny a stay to the Ninth Circuit's injunction.[227][228]\n\n\n\n#### Federalism[edit]\n\n\nThomas views federalism as a foundational limit on federal power.[229] In interpreting congressional powers, he has defended strict constructionism—an approach Scalia rejected.[230] On September 24, 1999, Thomas delivered the Dwight D. Opperman Lecture at Drake University Law School on \"Why Federalism Matters\", saying that it was an essential safeguard to protect \"individual liberty and the private ordering of our lives\". He also asserted that federalism enhances self-government, protects individual liberty by separating political power, and checks federal authority.[231] According to law professor Ann Althouse, the Court has yet to move toward \"the broader, more principled version of federalism propounded by Justice Thomas\".[232]\n\n> \n> Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question. And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to action by the States or the people.\n> \n> \n> — Thomas, dissenting in *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton* (1995)[233][229]\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nIn the 1995 case *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton*,[j] parties challenged the constitutionality of an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution that added age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, also affirming the previous rulings of both the state's trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Stevens wrote for the majority. Thomas—joined by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia—dissented in what is to date his lengthiest opinion.[234] He argued that states could impose term limits on members of Congress, as state citizens are \"the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority\".[235] That same year, Thomas concurred in *United States v. Lopez*, which invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for going beyond the Commerce Clause. He opined that the Court had deviated \"from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause\" and that the substantial effects test, \"if taken to its logical extreme, would give Congress a 'police power' over all aspects of American life\".[236]\n\n\nThomas dissented in *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005), which held that the Controlled Substances Act applies to homegrown marijuana, on the grounds of original meaning.[237] His interpretation of the interstate commerce clause differed from Scalia's, and they also held conflicting beliefs about the general welfare clause, the Indian commerce clause, and the necessary and proper clause. Scalia joined the majority opinion, but Thomas disputed the relevance of homegrown marijuana to interstate commerce, writing that if Congress can regulate it, \"it can regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers\".[238][239]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Comstock* (2010),[k] the Supreme Court, in a majority opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, held that the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to enact a law that authorized the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to detain a mentally ill and dangerous federal prisoner beyond the DOJ's original lawful date. Thomas's dissent, joined by Scalia, argued that the clause allows Congress only to execute enumerated powers.[240] When the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* (2012), he authored a short dissent and joined the joint dissent finding the act completely unconstitutional.[241]\n\n\n\n#### Federal statutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas Swears in Sonny Perdue as the 31st Secretary of Agriculture, 2017As of 2007, Thomas was the justice most willing to exercise judicial review of federal statutes but among the least likely to overturn state statutes.[242] According to a *New York Times* editorial, \"from 1994 to 2005 ... Justice Thomas voted to overturn federal laws in 34 cases and Justice Scalia in 31, compared with just 15 for Justice Stephen Breyer\".[243]\n\n\nIn *Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder*, Thomas was the sole dissenter, voting to throw out Section Five of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section Five requires states with a history of racial voter discrimination—mostly states from the old South—to gain Justice Department clearance when revising election procedures. Congress had reauthorized Section Five in 2006 for another 25 years, but Thomas said the law was no longer necessary, stating that the rate of black voting in seven Section Five states was higher than the national average. He wrote, \"the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section 5 and this court to uphold it no longer remains.\"[244] He took this position again in *Shelby County v. Holder*, voting with the majority and concurring with the reasoning that struck down Section Five.[245]\n\n\n\n### Individual rights[edit]\n\n\n#### Free speech and expression[edit]\n\n\nThomas has generally written opinions in favor of protections for free speech.[246][247] He has voted in favor of First Amendment claims in cases involving issues including campaign contributions and commercial speech.[248] A 2002 study by Eugene Volokh found Thomas to be the justice second-most likely to uphold free speech claims (tied with Souter).[249] He has ruled against laws regulating hate speech, as in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul* (1992), *United States v. Stevens* (2010), and *Snyder v. Phelps* (2011).[250] Conversely, he has been reluctant to uphold speech deemed intimidating, as in *Virginia v. Black* (2003).[251][252]\n\n\nThomas's first opinion on free speech was the 1995 case *McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission*,[l] finding that the Founding Era contained the expansive use of anonymous pamphlets and columns. Although he agreed with the result of Justice John Paul Stevens's majority opinion, he disagreed with its methodology and did not join it.[253] With the announcement of *McIntyre*, the Court also decided *Rubin v. Coors Brewing Company*, in which Thomas wrote his first majority opinion concerning free speech. In *Rubin*, Thomas was joined unanimously in ruling unconstitutional a 1935 federal law that prohibited beer labels from disclosing alcohol content. He similarly concurred the next year in *44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island*, which struck down a state law that banned the advertisement of prices of alcoholic beverages.[254]\n\n\n\nIn *Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC* (1996), the Supreme Court ruled against the decision of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to fine the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee for running a political advertisement targeting Senator Tim Wirth. Thomas joined Justice Stephen Breyer's majority opinion in the case, but wrote separately to call against the framework established in the previous campaign finance case of *Buckley v Valeo* (1976):\n\n\n> I believe that contribution limits infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedom of political expression and association as do expenditure limits. The protections of the First Amendment do not depend upon so fine a line as that between spending money to support a candidate or group and giving money to the candidate or group to spend for the same purpose. In principle, people and groups give money to candidates and other groups for the same reason that they spend money in support of those candidates and groups: because they share social, economic, and political beliefs and seek to have those beliefs affect governmental policy.[255]\n> \n> \n\n![](image)The Roberts Court pictured in 2017Thomas has made public his belief that all limits on federal campaign contributions are unconstitutional and should be struck down.[256] In *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010), Thomas joined the majority but dissented in part, arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's disclaimer and disclosure requirements were unconstitutional. He reinforced his defense of anonymous speech in *Doe v. Reed* (2010), writing that the First Amendment protects \"political association\" by means of signing a petition.[257]\n\nIn *Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District* (1969), Justice Hugo Black dissented from the Court's opinion invalidating a school's policy to forbid students from wearing armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. Thomas endorsed Black's dissent in *Morse v. Frederick* (2007), concurring with narrowing the rationale of *Tinker* and arguing that *Tinker* be overruled as it was a constitutionally unsupported \"sea change in students’ speech rights\".[258] In his view, the Constitution does not govern whether public school students may be disciplined for expressive behavior.[259]\n\n\nIn *Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.*—in which a high school punished a student for sending a profane message on social media about her school, softball team, and cheer team—Thomas was the lone dissenter, siding with the school. He criticized the majority for relying on \"vague considerations\" and wrote that historically schools could discipline students in similar situations.[260] In *Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans*, he joined the majority opinion that Texas's decision to deny a request for a Confederate Battle Flag specialty license plate was constitutional.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks at the Library of Congress in September 2012\nThomas agreed with the judgment in *McDonald v. Chicago* (2010) that the right to keep and bear arms is applicable to state and local governments, but he wrote a separate concurrence finding that an individual's right to bear arms is fundamental as a privilege of American citizenship under the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather than as a fundamental right under the due process clause.[262] The four justices in the plurality opinion specifically rejected incorporation under the privileges or immunities clause, \"declin[ing] to disturb\" the holding in the *Slaughter-House Cases*, which, according to the plurality, had held that the clause applied only to federal matters.[263][264]\n\n\nSince 2010, Thomas has dissented from denial of certiorari in several Second Amendment cases. He voted to grant certiorari in *Friedman v. City of Highland Park* (2015), which upheld bans on certain semi-automatic rifles; *Jackson v. San Francisco* (2014), which upheld trigger lock ordinances similar to those struck down in *Heller*; *Peruta v. San Diego County* (2016), which upheld restrictive concealed carry licensing in California; and *Silvester v. Becerra* (2017), which upheld waiting periods for firearm purchasers who have already passed background checks and already own firearms. He was joined by Scalia in the first two cases, and by Gorsuch in *Peruta*.[265][266][267][268]\n\n\nThomas dissented from the denial of an application for a stay presented to Chief Justice Roberts in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case *Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives* (2019), a case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. Only Thomas and Gorsuch publicly dissented.[269]\n\n\nThomas authored the majority opinion in *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (2022), guaranteeing the right of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in public. The case held: \"When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.'\" Justice Stephen Breyer, dissenting, wrote, \"when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms.\"\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson, 2007\nIn cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, Thomas often favors police over defendants. For example, his opinion for the Court in *Board of Education v. Earls* upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the Court in *Samson v. California*, permitting random searches on parolees. He dissented in *Georgia v. Randolph*, which prohibited warrantless searches that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the Court's decision in *Coolidge v. New Hampshire* controlled the case. In *Indianapolis v. Edmond*, Thomas described the Court's extant case law as having held that \"suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops.\" He expressed doubt that those cases were decided correctly but concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the Court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.[270] Thomas was in the majority in *Kyllo v. United States*, which held that the use of thermal imaging technology to probe a suspect's home without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\nIn cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of *in loco parentis*,[271] which he defines as \"parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order\".[272] His dissent in *Safford Unified School District v. Redding* illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the *Safford* case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the Court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a strip search or the like.[272] All the justices except Thomas concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. Thomas wrote, \"It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not\"[273] and \"reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed\". He added, \"[t]here can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search.\"[272]\n\n\n\n#### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doggett v. United States*, the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The Court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.[274] Thomas dissented, arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause's purpose was to prevent \"'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'\" and that the case implicated neither.[274] He cast the case instead as \"present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime\". Thomas dissented from the court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.[274] He wrote that dismissing the conviction \"invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role\".[275]\n\n\nIn *Garza v. Idaho*, Thomas and Gorsuch, in dissent, suggested that *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963), which required that indigent criminal defendants be provided counsel, was wrongly decided and should be overruled.[214]\n\n\n\n##### Eighth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nThomas was among the dissenters in *Atkins v. Virginia* and *Roper v. Simmons*, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of the death penalty to certain classes of persons. In *Kansas v. Marsh*, his opinion for the Court indicated a belief that the Constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of *Furman v. Georgia* and *Gregg v. Georgia*, the 1976 case in which the Court reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.[*citation needed*]\n\n![](image)Thomas speaking to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in 2017\nIn *Hudson v. McMillian*, a prisoner had been beaten, sustaining a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. Although these were not \"serious injuries\", the Court believed, it held that \"the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\"[276] Dissenting, Thomas wrote, \"a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents.\"[276] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the Court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).[277] His opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, it ignored \"the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment\".[276] According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in *Hudson* was a \"classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him\".[278] Thomas later responded to the accusation \"that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion.\"[278]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Bajakajian*, Thomas joined with the Court's liberal justices to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was \"grossly disproportional\" and violated the Excessive Fines Clause.[279]\n\n\nThomas has written that the \"Cruel and Unusual Punishment\" clause \"contains no proportionality principle\", meaning that the question whether a sentence should be rejected as \"cruel and unusual\" depends only on the sentence itself, not on what crime is being punished.[280] He was concurring with the Court's decision to reject a request for review from a petitioner who had been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison under California's \"Three-Strikes\" law for stealing some golf clubs because the combined value of the clubs made the theft a felony and he had two previous felonies in his criminal record.\n\n\n\n#### Race, equal protection, and affirmative action[edit]\n\n\nThomas believes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In *Adarand Constructors v. Peña*, he wrote, \"there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\"[281]\n\n\nIn *Gratz v. Bollinger*, Thomas wrote, \"a State's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\"[282] In *Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1*, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"[283] Concurring, Thomas wrote, \"if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories\", and charged that the dissent carried \"similarities\" to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in *Brown v. Board of Education*.[283]\n\n\nLikewise, in *Grutter v. Bollinger*, Thomas approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's *Plessy v. Ferguson* dissent: \"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\"[284] In a concurrence in *Missouri v. Jenkins* (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court \"has read our cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority.\"[285]\n\n\nSome legal scholars have called Thomas's views on race and the constitution \"idiosyncratic\",[286] \"pessimistic\", or \"fatalistic\".[287] For example, professors Corey Robin and Stephen F. Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard*, which struck down affirmative action in college admissions. He filed a concurring opinion, which he read from the bench, a rare practice for Supreme Court justices.[291]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion and family planning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Thomas administers the oath of office to Amy Coney Barrett (Oct 26, 2020)\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Casey* (1992), the Court reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*. Thomas and Justice Byron White joined the dissenting opinions of Rehnquist and Scalia. Rehnquist wrote, \"[w]e believe *Roe* was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to *stare decisis* in constitutional cases.\"[293] Scalia's opinion concluded that the right to obtain an abortion is not \"a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States\".[293] \"[T]he Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,\" Scalia wrote, \"and [ ] the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed\".[293]\n\n\nIn *Stenberg v. Carhart* (2000), the Court struck down a state ban on partial-birth abortion, concluding that it failed *Casey*'s \"undue burden\" test. Thomas dissented, writing, \"Although a State *may* permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State *must* do so.\"[294][*citation needed*] He went on to criticize the reasoning of the *Casey* and *Stenberg* majorities: \"The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States—a hostility that *Casey* purported to reject.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Gonzales v. Carhart* (2007), the Court rejected a facial challenge to a federal ban on partial-birth abortion.[295][*citation needed*] Concurring, Thomas asserted that the court's abortion jurisprudence had no basis in the Constitution but that the court had accurately applied that jurisprudence in rejecting the challenge.[295][*citation needed*] He added that the Court was not deciding the question of whether Congress had the power to outlaw partial-birth abortions: \"[W]hether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court [in this case] ... the parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it.\"[295][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Thomas dissented when the Court voted not to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[296] Alito and Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissent, arguing that the Court was \"abdicating its judicial duty\".[297]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Thomas joined three of the Court's other conservative justices in voting to reject a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[298] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would have required that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[299]\n\n\nIn *Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.* (2019), a per curiam decision upholding the provision of Indiana's abortion restriction regarding fetal remains disposal on rational basis scrutiny and upholding the lower court rulings striking down the provision banning race, sex, and disability, Thomas wrote a concurring opinion comparing abortion and birth control to eugenics, which was practiced in the U.S. in the early 20th century and by the Nazi government in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, and comparing *Box* to *Buck v. Bell* (1927), which upheld a forced sterilization law regarding people with mental disabilities. In his opinion, Thomas quoted Margaret Sanger's support for contraception as a form of personal reproductive control that she considered superior to \"the horrors of abortion and infanticide\" (Sanger's words).[300][*citation needed*] His opinion referred several times to historian/journalist Adam Cohen's book *Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck*; shortly afterward, Cohen published a sharply worded criticism saying that Thomas had misinterpreted his book and misunderstood the history of the eugenics movement.[301] In *Box*, only Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ginsburg publicly registered their votes. Ginsburg and Sotomayor concurred in part and dissented in part, stating they would have upheld the lower court decision on striking down the race, sex, and disability ban as well as the lower court decision striking down the fetal remains disposal provision.[300][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a concurring opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), Thomas wrote that \"any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\",[*citation needed*] and argued that the Supreme Court should go beyond *Roe vs. Wade* and reconsider other substantive due process precedents, including those established in *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965), *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003) and *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015). The overturning of these previous decisions would enable states to limit access to contraception, criminalize sodomy, and criminalize same-sex marriage, respectively.[302][303][304]\n\n\n\n#### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Evans* (1996), Thomas joined Scalia's dissenting opinion arguing that Amendment Two to the Colorado State Constitution did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Colorado amendment forbade any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on \"homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships\".[305][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003), Thomas issued a one-page dissent in which he called the Texas statute prohibiting sodomy \"uncommonly silly\", a phrase originally used by Justice Potter Stewart. He then said that if he were a member of the Texas legislature he would vote to repeal the law, as it was not a worthwhile use of \"law enforcement resources\" to police private sexual behavior. But Thomas opined that the Constitution does not contain a right to privacy and therefore did not vote to strike the statute down. He saw the issue as a matter for states to decide for themselves.[306][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia* (2020), Thomas joined Alito and Kavanaugh in dissenting from the decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. (Thomas and Alito wrote a dissent together, and Kavanaugh wrote separately.) The 6–3 ruling's majority consisted of two Republican-appointed justices, Roberts and Gorsuch, along with four Democratic-appointed justices: Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.[307]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from *Obergefell v. Hodges* and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[308][309][310] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[311][312][313] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6-3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[314] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[315][316]\n\n\n\n### Oral arguments[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[317][318] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[319] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006.[320]\n\n\nThomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic;[321][322][323][320] before that, he had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question to each advocate.[325]\n\n\nThomas has given many reasons for his silence, including self-consciousness about how he speaks, a preference for listening to those arguing the case, and difficulty getting in a word.[319] His speaking and listening habits may have been influenced by his Gullah upbringing, during which his English was relatively unpolished.[18][62][326] In a 2017 paper in *Northwestern University Law Review*, RonNell Andersen Jones and Aaron L. Nielson wrote that while asking few questions, \"in many ways, [Thomas] is a model questioner.\"[327][328]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas and his wife, Ginni Thomas, on their wedding day in 1987\nIn 1971, Thomas married Kathy Grace Ambush. The couple had one child, Jamal Adeen, born in 1973, who is Thomas's sole child. Thomas and his first wife separated in 1981 and divorced in 1984.[329][330] In 1987, Thomas married Virginia Lamp, a lobbyist and aide to U.S. Representative Dick Armey.[331] In 1997, they took in Thomas's six-year-old great-nephew, Mark Martin Jr.,[332] who had lived with his mother in Savannah public housing.[333] Since 1999, Thomas and his wife have traveled across the U.S. in a motorcoach between Court terms.[334][335]\n\n\nVirginia \"Ginni\" Thomas has remained active in conservative politics, serving as a consultant to The Heritage Foundation and as founder and president of Liberty Central.[336] In 2011, she stepped down from Liberty Central to open a conservative lobbying firm, touting her \"experience and connections\", meeting with newly elected Republican representatives and calling herself an \"ambassador to the Tea Party\".[337][338] Also in 2011, 74 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote that Justice Thomas should recuse himself on cases regarding the Affordable Care Act because of \"appearance of a conflict of interest\" based on his wife's work.[339]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* reported in February 2021 that Ginni Thomas apologized to a group of Thomas's former clerks on the email listserv \"Thomas Clerk World\" for her role in contributing to a rift relating to \"pro-Trump postings and former Thomas clerk John Eastman, who spoke at the rally and represented Trump in some of his failed lawsuits filed to overturn the election results\".[340] In March 2022, texts between Ginni Thomas and Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows from 2020 were turned over to the Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[341] The texts show Ginni Thomas repeatedly urging Meadows to overturn the election results and repeating conspiracy theories about ballot fraud.[342] In response, 24 Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate demanded that Thomas recuse himself from cases related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol on the grounds that Ginni Thomas's involvement in such efforts raised questions about his impartiality.[343] An April 2022 Quinnipiac poll found that 52% of Americans agreed that, in light of Ginni Thomas's texts about overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, Thomas should have recused himself from related cases.[344]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThomas was reconciled to the Catholic Church in the mid-1990s.[345] In his autobiography, he criticized the church for failing to grapple with racism in the 1960s during the civil rights movement, saying it was not so \"adamant about ending racism then as it is about ending abortion now\".[346] As of 2021, Thomas is one of 14 practicing Catholic justices in the Court's history and one of six currently serving (along with Alito, Kavanaugh, Roberts, Sotomayor and Barrett).[347]\n\n\n\n### Literary influences[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, when Thomas read economist Thomas Sowell's *Race and Economics*, he found an intellectual foundation for his philosophy.[348][349] The book criticizes social reform by government and argues for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. Ayn Rand's works also influenced him, particularly *The Fountainhead*, and he later required his staffers to watch the 1949 film version of the novel.[350][351] Thomas acknowledges \"some very strong libertarian leanings\", though he does not consider himself a libertarian.[352]\n\n\nThomas has said novelist Richard Wright is the most influential writer in his life; Wright's books *Native Son* and *Black Boy* \"capture[d] a lot of the feelings that I had inside that you learn how to repress\".[329] *Native Son* and Ralph Ellison's *Invisible Man* are Thomas's two favorite novels.[185]\n\n\n\n### Moira Smith allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Moira Smith, vice-president and general counsel of a natural gas distributor in Alaska, said that Thomas groped her buttocks at a dinner party in 1999. She was a Truman Foundation scholar helping the director of the foundation set up for a dinner party honoring Thomas and David Adkins. Smith's roommates at the time confirmed that she had told them about the incident. Thomas denied the allegation.[353][354]\n\n\nLouis Blair, who was the head of the Truman Foundation and hosted the dinner at his home, said he had \"no recollection of the incident\" and that he had neither seen nor heard of Smith's allegation. Blair acknowledged that he was in the kitchen most of the time so, if the incident happened, he wouldn't have seen it, but was also \"skeptical that the justice and Moira would have been alone\", given that there were approximately 16 people in three rooms.[355][356] Norma Stevens, who attended the event, said that the incident \"couldn't have happened\" because Thomas was never alone, as he was the guest of honor.[357]\n\n\n\n### Nondisclosure of finances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Crow's foundation gave $105,000 to Yale Law School, Thomas's alma mater, for the \"Justice Thomas Portrait Fund\", tax filings show.[360]\n\n\nIn 2011, *Politico* reported that Crow gave $500,000 to a Tea Party group founded by Thomas's wife and that Thomas had failed to report her income on his disclosure for more than a decade.[361][362] Also that year, the advocacy group Common Cause reported that between 2003 and 2007, Thomas failed to disclose $686,589 in income his wife earned from The Heritage Foundation, instead reporting \"none\" where \"spousal noninvestment income\" would be reported on his Supreme Court financial disclosure forms.[363] The next week, Thomas said the disclosure of his wife's income had been \"inadvertently omitted due to a misunderstanding of the filing instructions\".[364] He amended reports going back to 1989.[365]\n\n\nIn April 2023, ProPublica reported that Thomas had \"accepted luxury trips virtually every year\" from Crow for two decades and failed to report them. They included flights on Crow's private jet, cruises on Crow's superyacht at locations around the globe, and stays at Crow's private resort in the Adirondacks and the private club Bohemian Grove.[360][366][362] The Ethics in Government Act requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to annually disclose gifts they receive.[367] Many elected officials criticized the appearance of impropriety, given Crow's donations to conservative causes and Republican candidates, and his service on the Board of Trustees for the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, which have filed amicus briefs before the Supreme Court.[368][360]\n\n\nAlso in April 2023, ProPublica reported that one of Crow's companies bought a house and two empty lots on a residential street in Savannah, Georgia, for $133,000 in 2014. The properties were owned in equal parts by Thomas, his mother, and the family of his deceased brother. Thomas did not report the sale on the disclosure form he filed for 2014. Crow's company also paid for extensive renovations of the house, where Thomas's mother still lives.[369][362]\n\n\nIn May 2023, ProPublica reported that Crow had paid for private school tuition for Thomas's grandnephew, Mark Martin, of whom Thomas had legal custody. Thomas did not report the payments on his financial disclosure forms, while ethics law experts said that they were required to be disclosed as gifts. A bank statement[370] showed that monthly tuition at Hidden Lake Academy, one of the two schools Crow paid for, was $6,200. Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas, said that Crow paid for one year each at Hidden Lake and Randolph-Macon Academy, which ProPublica estimated to total around $100,000.[371][362]\n\n\nOn the same day, *The Washington Post* reported that in January 2012 conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo had Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway's polling firm bill the Judicial Education Project $25,000, which her firm then paid to Ginni Thomas's firm, Liberty Consulting, for a total of $80,000 between June 2011 and June 2012. Leo instructed Conway not to mention Thomas's name on the paperwork. The documents the newspaper reviewed did not indicate the nature of the work Thomas did for the Judicial Education Project or Conway's company. In 2012 the Judicial Education Project filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case.[372][362]\n\n\nIn 2023, *The New York Times* reported that a friend had paid for Thomas's Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon RV, purchased for $267,230 in 1999 (roughly equivalent to $489,000 in 2023). Anthony Welters, a former UnitedHealthcare executive and a close friend, lent Thomas the purchase price. In response to a Senate inquiry, Welters revealed that the loan was discharged in 2008, forgiving much of the original balance. A bank would have been unlikely to offer such a loan, given the Marathon's high capacity for customization, which can make used models difficult to appraise. Thomas had previously said that he \"had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach\", according to the *Times*, and a friend, Armstrong Williams, said that Thomas had told him that \"he saved up all his money to buy it\". When the loan was forgiven, Thomas was required to disclose the money as a gift.[373][374][375][362]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Thomas filed his financial disclosure report for 2022, listing three trips on Crow's jets.[376][377]\n\n\n\n## Honors and recognition[edit]\n\n\nThomas was awarded the 1992 Horatio Alger Award by the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans.[378] In 2001, Thomas was awarded the Francis Boyer Award presented by the American Enterprise Institute.[379] In 2012, Thomas received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, his alma mater.[380] In 2020, Belmont Abbey College awarded him the Benedict Leadership Award for his devotion to the Catholic faith and government service.[381]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* In the 1996 film *Jerry Maguire*, after Tom Cruise's character makes a pass at his employee (played by Renee Zellweger), he apologizes with, \"I feel like Clarence Thomas.\"[382]\n* Wendell Pierce portrayed Thomas in the 2016 film *Confirmation*.\n* In May 2023, Michael Kirk directed a *Frontline* documentary about Thomas's life and career, narrated by Will Lyman.[383][384] John Danforth, who was interviewed for the documentary, wrote in an op-ed published in *The Wall Street Journal* that the excerpts of his interview included in the film were only \"biographical filler\" and criticized the film as a whole as \"a two-hour hit job on the character of Clarence Thomas\".[385]\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\n* \"Why Black Americans Should Look to Conservative Policies\". *The Heritage Lectures*.

In that same period, Thomas was the third-most-frequent dissenter on the Court, behind Stevens and Scalia.[179] Scalia's and Thomas's agreement rate peaked in 1996 at 98%.[179] By 2004, other pairs of justices were more closely aligned than Scalia and Thomas.[180]\n4. **^** Thomas's close early association with Scalia came under scrutiny by critics in multiple law review articles. In November 1996, *Emerge* magazine titled him as \"Uncle Thomas: Lawn Jockey of the Far Right\".[181] Linda Greenhouse observed that Thomas voted with Scalia 91% of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time.[182] Biographer Jan Crawford noted that Scalia often joined Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.[183][184] Biographer Corey Robin has called the idea that Thomas followed Scalia's votes a debunked myth.[185]\n5. **^** Thomas's jurisprudence has also been compared to that of Justice Hugo Black, who \"resisted the tendency to create social policy out of 'whole cloth.'\" According to the same critic, Thomas generally declines to engage in judicial lawmaking, viewing the Court's constitutional role as the interpretation of law, rather than making law.[192][193]\n6. **^** In 2005, while an assistant professor of law at Notre Dame Law School, future-Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that Thomas supports statutory *stare decisis*. Her examples included his concurring opinion in *Fogerty v. Fantasy* (1994).[196]\n7. **^** \"Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt\" (PDF). U.S. Supreme Court. 2018.

But later on, immediately following that response, I noted to the press that I did not raise a claim of sexual harassment in this complaint. It seems to me that the behavior has to be evaluated on its own with regard to the fitness of this individual to act as an Associate Justice.

Justices Stevens and Souter agreed 77 percent of the time; so did Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. Thomas and Scalia agreed in only 73 percent of the cases. Thomas regularly breaks with Scalia, disagreeing on points of doctrine, finding a more measured and judicial tone, and calling for the elimination of bad law.

He was nominated by President George H. W. Bush to succeed Thurgood Marshall and has served since 1991. After Marshall, Thomas is the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court and has been its longest-serving member since Anthony Kennedy's retirement in 2018. Since Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, he is also the Court's oldest member.\n\n\nThomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor Gullah community near Savannah. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a priest in the Catholic Church but was frustrated over the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a clergyman to attend the College of the Holy Cross and, later Yale Law School, where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, notably Thomas Sowell. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an assistant attorney general in Missouri and later entered private practice there. He became a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John Danforth in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education in 1981. President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the next year.\n\n\nPresident George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and the EEOC.[5] Hill alleged that Thomas made multiple sexual and romantic overtures to her despite her repeatedly telling him to stop. Thomas and his supporters denied the allegation, asserting that Hill and her political supporters had fabricated the accusation to prevent the appointment of a black conservative. The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin in a century.[6]\n\n\nSince the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana). He is widely considered the Court's most conservative member.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nThomas was born on June 23, 1948, in his parents' wooden shack in Pin Point, Georgia.[11][12] Pin Point was a small community near Savannah founded by freedmen in the 1880s.[13] He was the second of three children of M. C. Thomas, a farm worker, and Leola Williams,[11] Myers Anderson's illegitimate daughter who, after her mother's death, had been sent from Liberty County, Georgia to live with an aunt in Pin Point.[14][15][16] His older sister Emma was born in 1946, his younger brother Myers in 1949.[17]\n\n\nThe family were descendants of enslaved people and spoke Gullah as a first language.[18] Thomas's earliest known ancestors were slaves named Sandy and Peggy, who were born in the late 18th century and owned by wealthy planter Josiah Wilson of Liberty County.[19]\n\n\n\nWhen Leola was pregnant with Thomas's older sister, she was expelled from her Baptist church and dropped out of high school after the 10th grade. Her father ordered her to marry M. C. in January 1947. They divorced in 1951.[17] M.C. moved to Savannah and later to Pennsylvania, visiting his children only once after the divorce. Custody of the children was awarded to Leola's aunt. Leola went to work as a maid in Savannah during the week, returning to Pin Point on the weekends. When the aunt's house burnt down in 1955, Leola took the boys to live with her in the room she rented in a tenement with an outdoor toilet in Savannah, leaving her daughter with the aunt in Pin Point.[20][21][22] Finding herself unable to raise two little boys by herself,[23] and unable to get public assistance because her father was wealthy,[22] she asked her father for help. He initially refused but agreed after his wife threatened to throw him out.[24][23]\n\n![](image)Thomas's 1967 high school yearbook pictureThomas and his brother went to live with Anderson and his wife in 1955 and experienced amenities such as indoor plumbing and regular meals for the first time.[25] Despite having little formal education, Anderson had built a successful business delivering coal, oil, and ice.[24] He converted to Catholicism, and sent Thomas to be educated at a series of segregated Catholic schools. Thomas attended the predominantly black St. Pius X High School in Chatham County[26] for two years before transferring to St. John Vianney's Minor Seminary on the Isle of Hope, where he was the segregated boarding school's first black student.[27][28] Though he experienced hazing, he performed well academically.[15] He spent many hours at the Carnegie Library, the only library for blacks in Savannah before libraries were desegregated in 1961.[29][30][32]\n\n\nWhen racial unrest led to widespread protest and marches in Savannah from 1960 to 1963, Anderson used his wealth to bail out demonstrators and took his grandchildren to meetings promoted by the NAACP.[33]\n\n\nWhen Thomas was ten years old, Anderson began putting his grandsons to work during the summers, helping him build a house on a plot of farmland he owned, building fences, and doing farm work.[34] He believed in hard work and self-reliance,[35] never showed his grandsons affection,[34] beat them frequently according to Leola, and impressed the importance of a good education on them.[36] Anderson taught Thomas that \"all of our rights as human beings came from God, not man\", and that racial segregation was a violation of divine law.[37]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nDuring his freshman year from 1967 to 1968, Thomas attended Conception Seminary College, a Catholic seminary in Missouri, with the intent to become a priest; no one in Thomas's family had attended college before.[38][27] After Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, he overheard a student say, \"Good. I hope the S.O.B. dies\" and \"[t]hat's what they should do to all the niggers\".[39][40][41] Thomas thought the church did not do enough to combat racism and resolved to abandon the priesthood.[42][39] He left the seminary at the end of the semester.[39]\n\n\nAt a nun's suggestion, Thomas enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross, an elite Catholic college in Massachusetts, as a sophomore transfer student on a full academic scholarship.[43][44] He was one of the college's first black students, being one of 20 recruited by President John E. Brooks in 1968 in a group that also included future attorney Ted Wells, running back Eddie Jenkins, Jr., and novelist Edward P. Jones.[45] Without financial support from his grandfather, Thomas defrayed his expenses by working as a waiter and dishwasher in the college's dining hall.[46][47] He later recalled, \"I was 19. My only hope was Holy Cross College\".[48]\n\n\n\nProfessors at Holy Cross remembered Thomas as a determined, diligent student. He kept to a strict routine of studying alone and stayed back during holidays to continue working.[49] Thomas C. Lawler, an English professor at Holy Cross,[50] recalled him as having \"never talked very much in class. He was the kind of person you really might not notice\".[51] By contrast, he was outspoken at BSU meetings, distinguishing himself as a contrarian who often feuded with Ted Wells. Future NFL running back Ed Jenkins, a BSU member, said Thomas \"could turn on a dime and reduce you to intellectual rubble\".[52][53] Edward P. Jones, who lived across from Thomas as a sophomore, reflected that \"there was a fierce determination I sensed from him [Thomas], that he was going to get as much as he could and get as far, ultimately, as he could\".[54] \n\n![](image)Dinand Library at the College of the Holy Cross, where Thomas studied for college[55]\nThomas became a vocal student activist as an undergraduate. He became acquainted with Black separatism, the Black Muslim Movement, the Black power movement, helped draft the Black Student Union (BSU), and displayed a poster of Malcolm X in his dormitory room.[56] When some black students were disproportionately punished in comparison with white students for the same violation, he suggested a walkout in protest. The BSU adopted his idea, and Thomas, along with 60 other black students, departed campus.[57][58] Some of the priests negotiated with the protesting black students to reenter the school.[27] When administrators granted amnesty to all protesters, Thomas returned to the college, later also to attend anti-war marches. In April 1970, he participated in the violent 1970 Harvard Square riots.[59] He has credited his protests for his turn toward conservatism and subsequent disillusionment with leftist movements.[60][61][54]\n\n\nHaving struggled with English as a native speaker of Gullah, Thomas chose to major in English literature.[46][62] He became a member of Alpha Sigma Nu, the Jesuit honor society, and the Purple Key Society, of which he was the only black member.[63] The college's focus on a liberal arts education introduced him to the works of black intellectuals such as Richard Wright, whose literary works Thomas sympathized with.[64] He also admired Malcolm X and recalled reading *The Autobiography of Malcolm X* to the point of wearing down the pages of his copy.[65]\n\n\nThomas graduated on June 4, 1971, with a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*,[63] ranked ninth in his class.[66][67] In his junior year, he was named a Fenwick Scholar, one of the highest honors at Holy Cross; in his senior year, he decided to pursue a career in law. Due to his academic achievements, he applied to and was accepted at Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[66][68] In 1971, Thomas matriculated at Yale Law School as one of 12 black students.[69] Yale offered him the best financial aid package, and he was attracted to the civil rights activism of some of its faculty members.[70][71] Finding it difficult to keep up with the school's expectations, he struggled to connect with other students who came from upper-class backgrounds. He enrolled in the most difficult courses and became a student of property law scholar Quintin Johnstone, who became his favorite professor.[72][73] Johnstone remembered Thomas as having \"performed very well\" and Dean Guido Calabresi described him and fellow student Hillary Clinton as \"both excellent students [who] had the same kind of reputation\".[74] He received several student deferments from the military draft with the classification 1-A after graduation, but failed the medical exam due to the curvature of his spine.[75]\n\n\nThomas obtained his Juris Doctor on May 20, 1974.[76] After graduation, he sought to enter private practice as a corporate lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia.[77] He has said that the law firms he applied to did not take his degree seriously, assuming he obtained it because of affirmative action.[78] According to Thomas, the law firms also \"asked pointed questions, unsubtly suggesting that they doubted I was as smart as my grades indicated\".[79] In his 2007 memoir, he wrote: \"I peeled a fifteen-cent sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of my law degree to remind myself of the mistake I'd made by going to Yale. I never did change my mind about its value.\"[80]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas is sworn in as Assistant Secretary of Education for the Office for Civil Rights in 1981\nWith no job offers from major law firms, Thomas took a position as an associate with Missouri attorney general John Danforth, who offered him the prospect of practicing what he liked.[81] Thomas moved to Saint Louis to study for the Missouri bar, and was admitted on September 13, 1974.[82] He remained financially destitute even after leaving Yale, trying unsuccessfully on one occasion to make money by selling his blood at a blood bank, and hoped that by working for Danforth he might later acquire a job in private practice.[83][84]\n\n\nFrom 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an assistant attorney general of Missouri—the only African-American member of Danforth's staff. He worked first in the office's criminal appeals division and later in the revenue and taxation division. Thomas conducted lawsuits independently, gaining a reputation as a fair but controversial prosecutor.[85] Years later, after he joined the Supreme Court, Thomas recalled his position in Missouri as \"the best job I've ever had\".[86]\n\n\n\nWhen Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney in Monsanto's legal department in Saint Louis. He found the job unsatisfying, so left to rejoin Danforth in Washington, D.C., as a legislative assistant.[87] From 1979 to 1981, he handled energy issues for the Senate Commerce Committee. Thomas soon drew the attention of officials in the newly elected Reagan Administration as a Black conservative.[88] Pendleton James, Reagan's personnel director, offered Thomas the position of assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Education. Initially reluctant, Thomas agreed after Danforth and others pressed him to take the post.[89]\n\n![](image)Thomas in his office on May 18, 1981President Ronald Reagan nominated Thomas as assistant secretary of education for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on May 1, 1981.[90][91] The Senate received the nomination on May 28, 1981, and Thomas was quickly confirmed before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on June 19, succeeding Cynthia Brown at the age of 32.[92][93] He held the position for a brief period before James offered him a new position as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a promotion that Thomas believed, as with his position in the OCR, was because of his race.[94] After James consulted the President, Thomas hesitantly took up the chair with Reagan's approval.[95]\n\n\nThomas chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 1982 to 1990. As chairman, he was tasked with enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in an agency that had been mutually resented by both Democrats and Republicans. He announced a reorganization of the EEOC and upgraded its record-keeping under an uncompromising leadership that eschewed racial quotas.[94][96] Concerned by the EEOC's limited statutory authority, Thomas sought to impose criminal penalties for employers who practiced employment discrimination, moving to shift funding towards agency investigators. Though he had been critical of affirmative action, Thomas also opposed the Reagan Administration's agenda to remove affirmative action policies, believing it to be a detraction from socioeconomic issues.[97][98]\n\n\nDuring Thomas's tenure, settlement award amounts to victims of discrimination tripled, while the number of suits filed decreased. The EEOC's lack of the use of goals and timetables drew criticism from civil rights advocates, who lobbied representatives to review the EEOC's practices; Thomas testified before Congress more than 50 times. Near the end of his final term, the EEOC came under congressional scrutiny for the mishandling of age-discrimination cases.[99][100]\n\n\n\n## District of Columbia Court of Appeals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with President Ronald Reagan in 1986, while serving as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity CommissionIn early 1989, President George H. W. Bush expressed interest in nominating Thomas to a federal judgeship. Thomas, now at age 41, initially rejected the position, believing himself unready to make a lifetime commitment to being a judge. White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu advocated for his nomination, and Judge Laurence Silberman advised Thomas to accept an appointment.[101] Anticipating Thomas's nomination, a liberal coalition—including the Alliance for Justice and the National Organization for Women (NOW)—emerged to oppose his candidacy.[102]\n\n\nOn October 30, 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[103][104] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65]\n\n\nIn February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[102] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[105]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Thomas was nominated to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall (*pictured*), who announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, due to ill health. Marshall would later give advice to Thomas after the confirmation.[106][107]\nWhen Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\nLiberal interest groups sought to challenge Thomas's nomination by paralleling the same strategy used against Robert Bork's confirmation.[112] Abortion-rights groups, including the National Abortion Rights Action League and the NOW, were concerned that Thomas would be among those to overrule *Roe v. Wade*.[113] Republican officials in turn emphasized his personal history and gathered support from African American interest groups, including the NAACP.[114] Other civil rights organizations, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Urban League, were convinced not to oppose Thomas, believing that he was Bush's last black nominee. On July 31, 1991, the board of directors of the NAACP voted against endorsing Thomas, announcing their opposition to his confirmation the same day.[115]\n\n\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) appraised Thomas as \"qualified\" for the Supreme Court.[116][a] The Bush Administration anticipated that the organization would rate Thomas more poorly than it thought he deserved, so pressured the ABA for at least the mid-level qualified rating while simultaneously discrediting it as partisan.[119] The ABA did rate Thomas as qualified, although with one of the lowest levels of support for a Supreme Court nominee.[120][121] It gave its highest rankings to Thomas in integrity and judicial temperament, and a mid-grade in professional competence.[122]\n\n\nOn September 10, 1991, formal confirmation hearings began before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[123][124] Thomas testified for 25 hours, the second-longest of any Supreme Court nominee.[125] He was reticent when answering senators' questions, recalling what had happened to Robert Bork when Bork expounded on his judicial philosophy during his confirmation hearings four years earlier.[126] As many of his earlier writings frequently referenced natural law, his views on the legal theory became a focus of the hearings. Thomas said he regarded natural law as a \"philosophical background\" to the Constitution.[127][128][129]\n\n\nNinety witnesses testified in favor of or against Thomas.[130] On September 27, 1991, the Judiciary Committee voted 13–1 to send his nomination to the full Senate without recommendation. A motion earlier in the day to give the nomination a favorable recommendation had failed, 7–7,[131] forwarding it to a full Senate vote.[130][132]\n\n\n\n### Anita Hill accusations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Clarence Thomas Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Anita Hill Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 1October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 2October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the committee's confirmation hearings, the Senate was debating whether to give final approval to Thomas's nomination. An FBI interview with Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas at the EEOC, was soon leaked to the press and allegations of sexual harassment followed.[133][134] As a result, on October 8, the final vote was postponed, and the confirmation hearings were reopened. It was only the third time in the Senate's history that such an action was taken and the first since 1925, when Justice Harlan F. Stone's nomination was recommitted to the Judiciary Committee.[132]\n\n\n\nHill was raised in Oklahoma and, like Thomas, graduated from Yale Law School.[135] She told James Brudney, a fellow Yale alumnus, about alleged sexual advances Thomas had made, telling him that she also did not wish to testify or make the allegations public to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hill requested to the staff of Senator Joe Biden, the chair of the committee, that her allegations be made anonymously if she chose to testify and that Thomas not be informed of them, which Biden declined. Hill then notified Democratic staffers the day after the hearings had ended that she wished to make her allegations known to the committee.[136]\n\n![](image)Hill testifying during the second confirmation hearingsHill's allegations were corroborated by Susan Hoerchner, a judge in California, who also wished to remain anonymous.[137][138] Hoerchner called Harriet Grant, a chief counsel to Biden, to inform him of her allegations. She recalled that Thomas told Hill in an elevator at the EEOC that he would ruin her career if she spoke about his behavior.[139] When Grant told Hill and Hoerchner that the FBI would be involved, they were reluctant to be investigated. Hill declined to speak with the FBI, as she feared it would misconstrue her words, so instead arranged to deliver a written statement. The statement described how Thomas pressured her to date him, and included descriptions of him speaking about sexual interests involving pornographic films.[140] Hill also alleged that Thomas spoke of sex at work despite her being uncomfortable with the subject, adding, \"I sensed that my discomfort with his discussions only urged him on, as though my reaction of feeling ill at ease and vulnerable was what he wanted\".[141] The FBI report of its investigation was not made public. The White House announced that the FBI had found the allegations \"without foundation\". Congressional officials who had seen the report told the *New York Times* that \"the bureau could not draw any conclusion because of the 'he said, she said' nature of the subject\".[142][143] The use of the FBI was contentious in the Judiciary Committee because it answers to the president, who was sponsoring Thomas. Biden used the FBI instead of the committee's investigators to avoid the appearance of partisanship.[144]\n\n\n#### Second hearing[edit]\n\n\nThe hearings reconvened on October 11, 1991. Thomas was scheduled to go first, followed by a questioning of Hill by the committee.[145] He denied that he had said or done anything to Hill \"that could have been mistaken for sexual harassment\" and said that he would not answer any questions about his private life so as not to \"provide the rope for my own lynching\".[146]\n\n\nHill then testified for seven hours that ten years earlier Thomas had subjected her to comments of a sexual nature, calling it \"behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court\".[147][148][149] Her testimony included graphic details, and some senators questioned her aggressively.[150][151] Hill accused Thomas of making two sexually offensive remarks to her: comparing his penis to that of Long Dong Silver, a black porn star, and saying he had discovered a pubic hair on his Coca-Cola can.[152][153]\n\n\n\n> \n> And from my standpoint as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, [this proceeding] is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks that in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to the old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the United States Senate rather than hung from a tree.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThomas, testifying as part of his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee[154]\n\nIn the evening, Thomas was recalled before the committee. He again denied the allegations and was prompted by Senator Orrin Hatch's questioning to launch a speech that criticized the proceeding as a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks\".[155] The speech resonated with Southern blacks and stimulated Thomas's supporters,[156] with public opinion shifting in his favor afterward.[157][158]\n\n\nHill was the only person to publicly testify that Thomas had sexually harassed her.[159] Angela Wright, who worked under Thomas at the EEOC and had alleged that \"Thomas had continually pressured her to date him and made sexual comments about women's bodies\",[160][161] and a corroborating witness she had named were not called to testify.[160] Their written depositions were entered into the congressional records unrebutted.[162][163][164] Sukari Hardnett, a former Thomas assistant, wrote to the Senate committee that although Thomas had not harassed her, \"If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female.\"[165]\n\n\nIn addition to Hill and Thomas, the committee heard from several other witnesses over October 11–13.[132] A former colleague, Nancy Altman, who shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education, testified that she heard virtually everything Thomas said over the course of two years and never heard a sexist or offensive comment from him. Altman did not find it credible that Thomas could have engaged in the conduct Hill alleged without any of the dozens of women he worked with noticing it.[166] Senator Alan K. Simpson, a member of the committee, asked why Hill met, dined with, and spoke by phone with Thomas on various occasions after they no longer worked together.[167][168] After the confirmation hearings ended, the event became a focus of divided scholarship, with authors who revisited it reaching varying conclusions.[158]\n\n\n\n### Senate votes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas was sworn in as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court by Justice Byron White on October 23, 1991. His wife, Virginia Thomas, looks on in the foreground.On October 15, 1991, the Senate voted to confirm Thomas as an associate justice, 52–48.[132] Thomas received the votes of 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats, while 46 Democrats and two Republicans voted to reject his nomination.[169]\n\n\nThe 99 days during which Thomas's nomination was pending in the Senate was the second-longest of the 16 nominees receiving a final vote since 1975, second only to Bork's 108 days.[132] The vote to confirm Thomas was the narrowest margin for approval in more than 100 years.[170]\n\n\nThomas received his commission on October 23 and took the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, becoming the Court's 106th justice.[171][b] He was sworn in by Justice Byron White in a ceremony initially scheduled for October 21, which was postponed because of the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist's wife, Natalie.[173][174][175] His first set of law clerks included future judges Gregory Katsas and Gregory Maggs and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau.[176][177]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Vote to confirm the Thomas nomination\n |\n| --- |\n| October 15, 1991\n | Party\n | Total votes\n |\n| Democratic | Republican |\n| **Yea** | **11** | **41** | **52** |\n| Nay\n | 46\n | 02\n | 48\n |\n| **Result: Confirmed** |\n\n\n## Supreme Court of the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait, 2004\nAfter joining the Supreme Court, Thomas emerged as a member of the Court's conservative wing.[178] He aligned himself with Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom he shared an originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, and sided with him in 92 percent of cases during his first 13 years on the bench.[c] Over time, Thomas and Scalia's jurisprudence separated,[d] with Thomas favoring stronger emphasis on the Constitution's original understanding and demonstrating greater willingness to overrule precedent.[186] His appointment represented a decline in the Court's liberal wing, which then comprised only Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun.[187][188]\n\n\nIn his early days on the Court, Thomas adopted a bold style of legal jurisprudence that alienated him from Justices Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor. He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic which embodied his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[189][190]\n\n\nThomas is a proponent of original meaning, incorporating what had been Scalia's narrower approach to the doctrine and the original intent of the Framers of the Constitution, including those espoused in the Declaration of Independence. As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[191][e] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in *stare decisis*, period\".[194][195][f] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[197] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9]\n\n\nThomas has been called the most conservative member of the Supreme Court,[190][198][199] though others gave Scalia that designation while they served on the Court together.[200][201] Thomas's influence, particularly among conservatives, was perceived to have significantly increased during Donald Trump's presidency,[202][203] and Trump appointed many of his former clerks to political positions and judgeships.[204][205][206] As the Supreme Court became more conservative, Thomas and his legal views became more influential on the Court.[207][208][209] This influence increased further by 2022, with Thomas authoring an opinion expanding Second Amendment rights and contributing to the Court's overruling of *Roe v. Wade*. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stare decisis in the U.S. legal system\n![](image)The Roberts Court in 2006Thomas believes the Court should not follow erroneous precedent, a view not currently held by other justices.[213] He has called to reconsider *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan* (1964), and criticized *Roe v. Wade* (1973) and *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963). At a 2013 Federalist Society dinner, Judge Diane S. Sykes asked Thomas whether \"*stare decisis* doesn't hold much force for you?\" He responded, \"Oh, it sure does, but not enough to keep me from going to the Constitution\".[214][215] In 2019, *The New York Times* reported that data gathered by political scientist Stephen L. Wasby of the University at Albany found that Thomas wrote \"more than 250 concurring or dissenting opinions seriously questioning precedents, calling for their reconsideration or suggesting that they be overruled\".[214]\n\n\n\nIn the 2010 gun regulation case *McDonald v. City of Chicago*, Thomas sought to repeal past precedents and insisted that \"*stare decisis* is only an 'adjunct' of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means\".[216] In *Gamble v. United States* (2019), he joined the majority opinion, which revisited an exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause, writing separately to state his position against the Court's prevailing view of multi-factor analysis regarding whether to follow precedent:[217]\n\n\n> In my view, if the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous—i.e., one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text—the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent. Federal courts may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision as precedent, but only when traditional tools of legal interpretation show that the earlier decision adopted a textually permissible interpretation of the law. A demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power.[218]\n> \n> \n\nIn *Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt* (2019),[g] Thomas wrote the 5–4 decision overruling *Nevada v. Hall* (1979), which said states could be sued in courts of other states. In his majority opinion, he noted that *stare decisis* \"is not an inexorable command\". Thomas explicitly disavowed the concept of reliance interests as justification for adhering to precedent. In dissent from *Hyatt III*, Justice Breyer asked what other decisions might eventually be overruled, and suggested *Roe v. Wade* might be among them. Breyer stated that it is best to leave precedents alone unless they are widely seen as erroneous or become impractical.[219]\n\n\n#### Executive power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks with Akhil Reed Amar of the Constitutional Accountability Center in 2012\nThomas has supported a broad interpretation of executive power and has theorized about its constitutional aspects.[9] In *Hamdi v. Rumsfeld* (2004),[h] he dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that courts should have had complete deference to the executive decision to determine that Yaser Esam Hamdi was an enemy combatant.[220] He wrote in *Hamdi* that the president does not have the singular authority to detain a citizen who was captured while in enemy service.[221] In addition, Thomas noted that \"structural advantages [of the Presidency] are most important in the national-security and foreign-affairs contexts\" and thus \"the Founders intended that the President have primary responsibility—along with the necessary power—to protect the national security and to conduct the nation's foreign relations\".[222]\n\n\nThomas was one of three justices to dissent in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* (2006),[i] which concerned whether the president can establish military tribunals to try detained enemy combatants for war crimes conspiracy. As in *Hamdi*, he relied on *The Federalist Papers* in proposing that the president is responsible for protecting national security.[223][224]\n\n\nIn *Zivotofsky v. Kerry* (2015), Thomas relied on the Articles of Confederation for his opinion. He wrote, \"the President is not confined to those powers expressly identified in [the Constitution]\", concluding that residual foreign affairs were vested in the president, not Congress.[225] Rather than finding the original intent or original understanding, Thomas wrote in the case that he sought the \"understanding of executive power [that] prevailed in America\" at the time of the founding.[226]\n\n\nIn the Ninth Circuit case *East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump* (2018), which placed an injunction on the Trump administration's asylum policy, Thomas dissented from a denial of stay application. The Ninth Circuit imposed an injunction on the Trump administration's policy granting asylum only to refugees entering from a designated port of entry, ruling that it violated the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Ninth Circuit Judge Jay Bybee's majority opinion concluded that denial of the ability to apply for asylum regardless of entry point is \"the hollowest of rights that an alien must be allowed to apply for asylum regardless of whether she arrived through a port of entry if another rule makes her categorically ineligible for asylum based on precisely that fact.\" Gorsuch, Alito, Kavanaugh also dissented in the decision to deny a stay to the Ninth Circuit's injunction.[227][228]\n\n\n\n#### Federalism[edit]\n\n\nThomas views federalism as a foundational limit on federal power.[229] In interpreting congressional powers, he has defended strict constructionism—an approach Scalia rejected.[230] On September 24, 1999, Thomas delivered the Dwight D. Opperman Lecture at Drake University Law School on \"Why Federalism Matters\", saying that it was an essential safeguard to protect \"individual liberty and the private ordering of our lives\". He also asserted that federalism enhances self-government, protects individual liberty by separating political power, and checks federal authority.[231] According to law professor Ann Althouse, the Court has yet to move toward \"the broader, more principled version of federalism propounded by Justice Thomas\".[232]\n\n> \n> Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question. And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to action by the States or the people.\n> \n> \n> — Thomas, dissenting in *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton* (1995)[233][229]\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nIn the 1995 case *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton*,[j] parties challenged the constitutionality of an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution that added age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, also affirming the previous rulings of both the state's trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Stevens wrote for the majority. Thomas—joined by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia—dissented in what is to date his lengthiest opinion.[234] He argued that states could impose term limits on members of Congress, as state citizens are \"the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority\".[235] That same year, Thomas concurred in *United States v. Lopez*, which invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for going beyond the Commerce Clause. He opined that the Court had deviated \"from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause\" and that the substantial effects test, \"if taken to its logical extreme, would give Congress a 'police power' over all aspects of American life\".[236]\n\n\nThomas dissented in *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005), which held that the Controlled Substances Act applies to homegrown marijuana, on the grounds of original meaning.[237] His interpretation of the interstate commerce clause differed from Scalia's, and they also held conflicting beliefs about the general welfare clause, the Indian commerce clause, and the necessary and proper clause. Scalia joined the majority opinion, but Thomas disputed the relevance of homegrown marijuana to interstate commerce, writing that if Congress can regulate it, \"it can regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers\".[238][239]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Comstock* (2010),[k] the Supreme Court, in a majority opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, held that the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to enact a law that authorized the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to detain a mentally ill and dangerous federal prisoner beyond the DOJ's original lawful date. Thomas's dissent, joined by Scalia, argued that the clause allows Congress only to execute enumerated powers.[240] When the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* (2012), he authored a short dissent and joined the joint dissent finding the act completely unconstitutional.[241]\n\n\n\n#### Federal statutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas Swears in Sonny Perdue as the 31st Secretary of Agriculture, 2017As of 2007, Thomas was the justice most willing to exercise judicial review of federal statutes but among the least likely to overturn state statutes.[242] According to a *New York Times* editorial, \"from 1994 to 2005 ... Justice Thomas voted to overturn federal laws in 34 cases and Justice Scalia in 31, compared with just 15 for Justice Stephen Breyer\".[243]\n\n\nIn *Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder*, Thomas was the sole dissenter, voting to throw out Section Five of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section Five requires states with a history of racial voter discrimination—mostly states from the old South—to gain Justice Department clearance when revising election procedures. Congress had reauthorized Section Five in 2006 for another 25 years, but Thomas said the law was no longer necessary, stating that the rate of black voting in seven Section Five states was higher than the national average. He wrote, \"the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section 5 and this court to uphold it no longer remains.\"[244] He took this position again in *Shelby County v. Holder*, voting with the majority and concurring with the reasoning that struck down Section Five.[245]\n\n\n\n### Individual rights[edit]\n\n\n#### Free speech and expression[edit]\n\n\nThomas has generally written opinions in favor of protections for free speech.[246][247] He has voted in favor of First Amendment claims in cases involving issues including campaign contributions and commercial speech.[248] A 2002 study by Eugene Volokh found Thomas to be the justice second-most likely to uphold free speech claims (tied with Souter).[249] He has ruled against laws regulating hate speech, as in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul* (1992), *United States v. Stevens* (2010), and *Snyder v. Phelps* (2011).[250] Conversely, he has been reluctant to uphold speech deemed intimidating, as in *Virginia v. Black* (2003).[251][252]\n\n\nThomas's first opinion on free speech was the 1995 case *McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission*,[l] finding that the Founding Era contained the expansive use of anonymous pamphlets and columns. Although he agreed with the result of Justice John Paul Stevens's majority opinion, he disagreed with its methodology and did not join it.[253] With the announcement of *McIntyre*, the Court also decided *Rubin v. Coors Brewing Company*, in which Thomas wrote his first majority opinion concerning free speech. In *Rubin*, Thomas was joined unanimously in ruling unconstitutional a 1935 federal law that prohibited beer labels from disclosing alcohol content. He similarly concurred the next year in *44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island*, which struck down a state law that banned the advertisement of prices of alcoholic beverages.[254]\n\n\n\nIn *Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC* (1996), the Supreme Court ruled against the decision of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to fine the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee for running a political advertisement targeting Senator Tim Wirth. Thomas joined Justice Stephen Breyer's majority opinion in the case, but wrote separately to call against the framework established in the previous campaign finance case of *Buckley v Valeo* (1976):\n\n\n> I believe that contribution limits infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedom of political expression and association as do expenditure limits. The protections of the First Amendment do not depend upon so fine a line as that between spending money to support a candidate or group and giving money to the candidate or group to spend for the same purpose. In principle, people and groups give money to candidates and other groups for the same reason that they spend money in support of those candidates and groups: because they share social, economic, and political beliefs and seek to have those beliefs affect governmental policy.[255]\n> \n> \n\n![](image)The Roberts Court pictured in 2017Thomas has made public his belief that all limits on federal campaign contributions are unconstitutional and should be struck down.[256] In *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010), Thomas joined the majority but dissented in part, arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's disclaimer and disclosure requirements were unconstitutional. He reinforced his defense of anonymous speech in *Doe v. Reed* (2010), writing that the First Amendment protects \"political association\" by means of signing a petition.[257]\n\nIn *Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District* (1969), Justice Hugo Black dissented from the Court's opinion invalidating a school's policy to forbid students from wearing armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. Thomas endorsed Black's dissent in *Morse v. Frederick* (2007), concurring with narrowing the rationale of *Tinker* and arguing that *Tinker* be overruled as it was a constitutionally unsupported \"sea change in students’ speech rights\".[258] In his view, the Constitution does not govern whether public school students may be disciplined for expressive behavior.[259]\n\n\nIn *Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.*—in which a high school punished a student for sending a profane message on social media about her school, softball team, and cheer team—Thomas was the lone dissenter, siding with the school. He criticized the majority for relying on \"vague considerations\" and wrote that historically schools could discipline students in similar situations.[260] In *Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans*, he joined the majority opinion that Texas's decision to deny a request for a Confederate Battle Flag specialty license plate was constitutional.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks at the Library of Congress in September 2012\nThomas agreed with the judgment in *McDonald v. Chicago* (2010) that the right to keep and bear arms is applicable to state and local governments, but he wrote a separate concurrence finding that an individual's right to bear arms is fundamental as a privilege of American citizenship under the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather than as a fundamental right under the due process clause.[262] The four justices in the plurality opinion specifically rejected incorporation under the privileges or immunities clause, \"declin[ing] to disturb\" the holding in the *Slaughter-House Cases*, which, according to the plurality, had held that the clause applied only to federal matters.[263][264]\n\n\nSince 2010, Thomas has dissented from denial of certiorari in several Second Amendment cases. He voted to grant certiorari in *Friedman v. City of Highland Park* (2015), which upheld bans on certain semi-automatic rifles; *Jackson v. San Francisco* (2014), which upheld trigger lock ordinances similar to those struck down in *Heller*; *Peruta v. San Diego County* (2016), which upheld restrictive concealed carry licensing in California; and *Silvester v. Becerra* (2017), which upheld waiting periods for firearm purchasers who have already passed background checks and already own firearms. He was joined by Scalia in the first two cases, and by Gorsuch in *Peruta*.[265][266][267][268]\n\n\nThomas dissented from the denial of an application for a stay presented to Chief Justice Roberts in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case *Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives* (2019), a case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. Only Thomas and Gorsuch publicly dissented.[269]\n\n\nThomas authored the majority opinion in *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (2022), guaranteeing the right of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in public. The case held: \"When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.'\" Justice Stephen Breyer, dissenting, wrote, \"when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms.\"\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson, 2007\nIn cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, Thomas often favors police over defendants. For example, his opinion for the Court in *Board of Education v. Earls* upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the Court in *Samson v. California*, permitting random searches on parolees. He dissented in *Georgia v. Randolph*, which prohibited warrantless searches that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the Court's decision in *Coolidge v. New Hampshire* controlled the case. In *Indianapolis v. Edmond*, Thomas described the Court's extant case law as having held that \"suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops.\" He expressed doubt that those cases were decided correctly but concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the Court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.[270] Thomas was in the majority in *Kyllo v. United States*, which held that the use of thermal imaging technology to probe a suspect's home without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\nIn cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of *in loco parentis*,[271] which he defines as \"parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order\".[272] His dissent in *Safford Unified School District v. Redding* illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the *Safford* case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the Court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a strip search or the like.[272] All the justices except Thomas concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. Thomas wrote, \"It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not\"[273] and \"reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed\". He added, \"[t]here can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search.\"[272]\n\n\n\n#### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doggett v. United States*, the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The Court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.[274] Thomas dissented, arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause's purpose was to prevent \"'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'\" and that the case implicated neither.[274] He cast the case instead as \"present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime\". Thomas dissented from the court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.[274] He wrote that dismissing the conviction \"invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role\".[275]\n\n\nIn *Garza v. Idaho*, Thomas and Gorsuch, in dissent, suggested that *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963), which required that indigent criminal defendants be provided counsel, was wrongly decided and should be overruled.[214]\n\n\n\n##### Eighth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nThomas was among the dissenters in *Atkins v. Virginia* and *Roper v. Simmons*, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of the death penalty to certain classes of persons. In *Kansas v. Marsh*, his opinion for the Court indicated a belief that the Constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of *Furman v. Georgia* and *Gregg v. Georgia*, the 1976 case in which the Court reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.[*citation needed*]\n\n![](image)Thomas speaking to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in 2017\nIn *Hudson v. McMillian*, a prisoner had been beaten, sustaining a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. Although these were not \"serious injuries\", the Court believed, it held that \"the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\"[276] Dissenting, Thomas wrote, \"a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents.\"[276] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the Court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).[277] His opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, it ignored \"the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment\".[276] According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in *Hudson* was a \"classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him\".[278] Thomas later responded to the accusation \"that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion.\"[278]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Bajakajian*, Thomas joined with the Court's liberal justices to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was \"grossly disproportional\" and violated the Excessive Fines Clause.[279]\n\n\nThomas has written that the \"Cruel and Unusual Punishment\" clause \"contains no proportionality principle\", meaning that the question whether a sentence should be rejected as \"cruel and unusual\" depends only on the sentence itself, not on what crime is being punished.[280] He was concurring with the Court's decision to reject a request for review from a petitioner who had been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison under California's \"Three-Strikes\" law for stealing some golf clubs because the combined value of the clubs made the theft a felony and he had two previous felonies in his criminal record.\n\n\n\n#### Race, equal protection, and affirmative action[edit]\n\n\nThomas believes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In *Adarand Constructors v. Peña*, he wrote, \"there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\"[281]\n\n\nIn *Gratz v. Bollinger*, Thomas wrote, \"a State's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\"[282] In *Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1*, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"[283] Concurring, Thomas wrote, \"if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories\", and charged that the dissent carried \"similarities\" to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in *Brown v. Board of Education*.[283]\n\n\nLikewise, in *Grutter v. Bollinger*, Thomas approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's *Plessy v. Ferguson* dissent: \"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\"[284] In a concurrence in *Missouri v. Jenkins* (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court \"has read our cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority.\"[285]\n\n\nSome legal scholars have called Thomas's views on race and the constitution \"idiosyncratic\",[286] \"pessimistic\", or \"fatalistic\".[287] For example, professors Corey Robin and Stephen F. Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard*, which struck down affirmative action in college admissions. He filed a concurring opinion, which he read from the bench, a rare practice for Supreme Court justices.[291]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion and family planning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Thomas administers the oath of office to Amy Coney Barrett (Oct 26, 2020)\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Casey* (1992), the Court reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*. Thomas and Justice Byron White joined the dissenting opinions of Rehnquist and Scalia. Rehnquist wrote, \"[w]e believe *Roe* was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to *stare decisis* in constitutional cases.\"[293] Scalia's opinion concluded that the right to obtain an abortion is not \"a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States\".[293] \"[T]he Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,\" Scalia wrote, \"and [ ] the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed\".[293]\n\n\nIn *Stenberg v. Carhart* (2000), the Court struck down a state ban on partial-birth abortion, concluding that it failed *Casey*'s \"undue burden\" test. Thomas dissented, writing, \"Although a State *may* permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State *must* do so.\"[294][*citation needed*] He went on to criticize the reasoning of the *Casey* and *Stenberg* majorities: \"The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States—a hostility that *Casey* purported to reject.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Gonzales v. Carhart* (2007), the Court rejected a facial challenge to a federal ban on partial-birth abortion.[295][*citation needed*] Concurring, Thomas asserted that the court's abortion jurisprudence had no basis in the Constitution but that the court had accurately applied that jurisprudence in rejecting the challenge.[295][*citation needed*] He added that the Court was not deciding the question of whether Congress had the power to outlaw partial-birth abortions: \"[W]hether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court [in this case] ... the parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it.\"[295][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Thomas dissented when the Court voted not to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[296] Alito and Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissent, arguing that the Court was \"abdicating its judicial duty\".[297]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Thomas joined three of the Court's other conservative justices in voting to reject a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[298] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would have required that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[299]\n\n\nIn *Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.* (2019), a per curiam decision upholding the provision of Indiana's abortion restriction regarding fetal remains disposal on rational basis scrutiny and upholding the lower court rulings striking down the provision banning race, sex, and disability, Thomas wrote a concurring opinion comparing abortion and birth control to eugenics, which was practiced in the U.S. in the early 20th century and by the Nazi government in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, and comparing *Box* to *Buck v. Bell* (1927), which upheld a forced sterilization law regarding people with mental disabilities. In his opinion, Thomas quoted Margaret Sanger's support for contraception as a form of personal reproductive control that she considered superior to \"the horrors of abortion and infanticide\" (Sanger's words).[300][*citation needed*] His opinion referred several times to historian/journalist Adam Cohen's book *Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck*; shortly afterward, Cohen published a sharply worded criticism saying that Thomas had misinterpreted his book and misunderstood the history of the eugenics movement.[301] In *Box*, only Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ginsburg publicly registered their votes. Ginsburg and Sotomayor concurred in part and dissented in part, stating they would have upheld the lower court decision on striking down the race, sex, and disability ban as well as the lower court decision striking down the fetal remains disposal provision.[300][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a concurring opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), Thomas wrote that \"any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\",[*citation needed*] and argued that the Supreme Court should go beyond *Roe vs. Wade* and reconsider other substantive due process precedents, including those established in *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965), *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003) and *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015). The overturning of these previous decisions would enable states to limit access to contraception, criminalize sodomy, and criminalize same-sex marriage, respectively.[302][303][304]\n\n\n\n#### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Evans* (1996), Thomas joined Scalia's dissenting opinion arguing that Amendment Two to the Colorado State Constitution did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Colorado amendment forbade any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on \"homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships\".[305][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003), Thomas issued a one-page dissent in which he called the Texas statute prohibiting sodomy \"uncommonly silly\", a phrase originally used by Justice Potter Stewart. He then said that if he were a member of the Texas legislature he would vote to repeal the law, as it was not a worthwhile use of \"law enforcement resources\" to police private sexual behavior. But Thomas opined that the Constitution does not contain a right to privacy and therefore did not vote to strike the statute down. He saw the issue as a matter for states to decide for themselves.[306][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia* (2020), Thomas joined Alito and Kavanaugh in dissenting from the decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. (Thomas and Alito wrote a dissent together, and Kavanaugh wrote separately.) The 6–3 ruling's majority consisted of two Republican-appointed justices, Roberts and Gorsuch, along with four Democratic-appointed justices: Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.[307]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from *Obergefell v. Hodges* and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[308][309][310] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[311][312][313] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6-3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[314] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[315][316]\n\n\n\n### Oral arguments[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[317][318] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[319] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006.[320]\n\n\nThomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic;[321][322][323][320] before that, he had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question to each advocate.[325]\n\n\nThomas has given many reasons for his silence, including self-consciousness about how he speaks, a preference for listening to those arguing the case, and difficulty getting in a word.[319] His speaking and listening habits may have been influenced by his Gullah upbringing, during which his English was relatively unpolished.[18][62][326] In a 2017 paper in *Northwestern University Law Review*, RonNell Andersen Jones and Aaron L. Nielson wrote that while asking few questions, \"in many ways, [Thomas] is a model questioner.\"[327][328]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas and his wife, Ginni Thomas, on their wedding day in 1987\nIn 1971, Thomas married Kathy Grace Ambush. The couple had one child, Jamal Adeen, born in 1973, who is Thomas's sole child. Thomas and his first wife separated in 1981 and divorced in 1984.[329][330] In 1987, Thomas married Virginia Lamp, a lobbyist and aide to U.S. Representative Dick Armey.[331] In 1997, they took in Thomas's six-year-old great-nephew, Mark Martin Jr.,[332] who had lived with his mother in Savannah public housing.[333] Since 1999, Thomas and his wife have traveled across the U.S. in a motorcoach between Court terms.[334][335]\n\n\nVirginia \"Ginni\" Thomas has remained active in conservative politics, serving as a consultant to The Heritage Foundation and as founder and president of Liberty Central.[336] In 2011, she stepped down from Liberty Central to open a conservative lobbying firm, touting her \"experience and connections\", meeting with newly elected Republican representatives and calling herself an \"ambassador to the Tea Party\".[337][338] Also in 2011, 74 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote that Justice Thomas should recuse himself on cases regarding the Affordable Care Act because of \"appearance of a conflict of interest\" based on his wife's work.[339]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* reported in February 2021 that Ginni Thomas apologized to a group of Thomas's former clerks on the email listserv \"Thomas Clerk World\" for her role in contributing to a rift relating to \"pro-Trump postings and former Thomas clerk John Eastman, who spoke at the rally and represented Trump in some of his failed lawsuits filed to overturn the election results\".[340] In March 2022, texts between Ginni Thomas and Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows from 2020 were turned over to the Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[341] The texts show Ginni Thomas repeatedly urging Meadows to overturn the election results and repeating conspiracy theories about ballot fraud.[342] In response, 24 Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate demanded that Thomas recuse himself from cases related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol on the grounds that Ginni Thomas's involvement in such efforts raised questions about his impartiality.[343] An April 2022 Quinnipiac poll found that 52% of Americans agreed that, in light of Ginni Thomas's texts about overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, Thomas should have recused himself from related cases.[344]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThomas was reconciled to the Catholic Church in the mid-1990s.[345] In his autobiography, he criticized the church for failing to grapple with racism in the 1960s during the civil rights movement, saying it was not so \"adamant about ending racism then as it is about ending abortion now\".[346] As of 2021, Thomas is one of 14 practicing Catholic justices in the Court's history and one of six currently serving (along with Alito, Kavanaugh, Roberts, Sotomayor and Barrett).[347]\n\n\n\n### Literary influences[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, when Thomas read economist Thomas Sowell's *Race and Economics*, he found an intellectual foundation for his philosophy.[348][349] The book criticizes social reform by government and argues for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. Ayn Rand's works also influenced him, particularly *The Fountainhead*, and he later required his staffers to watch the 1949 film version of the novel.[350][351] Thomas acknowledges \"some very strong libertarian leanings\", though he does not consider himself a libertarian.[352]\n\n\nThomas has said novelist Richard Wright is the most influential writer in his life; Wright's books *Native Son* and *Black Boy* \"capture[d] a lot of the feelings that I had inside that you learn how to repress\".[329] *Native Son* and Ralph Ellison's *Invisible Man* are Thomas's two favorite novels.[185]\n\n\n\n### Moira Smith allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Moira Smith, vice-president and general counsel of a natural gas distributor in Alaska, said that Thomas groped her buttocks at a dinner party in 1999. She was a Truman Foundation scholar helping the director of the foundation set up for a dinner party honoring Thomas and David Adkins. Smith's roommates at the time confirmed that she had told them about the incident. Thomas denied the allegation.[353][354]\n\n\nLouis Blair, who was the head of the Truman Foundation and hosted the dinner at his home, said he had \"no recollection of the incident\" and that he had neither seen nor heard of Smith's allegation. Blair acknowledged that he was in the kitchen most of the time so, if the incident happened, he wouldn't have seen it, but was also \"skeptical that the justice and Moira would have been alone\", given that there were approximately 16 people in three rooms.[355][356] Norma Stevens, who attended the event, said that the incident \"couldn't have happened\" because Thomas was never alone, as he was the guest of honor.[357]\n\n\n\n### Nondisclosure of finances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Crow's foundation gave $105,000 to Yale Law School, Thomas's alma mater, for the \"Justice Thomas Portrait Fund\", tax filings show.[360]\n\n\nIn 2011, *Politico* reported that Crow gave $500,000 to a Tea Party group founded by Thomas's wife and that Thomas had failed to report her income on his disclosure for more than a decade.[361][362] Also that year, the advocacy group Common Cause reported that between 2003 and 2007, Thomas failed to disclose $686,589 in income his wife earned from The Heritage Foundation, instead reporting \"none\" where \"spousal noninvestment income\" would be reported on his Supreme Court financial disclosure forms.[363] The next week, Thomas said the disclosure of his wife's income had been \"inadvertently omitted due to a misunderstanding of the filing instructions\".[364] He amended reports going back to 1989.[365]\n\n\nIn April 2023, ProPublica reported that Thomas had \"accepted luxury trips virtually every year\" from Crow for two decades and failed to report them. They included flights on Crow's private jet, cruises on Crow's superyacht at locations around the globe, and stays at Crow's private resort in the Adirondacks and the private club Bohemian Grove.[360][366][362] The Ethics in Government Act requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to annually disclose gifts they receive.[367] Many elected officials criticized the appearance of impropriety, given Crow's donations to conservative causes and Republican candidates, and his service on the Board of Trustees for the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, which have filed amicus briefs before the Supreme Court.[368][360]\n\n\nAlso in April 2023, ProPublica reported that one of Crow's companies bought a house and two empty lots on a residential street in Savannah, Georgia, for $133,000 in 2014. The properties were owned in equal parts by Thomas, his mother, and the family of his deceased brother. Thomas did not report the sale on the disclosure form he filed for 2014. Crow's company also paid for extensive renovations of the house, where Thomas's mother still lives.[369][362]\n\n\nIn May 2023, ProPublica reported that Crow had paid for private school tuition for Thomas's grandnephew, Mark Martin, of whom Thomas had legal custody. Thomas did not report the payments on his financial disclosure forms, while ethics law experts said that they were required to be disclosed as gifts. A bank statement[370] showed that monthly tuition at Hidden Lake Academy, one of the two schools Crow paid for, was $6,200. Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas, said that Crow paid for one year each at Hidden Lake and Randolph-Macon Academy, which ProPublica estimated to total around $100,000.[371][362]\n\n\nOn the same day, *The Washington Post* reported that in January 2012 conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo had Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway's polling firm bill the Judicial Education Project $25,000, which her firm then paid to Ginni Thomas's firm, Liberty Consulting, for a total of $80,000 between June 2011 and June 2012. Leo instructed Conway not to mention Thomas's name on the paperwork. The documents the newspaper reviewed did not indicate the nature of the work Thomas did for the Judicial Education Project or Conway's company. In 2012 the Judicial Education Project filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case.[372][362]\n\n\nIn 2023, *The New York Times* reported that a friend had paid for Thomas's Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon RV, purchased for $267,230 in 1999 (roughly equivalent to $489,000 in 2023). Anthony Welters, a former UnitedHealthcare executive and a close friend, lent Thomas the purchase price. In response to a Senate inquiry, Welters revealed that the loan was discharged in 2008, forgiving much of the original balance. A bank would have been unlikely to offer such a loan, given the Marathon's high capacity for customization, which can make used models difficult to appraise. Thomas had previously said that he \"had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach\", according to the *Times*, and a friend, Armstrong Williams, said that Thomas had told him that \"he saved up all his money to buy it\". When the loan was forgiven, Thomas was required to disclose the money as a gift.[373][374][375][362]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Thomas filed his financial disclosure report for 2022, listing three trips on Crow's jets.[376][377]\n\n\n\n## Honors and recognition[edit]\n\n\nThomas was awarded the 1992 Horatio Alger Award by the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans.[378] In 2001, Thomas was awarded the Francis Boyer Award presented by the American Enterprise Institute.[379] In 2012, Thomas received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, his alma mater.[380] In 2020, Belmont Abbey College awarded him the Benedict Leadership Award for his devotion to the Catholic faith and government service.[381]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* In the 1996 film *Jerry Maguire*, after Tom Cruise's character makes a pass at his employee (played by Renee Zellweger), he apologizes with, \"I feel like Clarence Thomas.\"[382]\n* Wendell Pierce portrayed Thomas in the 2016 film *Confirmation*.\n* In May 2023, Michael Kirk directed a *Frontline* documentary about Thomas's life and career, narrated by Will Lyman.[383][384] John Danforth, who was interviewed for the documentary, wrote in an op-ed published in *The Wall Street Journal* that the excerpts of his interview included in the film were only \"biographical filler\" and criticized the film as a whole as \"a two-hour hit job on the character of Clarence Thomas\".[385]\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\n* \"Why Black Americans Should Look to Conservative Policies\". *The Heritage Lectures*.

In that same period, Thomas was the third-most-frequent dissenter on the Court, behind Stevens and Scalia.[179] Scalia's and Thomas's agreement rate peaked in 1996 at 98%.[179] By 2004, other pairs of justices were more closely aligned than Scalia and Thomas.[180]\n4. **^** Thomas's close early association with Scalia came under scrutiny by critics in multiple law review articles. In November 1996, *Emerge* magazine titled him as \"Uncle Thomas: Lawn Jockey of the Far Right\".[181] Linda Greenhouse observed that Thomas voted with Scalia 91% of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time.[182] Biographer Jan Crawford noted that Scalia often joined Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.[183][184] Biographer Corey Robin has called the idea that Thomas followed Scalia's votes a debunked myth.[185]\n5. **^** Thomas's jurisprudence has also been compared to that of Justice Hugo Black, who \"resisted the tendency to create social policy out of 'whole cloth.'\" According to the same critic, Thomas generally declines to engage in judicial lawmaking, viewing the Court's constitutional role as the interpretation of law, rather than making law.[192][193]\n6. **^** In 2005, while an assistant professor of law at Notre Dame Law School, future-Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that Thomas supports statutory *stare decisis*. Her examples included his concurring opinion in *Fogerty v. Fantasy* (1994).[196]\n7. **^** \"Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt\" (PDF). U.S. Supreme Court. 2018.

And in the transcript of your October 7 interview, you responded to a question saying that it was sexual harassment.  \n\n\"A: In my opinion, based on my reading of the law, yes, it was. But later on, immediately following that response, I noted to the press that I did not raise a claim of sexual harassment in this complaint. It seems to me that the behavior has to be evaluated on its own with regard to the fitness of this individual to act as an Associate Justice. It seems to me that even if it does not rise to the level of sexual harassment, it is behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court.\"\n149. **^** Pollitt, Katha. *Subject to Debate: Sense and Dissents on Women, Politics, and Culture*, page 161 (2001): \"The question Hill's testimony placed before us was not whether Thomas was guilty of a legally actionable offense (she herself was unsure if his behavior added up to sexual harassment) but whether he belonged on the Supreme Court.\"\n150. **^** Segers, Grace (September 19, 2018). \"Here are some of the questions Anita Hill answered in 1991\".

He was nominated to the high court by President George W. Bush on October 31, 2005, and has served on it since January 31, 2006. After Antonin Scalia, Alito is the second Italian American justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court; he is also the eleventh Catholic Supreme Court justice in U.S. history.\n\n\nAlito was raised in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Yale Law School. After graduating from law school, he worked as an assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel and served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1990, Alito was appointed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where he served until joining the Supreme Court. He has called himself a \"practical originalist\" and has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".\n\n\nAlito wrote the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), in which the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 abortion rights decision *Roe v. Wade*. He has also written majority opinions in the landmark cases *McDonald v. Chicago*, *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, *Murphy v. NCAA*, and *Janus v. AFSCME*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAlito was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the son of Samuel A. Alito Sr., an Italian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata.[1][2][3] Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito's mother was a schoolteacher. Both are deceased.[4]\n\n\nAlito grew up in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Trenton.[5] He attended Steinert High School, where he graduated in 1968 as the class valedictorian,[6] subsequently matriculating at Princeton University. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[7] His senior thesis, supervised by political scientist Walter F. Murphy, was entitled \"An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court\".[8]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito chaired a student conference in 1971 called \"The Boundaries of Privacy in American Society\", which supported curbs on domestic intelligence gathering and anticipated the need for a statute and a court to oversee national security surveillance.[9] The conference report itself also called for the decriminalization of sodomy, and urged for an end to discrimination against gays in hiring by employers. Alito also led the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel during his time at Princeton.[10] He avoided Princeton's eating clubs, joining Stevenson Hall instead.[11]\n\n\nIn December 1969, while a sophomore at Princeton, Alito received a low lottery number of 32 in the Selective Service drawing. He became a member of the school's Army ROTC program.[12][a] Alito was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve in 1972. He began his military duty after graduating from law school in 1975 and served on active duty from September to December while attending the Signal Officer Basic Course at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Alito was promoted to first lieutenant and captain, and completed his service obligation as a member of the inactive reserve before being honorably discharged in 1980.[12]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito was \"almost alone\" in his familiarity with the writings of John Marshall Harlan II[14] and was much influenced by the course on constitutional interpretation taught by Walter F. Murphy, also his faculty adviser.[14] During his senior year at Princeton, Alito moved out of New Jersey for the first time to study in Italy, where he wrote his thesis on the Italian legal system.[15] Graduating in 1972, Alito left a sign of his lofty aspirations in his yearbook, which said that he hoped to \"eventually warm a seat on the Supreme Court\".[16]\n\n\nAlito then attended Yale Law School, where he served as an editor of the *Yale Law Journal* and earned a Juris Doctor in 1975.[7]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Alito clerked for Third Circuit appeals judge Leonard I. Garth in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976 and 1977.[15] He interviewed with Supreme Court Justice Byron White for a clerkship but was not hired.[17] Between 1977 and 1981, Alito was Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Jersey.[18] There, he served under the then-chief of the appeals division Assistant U.S. Attorney, Maryanne Trump Barry (Barry later became a federal judge).[19] While an Assistant U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted many cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime.[20]\n\n\nFrom 1981 to 1985, Alito was Assistant to U.S. Solicitor General Rex E. Lee. In that capacity he argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court for the federal government.[21] In *Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists* (1986), the Supreme Court ruled against Charles Fried after he rejected a memo by Alito urging the Solicitor General to avoid directly attacking the constitutional right to an abortion.[22] Alito lost only two of the cases he argued before the Supreme Court.[23]\n\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Alito was Deputy Assistant Attorney General under Charles J. Cooper in the Office of Legal Counsel during the tenure of Attorney General Edwin Meese. John F. Manning worked under Alito there.[11] Between 1986 and 1987, Alito authored nearly 470 pages of memoranda, in which he argued for expanding his client's law enforcement and personnel authorities.[24] In his 1985 application for Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Alito espoused conservative views, naming William F. Buckley, Jr., the *National Review*, Alexander Bickel, and Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign as major influences. He also expressed concern about Warren Court decisions in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.[25]\n\n\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Alito was the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.[26] When he arrived, the office had begun the prosecution of 20 defendants accused of being mob affiliates of Anthony Accetturo.[27] In August 1988, the two-year trial, then the longest federal criminal trial in history, ended in the acquittal of all 20 after less than two days of jury deliberations.[28] Alito soon hired Michael Chertoff as his chief deputy.[28]\n\n\nAfter an FBI agent was shot in the line of duty in 1988, Alito personally handled the trial, assigning himself the then-novice Stuart Rabner as an assistant, and securing the shooter's conviction.[28] In March 1988, Alito sought a rehearing of extradition proceedings against two Indian men, represented by Ron Kuby, who were accused of being terrorist assassins, after Alito discovered that the death threats his prosecutor had received had been sent to her by herself.[29] The prosecutor was later found not guilty of obstruction of justice by reason of insanity, after psychiatrists found she may have suffered from schizophrenia, with up to four distinct personalities.[28][30] In 1989, Alito prosecuted a member of the Japanese Red Army for planning a terrorist bombing in Manhattan.[31]\n\n\nAlito is a member of the Federalist Society, a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers and legal students interested in conservative legal theory.[32]\n\n\n\n## Court of Appeals judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThird Circuit Judges Leonard I. Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney, recommended Alito's judicial nomination to President George H. W. Bush.[19] On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons. The American Bar Association rated Alito \"Well Qualified\" at the time of his nomination. He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990,[33][34] and received his commission three days later. As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey.[15]\n\n\n\n### Notable opinions[edit]\n\n\nAbortion\n* On a Third Circuit panel, the majority in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* overturned one part of a law regulating abortion, the provision mandating that married women first inform their husbands if they sought an abortion. Alito, the third judge on the panel, disagreed, arguing that he would have upheld the spousal notification requirement along with the rest of the law.\n\n\nFederalism\n* A dissenting opinion in *United States v. Rybar*, 103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 1996), arguing that a U.S. law banning private citizens from owning submachine guns was similar to one struck down by the Supreme Court in *United States v. Lopez* and thus outside the authority of Congress under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n* A majority opinion in *Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development*, 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under the Family and Medical Leave Act against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. States are free to maintain sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee's claims.\n\n\nFirst Amendment\n* A majority opinion in *Saxe v. State College Area School District*, 240 F.3d 200 (3d Cir. 2001), holding that a public school district's anti-harassment policy was unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore violated First Amendment guarantees of free speech.\n* A majority opinion in *ACLU v. Schundler*, 168 F.3d 92 (3d Cir. 1999), holding that a government-sponsored holiday display consisting solely of religious symbols was impermissible, but that a mixed display including both secular and religious symbols was permissible if balanced in a generally secular context.\n* A dissenting opinion in *C. H. v. Oliva* (3d Cir. 2000), arguing that the removal and subsequent replacement in \"a less conspicuous spot\" of a kindergartener's religious themed poster was, at least potentially, a violation of his right to free expression.\n\n\nFourth and Eighth Amendments\n* A dissenting opinion in *Doe v. Groody*, arguing that qualified immunity should have protected police officers from a finding of having violated constitutional rights when they strip-searched a mother and her ten-year-old daughter while carrying out a search warrant that authorized the search of a residence.\n* A unanimous opinion in *Chadwick v. Janecka* (3d Cir. 2002), holding that there was \"no federal constitutional bar\" to the \"indefinite confinement\" of a man imprisoned for civil contempt because he would not pay his $2.5 million debt to his wife.\n\n\nCivil rights\n* A majority opinion in *Williams v. Price*, 343 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2003), granting a writ of habeas corpus to a black state prisoner after state courts had refused to consider the testimony of a witness who stated that a juror had uttered derogatory remarks about blacks during an encounter in the courthouse after the conclusion of the trial.[35]\n* A dissenting opinion in *Glass v. Philadelphia Electric Company*, 34 F.3d 188 (3rd Cir. 1994), arguing that a lower court did not abuse its discretion in excluding certain evidence of past conduct that defendant had created a hostile and racist work environment.\n* A majority opinion in *Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh*, 120 F.3d 1286 (3rd Cir. 1997), rejecting a female police officer's Equal Protection-based sexual harassment and retaliation claims against the city and certain police officials and rejecting her Title VII-based retaliation claim against the city, but allowing her Title VII-based sexual harassment claim against the city.\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Bush looking on, Alito acknowledges his nomination.\nOn July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor. President George W. Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship. On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor. Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.\n\n\nOn October 31, Bush announced that he was nominating Alito to O'Connor's seat, and he submitted the nomination to the Senate on November 10.[36] Alito was unanimously rated \"well qualified\" to fill the Associate Justice post by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, which measures the professional qualifications of a nominee.[37] The committee rates judges as \"not qualified\", \"qualified\", or \"well qualified\".[38] Leonard Leo was selected to play a role in shepherding Alito's appointment through the Senate.[39]\n\n\nAlito's confirmation hearing was held from January 9 to 13, 2006. Two active-duty members of the Third Circuit, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica, testified in Alito's confirmation hearing, as did five senior and retired circuit judges.[40] Alito responded to some 700 questions over 18 hours of testimony. He rejected the use of foreign legal materials in the Constitution, did not state a position on cameras in courtrooms (he had supported them while on the 3rd Circuit), said Congress could choose to outlaw LGBT employment discrimination in the United States if it wished, and told then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) that he endorsed a weak version of the unitary executive theory.[41]\n\n\nOn January 24, his nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard-right conservative in the mold of Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. He said he would look at abortion with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on *Roe v. Wade* if that decision were to be challenged. \n\n\nDemocrats on the committee asked Alito about his past association with the conservative group Concerned Alumni of Princeton.[42] Alito said that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to Ronald Reagan's Justice Department in order to establish his conservative credentials: \"You have to look at the question that I was responding to and the form that I was filling out... I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration. And my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position.\"[43] But during the confirmation hearings, he disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: \"I disavow them. I deplore them. They represent things that I have always stood against and I can't express too strongly.\"[43]\n\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) formally opposed Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court. The ACLU has only taken this step three other times in its entire history, opposing the nominations of William Rehnquist, Robert Bork and Brett Kavanaugh.[44][*better source needed*] In releasing its report[45][*better source needed*] on Alito, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, \"At a time when our president has claimed unprecedented authority to spy on Americans and jail terrorism suspects indefinitely, America needs a Supreme Court justice who will uphold our precious civil liberties. Alito's record shows a willingness to support government actions that abridge individual freedoms.\"[46][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito ceremonially sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts the day after his confirmation, February 1, 2006.\nDebate on the nomination began in the full Senate on January 25. After a failed filibuster attempt by Senator John Kerry, the Senate confirmed Alito to the Supreme Court on January 31 by a vote of 58–42.[47] All Senate Republicans voted in favor of confirmation except Lincoln Chafee, and all Senate Democrats voted against confirmation except Tim Johnson, Robert Byrd, Kent Conrad, and Ben Nelson. An Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against confirmation.[48][49] Alito was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court later that day.[50][51] He became the 110th justice, the second Italian-American,[52][53] the 11th Catholic in the history of the Supreme Court, and the fifth Catholic on the Court at the time he assumed office.[54]\n\n\nBecause Alito joined the Court mid-term, he did not participate in the decisions of most of the early cases in the Court term because he had not heard arguments for them. These decisions were released with an 8-member Court; none were 4–4, so Alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated. Only three of these cases  – *Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan*, and *Kansas v. Marsh*  – were reargued since a tie needed to be broken.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAlito delivered his first written Supreme Court opinion on May 1, 2006, in *Holmes v. South Carolina*, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. From the beginning of the Rehnquist Court to the nomination of Justice Elena Kagan, each new justice has been given a unanimous opinion to write as their first Supreme Court opinion; this practice is designed to help \"break in\" new justices so that each justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt.[*original research?*] Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in *Zedner v. United States*, *Woodford v. Ngo*, and *Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy*.\n\n\nIn his first term, Alito compiled a fairly conservative record.[*original research?*] For example, in the three reargued cases (*Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan* and *Kansas v. Marsh*), Alito created a 5–4 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices – Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on *Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon*[55] and *Rapanos v. United States*. Alito also dissented in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* alongside Justices Scalia and Thomas.\n\n\nAlito delivered the Supreme Court Historical Society's 2008 Annual Lecture, \"The Origin of the Baseball Antitrust Exemption\". The lecture was published in two journals.[56][57]\n\n\nIn 2013, Alito was considered[*by whom?*] \"one of the most conservative justices on the Court\".[58][59][60] While his voting record is conservative, he does not always join the opinions of the Court's other conservative justices.[*original research?*] On February 1, 2006, in Alito's first decision on the Supreme Court, he voted with the majority (6–3) to refuse Missouri's request to vacate the stay of execution issued by the Eighth Circuit for death-row inmate Michael Taylor. Justices Roberts, Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay; Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution.[61] Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed \"Scalito\", Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case and various other cases of the 2005 term.[*original research?*] A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation,[*citation needed*] Scalia was the only member of the Court in *Zedner v. United States* not to join a section of Alito's opinion that discussed the legislative history of the statute in question. In two higher-profile cases, one involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and one involving campaign finance reform (*LULAC v. Perry* and *Randall v. Sorrell*), Alito adopted narrow positions, declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the Court.[*original research?*] According to a SCOTUSblog analysis of 2005 term decisions, Alito and Scalia concurred in the result of 86% of decisions in which both participated, and concurred in full in 75%.[62] Alito also differed from Scalia in applying originalism flexibly to arrive at conservative outcomes \"with plodding consistency\", rather than following it so strictly as to occasionally produce outcomes unfavorable to conservatives.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito swearing in Mark Esper as the United States Secretary of Defense in 2019.\nAlito's majority opinion in the 2008 worker protection case *Gomez-Perez v. Potter* cleared the way for federal workers who experience retaliation after filing age discrimination complaints to sue for damages. He sided with the liberal bloc of the court,[*original research?*] inferring protection against retaliation in the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act despite the lack of an explicit provision concerning retaliation.\n\n\nAlito joined Thomas in writing a separate dissent in *Obergefell v. Hodges*.[64][65][66] In 2020, Alito wrote a dissent joined by Thomas to *Bostock v. Clayton County*, arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination by sexual orientation or gender identity and criticizing the majority's interpretation of Title VII.[67][68] In October 2020, Alito agreed with the other justices on the denial of an appeal filed by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n\nOn November 12, 2020, Alito made headlines for comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to the Federalist Society, Alito criticized what he called the \"loss of individual liberties\", saying, \"We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020\" and calling the pandemic \"a Constitutional stress test\".[69]\n\n\nAlito has called himself a \"practical originalist\"[70] and is a member of the Court's conservative bloc.[71] He has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".[59][58][72][73]\n\n\nAccording to *The New Yorker*, since the 2020 appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Alito has become \"the embodiment of a conservative majority that is ambitious and extreme\", overruling progressive precedents from the 1960s and '70s that were previously out of conservatives' reach.[63]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Alito, 2018\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of *Gonzales v. Carhart*. The Court had previously ruled in *Stenberg v. Carhart* that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after *Stenberg*, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in *Roe*) and O'Connor (a supporter of *Roe*) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in *Gonzales v. Carhart* was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the *Stenberg* case.\n\n\nOn April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy said that the challenged statute was consistent with the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade*, *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and *Stenberg v. Carhart*.\n\n\nAlito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Stephen Breyer, and John Paul Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.\n\n\nOn May 2, 2022, *Politico* published a leak of a first draft of a majority opinion by Alito that circulated among the justices in February 2022 for the upcoming decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*. The opinion would overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and would likely either severely restrict access to abortion or make it completely illegal in states with trigger laws.[74] On June 24, 2022, the ruling was handed down. It was mostly identical to the leaked draft, with the addition of replies to the dissenting and concurring opinions. Alito wrote that \"*Roe* was egregiously wrong from the start.\"[75] In July 2022, Alito gave his first public comments on the ruling in a keynote address for Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome. He mocked several foreign leaders for criticizing the decision, particularly U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, referencing his pending resignation, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, who had compared the ruling to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[76][77] During an October 2022 talk at The Heritage Foundation, Alito said that the leaked opinion made some justices \"targets for assassination\", referring to the assassination attempt on fellow Justice Brett Kavanaugh during that year.[78] At the same event, he said that \"questioning [the Court's] integrity crosses an important line\", which many media commentators interpreted as criticism of Kagan's recent statements on the court's overturning of precedent during the past term.[79]\n\n\nIn November 2022, as the investigation into who had leaked the draft opinion was still ongoing, it was revealed that Rob Schenck, an evangelical minister and former anti-abortion activist, had written Roberts a letter about an alleged previous leak of a Supreme Court decision. He wrote that he had been informed of the outcome of *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby* weeks before the June 2014 decision, authored by Alito and favorable to anti-abortion conservatives, was officially announced.[80] Schenck claimed to have heard of the outcome from Gayle Wright, a conservative donor, shortly after she and her husband had lunch with Alito and his wife on June 3, 2014.[80] *The New York Times* claims contemporaneous emails written by Schenck \"strongly suggested he knew the outcome and the author of the Hobby Lobby decision before it was made public.\"[80] In a statement, Alito denied having revealed the outcome or authorship of any decision before its official announcement, but did not dispute that the June 3 lunch with Wright had occurred.[80]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2023, Alito dissented when the Supreme Court reversed a ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that would have banned mifepristone (one of two medications used in the emergency contraception medication Plan B) nationwide.[81][82][83]\n\n\n\n#### Free speech jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nSamuel Alito attending the inauguration of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\nAlito has also dissented from the opinions of the Court's conservative justices on free speech cases, one of which, *Snyder v. Phelps*, had to do with Westboro Baptist Church members' right to protest a military funeral.[84] Alito offered the sole dissenting opinion, saying protesters \"were sued under a very well-established tort that goes back to the 19th century, the intentional infliction of emotional, of severe emotional distress. And I thought that this tort constituted a reasonable exception to the First Amendment, but my colleagues disagreed about that.\"[85]\n\n\nIn the 2007 landmark free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, Alito joined Roberts's majority decision that speech advocating drug use can be banned in public schools, but also warned that the ruling must be circumscribed so as not to interfere with political speech, such as discussion of the medical marijuana debate.\n\n\n\n#### Ethical questions[edit]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2023, Alito published an op-ed in *The Wall Street Journal* challenging the assertions made in a forthcoming *ProPublica* article, claiming that the source \"misleads its readers\".[86][87] The *ProPublica* investigation, published a few hours later, addressed Alito's relationship with billionaire businessman Paul Singer, focusing on a trip Alito and Singer took to a luxury fishing resort in Alaska and suggesting Alito \"violated a federal law that requires justices to disclose most gifts\", such as private jet travel.[88] The article said he should have recused himself in cases involving Singer and that he was obligated to disclose certain benefits as gifts on his 2008 Financial Disclosure Report. Legal ethics experts quoted in *ProPublica* called Alito's behavior \"unacceptable\".[89] Alito's preemptory challenge maintained that *ProPublica*'s charges were invalid.[88] Alito further contended that because of an exemption in the Court's reporting rules for \"personal hospitality\", he was not required to disclose private air transport for social trips.[86] His unconventional decision to bypass reporters' questions and preempt the story via a separate publication took *ProPublica*'s reporters by surprise.[90] The decision to publish the op-ed was criticized both within the *Wall Street Journal* and by media critics, in part because Alito's \"pre-buttal\" lacked fact-checking.[90][91]\n\n\nThe *ProPublica* report on unreported gifts to both Alito and Thomas led several Democratic members of Congress to call for ethics reform for the Supreme Court. This included a Senate Judiciary Committee proposal to establish a code of ethics for the Court.[92] In a July 2023 *Wall Street Journal* opinion column, Alito wrote, \"Congress did not create the Supreme Court [...] I know this is a controversial view, but I'm willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.\"[93] This declaration led to further debate among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Chris Murphy asserted that the Constitution gives Congress power to oversee the Court: \"It is just wrong on the facts to say that Congress doesn't have anything to do with the rules guiding the Supreme Court. In fact, from the very beginning, Congress has set those rules.\"[94]\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\nAs an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark from 1999 to 2004, Alito taught courses in constitutional law and an original course on terrorism and civil liberties. In 1995, he received the school's Saint Thomas More Medal \"in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of law\".[95] On May 25, 2007, he delivered the commencement address at Seton Hall Law's commencement ceremony and received an honorary law degree from the school.[96]\n\n\nAs a visiting professor at Duke University School of Law, Alito taught Current Issues in Constitutional Interpretation in fall 2011 and a course in the Master of Laws in Judicial Studies program in summer 2012.[97][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Alito married Martha-Ann Alito, a onetime law librarian who met him during his many trips to the library as a law clerk.[15] They have two adult children together. Alito resided with his family in West Caldwell, New Jersey, before his Supreme Court nomination.[98] He has since moved to Alexandria, Virginia.[99]\n\n\nSince Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, Alito has been the only military veteran on the Court.[100]\n\n\nIn 2013, as part of the ongoing fallout from the Edward Snowden case, former National Security Agency analyst Russell Tice revealed that during 2002 and 2003 the National Security Agency targeted Alito's phones, and those of his staff and his family, for surveillance.[101][102]\n\n\nAlito is an avid baseball fan and a longtime fan of the Philadelphia Phillies.[103] The Phillie Phanatic was a special guest at his Supreme Court welcome dinner.[104]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Draft numbers were determined in a lottery based on birthdates; a low draft number increased the likelihood of being selected for compulsory military service overseas during the Vietnam War.

He was nominated to the high court by President George W. Bush on October 31, 2005, and has served on it since January 31, 2006. After Antonin Scalia, Alito is the second Italian American justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court; he is also the eleventh Catholic Supreme Court justice in U.S. history.\n\n\nAlito was raised in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Yale Law School. After graduating from law school, he worked as an assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel and served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1990, Alito was appointed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where he served until joining the Supreme Court. He has called himself a \"practical originalist\" and has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".\n\n\nAlito wrote the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), in which the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 abortion rights decision *Roe v. Wade*. He has also written majority opinions in the landmark cases *McDonald v. Chicago*, *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, *Murphy v. NCAA*, and *Janus v. AFSCME*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAlito was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the son of Samuel A. Alito Sr., an Italian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata.[1][2][3] Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito's mother was a schoolteacher. Both are deceased.[4]\n\n\nAlito grew up in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Trenton.[5] He attended Steinert High School, where he graduated in 1968 as the class valedictorian,[6] subsequently matriculating at Princeton University. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[7] His senior thesis, supervised by political scientist Walter F. Murphy, was entitled \"An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court\".[8]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito chaired a student conference in 1971 called \"The Boundaries of Privacy in American Society\", which supported curbs on domestic intelligence gathering and anticipated the need for a statute and a court to oversee national security surveillance.[9] The conference report itself also called for the decriminalization of sodomy, and urged for an end to discrimination against gays in hiring by employers. Alito also led the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel during his time at Princeton.[10] He avoided Princeton's eating clubs, joining Stevenson Hall instead.[11]\n\n\nIn December 1969, while a sophomore at Princeton, Alito received a low lottery number of 32 in the Selective Service drawing. He became a member of the school's Army ROTC program.[12][a] Alito was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve in 1972. He began his military duty after graduating from law school in 1975 and served on active duty from September to December while attending the Signal Officer Basic Course at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Alito was promoted to first lieutenant and captain, and completed his service obligation as a member of the inactive reserve before being honorably discharged in 1980.[12]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito was \"almost alone\" in his familiarity with the writings of John Marshall Harlan II[14] and was much influenced by the course on constitutional interpretation taught by Walter F. Murphy, also his faculty adviser.[14] During his senior year at Princeton, Alito moved out of New Jersey for the first time to study in Italy, where he wrote his thesis on the Italian legal system.[15] Graduating in 1972, Alito left a sign of his lofty aspirations in his yearbook, which said that he hoped to \"eventually warm a seat on the Supreme Court\".[16]\n\n\nAlito then attended Yale Law School, where he served as an editor of the *Yale Law Journal* and earned a Juris Doctor in 1975.[7]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Alito clerked for Third Circuit appeals judge Leonard I. Garth in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976 and 1977.[15] He interviewed with Supreme Court Justice Byron White for a clerkship but was not hired.[17] Between 1977 and 1981, Alito was Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Jersey.[18] There, he served under the then-chief of the appeals division Assistant U.S. Attorney, Maryanne Trump Barry (Barry later became a federal judge).[19] While an Assistant U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted many cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime.[20]\n\n\nFrom 1981 to 1985, Alito was Assistant to U.S. Solicitor General Rex E. Lee. In that capacity he argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court for the federal government.[21] In *Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists* (1986), the Supreme Court ruled against Charles Fried after he rejected a memo by Alito urging the Solicitor General to avoid directly attacking the constitutional right to an abortion.[22] Alito lost only two of the cases he argued before the Supreme Court.[23]\n\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Alito was Deputy Assistant Attorney General under Charles J. Cooper in the Office of Legal Counsel during the tenure of Attorney General Edwin Meese. John F. Manning worked under Alito there.[11] Between 1986 and 1987, Alito authored nearly 470 pages of memoranda, in which he argued for expanding his client's law enforcement and personnel authorities.[24] In his 1985 application for Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Alito espoused conservative views, naming William F. Buckley, Jr., the *National Review*, Alexander Bickel, and Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign as major influences. He also expressed concern about Warren Court decisions in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.[25]\n\n\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Alito was the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.[26] When he arrived, the office had begun the prosecution of 20 defendants accused of being mob affiliates of Anthony Accetturo.[27] In August 1988, the two-year trial, then the longest federal criminal trial in history, ended in the acquittal of all 20 after less than two days of jury deliberations.[28] Alito soon hired Michael Chertoff as his chief deputy.[28]\n\n\nAfter an FBI agent was shot in the line of duty in 1988, Alito personally handled the trial, assigning himself the then-novice Stuart Rabner as an assistant, and securing the shooter's conviction.[28] In March 1988, Alito sought a rehearing of extradition proceedings against two Indian men, represented by Ron Kuby, who were accused of being terrorist assassins, after Alito discovered that the death threats his prosecutor had received had been sent to her by herself.[29] The prosecutor was later found not guilty of obstruction of justice by reason of insanity, after psychiatrists found she may have suffered from schizophrenia, with up to four distinct personalities.[28][30] In 1989, Alito prosecuted a member of the Japanese Red Army for planning a terrorist bombing in Manhattan.[31]\n\n\nAlito is a member of the Federalist Society, a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers and legal students interested in conservative legal theory.[32]\n\n\n\n## Court of Appeals judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThird Circuit Judges Leonard I. Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney, recommended Alito's judicial nomination to President George H. W. Bush.[19] On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons. The American Bar Association rated Alito \"Well Qualified\" at the time of his nomination. He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990,[33][34] and received his commission three days later. As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey.[15]\n\n\n\n### Notable opinions[edit]\n\n\nAbortion\n* On a Third Circuit panel, the majority in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* overturned one part of a law regulating abortion, the provision mandating that married women first inform their husbands if they sought an abortion. Alito, the third judge on the panel, disagreed, arguing that he would have upheld the spousal notification requirement along with the rest of the law.\n\n\nFederalism\n* A dissenting opinion in *United States v. Rybar*, 103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 1996), arguing that a U.S. law banning private citizens from owning submachine guns was similar to one struck down by the Supreme Court in *United States v. Lopez* and thus outside the authority of Congress under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n* A majority opinion in *Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development*, 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under the Family and Medical Leave Act against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. States are free to maintain sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee's claims.\n\n\nFirst Amendment\n* A majority opinion in *Saxe v. State College Area School District*, 240 F.3d 200 (3d Cir. 2001), holding that a public school district's anti-harassment policy was unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore violated First Amendment guarantees of free speech.\n* A majority opinion in *ACLU v. Schundler*, 168 F.3d 92 (3d Cir. 1999), holding that a government-sponsored holiday display consisting solely of religious symbols was impermissible, but that a mixed display including both secular and religious symbols was permissible if balanced in a generally secular context.\n* A dissenting opinion in *C. H. v. Oliva* (3d Cir. 2000), arguing that the removal and subsequent replacement in \"a less conspicuous spot\" of a kindergartener's religious themed poster was, at least potentially, a violation of his right to free expression.\n\n\nFourth and Eighth Amendments\n* A dissenting opinion in *Doe v. Groody*, arguing that qualified immunity should have protected police officers from a finding of having violated constitutional rights when they strip-searched a mother and her ten-year-old daughter while carrying out a search warrant that authorized the search of a residence.\n* A unanimous opinion in *Chadwick v. Janecka* (3d Cir. 2002), holding that there was \"no federal constitutional bar\" to the \"indefinite confinement\" of a man imprisoned for civil contempt because he would not pay his $2.5 million debt to his wife.\n\n\nCivil rights\n* A majority opinion in *Williams v. Price*, 343 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2003), granting a writ of habeas corpus to a black state prisoner after state courts had refused to consider the testimony of a witness who stated that a juror had uttered derogatory remarks about blacks during an encounter in the courthouse after the conclusion of the trial.[35]\n* A dissenting opinion in *Glass v. Philadelphia Electric Company*, 34 F.3d 188 (3rd Cir. 1994), arguing that a lower court did not abuse its discretion in excluding certain evidence of past conduct that defendant had created a hostile and racist work environment.\n* A majority opinion in *Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh*, 120 F.3d 1286 (3rd Cir. 1997), rejecting a female police officer's Equal Protection-based sexual harassment and retaliation claims against the city and certain police officials and rejecting her Title VII-based retaliation claim against the city, but allowing her Title VII-based sexual harassment claim against the city.\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Bush looking on, Alito acknowledges his nomination.\nOn July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor. President George W. Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship. On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor. Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.\n\n\nOn October 31, Bush announced that he was nominating Alito to O'Connor's seat, and he submitted the nomination to the Senate on November 10.[36] Alito was unanimously rated \"well qualified\" to fill the Associate Justice post by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, which measures the professional qualifications of a nominee.[37] The committee rates judges as \"not qualified\", \"qualified\", or \"well qualified\".[38] Leonard Leo was selected to play a role in shepherding Alito's appointment through the Senate.[39]\n\n\nAlito's confirmation hearing was held from January 9 to 13, 2006. Two active-duty members of the Third Circuit, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica, testified in Alito's confirmation hearing, as did five senior and retired circuit judges.[40] Alito responded to some 700 questions over 18 hours of testimony. He rejected the use of foreign legal materials in the Constitution, did not state a position on cameras in courtrooms (he had supported them while on the 3rd Circuit), said Congress could choose to outlaw LGBT employment discrimination in the United States if it wished, and told then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) that he endorsed a weak version of the unitary executive theory.[41]\n\n\nOn January 24, his nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard-right conservative in the mold of Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. He said he would look at abortion with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on *Roe v. Wade* if that decision were to be challenged. \n\n\nDemocrats on the committee asked Alito about his past association with the conservative group Concerned Alumni of Princeton.[42] Alito said that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to Ronald Reagan's Justice Department in order to establish his conservative credentials: \"You have to look at the question that I was responding to and the form that I was filling out... I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration. And my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position.\"[43] But during the confirmation hearings, he disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: \"I disavow them. I deplore them. They represent things that I have always stood against and I can't express too strongly.\"[43]\n\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) formally opposed Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court. The ACLU has only taken this step three other times in its entire history, opposing the nominations of William Rehnquist, Robert Bork and Brett Kavanaugh.[44][*better source needed*] In releasing its report[45][*better source needed*] on Alito, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, \"At a time when our president has claimed unprecedented authority to spy on Americans and jail terrorism suspects indefinitely, America needs a Supreme Court justice who will uphold our precious civil liberties. Alito's record shows a willingness to support government actions that abridge individual freedoms.\"[46][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito ceremonially sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts the day after his confirmation, February 1, 2006.\nDebate on the nomination began in the full Senate on January 25. After a failed filibuster attempt by Senator John Kerry, the Senate confirmed Alito to the Supreme Court on January 31 by a vote of 58–42.[47] All Senate Republicans voted in favor of confirmation except Lincoln Chafee, and all Senate Democrats voted against confirmation except Tim Johnson, Robert Byrd, Kent Conrad, and Ben Nelson. An Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against confirmation.[48][49] Alito was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court later that day.[50][51] He became the 110th justice, the second Italian-American,[52][53] the 11th Catholic in the history of the Supreme Court, and the fifth Catholic on the Court at the time he assumed office.[54]\n\n\nBecause Alito joined the Court mid-term, he did not participate in the decisions of most of the early cases in the Court term because he had not heard arguments for them. These decisions were released with an 8-member Court; none were 4–4, so Alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated. Only three of these cases  – *Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan*, and *Kansas v. Marsh*  – were reargued since a tie needed to be broken.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAlito delivered his first written Supreme Court opinion on May 1, 2006, in *Holmes v. South Carolina*, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. From the beginning of the Rehnquist Court to the nomination of Justice Elena Kagan, each new justice has been given a unanimous opinion to write as their first Supreme Court opinion; this practice is designed to help \"break in\" new justices so that each justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt.[*original research?*] Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in *Zedner v. United States*, *Woodford v. Ngo*, and *Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy*.\n\n\nIn his first term, Alito compiled a fairly conservative record.[*original research?*] For example, in the three reargued cases (*Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan* and *Kansas v. Marsh*), Alito created a 5–4 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices – Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on *Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon*[55] and *Rapanos v. United States*. Alito also dissented in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* alongside Justices Scalia and Thomas.\n\n\nAlito delivered the Supreme Court Historical Society's 2008 Annual Lecture, \"The Origin of the Baseball Antitrust Exemption\". The lecture was published in two journals.[56][57]\n\n\nIn 2013, Alito was considered[*by whom?*] \"one of the most conservative justices on the Court\".[58][59][60] While his voting record is conservative, he does not always join the opinions of the Court's other conservative justices.[*original research?*] On February 1, 2006, in Alito's first decision on the Supreme Court, he voted with the majority (6–3) to refuse Missouri's request to vacate the stay of execution issued by the Eighth Circuit for death-row inmate Michael Taylor. Justices Roberts, Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay; Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution.[61] Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed \"Scalito\", Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case and various other cases of the 2005 term.[*original research?*] A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation,[*citation needed*] Scalia was the only member of the Court in *Zedner v. United States* not to join a section of Alito's opinion that discussed the legislative history of the statute in question. In two higher-profile cases, one involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and one involving campaign finance reform (*LULAC v. Perry* and *Randall v. Sorrell*), Alito adopted narrow positions, declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the Court.[*original research?*] According to a SCOTUSblog analysis of 2005 term decisions, Alito and Scalia concurred in the result of 86% of decisions in which both participated, and concurred in full in 75%.[62] Alito also differed from Scalia in applying originalism flexibly to arrive at conservative outcomes \"with plodding consistency\", rather than following it so strictly as to occasionally produce outcomes unfavorable to conservatives.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito swearing in Mark Esper as the United States Secretary of Defense in 2019.\nAlito's majority opinion in the 2008 worker protection case *Gomez-Perez v. Potter* cleared the way for federal workers who experience retaliation after filing age discrimination complaints to sue for damages. He sided with the liberal bloc of the court,[*original research?*] inferring protection against retaliation in the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act despite the lack of an explicit provision concerning retaliation.\n\n\nAlito joined Thomas in writing a separate dissent in *Obergefell v. Hodges*.[64][65][66] In 2020, Alito wrote a dissent joined by Thomas to *Bostock v. Clayton County*, arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination by sexual orientation or gender identity and criticizing the majority's interpretation of Title VII.[67][68] In October 2020, Alito agreed with the other justices on the denial of an appeal filed by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n\nOn November 12, 2020, Alito made headlines for comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to the Federalist Society, Alito criticized what he called the \"loss of individual liberties\", saying, \"We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020\" and calling the pandemic \"a Constitutional stress test\".[69]\n\n\nAlito has called himself a \"practical originalist\"[70] and is a member of the Court's conservative bloc.[71] He has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".[59][58][72][73]\n\n\nAccording to *The New Yorker*, since the 2020 appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Alito has become \"the embodiment of a conservative majority that is ambitious and extreme\", overruling progressive precedents from the 1960s and '70s that were previously out of conservatives' reach.[63]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Alito, 2018\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of *Gonzales v. Carhart*. The Court had previously ruled in *Stenberg v. Carhart* that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after *Stenberg*, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in *Roe*) and O'Connor (a supporter of *Roe*) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in *Gonzales v. Carhart* was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the *Stenberg* case.\n\n\nOn April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy said that the challenged statute was consistent with the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade*, *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and *Stenberg v. Carhart*.\n\n\nAlito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Stephen Breyer, and John Paul Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.\n\n\nOn May 2, 2022, *Politico* published a leak of a first draft of a majority opinion by Alito that circulated among the justices in February 2022 for the upcoming decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*. The opinion would overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and would likely either severely restrict access to abortion or make it completely illegal in states with trigger laws.[74] On June 24, 2022, the ruling was handed down. It was mostly identical to the leaked draft, with the addition of replies to the dissenting and concurring opinions. Alito wrote that \"*Roe* was egregiously wrong from the start.\"[75] In July 2022, Alito gave his first public comments on the ruling in a keynote address for Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome. He mocked several foreign leaders for criticizing the decision, particularly U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, referencing his pending resignation, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, who had compared the ruling to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[76][77] During an October 2022 talk at The Heritage Foundation, Alito said that the leaked opinion made some justices \"targets for assassination\", referring to the assassination attempt on fellow Justice Brett Kavanaugh during that year.[78] At the same event, he said that \"questioning [the Court's] integrity crosses an important line\", which many media commentators interpreted as criticism of Kagan's recent statements on the court's overturning of precedent during the past term.[79]\n\n\nIn November 2022, as the investigation into who had leaked the draft opinion was still ongoing, it was revealed that Rob Schenck, an evangelical minister and former anti-abortion activist, had written Roberts a letter about an alleged previous leak of a Supreme Court decision. He wrote that he had been informed of the outcome of *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby* weeks before the June 2014 decision, authored by Alito and favorable to anti-abortion conservatives, was officially announced.[80] Schenck claimed to have heard of the outcome from Gayle Wright, a conservative donor, shortly after she and her husband had lunch with Alito and his wife on June 3, 2014.[80] *The New York Times* claims contemporaneous emails written by Schenck \"strongly suggested he knew the outcome and the author of the Hobby Lobby decision before it was made public.\"[80] In a statement, Alito denied having revealed the outcome or authorship of any decision before its official announcement, but did not dispute that the June 3 lunch with Wright had occurred.[80]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2023, Alito dissented when the Supreme Court reversed a ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that would have banned mifepristone (one of two medications used in the emergency contraception medication Plan B) nationwide.[81][82][83]\n\n\n\n#### Free speech jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nSamuel Alito attending the inauguration of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\nAlito has also dissented from the opinions of the Court's conservative justices on free speech cases, one of which, *Snyder v. Phelps*, had to do with Westboro Baptist Church members' right to protest a military funeral.[84] Alito offered the sole dissenting opinion, saying protesters \"were sued under a very well-established tort that goes back to the 19th century, the intentional infliction of emotional, of severe emotional distress. And I thought that this tort constituted a reasonable exception to the First Amendment, but my colleagues disagreed about that.\"[85]\n\n\nIn the 2007 landmark free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, Alito joined Roberts's majority decision that speech advocating drug use can be banned in public schools, but also warned that the ruling must be circumscribed so as not to interfere with political speech, such as discussion of the medical marijuana debate.\n\n\n\n#### Ethical questions[edit]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2023, Alito published an op-ed in *The Wall Street Journal* challenging the assertions made in a forthcoming *ProPublica* article, claiming that the source \"misleads its readers\".[86][87] The *ProPublica* investigation, published a few hours later, addressed Alito's relationship with billionaire businessman Paul Singer, focusing on a trip Alito and Singer took to a luxury fishing resort in Alaska and suggesting Alito \"violated a federal law that requires justices to disclose most gifts\", such as private jet travel.[88] The article said he should have recused himself in cases involving Singer and that he was obligated to disclose certain benefits as gifts on his 2008 Financial Disclosure Report. Legal ethics experts quoted in *ProPublica* called Alito's behavior \"unacceptable\".[89] Alito's preemptory challenge maintained that *ProPublica*'s charges were invalid.[88] Alito further contended that because of an exemption in the Court's reporting rules for \"personal hospitality\", he was not required to disclose private air transport for social trips.[86] His unconventional decision to bypass reporters' questions and preempt the story via a separate publication took *ProPublica*'s reporters by surprise.[90] The decision to publish the op-ed was criticized both within the *Wall Street Journal* and by media critics, in part because Alito's \"pre-buttal\" lacked fact-checking.[90][91]\n\n\nThe *ProPublica* report on unreported gifts to both Alito and Thomas led several Democratic members of Congress to call for ethics reform for the Supreme Court. This included a Senate Judiciary Committee proposal to establish a code of ethics for the Court.[92] In a July 2023 *Wall Street Journal* opinion column, Alito wrote, \"Congress did not create the Supreme Court [...] I know this is a controversial view, but I'm willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.\"[93] This declaration led to further debate among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Chris Murphy asserted that the Constitution gives Congress power to oversee the Court: \"It is just wrong on the facts to say that Congress doesn't have anything to do with the rules guiding the Supreme Court. In fact, from the very beginning, Congress has set those rules.\"[94]\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\nAs an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark from 1999 to 2004, Alito taught courses in constitutional law and an original course on terrorism and civil liberties. In 1995, he received the school's Saint Thomas More Medal \"in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of law\".[95] On May 25, 2007, he delivered the commencement address at Seton Hall Law's commencement ceremony and received an honorary law degree from the school.[96]\n\n\nAs a visiting professor at Duke University School of Law, Alito taught Current Issues in Constitutional Interpretation in fall 2011 and a course in the Master of Laws in Judicial Studies program in summer 2012.[97][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Alito married Martha-Ann Alito, a onetime law librarian who met him during his many trips to the library as a law clerk.[15] They have two adult children together. Alito resided with his family in West Caldwell, New Jersey, before his Supreme Court nomination.[98] He has since moved to Alexandria, Virginia.[99]\n\n\nSince Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, Alito has been the only military veteran on the Court.[100]\n\n\nIn 2013, as part of the ongoing fallout from the Edward Snowden case, former National Security Agency analyst Russell Tice revealed that during 2002 and 2003 the National Security Agency targeted Alito's phones, and those of his staff and his family, for surveillance.[101][102]\n\n\nAlito is an avid baseball fan and a longtime fan of the Philadelphia Phillies.[103] The Phillie Phanatic was a special guest at his Supreme Court welcome dinner.[104]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Draft numbers were determined in a lottery based on birthdates; a low draft number increased the likelihood of being selected for compulsory military service overseas during the Vietnam War.

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 26, 2009, and has served since August 8, 2009. She is the third woman, first woman of color, the first Hispanic, and first Latina to serve on the Supreme Court.[3][a]\n\n\nSotomayor was born in the Bronx, New York City,[4] to Puerto Rican-born parents. Her father died when she was nine, and she was subsequently raised by her mother. Sotomayor graduated *summa cum laude* from Princeton University in 1976 and received her Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1979, where she was an editor at the *Yale Law Journal*.[4] Sotomayor worked as an assistant district attorney in New York for four and a half years before entering private practice in 1984. She played an active role on the boards of directors for the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the State of New York Mortgage Agency, and the New York City Campaign Finance Board.\n\n\nSotomayor was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. In 1997, she was nominated by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her appointment to the court of appeals was slowed by the Republican majority in the United States Senate because of their concerns that the position might lead to a Supreme Court nomination but she was eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.\n\n\nIn May 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice David Souter. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68–31. While on the Court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her Supreme Court tenure, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants and criminal justice reform, and is known for her impassioned dissents on issues of race, ethnic, and gender identity, including in *Schuette v. BAMN*, *Utah v. Strieff*, and *Trump v. Hawaii*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor[5] was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx.[6] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (c. 1921–1964),[7] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[8][9][10] and her mother was Celina Báez (1927–2021),[11] an orphan[12] from Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[10]\n\n\nThe two left Puerto Rico separately, met, and married during World War II after Celina served in the Women's Army Corps.[13][14] Juan Sotomayor had a third-grade education, did not speak English, and worked as a tool and die worker;[8] Celina Baez worked as a telephone operator and then a practical nurse.[7] Sonia's younger brother, Juan Sotomayor (born c. 1957), later became a physician and university professor in the Syracuse, New York, area.[15][16]\n\n\n\nSotomayor was raised a Catholic[3] and grew up in Puerto Rican communities in the South Bronx and East Bronx; she self-identifies as a \"Nuyorican\".[13] The family lived in a South Bronx tenement[17] before moving in 1957 to the well-maintained, racially and ethnically mixed, working-class Bronxdale Houses housing project[17][18][19] in Soundview (which has over time been thought as part of both the East Bronx and South Bronx).[20][21][22] In 2010, the Bronxdale Houses were renamed in her honor. Her relative proximity to Yankee Stadium led to her becoming a lifelong fan of the New York Yankees.[23] The extended family got together frequently[17] and regularly visited Puerto Rico during summers.[24]\n\n![A woman and man, both in their thirties and both dressed in 'Sunday best', hold a similarly dressed very young girl standing on the arm of a floral-print sofa.](image)\nSotomayor and her parents\n![A studio pose of a six- or seven-year-old girl with short dark curly hair in a sleeveless print dress.](image)\nSotomayor as a young girl\nSonia grew up with an alcoholic father and a mother who was emotionally distant; she felt closest to her grandmother, who she later said gave her a source of \"protection and purpose\".[12] Sonia was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age seven,[8] and began taking daily insulin injections.[25] Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old.[7][17] After this, she became fluent in English.[8] Sotomayor has said that she was first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the *Perry Mason* television series.[8][23][25] She reflected in 1998: \"I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, and I knew that when I was ten.

That's no jest.\"[23]\n\n\nCelina Sotomayor put great stress on the value of education; she bought the *Encyclopædia Britannica* for her children, something unusual in the housing projects.[13] Despite the distance between the two, which became greater after her father's death and which was not fully reconciled until decades later,[12] Sotomayor has credited her mother with being her \"life inspiration\".[26] For grammar school, Sotomayor attended Blessed Sacrament School in Soundview,[27] where she was valedictorian and had a near-perfect attendance record.[22][28] Although underage, Sotomayor worked at a local retail store and a hospital.[29] Sotomayor passed the entrance tests for and then attended Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx.[3][30] At Cardinal Spellman, Sotomayor was on the forensics team and was elected to the student government.[3][30] She graduated as valedictorian in 1972.[13] Meanwhile, the Bronxdale Houses had fallen victim to increasing heroin use, crime, and the emergence of the Black Spades gang.[17] In 1970, the family found refuge by moving to Co-op City in the Northeast Bronx.[17]\n\n\n\n### College and law school[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor attended Princeton University. She has said she was admitted in part due to her achievements in high school and in part because affirmative action made up for her standardized test scores, which she described as \"not comparable to her colleagues at Princeton and Yale.\"[31][32] She would later say that there are cultural biases built into such testing[31] and praise affirmative action for fulfilling \"its purpose: to create the conditions whereby students from disadvantaged backgrounds could be brought to the starting line of a race many were unaware was even being run.\"[33]\n\n\nSotomayor described her time at Princeton as life-changing.[34] Initially, she felt like \"a visitor landing in an alien country\"[35] coming from the Bronx and Puerto Rico.[36] Princeton had few women students and fewer Latinos (about 20).[13][37] She was too intimidated to ask questions during her freshman year;[35] her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, and she lacked knowledge in the classics.[38] She put in long hours in the library and over summers, worked with a professor outside of class, and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence.[13][37][38] She became a moderate student activist[30][39] and co-chair of the *Acción Puertorriqueña* organization, which served as a social and political hub and sought more opportunities for Puerto Rican students.[13][40][41] She worked in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her best prospects.[42]\n\n\nAs a student activist, Sotomayor focused on faculty hiring and curriculum, since Princeton did not have a single full-time Latino professor nor any class on Latin American studies.[43][44] A meeting with university president William G. Bowen in her sophomore year saw no results,[41] leading to Sotomayor's saying in a *New York Times* story at the time that \"Princeton is following a policy of benign neutrality and is not making substantive efforts to change.\"[45] Acción Puertorriqueña filed a formal letter of complaint in April 1974 with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, saying the school discriminated in its hiring and admission practices.[40][43][45] Sotomayor wrote opinion pieces for the *Daily Princetonian* with the same theme.[13] The university began to hire Latino faculty,[39][43] and Sotomayor established an ongoing dialogue with Bowen.[42] Sotomayor also successfully persuaded historian Peter Winn to create a seminar on Puerto Rican history and politics.[43] Sotomayor joined the governance board of Princeton's Third World Center and served on the university's student–faculty Discipline Committee, which issued rulings on student infractions.[42][46] She also ran an after-school program for local children[39] and volunteered as an interpreter for Latino patients at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital.[13][36][47]\n\n\n\n![A formal pose of a young woman in her early twenties, dark straight hair parted near the center, wearing a dark floral print top.](image)Sotomayor's 1976 Princeton yearbook photo\nAcademically, Sotomayor stumbled her first year at Princeton,[36] but later received almost all A's in her final two years of college.[46] Sotomayor wrote her senior thesis on Luis Muñoz Marín, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico, and on the territory's struggles for economic and political self-determination.[13] The 178-page work, \"La Historia Ciclica de Puerto Rico: The Impact of the Life of Luis Muñoz Marin on the Political and Economic History of Puerto Rico, 1930–1975\",[48] won honorable mention for the Latin American Studies Thesis Prize.[49] As a senior, Sotomayor won the Pyne Prize, the top award for undergraduates, which reflected both strong grades and extracurricular activities.[13][30][46] In 1976, she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa[13][50] and graduated *summa cum laude* with an A.B. in history.[51] She was influenced by critical race theory, which would be reflected in her later speeches and writings.[52]\n\n\nOn August 14, 1976, just after graduating from Princeton, Sotomayor married Kevin Edward Noonan, whom she had dated since high school,[9][13] in a small chapel at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.[3] She used the married name **Sonia Sotomayor de Noonan**.[53][54][55] He became a biologist and a patent lawyer.[13]\n\n\nSotomayor entered Yale Law School in the fall of 1976.[23] While she believes she again benefited from affirmative action to compensate for relatively low standardized test scores,[31][32] a former dean of admissions at Yale has said that given her record at Princeton, it probably had little effect.[42] At Yale she fit in well[18][54] although she found there were again few Latino students.[41] She was known as a hard worker but she was not considered among the star students in her class.[18][54] Yale General Counsel and professor José A. Cabranes acted as an early mentor to her to successfully transition and work within \"the system\".[56] She became an editor of the *Yale Law Journal*[9] and was also managing editor of the student-run *Yale Studies in World Public Order* publication (later known as the *Yale Journal of International Law*).[57] Sotomayor published a law review note on the effect of possible Puerto Rican statehood on the island's mineral and ocean rights.[13][30] She was a semi-finalist in the Barristers Union mock trial competition.[57] She served as the co-chair of a group for Latin, Asian, and Native American students, and continued to advocate for the hiring of more Hispanic faculty.[37][41]\n\n\nFollowing her second year, she gained a job as a summer associate with the prominent New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.[58] By her own later evaluation, her performance there was lacking.[59] She did not receive an offer for a full-time position, an experience that she later described as a \"kick in the teeth\" and one that would bother her for years.[58][59] In her third year, she filed a formal complaint against the established Washington, D.C., law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge for suggesting during a recruiting dinner that she was at Yale only via affirmative action.[30][41] Sotomayor refused to be interviewed by the firm further and filed her complaint with a faculty–student tribunal, which ruled in her favor.[41][43] Her action triggered a campus-wide debate,[56] and news of the firm's subsequent December 1978 apology made *The Washington Post*.[53]\n\n\nIn 1979, Sotomayor was awarded a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School.[9] She was admitted to the New York Bar the following year.[55][60]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\nOn the recommendation of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired out of law school as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979.[9][56] She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: \"There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem.\"[61] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court.[62] Working in the trial division,[63] she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders.[9][13][64] She also worked on cases involving police brutality.[65] She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses.[64][66] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate.[64] In 1983, she helped convict Richard Maddicks (known as the \"Tarzan Murderer\" who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason).[62][67] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: \"No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous.\"[61] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: \"The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other.\"[8] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time.[30] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness.[23][62][68] One of her job evaluations labelled her a \"potential superstar\".[66] Morgenthau later described her as \"smart, hard-working, [and having] a lot of common sense,\"[69] and as a \"fearless and effective prosecutor.\"[65] She stayed a typical length of time in the post[61] and had a common reaction to the job: \"After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life.\"[70]\n\n\nSotomayor and Noonan divorced amicably in 1983;[66] they did not have children.[21] She has said that the pressures of her working life were a contributing factor, but not the major factor, in the breakup.[68][71] From 1983 to 1986, Sotomayor had an informal solo practice, dubbed Sotomayor & Associates, located in her Brooklyn apartment.[72] She performed legal consulting work, often for friends or family members.[72]\n\n\nIn 1984, she entered private practice, joining the commercial litigation practice group of Pavia & Harcourt in Manhattan as an associate.[8][73] One of 30 attorneys in the law firm,[73] she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, and arbitration.[8][65][74][75] She later said, \"I wanted to complete myself as an attorney.\"[23] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job.[73] She was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than be part of a larger law firm.[73] Her clients were mostly international corporations doing business in the United States;[30] much of her time was spent tracking down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods.[13][73] In some cases, Sotomayor went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while riding on a motorcycle.[13][73] She said at the time that Pavia & Harcourt's efforts were run \"much like a drug operation\", and the successful rounding up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by \"Fendi Crush\", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green.[76] At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain export contract disputes.[73] In a 1986 appearance on *Good Morning America* that profiled women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, she had expected greater things of herself coming out of college.[71] In 1988 she became a partner at the firm;[38][57] she was paid well but not extravagantly.[77] She left in 1992 when she became a judge.[9]\n\n\nIn addition to her law firm work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles.[78] She was not connected to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, and indeed she was registered as an independent.[78] Instead, District Attorney Morgenthau, an influential figure, served as her patron.[69][78] In 1987, Governor of New York Mario Cuomo appointed Sotomayor to the board of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992.[79] As part of one of the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history,[79] the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance coverage for housing and hospices for sufferers of AIDS.[8] Despite being the youngest member of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the details of the operation and was effective.[69][78] She was vocal in supporting the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home owners, and in her skepticism about the effects of gentrification, although in the end she voted in favor of most of the projects.[78][79]\n\n\nSotomayor was appointed by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 as one of the founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years.[8][80] There she took a vigorous role[78] in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure.[81] Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members.[69][78] She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.[78]\n\n\nBased upon another recommendation from Cabranes,[69] Sotomayor was a member of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992.[82] There she was a top policy maker[8] who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights.[82] The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.[82]\n\n\nDuring 1985 and 1986, Sotomayor served on the board of the Maternity Center Association, a Manhattan-based non-profit group which focused on improving the quality of maternity care.[83][84][85]\n\n\n\n## Federal district judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor had wanted to become a judge since she was in elementary school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.[8] Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly one out of every four New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House.[34][86][87][88] Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York.[21] When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said \"Have we got a judge for you!\"[8] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.[13][78] D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor,[89] who was seen as politically centrist at the time.[8][21] Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: \"I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all.\"[8]\n\n\nSotomayor was thus nominated on November 27, 1991, by President George H. W. Bush to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by John M. Walker Jr.[6] Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities winning praise from Senator Ted Kennedy and her getting unanimous approval from the committee.[8][89][90] Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block Democrats had put on another nominee.[89][91] D'Amato objected strongly;[91] some weeks later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by unanimous consent[63][89] of the full United States Senate on August 11, 1992, and received her commission the next day.[6]\n\n\nSotomayor became the youngest judge in the Southern District[92] and the first Hispanic federal judge in New York State.[93] She became the first Puerto Rican woman to serve as a judge in a U.S. federal court.[94] She was one of seven women among the district's 58 judges.[8] She moved from Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, back to the Bronx in order to live within her district.[8]\n\n\n\n### Judgeship[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor generally kept a low public profile as a district court judge.[23] She showed a willingness to take anti-government positions in a number of cases, and during her first year in the seat, she received high ratings from liberal public-interest groups.[21] Other sources and organizations regarded her as a centrist during this period.[8][21] In criminal cases, she gained a reputation for tough sentencing and was not viewed as a pro-defense judge.[95] A Syracuse University study found that in such cases, Sotomayor generally handed out longer sentences than her colleagues, especially when white-collar crime was involved.[96] Fellow district judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum was an influence on Sotomayor in adopting a narrow, \"just the facts\" approach to judicial decision-making.[56]\n\n\nAs a trial judge, she garnered a reputation for being well-prepared in advance of a case and moving cases along a tight schedule.[21] Lawyers before her court viewed her as plain-spoken, intelligent, demanding, and sometimes somewhat unforgiving; one said, \"She does not have much patience for people trying to snow her. You can't do it.\"[21]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\nOn March 30, 1995, in *Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc.*,[97] Sotomayor issued a preliminary injunction against Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new collective bargaining agreement and using replacement players. Her ruling ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, the day before the new season was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling.[23][98][99] The decision raised her profile,[13] won her the plaudits of baseball fans,[23] and had a lasting effect on the game.[100] In the preparatory phase of the case, Sotomayor informed the lawyers of both sides that, \"I hope none of you assumed ... that my lack of knowledge of any of the intimate details of your dispute meant I was not a baseball fan. You can't grow up in the South Bronx without knowing about baseball.\"[101]\n\n\nIn *Dow Jones v. Department of Justice* (1995),[102] Sotomayor sided with the *Wall Street Journal* in its efforts to obtain and publish a photocopy of the last note left by former Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. Sotomayor ruled that the public had \"a substantial interest\"[103] in viewing the note and enjoined the U.S. Justice Department from blocking its release.\n\n\nIn *New York Times Co. v. Tasini* (1997), freelance journalists sued the New York Times Company for copyright infringement for *The New York Times*' inclusion in an electronic archival database (LexisNexis) of the work of freelancers it had published. Sotomayor ruled that the publisher had the right to license the freelancers' work. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court upheld the reversal; two dissenters (John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer) took Sotomayor's position.[104]\n\n\nIn *Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group* (also in 1997), Sotomayor ruled that a book of trivia from the television program *Seinfeld* infringed on the copyright of the show's producer and did not constitute legal fair use. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's ruling.\n\n\n\n## Court of Appeals judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Sonia Sotomayor with her godson at the United States Court of Appeals signing ceremony in 1998\nOn June 25, 1997, Sotomayor was nominated by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which was vacated by J. Daniel Mahoney.[6] Her nomination was initially expected to have smooth sailing,[23][105] with the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary giving her a \"well qualified\" professional assessment.[106] However, as *The New York Times* described, \"[it became] embroiled in the sometimes tortured judicial politics of the Senate.\"[107] Some in the Republican majority believed Clinton was eager to name the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice and that an easy confirmation to the appeals court would put Sotomayor in a better position for a possible Supreme Court nomination (despite there being no vacancy at the time nor any indication the Clinton administration was considering nominating her or any Hispanic). Therefore, the Republican majority decided to slow her confirmation.[18][105][107] Radio commentator Rush Limbaugh weighed in that Sotomayor was an ultraliberal who was on a \"rocket ship\" to the highest court.[105]\n\n\nDuring her September 1997 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sotomayor parried strong questioning from some Republican members about mandatory sentencing, gay rights, and her level of respect for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.[90] After a long wait, she was approved by the committee in March 1998, with only two dissensions.[90][105] However, in June 1998, the influential *Wall Street Journal* editorial page opined that the Clinton administration intended to \"get her on to the Second Circuit, then elevate her to the Supreme Court as soon as an opening occurs\"; the editorial criticized two of her district court rulings and urged further delay of her confirmation.[108] The Republican block continued.[23][105]\n\n\nRanking Democratic committee member Patrick Leahy objected to Republican use of a secret hold to slow down the Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee.[105][109] The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.[110]\n\n\nDuring 1998, several Hispanic organizations organized a petition drive in New York State, generating hundreds of signatures from New Yorkers to try to convince New York Republican senator Al D'Amato to push the Senate leadership to bring Sotomayor's nomination to a vote.[111] D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year,[111] helped move Republican leadership.[13] Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled the vote.[107] With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch,[107] Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote.[112] She received her commission on October 7.[6] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: \"That series of questions, I think, were symbolic of a set of expectations that some people had [that] I must be liberal. It is stereotyping, and stereotyping is perhaps the most insidious of all problems in our society today.\"[23]\n\n\n\n### Judgeship[edit]\n\n\nOver her ten years on the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions when she was in the majority.[13] The Supreme Court reviewed five of those, reversing three and affirming two[13]—not high numbers for an appellate judge of that many years[18] and a typical percentage of reversals.[113]\n\n\nSotomayor's circuit court rulings led to her being considered a political centrist by the *ABA Journal*[75][114] and other sources and organizations.[75][92][114][115][116][117] Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations.[118][119][120] The Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues.[18] Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints.[18][121] A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role.[122] Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose.[123] Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.[124]\n\n\nAcross some 150 cases involving business and civil law, Sotomayor's rulings were generally unpredictable and not consistently pro-business or anti-business.[125] Sotomayor's influence in the federal judiciary, as measured by the number of citations of her rulings by other judges and in law review articles, increased significantly during the length of her appellate judgeship and was greater than that of some other prominent federal appeals court judges.[126] Two academic studies showed that the percentage of Sotomayor's decisions that overrode policy decisions by elected branches was the same as or lower than that of other circuit judges.[127]\n\n\nSotomayor was a member of the Second Circuit Task Force on Gender, Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts.[104] In October 2001, she presented the annual Judge Mario G. Olmos Memorial Lecture at UC Berkeley School of Law;[16] titled \"A Latina Judge's Voice\"; it was published in the *Berkeley La Raza Law Journal* the following spring.[128][129] In the speech, she discussed the characteristics of her Latina upbringing and culture and the history of minorities and women ascending to the federal bench.[130] She said the low number of minority women on the federal bench at that time was \"shocking\".[41] She then discussed at length how her own experiences as a Latina might affect her decisions as a judge.[130] In any case, her background in activism did not necessarily influence her rulings: in a study of 50 racial discrimination cases brought before her panel, 45 were rejected, with Sotomayor never filing a dissent.[41] An expanded study showed that Sotomayor decided 97 cases involving a claim of discrimination and rejected those claims nearly 90 percent of the time.[131] Another examination of Second Circuit split decisions on cases that dealt with race and discrimination showed no clear ideological pattern in Sotomayor's opinions.[132]\n\n\nIn the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor gained a reputation for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes to the point of brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions.[13][133] She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a \"hot bench\", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions.[133][134] Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns.[134] The 2009 *Almanac of the Federal Judiciary*, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor.[13] Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, \"She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I just feel that she can be very, how do you say, temperamental.\"[133] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, \"She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand.\"[133] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been \"totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational.\"[133] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, \"Some lawyers just don't like to be questioned by a woman. [The criticism] was sexist, plain and simple.\"[133]\nSotomayor's law clerks regarded her as a valuable and strong mentor, and she said that she viewed them like family.[51]\n\n\nIn 2005, Senate Democrats suggested Sotomayor, among others, to President George W. Bush as an acceptable nominee to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.[135]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2002 decision *Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush*,[136] Sotomayor upheld the Bush administration's implementation of the Mexico City Policy, which states that \"the United States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.\"[137] Sotomayor held that the policy did not constitute a violation of equal protection, as \"the government is free to favor the anti-abortion position over the pro-choice position, and can do so with public funds.\"[136]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Pappas v. Giuliani* (2002),[138] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' ruling that the New York Police Department could terminate from his desk job an employee who sent racist materials through the mail. Sotomayor argued that the First Amendment protected speech by the employee \"away from the office, on [his] own time\", even if that speech was \"offensive, hateful, and insulting\", and that therefore the employee's First Amendment claim should have gone to trial rather than being dismissed on summary judgment.[139]\n\n\nIn 2005, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for *United States v. Quattrone*.[140] Frank Quattrone had been on trial on charges of obstructing investigations related to technology IPOs. After the first trial ended in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial, some members of the media had wanted to publish the names of the jurors deciding Quattrone's case, and a district court had issued an order barring the publication, even though their names had previously been disclosed in open court. In *United States v. Quattrone*, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the Second Circuit panel striking down this order on First Amendment grounds, stating that the media should be free to publish the names of the jurors. Sotomayor held that although it was important to protect the fairness of the retrial, the district court's order was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech and violated the right of the press \"to report freely on events that transpire in an open courtroom\".[140]\n\n\nIn 2008, Sotomayor was on a three-judge panel in *Doninger v. Niehoff*[141] that unanimously affirmed, in an opinion written by Second Circuit Judge Debra Livingston, the district court's judgment that Lewis S. Mills High School did not violate the First Amendment rights of a student when it barred her from running for student government after she called the superintendent and other school officials \"douchebags\" in a blog post written while off-campus that encouraged students to call an administrator and \"piss her off more\".[141] Judge Livingston held that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in holding that the student's speech \"foreseeably create[d] a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment\",[142] which is the precedent in the Second Circuit for when schools may regulate off-campus speech.[141] Although Sotomayor did not write this opinion, she has been criticized by some who disagree with it.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was part of the three-judge Second Circuit panel that affirmed the district court's ruling in *Maloney v. Cuomo* (2009).[144] Maloney was arrested for possession of nunchucks, which are illegal in New York; Maloney argued that this law violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Second Circuit's *per curiam* opinion noted that the Supreme Court has not, so far, ever held that the Second Amendment is binding against state governments. On the contrary, in *Presser v. Illinois* (1886), the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment \"is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state\".[144] With respect to the *Presser v. Illinois* precedent, the panel stated that only the Supreme Court has \"the prerogative of overruling its own decisions,\"[145] and the recent Supreme Court case of *District of Columbia v. Heller* (which struck down the District's gun ban as unconstitutional) did \"not invalidate this longstanding principle\".[144] The panel upheld the lower court's decision dismissing Maloney's challenge to New York's law against possession of nunchucks.[146] On June 2, 2009, a Seventh Circuit panel, including the prominent and heavily cited judges Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, unanimously agreed with *Maloney v. Cuomo*, citing the case in their decision turning back a challenge to Chicago's gun laws and noting the Supreme Court precedents remain in force until altered by the Supreme Court itself.[145]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *N.G. & S.G. ex rel. S.C. v. Connecticut* (2004),[147] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' decision to uphold a series of strip searches of \"troubled adolescent girls\" in juvenile detention centers. While Sotomayor agreed that some of the strip searches at issue in the case were lawful, she would have held that due to \"the severely intrusive nature of strip searches\",[147] they should not be allowed \"in the absence of individualized suspicion, of adolescents who have never been charged with a crime\".[147] She argued that an \"individualized suspicion\" rule was more consistent with Second Circuit precedent than the majority's rule.[147]\n\n\nIn *Leventhal v. Knapek* (2001),[148] Sotomayor rejected a Fourth Amendment challenge by a U.S. Department of Transportation employee whose employer searched his office computer. She held that, \"Even though [the employee] had some expectation of privacy in the contents of his office computer, the investigatory searches by the DOT did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights\"[148] because here \"there were reasonable grounds to believe\" that the search would reveal evidence of \"work-related misconduct\".[148]\n\n\n\n#### Alcohol in commerce[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Sotomayor was part of the judge panel that ruled in *Swedenburg v. Kelly* that New York's law prohibiting out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers in New York was constitutional even though in-state wineries were allowed to. The case, which invoked the 21st Amendment, was appealed and attached to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court later on as *Swedenburg v. Kelly* and was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.[149]\n\n\n\n#### Employment discrimination[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was involved in the high-profile case *Ricci v. DeStefano* that initially upheld the right of the City of New Haven to throw out its test for firefighters and start over with a new test, because the city believed the test had a \"disparate impact\"[150] on minority firefighters. (No black firefighters qualified for promotion under the test, whereas some had qualified under tests used in previous years.) The city was concerned that minority firefighters might sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The city chose not to certify the test results and a lower court had previously upheld the city's right to do this. Several white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter who had passed the test, including the lead plaintiff who has dyslexia and had put extra effort into studying, sued the City of New Haven, claiming that their rights were violated. A Second Circuit panel that included Sotomayor first issued a brief, unsigned summary order (not written by Sotomayor) affirming the lower court's ruling.[151] Sotomayor's former mentor José A. Cabranes, by now a fellow judge on the court, objected to this handling and requested that the court hear it en banc.[152] Sotomayor voted with a 7–6 majority not to rehear it and a slightly expanded ruling was issued, but a strong dissent by Cabranes led to the case reaching the Supreme Court in 2009.[152] There it was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the white firefighters had been victims of racial discrimination when they were denied promotion.[153]\n\n\n\n#### Business[edit]\n\n\nIn *Clarett v. National Football League* (2004),[154] Sotomayor upheld the National Football League's eligibility rules requiring players to wait three full seasons after high school graduation before entering the NFL draft. Maurice Clarett challenged these rules, which were part of the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players, on antitrust grounds. Sotomayor held that Clarett's claim would upset the established \"federal labor law favoring and governing the collective bargaining process\".[155]\n\n\nIn *Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit* (2005),[156] Sotomayor wrote a unanimous opinion that the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading inducement to buy or sell stocks.[113] The Supreme Court handed down an 8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt such claims, thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.[113]\n\n\nIn *Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.* (2001),[157] she ruled that the license agreement of Netscape's Smart Download software did not constitute a binding contract because the system did not give \"sufficient notice\" to the user.[158]\n\n\n\n#### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko* (2000),[159] Sotomayor, writing for the court, supported the right of an individual to sue a private corporation working on behalf of the federal government for alleged violations of that individual's constitutional rights. Reversing a lower court decision, Sotomayor found that the *Bivens* doctrine—which allows suits against individuals working for the federal government for constitutional rights violations—could be applied to the case of a former prisoner seeking to sue the private company operating the federal halfway house facility in which he resided. The Supreme Court reversed Sotomayor's ruling in a 5–4 decision, saying that the *Bivens* doctrine could not be expanded to cover private entities working on behalf of the federal government. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer dissented, siding with Sotomayor's original ruling.\n\n\nIn *Gant v. Wallingford Board of Education* (1999),[160] the parents of a black student alleged that he had been harassed due to his race and had been discriminated against when he was transferred from a first grade class to a kindergarten class without parental consent, while similarly situated white students were treated differently. Sotomayor agreed with the dismissal of the harassment claims due to lack of evidence, but would have allowed the discrimination claim to go forward. She wrote in dissent that the grade transfer was \"contrary to the school's established policies\" as well as its treatment of white students, which \"supports the inference that race discrimination played a role\".\n\n\n\n#### Property rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Krimstock v. Kelly* (2002),[161] Sotomayor wrote an opinion halting New York City's practice of seizing the motor vehicles of drivers accused of driving while intoxicated and some other crimes and holding those vehicles for \"months or even years\" during criminal proceedings. Noting the importance of cars to many individuals' livelihoods or daily activities, she held that it violated individuals' due process rights to hold the vehicles without permitting the owners to challenge the city's continued possession of their property.\n\n\nIn *Brody v. Village of Port Chester* (2003 and 2005),[162] a takings case, Sotomayor first ruled in 2003 for a unanimous panel that a property owner in Port Chester, New York was permitted to challenge the state's Eminent Domain Procedure Law. A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land should be used for a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.[163]\n\n\nIn *Didden v. Village of Port Chester* (2006),[164] an unrelated case brought about by the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal—due to a statute of limitations lapse—of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent *Kelo v. City of New London* ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.[165][166]\n\n\n\n## Supreme Court justice[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President Barack Obama meets with Judge Sonia Sotomayor and Vice President Joe Biden prior to an announcement in the East Room, May 26, 2009.\nFollowing Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election victory, speculation arose that Sotomayor could be a leading candidate for a Supreme Court seat.[75][114][115][167] New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand wrote a joint letter to Obama urging him to appoint Sotomayor, or alternatively Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, to the Supreme Court if a vacancy should arise during his term.[168] The White House first contacted Sotomayor on April 27, 2009, about the possibility of her nomination.[169] On April 30, 2009, Justice David Souter's retirement plans leaked to the media, and Sotomayor received early attention as a possible nominee for Souter's seat to be vacated in June 2009.[170] In May 2009, however, Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe urged Obama not to appoint Sotomayor, writing that \"she's not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is,\" and that \"her reputation for being something of a bully could well make her liberal impulses backfire and simply add to the fire power of the Roberts/Alito/Scalia/Thomas wing of the court.\"[171][172][173]\n\n\nOn May 25, Obama informed Sotomayor of his choice; she later said, \"I had my [hand] over my chest, trying to calm my beating heart, literally.\"[174] On May 26, 2009, Obama nominated her.[175] She became only the second jurist to be nominated to three different judicial positions by three different presidents.[176] The selection appeared to closely match Obama's presidential campaign promise that he would nominate judges who had \"the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old.\"[177]\n\n\nSotomayor's nomination won praise from Democrats and liberals, and Democrats appeared to have sufficient votes to confirm her.[178] The strongest criticism of her nomination came from conservatives and some Republican senators regarding a line she had used in similar forms in a number of her speeches, particularly in a 2001 Berkeley Law lecture:[130][178] \"I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\"[16] Sotomayor had made similar remarks in other speeches between 1994 and 2003, including one she submitted as part of her confirmation questionnaire for the Court of Appeals in 1998, but they had attracted little attention at the time.[179][180] The remark now became widely known.[181] The rhetoric quickly became inflamed, with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich calling Sotomayor a \"racist\" (although the latter later backtracked from that claim),[182] while John Cornyn and other Republican senators denounced such attacks but said that Sotomayor's approach was troubling.[183][184] Backers of Sotomayor offered a variety of explanations in defense of the remark,[185] and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated that Sotomayor's word choice in 2001 had been \"poor\".[183] Sotomayor subsequently clarified her remark through Senate Judiciary Committee chair Patrick Leahy, saying that while life experience shapes who one is, \"ultimately and completely\" a judge follows the law regardless of personal background.[186] Of her cases, the Second Circuit rulings in *Ricci v. DeStefano* received the most attention during the early nomination discussion,[187] motivated by the Republican desire to focus on the reverse racial discrimination aspect of the case.[181] In the midst of her confirmation process the Supreme Court overturned that ruling on June 29.[153] A third line of Republican attack against Sotomayor was based on her ruling in *Maloney v. Cuomo* and was motivated by gun ownership advocates concerned about her interpretation of Second Amendment rights.[181] Some of the fervor with which conservatives and Republicans viewed the Sotomayor nomination was due to their grievances over the history of federal judicial nomination battles going back to the 1987 Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination.[188]\n\n\nA Gallup poll released a week after the nomination showed 54 percent of Americans in favor of Sotomayor's confirmation compared with 28 percent in opposition.[189] A June 12 Fox News poll showed 58 percent of the public disagreeing with her \"wise Latina\" remark but 67 percent saying the remark should not disqualify her from serving on the Supreme Court.[190] The American Bar Association gave her a unanimous \"well qualified\" assessment, its highest mark for professional qualification.[106] Following the *Ricci* overruling, Rasmussen Reports and CNN/Opinion Research polls showed that the public was now sharply divided, largely along partisan and ideological lines, as to whether Sotomayor should be confirmed.[191][192]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of hearings on July 13, 2009\nSotomayor's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on July 13, 2009, during which she backed away from her \"wise Latina\" remark, declaring it \"a rhetorical flourish that fell flat\" and stating that \"I do not believe that any ethnic, racial or gender group has an advantage in sound judgment.\"[193][194] When Republican senators confronted her regarding other remarks from her past speeches, she pointed to her judicial record and said she had never let her own life experiences or opinions influence her decisions.[195] Republican senators said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, they feared her Supreme Court rulings—where there is more latitude with respect to precedent and interpretation—might be more reflective of her speeches.[196][197] Sotomayor defended her position in *Ricci* as following applicable precedent.[193] When asked whom she admired, she pointed to Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo.[198] In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, declining to take positions on controversial issues likely to come before the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming that as a justice she would just apply the law.[199]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13–6 in favor of Sotomayor's nomination, sending it to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote. Every Democrat voted in her favor, as did one Republican, Lindsey Graham.[200][201] On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31. All Democrats present, along with the Senate's two Independents plus nine Republicans, voted for her.[202][203]\n\n\nPresident Obama commissioned Sotomayor on the day of her confirmation,[204] and her swearing-in ceremony took place on August 8, 2009, at the Supreme Court Building. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, at which time she became the 111th justice (99th associate justice) of the Supreme Court.[205] Sotomayor is the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court,[202][203][206][207][b] and is one of six women who have served on the Court, along with Sandra Day O'Connor (from 1981 to 2006), Ruth Bader Ginsburg (from 1993 to 2020), Elena Kagan (since 2010),[210] Amy Coney Barrett (since 2020),[211] and Ketanji Brown Jackson (since 2022).[212] Sotomayor's appointment gave the Court a record six Roman Catholic justices serving at the same time.[3][c]\n\n\n\n### Justiceship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first four women Supreme Court Justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan. O'Connor is not wearing a robe because she is retired from the Court.\nSotomayor cast her first vote as an associate Supreme Court justice on August 17, 2009, in a stay of execution case.[213] She was given a warm welcome onto the Court[214] and was formally invested in a September 8 ceremony.[215] Sotomayor's inaugural case in which she heard arguments was on September 9 during a special session, *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*. It involved the controversial aspect of the First Amendment and the rights of corporations in campaign finance;[216] Sotomayor dissented.[217][218] In her vigorous examination of Floyd Abrams, representing the First Amendment issues in the case, Sotomayor challenged him, questioning 19th century rulings of the Court and saying, \"What you are suggesting is that the courts, who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with ... [imbuing] a creature of State law with human characteristics.\"[216][219]\n\n\nSotomayor's first major written opinion was a dissent in the *Berghuis v. Thompkins* case dealing with Miranda rights.[217][220] As her first year neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the intensity and heavy workload of the job.[220] During the oral arguments for *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, Sotomayor showed her increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.[221]\n\n\nIn succeeding Justice Souter, Sotomayor did not change the Court's net philosophical and ideological balance.[217][218][220] While many cases are decided unanimously or with different voting coalitions, Sotomayor has continued to be a reliable member of the liberal bloc of the court when the justices divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines.[222] Specifically, her voting pattern and judicial philosophy has been in close agreement with that of Justices Breyer, Ginsburg and Kagan.[223] During her first couple of years there, Sotomayor voted with Ginsburg and Breyer 90 percent of the time, one of the highest agreement rates on the Court.[217][224] In a 2015 article titled \"Ranking the Most Liberal Modern Supreme Court Justices\", Alex Greer identified Sotomayor as representing a more liberal voting pattern than both Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[225] Greer placed Sotomayor as having the most liberal voting history of all the current sitting Justices, and slightly less liberal than her predecessors Thurgood Marshall and John Marshall Harlan II on the Court.[225]\n\n\nChief Justice Roberts, together with Justices Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito (and former Justice Scalia) had comprised the identifiable conservative wing of the Court.[226] Although five of the justices on the Supreme Court in 2009 self-identified as having Roman Catholic affiliation, Sotomayor's voting history identifies her singly among them with the liberal bloc of the Court. However, there is a wide divergence among Catholics in general in their approaches to the law.[3] Due to her upbringing and her past jobs and positions, Sotomayor has brought one of the more diverse sets of life experiences to the Court.[227]\n\n\nThere have been some deviations from the ideological pattern. In a 2013 book on the Roberts Court, author Marcia Coyle assessed Sotomayor's position on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as a strong guarantee of the right of a defendant to confront his or her accusers.[223] Sotomayor's judicial philosophy on the issue is seen as being in parity with Elena Kagan and, unexpectedly for Sotomayor, also in at least partial agreement with the originalist reading of Antonin Scalia when applied to the clause.\n\n\nOn January 20 and 21, 2013, Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Joe Biden for the inauguration of his second term. Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a president or vice president.[228] On January 20, 2021, Sotomayor administered the oath of office to Kamala Harris for her inauguration as vice president, the first woman to ever hold the office.[229]\n\n\nBy the end of her fifth year on the Court, Sotomayor had become especially visible in oral arguments and in passionate dissents from various majority rulings, especially those involving issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.[230] Sotomayor has shown her individuality on the Court in a number of decisions. In her reading of the constitutionality of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan.[231] In dealing with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his statement that \"the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\" by stating, \"I don't borrow Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is... Our society is too complex to use that kind of analysis.\"[232] In the manufacturer liability case of *Williamson v. Mazda*, which the Court decided unanimously, she wrote a separate concurring opinion.[233] Sotomayor's rapport with her clerks is seen as more formalistic than some of the other justices as she requires detailed and rigorous evaluations of cases she is considering with a table of contents attached.[234] When compared to Kagan directly, one of their colleagues stated, \"Neither of them is a shrinking violet\". Coyle, in her 2013 book on the Roberts Court, stated that: \"Both women are more vocal during arguments than the justices whom they succeeded, and they have energized the moderate-liberal side of the bench.\"[235]\n\n\nDuring her tenure on the Court, Sotomayor has also become recognizable as being among the Court's strongest voices in supporting the rights of the accused.[236] She has been identified by Laurence Tribe as the foremost voice on the Court calling for reforming criminal justice adjudication—in particular as it relates misconduct by police and prosecutors, abuses in prisons, concerns about how the death penalty is used, and the potential for loss of privacy—and Tribe has compared her will to reform in general to that of past Chief Justice Earl Warren.[237]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of *The Week* wrote that an \"unexpected civil libertarian alliance\" was developing between Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch \"in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach.\"[238]\n\n\nCourt staff working for Sotomayor have suggested public institutions such as colleges and libraries where she has held lectures, speeches and other events to buy her books to have available for purchase, which reportedly earned Sotomayor $3.7 million. Her court staff has also been promoting Sotomayor's commercial events aimed to sell her own memoir or children's books. Use of government staff is prohibited for such activities in other government branches.[239]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor in 2017\n#### Miranda warnings[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion in *J.D.B. v. North Carolina*, in which the Supreme Court held that age is relevant when determining when a person is in police custody for *Miranda* purposes. J.D.B. was a 13-year-old student enrolled in special education classes whom police had suspected of committing two robberies. A police investigator visited J.D.B. at school, where he was interrogated by the investigator, a uniformed police officer, and school officials. J.D.B. subsequently confessed to his crimes and was convicted. J.D.B. was not given a *Miranda* warning during the interrogation, nor an opportunity to contact his legal guardian. In determining that a child's age properly informs the *Miranda* custody analysis, Sotomayor wrote that \"to hold... that a child's age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody— and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults—would be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that *Miranda* guarantees to adults\".[240] Sotomayor's opinion cited the Court's earlier decisions in *Stansbury v. California* (holding that a child's age \"would have affected how a reasonable person\" would \"perceive his or her freedom to leave\") and *Yarborough v. Alvarado* (holding that a child's age \"generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception\"). Sotomayor also pointed out that the law recognizes that a child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (*e.g.*, limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent). Associate Justice Samuel Alito, jointed by three other justices, wrote a dissenting opinion.\n\n\n\n#### Stolen Valor Act[edit]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Alvarez* (2012), the Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act (a federal law that criminalized false statements about having received a military medal) on First Amendment grounds. While a 6–3 majority of the Court agreed that the law was an unconstitutional violation of the Free Speech Clause, it could not agree on a single rationale. Sotomayor was among four justices, along with Justices Roberts, Ginsburg and Kennedy, who concluded that a statement's falsity is not enough, by itself, to exclude speech from First Amendment protection. Justices Breyer and Kagan concluded that while false statements were entitled to some protection, the act was invalid because it could have achieved its objectives in less restrictive ways. Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito dissented.[241]\n\n\n\n#### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* (2012), Sotomayor was part of a 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). Legal writer Jeffrey Toobin wrote, \"Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions about the facts of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of applying the same principle to health insurance as well).\"[242] Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: \"Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?\" For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.[242]\n\n\nIn 2014, Sotomayor dissented from a 6–3 ruling that granted Wheaton College of Illinois, a religiously affiliated university, an exemption from complying with the Affordable Care Act (ACA)'s mandate on contraception.[243] The ruling, which came the immediate wake of the Court's 5–4 decision in *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, in which the conservative bloc had prevailed, was opposed by the court's three female members: Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan. Writing in dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the case was at odds with the majority's previous statements in *Hobby Lobby* and said, \"Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ... Not today.\" Sotomayor stated further her opinion that the decision risked depriving \"hundreds of Wheaton's employees and students of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage.\"[243]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was part of a 5–3 majority in *Arizona v. United States* (2012), that struck down several aspects of the Arizona SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration law.[244][245]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment, privacy rights, & qualified immunity[edit]\n\n\nOn the Court, Sotomayor has taken positions in favor of an expansive view of the Fourth Amendment protections relating to privacy rights and search and seizure.[246][247] In *United States v. Jones* (2012), all nine justices agreed that a warrant was likely to be required before police could place a GPS tracking device on a suspect's car. Most justices sided with a narrow opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, but Sotomayor (in a lone concurrence) advocated a more expansive view of privacy rights in a digital age, calling for a re-assessment of the longstanding third-party doctrine: \"It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties.\"[248] The following year, federal judge Richard J. Leon cited this concurrence in his ruling that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephony records likely violated the Fourth Amendment.[248] Law professors Adam Winkler and Laurence Tribe were among those who said that Sotomayor's *Jones* concurrence had been influential in calling out the need for a new basis in understanding privacy requirements in a world, as she wrote, \"in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\"[248]\n\n\nIn *Missouri v. McNeely* (2013), Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion holding that a warrant is required before police take a nonconsensual blood test of a motorist suspected of drunk driving.[247] In *Navarette v. California* (2014), Sotomayor joined Justice Scalia's dissent from an opinion finding no Fourth Amendment violation from a traffic stop and drug seizure based solely on an anonymous tip submitted to 9-1-1.[247] Sotomayor was the lone dissenter in *Mullenix v. Luna* (2015), a case in which the Court held, *per curiam*, that an officer who fired six shots at a fleeing fugitive in a high-speed car chase was entitled to qualified immunity; Sotomayor argued that \"By sanctioning a 'shoot first, think later' approach to policing, the Court renders the protections of the Fourth Amendment hollow.\"[247][249]\n\n\nIn *Utah v. Strieff*, a case involving the exclusionary rule, Sotomayor wrote a dissent from the Court's ruling that evidence obtained as a result of an illegal police stop could be admitted if the stopped person was later found to have an outstanding traffic warrant,[247][250] writing that it was a \"remarkable proposition\" that the existence of a warrant could justify a stop illegally based on police officers' \"whim or hunch\".[250] Echoing her earlier dissent in *Heien v. North Carolina* (2014), and citing the works of figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and Ta-Nehisi Coates, Sotomayor wrote that *Strieff* and other Supreme Court Fourth Amendment jurisprudence sent the message \"that you are not the citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state, just waiting to be catalogued.\"[251][252]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental law[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was the sole dissenter in *BP P.L.C. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore* (2021), a case that made it harder for cities and states to win lawsuits against polluters.\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn *Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson* (2021), a case regarding an abortion law in Texas that allows private citizens to sue abortion providers, Sotomayor wrote a sharp dissenting opinion, joined by justices Breyer and Kagan. By a 5–4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the Texas law to stay in effect. Sotomayor concluded that \"Today's fractured Court evinces no such courage. While the Court properly holds that this suit may proceed against the licensing officials, it errs gravely in foreclosing relief against state-court officials and the state attorney general. By so doing, the Court leaves all manner of constitutional rights more vulnerable than ever before, to the great detriment of our Constitution and our Republic.\"[253]\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor with her nephews at the original Yankee Stadium in 2007\nSotomayor was an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law from 1998 to 2007.[254] There she taught trial and appellate advocacy as well as a federal appellate court seminar.[254] Beginning in 1999, she was also a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School in a paying, adjunct faculty position.[84][255] While there she created and co-taught a class called the Federal Appellate Externship each semester from 2000 until her departure; it combined classroom, moot court, and Second Circuit chambers work.[255] She became a member of the Board of Trustees of Princeton University in 2006, concluding her term in 2011.[47][256] In 2008, Sotomayor became a member of the Belizean Grove, an invitation-only women's group modeled after the men's Bohemian Grove.[257] On June 19, 2009, Sotomayor resigned from the Belizean Grove after Republican politicians voiced concerns over the group's membership policy.[258]\n\n\nSotomayor has maintained a public presence, mostly through making speeches, since joining the federal judiciary and throughout her time on the Supreme Court.[259][260] She gave over 180 speeches between 1993 and 2009, about half of which either focused on issues of ethnicity or gender or were delivered to minority or women's groups.[259] While on the Supreme Court she has been invited to give commencement addresses at a number of universities including New York University (2012),[261] Yale University (2013),[262] and the University of Puerto Rico (2014).[260][263] Her speeches have tended to give a more defined picture of her worldview than her rulings on the bench.[169] The themes of her speeches have often focused on ethnic identity and experience, the need for diversity, and America's struggle with the implications of its diverse makeup.[169] She has also presented her career achievements as an example of the success of affirmative action policies in university admissions, saying \"I am the perfect affirmative action baby\" in regard to her belief that her admission test scores were not comparable to those of her classmates.[31][32] During 2012 while already on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor made two appearances as herself on the children's television program *Sesame Street*, explaining what a vocational career is in general and then demonstrating how a judge hears a case.[264][265]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Sotomayor signed a contract with Alfred A. Knopf to publish a memoir about the early part of her life.[266] She received an advance of nearly $1.2 million for the work,[267] which was published in January 2013 and titled *My Beloved World*[58] (*Mi mundo adorado* in the simultaneously published Spanish edition). It focuses on her life up to 1992, with recollections of growing up in housing projects in New York and descriptions of the challenges she faced.[58] It received good reviews, with Michiko Kakutani of *The New York Times* describing it as \"a compelling and powerfully written memoir about identity and coming of age. ... It's an eloquent and affecting testament to the triumph of brains and hard work over circumstance, of a childhood dream realized through extraordinary will and dedication.\"[268] She staged a book tour to promote the work,[269] and it debuted atop the *New York Times* Best Seller List.[270]\n\n\nIn 2020, Justice Sotomayor was reportedly targeted by the same gunman, an angry lawyer, who entered U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas's home, shooting her husband and killing her son. The gunman had subsequently killed himself, after which his detailed planning notes regarding Sotomayor were found.[271]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Sonia Sotomayor swore in Kamala Harris as the Vice President of the United States. It was considered historic as Sotomayor is the first woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court and Harris is the first woman, African-American, and Asian-American Vice President.[272]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor at the 2017 John P. Frank Memorial Lecture at Arizona State University as the guest of honor\nSotomayor has received honorary law degrees from Lehman College (1999),[104] Princeton University (2001),[104] Brooklyn Law School (2001),[104] Pace University School of Law (2003),[273] Hofstra University (2006),[84] Northeastern University School of Law (2007),[274] Howard University (2010),[275] St. Lawrence University (2010),[276] Paris Nanterre University (2010),[277] New York University (2012),[261] Yale University (2013),[262] the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras (2014),[263] and an honorary doctorate of human letters from Manhattan College (2019).[278]\n\n\nShe was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2002.[279] She was given the Outstanding Latino Professional Award in 2006 by the Latino/a Law Students Association.[280] In 2008, *Esquire* magazine included Sotomayor on its list of \"The 75 Most Influential People of the 21st Century\".[281] In 2013, Sotomayor won the Woodrow Wilson Award at her alma mater Princeton University.[282]\n\n\nIn June 2010, the Bronxdale Houses development, where Sotomayor grew up, was renamed after her. The Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses and Justice Sonia Sotomayor Community Center comprise 28 buildings with some 3,500 residents. While many New York housing developments are named after well-known people, this was only the second to be named after a former resident.[283] In 2011, the Sonia M. Sotomayor Learning Academies, a public high school complex in Los Angeles, was named after her.[284]\n\n\nIn 2013, a painting featuring her, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan was unveiled at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[285]\n\n\nIn May 2015 she received the Katharine Hepburn medal from Bryn Mawr College.[286]\n\n\nIn 2019, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[287]\n\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* Sotomayor, Sonia (2022) *Just Help!

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 26, 2009, and has served since August 8, 2009. She is the third woman, first woman of color, the first Hispanic, and first Latina to serve on the Supreme Court.[3][a]\n\n\nSotomayor was born in the Bronx, New York City,[4] to Puerto Rican-born parents. Her father died when she was nine, and she was subsequently raised by her mother. Sotomayor graduated *summa cum laude* from Princeton University in 1976 and received her Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1979, where she was an editor at the *Yale Law Journal*.[4] Sotomayor worked as an assistant district attorney in New York for four and a half years before entering private practice in 1984. She played an active role on the boards of directors for the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the State of New York Mortgage Agency, and the New York City Campaign Finance Board.\n\n\nSotomayor was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. In 1997, she was nominated by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her appointment to the court of appeals was slowed by the Republican majority in the United States Senate because of their concerns that the position might lead to a Supreme Court nomination but she was eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.\n\n\nIn May 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice David Souter. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68–31. While on the Court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her Supreme Court tenure, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants and criminal justice reform, and is known for her impassioned dissents on issues of race, ethnic, and gender identity, including in *Schuette v. BAMN*, *Utah v. Strieff*, and *Trump v. Hawaii*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor[5] was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx.[6] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (c. 1921–1964),[7] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[8][9][10] and her mother was Celina Báez (1927–2021),[11] an orphan[12] from Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[10]\n\n\nThe two left Puerto Rico separately, met, and married during World War II after Celina served in the Women's Army Corps.[13][14] Juan Sotomayor had a third-grade education, did not speak English, and worked as a tool and die worker;[8] Celina Baez worked as a telephone operator and then a practical nurse.[7] Sonia's younger brother, Juan Sotomayor (born c. 1957), later became a physician and university professor in the Syracuse, New York, area.[15][16]\n\n\n\nSotomayor was raised a Catholic[3] and grew up in Puerto Rican communities in the South Bronx and East Bronx; she self-identifies as a \"Nuyorican\".[13] The family lived in a South Bronx tenement[17] before moving in 1957 to the well-maintained, racially and ethnically mixed, working-class Bronxdale Houses housing project[17][18][19] in Soundview (which has over time been thought as part of both the East Bronx and South Bronx).[20][21][22] In 2010, the Bronxdale Houses were renamed in her honor. Her relative proximity to Yankee Stadium led to her becoming a lifelong fan of the New York Yankees.[23] The extended family got together frequently[17] and regularly visited Puerto Rico during summers.[24]\n\n![A woman and man, both in their thirties and both dressed in 'Sunday best', hold a similarly dressed very young girl standing on the arm of a floral-print sofa.](image)\nSotomayor and her parents\n![A studio pose of a six- or seven-year-old girl with short dark curly hair in a sleeveless print dress.](image)\nSotomayor as a young girl\nSonia grew up with an alcoholic father and a mother who was emotionally distant; she felt closest to her grandmother, who she later said gave her a source of \"protection and purpose\".[12] Sonia was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age seven,[8] and began taking daily insulin injections.[25] Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old.[7][17] After this, she became fluent in English.[8] Sotomayor has said that she was first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the *Perry Mason* television series.[8][23][25] She reflected in 1998: \"I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, and I knew that when I was ten. Ten. That's no jest.\"[23]\n\n\nCelina Sotomayor put great stress on the value of education; she bought the *Encyclopædia Britannica* for her children, something unusual in the housing projects.[13] Despite the distance between the two, which became greater after her father's death and which was not fully reconciled until decades later,[12] Sotomayor has credited her mother with being her \"life inspiration\".[26] For grammar school, Sotomayor attended Blessed Sacrament School in Soundview,[27] where she was valedictorian and had a near-perfect attendance record.[22][28] Although underage, Sotomayor worked at a local retail store and a hospital.[29] Sotomayor passed the entrance tests for and then attended Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx.[3][30] At Cardinal Spellman, Sotomayor was on the forensics team and was elected to the student government.[3][30] She graduated as valedictorian in 1972.[13] Meanwhile, the Bronxdale Houses had fallen victim to increasing heroin use, crime, and the emergence of the Black Spades gang.[17] In 1970, the family found refuge by moving to Co-op City in the Northeast Bronx.[17]\n\n\n\n### College and law school[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor attended Princeton University. She has said she was admitted in part due to her achievements in high school and in part because affirmative action made up for her standardized test scores, which she described as \"not comparable to her colleagues at Princeton and Yale.\"[31][32] She would later say that there are cultural biases built into such testing[31] and praise affirmative action for fulfilling \"its purpose: to create the conditions whereby students from disadvantaged backgrounds could be brought to the starting line of a race many were unaware was even being run.\"[33]\n\n\nSotomayor described her time at Princeton as life-changing.[34] Initially, she felt like \"a visitor landing in an alien country\"[35] coming from the Bronx and Puerto Rico.[36] Princeton had few women students and fewer Latinos (about 20).[13][37] She was too intimidated to ask questions during her freshman year;[35] her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, and she lacked knowledge in the classics.[38] She put in long hours in the library and over summers, worked with a professor outside of class, and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence.[13][37][38] She became a moderate student activist[30][39] and co-chair of the *Acción Puertorriqueña* organization, which served as a social and political hub and sought more opportunities for Puerto Rican students.[13][40][41] She worked in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her best prospects.[42]\n\n\nAs a student activist, Sotomayor focused on faculty hiring and curriculum, since Princeton did not have a single full-time Latino professor nor any class on Latin American studies.[43][44] A meeting with university president William G. Bowen in her sophomore year saw no results,[41] leading to Sotomayor's saying in a *New York Times* story at the time that \"Princeton is following a policy of benign neutrality and is not making substantive efforts to change.\"[45] Acción Puertorriqueña filed a formal letter of complaint in April 1974 with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, saying the school discriminated in its hiring and admission practices.[40][43][45] Sotomayor wrote opinion pieces for the *Daily Princetonian* with the same theme.[13] The university began to hire Latino faculty,[39][43] and Sotomayor established an ongoing dialogue with Bowen.[42] Sotomayor also successfully persuaded historian Peter Winn to create a seminar on Puerto Rican history and politics.[43] Sotomayor joined the governance board of Princeton's Third World Center and served on the university's student–faculty Discipline Committee, which issued rulings on student infractions.[42][46] She also ran an after-school program for local children[39] and volunteered as an interpreter for Latino patients at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital.[13][36][47]\n\n\n\n![A formal pose of a young woman in her early twenties, dark straight hair parted near the center, wearing a dark floral print top.](image)Sotomayor's 1976 Princeton yearbook photo\nAcademically, Sotomayor stumbled her first year at Princeton,[36] but later received almost all A's in her final two years of college.[46] Sotomayor wrote her senior thesis on Luis Muñoz Marín, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico, and on the territory's struggles for economic and political self-determination.[13] The 178-page work, \"La Historia Ciclica de Puerto Rico: The Impact of the Life of Luis Muñoz Marin on the Political and Economic History of Puerto Rico, 1930–1975\",[48] won honorable mention for the Latin American Studies Thesis Prize.[49] As a senior, Sotomayor won the Pyne Prize, the top award for undergraduates, which reflected both strong grades and extracurricular activities.[13][30][46] In 1976, she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa[13][50] and graduated *summa cum laude* with an A.B. in history.[51] She was influenced by critical race theory, which would be reflected in her later speeches and writings.[52]\n\n\nOn August 14, 1976, just after graduating from Princeton, Sotomayor married Kevin Edward Noonan, whom she had dated since high school,[9][13] in a small chapel at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.[3] She used the married name **Sonia Sotomayor de Noonan**.[53][54][55] He became a biologist and a patent lawyer.[13]\n\n\nSotomayor entered Yale Law School in the fall of 1976.[23] While she believes she again benefited from affirmative action to compensate for relatively low standardized test scores,[31][32] a former dean of admissions at Yale has said that given her record at Princeton, it probably had little effect.[42] At Yale she fit in well[18][54] although she found there were again few Latino students.[41] She was known as a hard worker but she was not considered among the star students in her class.[18][54] Yale General Counsel and professor José A. Cabranes acted as an early mentor to her to successfully transition and work within \"the system\".[56] She became an editor of the *Yale Law Journal*[9] and was also managing editor of the student-run *Yale Studies in World Public Order* publication (later known as the *Yale Journal of International Law*).[57] Sotomayor published a law review note on the effect of possible Puerto Rican statehood on the island's mineral and ocean rights.[13][30] She was a semi-finalist in the Barristers Union mock trial competition.[57] She served as the co-chair of a group for Latin, Asian, and Native American students, and continued to advocate for the hiring of more Hispanic faculty.[37][41]\n\n\nFollowing her second year, she gained a job as a summer associate with the prominent New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.[58] By her own later evaluation, her performance there was lacking.[59] She did not receive an offer for a full-time position, an experience that she later described as a \"kick in the teeth\" and one that would bother her for years.[58][59] In her third year, she filed a formal complaint against the established Washington, D.C., law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge for suggesting during a recruiting dinner that she was at Yale only via affirmative action.[30][41] Sotomayor refused to be interviewed by the firm further and filed her complaint with a faculty–student tribunal, which ruled in her favor.[41][43] Her action triggered a campus-wide debate,[56] and news of the firm's subsequent December 1978 apology made *The Washington Post*.[53]\n\n\nIn 1979, Sotomayor was awarded a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School.[9] She was admitted to the New York Bar the following year.[55][60]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\nOn the recommendation of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired out of law school as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979.[9][56] She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: \"There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem.\"[61] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court.[62] Working in the trial division,[63] she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders.[9][13][64] She also worked on cases involving police brutality.[65] She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses.[64][66] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate.[64] In 1983, she helped convict Richard Maddicks (known as the \"Tarzan Murderer\" who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason).[62][67] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: \"No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous.\"[61] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: \"The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other.\"[8] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time.[30] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness.[23][62][68] One of her job evaluations labelled her a \"potential superstar\".[66] Morgenthau later described her as \"smart, hard-working, [and having] a lot of common sense,\"[69] and as a \"fearless and effective prosecutor.\"[65] She stayed a typical length of time in the post[61] and had a common reaction to the job: \"After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life.\"[70]\n\n\nSotomayor and Noonan divorced amicably in 1983;[66] they did not have children.[21] She has said that the pressures of her working life were a contributing factor, but not the major factor, in the breakup.[68][71] From 1983 to 1986, Sotomayor had an informal solo practice, dubbed Sotomayor & Associates, located in her Brooklyn apartment.[72] She performed legal consulting work, often for friends or family members.[72]\n\n\nIn 1984, she entered private practice, joining the commercial litigation practice group of Pavia & Harcourt in Manhattan as an associate.[8][73] One of 30 attorneys in the law firm,[73] she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, and arbitration.[8][65][74][75] She later said, \"I wanted to complete myself as an attorney.\"[23] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job.[73] She was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than be part of a larger law firm.[73] Her clients were mostly international corporations doing business in the United States;[30] much of her time was spent tracking down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods.[13][73] In some cases, Sotomayor went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while riding on a motorcycle.[13][73] She said at the time that Pavia & Harcourt's efforts were run \"much like a drug operation\", and the successful rounding up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by \"Fendi Crush\", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green.[76] At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain export contract disputes.[73] In a 1986 appearance on *Good Morning America* that profiled women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, she had expected greater things of herself coming out of college.[71] In 1988 she became a partner at the firm;[38][57] she was paid well but not extravagantly.[77] She left in 1992 when she became a judge.[9]\n\n\nIn addition to her law firm work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles.[78] She was not connected to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, and indeed she was registered as an independent.[78] Instead, District Attorney Morgenthau, an influential figure, served as her patron.[69][78] In 1987, Governor of New York Mario Cuomo appointed Sotomayor to the board of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992.[79] As part of one of the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history,[79] the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance coverage for housing and hospices for sufferers of AIDS.[8] Despite being the youngest member of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the details of the operation and was effective.[69][78] She was vocal in supporting the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home owners, and in her skepticism about the effects of gentrification, although in the end she voted in favor of most of the projects.[78][79]\n\n\nSotomayor was appointed by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 as one of the founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years.[8][80] There she took a vigorous role[78] in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure.[81] Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members.[69][78] She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.[78]\n\n\nBased upon another recommendation from Cabranes,[69] Sotomayor was a member of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992.[82] There she was a top policy maker[8] who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights.[82] The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.[82]\n\n\nDuring 1985 and 1986, Sotomayor served on the board of the Maternity Center Association, a Manhattan-based non-profit group which focused on improving the quality of maternity care.[83][84][85]\n\n\n\n## Federal district judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor had wanted to become a judge since she was in elementary school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.[8] Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly one out of every four New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House.[34][86][87][88] Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York.[21] When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said \"Have we got a judge for you!\"[8] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.[13][78] D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor,[89] who was seen as politically centrist at the time.[8][21] Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: \"I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all.\"[8]\n\n\nSotomayor was thus nominated on November 27, 1991, by President George H. W. Bush to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by John M. Walker Jr.[6] Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities winning praise from Senator Ted Kennedy and her getting unanimous approval from the committee.[8][89][90] Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block Democrats had put on another nominee.[89][91] D'Amato objected strongly;[91] some weeks later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by unanimous consent[63][89] of the full United States Senate on August 11, 1992, and received her commission the next day.[6]\n\n\nSotomayor became the youngest judge in the Southern District[92] and the first Hispanic federal judge in New York State.[93] She became the first Puerto Rican woman to serve as a judge in a U.S. federal court.[94] She was one of seven women among the district's 58 judges.[8] She moved from Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, back to the Bronx in order to live within her district.[8]\n\n\n\n### Judgeship[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor generally kept a low public profile as a district court judge.[23] She showed a willingness to take anti-government positions in a number of cases, and during her first year in the seat, she received high ratings from liberal public-interest groups.[21] Other sources and organizations regarded her as a centrist during this period.[8][21] In criminal cases, she gained a reputation for tough sentencing and was not viewed as a pro-defense judge.[95] A Syracuse University study found that in such cases, Sotomayor generally handed out longer sentences than her colleagues, especially when white-collar crime was involved.[96] Fellow district judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum was an influence on Sotomayor in adopting a narrow, \"just the facts\" approach to judicial decision-making.[56]\n\n\nAs a trial judge, she garnered a reputation for being well-prepared in advance of a case and moving cases along a tight schedule.[21] Lawyers before her court viewed her as plain-spoken, intelligent, demanding, and sometimes somewhat unforgiving; one said, \"She does not have much patience for people trying to snow her. You can't do it.\"[21]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\nOn March 30, 1995, in *Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc.*,[97] Sotomayor issued a preliminary injunction against Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new collective bargaining agreement and using replacement players. Her ruling ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, the day before the new season was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling.[23][98][99] The decision raised her profile,[13] won her the plaudits of baseball fans,[23] and had a lasting effect on the game.[100] In the preparatory phase of the case, Sotomayor informed the lawyers of both sides that, \"I hope none of you assumed ... that my lack of knowledge of any of the intimate details of your dispute meant I was not a baseball fan. You can't grow up in the South Bronx without knowing about baseball.\"[101]\n\n\nIn *Dow Jones v. Department of Justice* (1995),[102] Sotomayor sided with the *Wall Street Journal* in its efforts to obtain and publish a photocopy of the last note left by former Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. Sotomayor ruled that the public had \"a substantial interest\"[103] in viewing the note and enjoined the U.S. Justice Department from blocking its release.\n\n\nIn *New York Times Co. v. Tasini* (1997), freelance journalists sued the New York Times Company for copyright infringement for *The New York Times*' inclusion in an electronic archival database (LexisNexis) of the work of freelancers it had published. Sotomayor ruled that the publisher had the right to license the freelancers' work. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court upheld the reversal; two dissenters (John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer) took Sotomayor's position.[104]\n\n\nIn *Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group* (also in 1997), Sotomayor ruled that a book of trivia from the television program *Seinfeld* infringed on the copyright of the show's producer and did not constitute legal fair use. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's ruling.\n\n\n\n## Court of Appeals judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Sonia Sotomayor with her godson at the United States Court of Appeals signing ceremony in 1998\nOn June 25, 1997, Sotomayor was nominated by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which was vacated by J. Daniel Mahoney.[6] Her nomination was initially expected to have smooth sailing,[23][105] with the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary giving her a \"well qualified\" professional assessment.[106] However, as *The New York Times* described, \"[it became] embroiled in the sometimes tortured judicial politics of the Senate.\"[107] Some in the Republican majority believed Clinton was eager to name the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice and that an easy confirmation to the appeals court would put Sotomayor in a better position for a possible Supreme Court nomination (despite there being no vacancy at the time nor any indication the Clinton administration was considering nominating her or any Hispanic). Therefore, the Republican majority decided to slow her confirmation.[18][105][107] Radio commentator Rush Limbaugh weighed in that Sotomayor was an ultraliberal who was on a \"rocket ship\" to the highest court.[105]\n\n\nDuring her September 1997 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sotomayor parried strong questioning from some Republican members about mandatory sentencing, gay rights, and her level of respect for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.[90] After a long wait, she was approved by the committee in March 1998, with only two dissensions.[90][105] However, in June 1998, the influential *Wall Street Journal* editorial page opined that the Clinton administration intended to \"get her on to the Second Circuit, then elevate her to the Supreme Court as soon as an opening occurs\"; the editorial criticized two of her district court rulings and urged further delay of her confirmation.[108] The Republican block continued.[23][105]\n\n\nRanking Democratic committee member Patrick Leahy objected to Republican use of a secret hold to slow down the Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee.[105][109] The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.[110]\n\n\nDuring 1998, several Hispanic organizations organized a petition drive in New York State, generating hundreds of signatures from New Yorkers to try to convince New York Republican senator Al D'Amato to push the Senate leadership to bring Sotomayor's nomination to a vote.[111] D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year,[111] helped move Republican leadership.[13] Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled the vote.[107] With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch,[107] Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote.[112] She received her commission on October 7.[6] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: \"That series of questions, I think, were symbolic of a set of expectations that some people had [that] I must be liberal. It is stereotyping, and stereotyping is perhaps the most insidious of all problems in our society today.\"[23]\n\n\n\n### Judgeship[edit]\n\n\nOver her ten years on the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions when she was in the majority.[13] The Supreme Court reviewed five of those, reversing three and affirming two[13]—not high numbers for an appellate judge of that many years[18] and a typical percentage of reversals.[113]\n\n\nSotomayor's circuit court rulings led to her being considered a political centrist by the *ABA Journal*[75][114] and other sources and organizations.[75][92][114][115][116][117] Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations.[118][119][120] The Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues.[18] Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints.[18][121] A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role.[122] Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose.[123] Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.[124]\n\n\nAcross some 150 cases involving business and civil law, Sotomayor's rulings were generally unpredictable and not consistently pro-business or anti-business.[125] Sotomayor's influence in the federal judiciary, as measured by the number of citations of her rulings by other judges and in law review articles, increased significantly during the length of her appellate judgeship and was greater than that of some other prominent federal appeals court judges.[126] Two academic studies showed that the percentage of Sotomayor's decisions that overrode policy decisions by elected branches was the same as or lower than that of other circuit judges.[127]\n\n\nSotomayor was a member of the Second Circuit Task Force on Gender, Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts.[104] In October 2001, she presented the annual Judge Mario G. Olmos Memorial Lecture at UC Berkeley School of Law;[16] titled \"A Latina Judge's Voice\"; it was published in the *Berkeley La Raza Law Journal* the following spring.[128][129] In the speech, she discussed the characteristics of her Latina upbringing and culture and the history of minorities and women ascending to the federal bench.[130] She said the low number of minority women on the federal bench at that time was \"shocking\".[41] She then discussed at length how her own experiences as a Latina might affect her decisions as a judge.[130] In any case, her background in activism did not necessarily influence her rulings: in a study of 50 racial discrimination cases brought before her panel, 45 were rejected, with Sotomayor never filing a dissent.[41] An expanded study showed that Sotomayor decided 97 cases involving a claim of discrimination and rejected those claims nearly 90 percent of the time.[131] Another examination of Second Circuit split decisions on cases that dealt with race and discrimination showed no clear ideological pattern in Sotomayor's opinions.[132]\n\n\nIn the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor gained a reputation for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes to the point of brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions.[13][133] She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a \"hot bench\", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions.[133][134] Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns.[134] The 2009 *Almanac of the Federal Judiciary*, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor.[13] Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, \"She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I just feel that she can be very, how do you say, temperamental.\"[133] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, \"She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand.\"[133] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been \"totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational.\"[133] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, \"Some lawyers just don't like to be questioned by a woman. [The criticism] was sexist, plain and simple.\"[133]\nSotomayor's law clerks regarded her as a valuable and strong mentor, and she said that she viewed them like family.[51]\n\n\nIn 2005, Senate Democrats suggested Sotomayor, among others, to President George W. Bush as an acceptable nominee to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.[135]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2002 decision *Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush*,[136] Sotomayor upheld the Bush administration's implementation of the Mexico City Policy, which states that \"the United States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.\"[137] Sotomayor held that the policy did not constitute a violation of equal protection, as \"the government is free to favor the anti-abortion position over the pro-choice position, and can do so with public funds.\"[136]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Pappas v. Giuliani* (2002),[138] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' ruling that the New York Police Department could terminate from his desk job an employee who sent racist materials through the mail. Sotomayor argued that the First Amendment protected speech by the employee \"away from the office, on [his] own time\", even if that speech was \"offensive, hateful, and insulting\", and that therefore the employee's First Amendment claim should have gone to trial rather than being dismissed on summary judgment.[139]\n\n\nIn 2005, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for *United States v. Quattrone*.[140] Frank Quattrone had been on trial on charges of obstructing investigations related to technology IPOs. After the first trial ended in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial, some members of the media had wanted to publish the names of the jurors deciding Quattrone's case, and a district court had issued an order barring the publication, even though their names had previously been disclosed in open court. In *United States v. Quattrone*, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the Second Circuit panel striking down this order on First Amendment grounds, stating that the media should be free to publish the names of the jurors. Sotomayor held that although it was important to protect the fairness of the retrial, the district court's order was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech and violated the right of the press \"to report freely on events that transpire in an open courtroom\".[140]\n\n\nIn 2008, Sotomayor was on a three-judge panel in *Doninger v. Niehoff*[141] that unanimously affirmed, in an opinion written by Second Circuit Judge Debra Livingston, the district court's judgment that Lewis S. Mills High School did not violate the First Amendment rights of a student when it barred her from running for student government after she called the superintendent and other school officials \"douchebags\" in a blog post written while off-campus that encouraged students to call an administrator and \"piss her off more\".[141] Judge Livingston held that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in holding that the student's speech \"foreseeably create[d] a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment\",[142] which is the precedent in the Second Circuit for when schools may regulate off-campus speech.[141] Although Sotomayor did not write this opinion, she has been criticized by some who disagree with it.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was part of the three-judge Second Circuit panel that affirmed the district court's ruling in *Maloney v. Cuomo* (2009).[144] Maloney was arrested for possession of nunchucks, which are illegal in New York; Maloney argued that this law violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Second Circuit's *per curiam* opinion noted that the Supreme Court has not, so far, ever held that the Second Amendment is binding against state governments. On the contrary, in *Presser v. Illinois* (1886), the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment \"is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state\".[144] With respect to the *Presser v. Illinois* precedent, the panel stated that only the Supreme Court has \"the prerogative of overruling its own decisions,\"[145] and the recent Supreme Court case of *District of Columbia v. Heller* (which struck down the District's gun ban as unconstitutional) did \"not invalidate this longstanding principle\".[144] The panel upheld the lower court's decision dismissing Maloney's challenge to New York's law against possession of nunchucks.[146] On June 2, 2009, a Seventh Circuit panel, including the prominent and heavily cited judges Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, unanimously agreed with *Maloney v. Cuomo*, citing the case in their decision turning back a challenge to Chicago's gun laws and noting the Supreme Court precedents remain in force until altered by the Supreme Court itself.[145]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *N.G. & S.G. ex rel. S.C. v. Connecticut* (2004),[147] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' decision to uphold a series of strip searches of \"troubled adolescent girls\" in juvenile detention centers. While Sotomayor agreed that some of the strip searches at issue in the case were lawful, she would have held that due to \"the severely intrusive nature of strip searches\",[147] they should not be allowed \"in the absence of individualized suspicion, of adolescents who have never been charged with a crime\".[147] She argued that an \"individualized suspicion\" rule was more consistent with Second Circuit precedent than the majority's rule.[147]\n\n\nIn *Leventhal v. Knapek* (2001),[148] Sotomayor rejected a Fourth Amendment challenge by a U.S. Department of Transportation employee whose employer searched his office computer. She held that, \"Even though [the employee] had some expectation of privacy in the contents of his office computer, the investigatory searches by the DOT did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights\"[148] because here \"there were reasonable grounds to believe\" that the search would reveal evidence of \"work-related misconduct\".[148]\n\n\n\n#### Alcohol in commerce[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Sotomayor was part of the judge panel that ruled in *Swedenburg v. Kelly* that New York's law prohibiting out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers in New York was constitutional even though in-state wineries were allowed to. The case, which invoked the 21st Amendment, was appealed and attached to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court later on as *Swedenburg v. Kelly* and was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.[149]\n\n\n\n#### Employment discrimination[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was involved in the high-profile case *Ricci v. DeStefano* that initially upheld the right of the City of New Haven to throw out its test for firefighters and start over with a new test, because the city believed the test had a \"disparate impact\"[150] on minority firefighters. (No black firefighters qualified for promotion under the test, whereas some had qualified under tests used in previous years.) The city was concerned that minority firefighters might sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The city chose not to certify the test results and a lower court had previously upheld the city's right to do this. Several white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter who had passed the test, including the lead plaintiff who has dyslexia and had put extra effort into studying, sued the City of New Haven, claiming that their rights were violated. A Second Circuit panel that included Sotomayor first issued a brief, unsigned summary order (not written by Sotomayor) affirming the lower court's ruling.[151] Sotomayor's former mentor José A. Cabranes, by now a fellow judge on the court, objected to this handling and requested that the court hear it en banc.[152] Sotomayor voted with a 7–6 majority not to rehear it and a slightly expanded ruling was issued, but a strong dissent by Cabranes led to the case reaching the Supreme Court in 2009.[152] There it was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the white firefighters had been victims of racial discrimination when they were denied promotion.[153]\n\n\n\n#### Business[edit]\n\n\nIn *Clarett v. National Football League* (2004),[154] Sotomayor upheld the National Football League's eligibility rules requiring players to wait three full seasons after high school graduation before entering the NFL draft. Maurice Clarett challenged these rules, which were part of the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players, on antitrust grounds. Sotomayor held that Clarett's claim would upset the established \"federal labor law favoring and governing the collective bargaining process\".[155]\n\n\nIn *Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit* (2005),[156] Sotomayor wrote a unanimous opinion that the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading inducement to buy or sell stocks.[113] The Supreme Court handed down an 8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt such claims, thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.[113]\n\n\nIn *Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.* (2001),[157] she ruled that the license agreement of Netscape's Smart Download software did not constitute a binding contract because the system did not give \"sufficient notice\" to the user.[158]\n\n\n\n#### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko* (2000),[159] Sotomayor, writing for the court, supported the right of an individual to sue a private corporation working on behalf of the federal government for alleged violations of that individual's constitutional rights. Reversing a lower court decision, Sotomayor found that the *Bivens* doctrine—which allows suits against individuals working for the federal government for constitutional rights violations—could be applied to the case of a former prisoner seeking to sue the private company operating the federal halfway house facility in which he resided. The Supreme Court reversed Sotomayor's ruling in a 5–4 decision, saying that the *Bivens* doctrine could not be expanded to cover private entities working on behalf of the federal government. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer dissented, siding with Sotomayor's original ruling.\n\n\nIn *Gant v. Wallingford Board of Education* (1999),[160] the parents of a black student alleged that he had been harassed due to his race and had been discriminated against when he was transferred from a first grade class to a kindergarten class without parental consent, while similarly situated white students were treated differently. Sotomayor agreed with the dismissal of the harassment claims due to lack of evidence, but would have allowed the discrimination claim to go forward. She wrote in dissent that the grade transfer was \"contrary to the school's established policies\" as well as its treatment of white students, which \"supports the inference that race discrimination played a role\".\n\n\n\n#### Property rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Krimstock v. Kelly* (2002),[161] Sotomayor wrote an opinion halting New York City's practice of seizing the motor vehicles of drivers accused of driving while intoxicated and some other crimes and holding those vehicles for \"months or even years\" during criminal proceedings. Noting the importance of cars to many individuals' livelihoods or daily activities, she held that it violated individuals' due process rights to hold the vehicles without permitting the owners to challenge the city's continued possession of their property.\n\n\nIn *Brody v. Village of Port Chester* (2003 and 2005),[162] a takings case, Sotomayor first ruled in 2003 for a unanimous panel that a property owner in Port Chester, New York was permitted to challenge the state's Eminent Domain Procedure Law. A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land should be used for a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.[163]\n\n\nIn *Didden v. Village of Port Chester* (2006),[164] an unrelated case brought about by the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal—due to a statute of limitations lapse—of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent *Kelo v. City of New London* ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.[165][166]\n\n\n\n## Supreme Court justice[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President Barack Obama meets with Judge Sonia Sotomayor and Vice President Joe Biden prior to an announcement in the East Room, May 26, 2009.\nFollowing Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election victory, speculation arose that Sotomayor could be a leading candidate for a Supreme Court seat.[75][114][115][167] New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand wrote a joint letter to Obama urging him to appoint Sotomayor, or alternatively Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, to the Supreme Court if a vacancy should arise during his term.[168] The White House first contacted Sotomayor on April 27, 2009, about the possibility of her nomination.[169] On April 30, 2009, Justice David Souter's retirement plans leaked to the media, and Sotomayor received early attention as a possible nominee for Souter's seat to be vacated in June 2009.[170] In May 2009, however, Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe urged Obama not to appoint Sotomayor, writing that \"she's not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is,\" and that \"her reputation for being something of a bully could well make her liberal impulses backfire and simply add to the fire power of the Roberts/Alito/Scalia/Thomas wing of the court.\"[171][172][173]\n\n\nOn May 25, Obama informed Sotomayor of his choice; she later said, \"I had my [hand] over my chest, trying to calm my beating heart, literally.\"[174] On May 26, 2009, Obama nominated her.[175] She became only the second jurist to be nominated to three different judicial positions by three different presidents.[176] The selection appeared to closely match Obama's presidential campaign promise that he would nominate judges who had \"the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old.\"[177]\n\n\nSotomayor's nomination won praise from Democrats and liberals, and Democrats appeared to have sufficient votes to confirm her.[178] The strongest criticism of her nomination came from conservatives and some Republican senators regarding a line she had used in similar forms in a number of her speeches, particularly in a 2001 Berkeley Law lecture:[130][178] \"I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\"[16] Sotomayor had made similar remarks in other speeches between 1994 and 2003, including one she submitted as part of her confirmation questionnaire for the Court of Appeals in 1998, but they had attracted little attention at the time.[179][180] The remark now became widely known.[181] The rhetoric quickly became inflamed, with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich calling Sotomayor a \"racist\" (although the latter later backtracked from that claim),[182] while John Cornyn and other Republican senators denounced such attacks but said that Sotomayor's approach was troubling.[183][184] Backers of Sotomayor offered a variety of explanations in defense of the remark,[185] and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated that Sotomayor's word choice in 2001 had been \"poor\".[183] Sotomayor subsequently clarified her remark through Senate Judiciary Committee chair Patrick Leahy, saying that while life experience shapes who one is, \"ultimately and completely\" a judge follows the law regardless of personal background.[186] Of her cases, the Second Circuit rulings in *Ricci v. DeStefano* received the most attention during the early nomination discussion,[187] motivated by the Republican desire to focus on the reverse racial discrimination aspect of the case.[181] In the midst of her confirmation process the Supreme Court overturned that ruling on June 29.[153] A third line of Republican attack against Sotomayor was based on her ruling in *Maloney v. Cuomo* and was motivated by gun ownership advocates concerned about her interpretation of Second Amendment rights.[181] Some of the fervor with which conservatives and Republicans viewed the Sotomayor nomination was due to their grievances over the history of federal judicial nomination battles going back to the 1987 Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination.[188]\n\n\nA Gallup poll released a week after the nomination showed 54 percent of Americans in favor of Sotomayor's confirmation compared with 28 percent in opposition.[189] A June 12 Fox News poll showed 58 percent of the public disagreeing with her \"wise Latina\" remark but 67 percent saying the remark should not disqualify her from serving on the Supreme Court.[190] The American Bar Association gave her a unanimous \"well qualified\" assessment, its highest mark for professional qualification.[106] Following the *Ricci* overruling, Rasmussen Reports and CNN/Opinion Research polls showed that the public was now sharply divided, largely along partisan and ideological lines, as to whether Sotomayor should be confirmed.[191][192]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of hearings on July 13, 2009\nSotomayor's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on July 13, 2009, during which she backed away from her \"wise Latina\" remark, declaring it \"a rhetorical flourish that fell flat\" and stating that \"I do not believe that any ethnic, racial or gender group has an advantage in sound judgment.\"[193][194] When Republican senators confronted her regarding other remarks from her past speeches, she pointed to her judicial record and said she had never let her own life experiences or opinions influence her decisions.[195] Republican senators said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, they feared her Supreme Court rulings—where there is more latitude with respect to precedent and interpretation—might be more reflective of her speeches.[196][197] Sotomayor defended her position in *Ricci* as following applicable precedent.[193] When asked whom she admired, she pointed to Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo.[198] In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, declining to take positions on controversial issues likely to come before the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming that as a justice she would just apply the law.[199]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13–6 in favor of Sotomayor's nomination, sending it to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote. Every Democrat voted in her favor, as did one Republican, Lindsey Graham.[200][201] On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31. All Democrats present, along with the Senate's two Independents plus nine Republicans, voted for her.[202][203]\n\n\nPresident Obama commissioned Sotomayor on the day of her confirmation,[204] and her swearing-in ceremony took place on August 8, 2009, at the Supreme Court Building. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, at which time she became the 111th justice (99th associate justice) of the Supreme Court.[205] Sotomayor is the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court,[202][203][206][207][b] and is one of six women who have served on the Court, along with Sandra Day O'Connor (from 1981 to 2006), Ruth Bader Ginsburg (from 1993 to 2020), Elena Kagan (since 2010),[210] Amy Coney Barrett (since 2020),[211] and Ketanji Brown Jackson (since 2022).[212] Sotomayor's appointment gave the Court a record six Roman Catholic justices serving at the same time.[3][c]\n\n\n\n### Justiceship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first four women Supreme Court Justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan. O'Connor is not wearing a robe because she is retired from the Court.\nSotomayor cast her first vote as an associate Supreme Court justice on August 17, 2009, in a stay of execution case.[213] She was given a warm welcome onto the Court[214] and was formally invested in a September 8 ceremony.[215] Sotomayor's inaugural case in which she heard arguments was on September 9 during a special session, *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*. It involved the controversial aspect of the First Amendment and the rights of corporations in campaign finance;[216] Sotomayor dissented.[217][218] In her vigorous examination of Floyd Abrams, representing the First Amendment issues in the case, Sotomayor challenged him, questioning 19th century rulings of the Court and saying, \"What you are suggesting is that the courts, who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with ... [imbuing] a creature of State law with human characteristics.\"[216][219]\n\n\nSotomayor's first major written opinion was a dissent in the *Berghuis v. Thompkins* case dealing with Miranda rights.[217][220] As her first year neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the intensity and heavy workload of the job.[220] During the oral arguments for *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, Sotomayor showed her increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.[221]\n\n\nIn succeeding Justice Souter, Sotomayor did not change the Court's net philosophical and ideological balance.[217][218][220] While many cases are decided unanimously or with different voting coalitions, Sotomayor has continued to be a reliable member of the liberal bloc of the court when the justices divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines.[222] Specifically, her voting pattern and judicial philosophy has been in close agreement with that of Justices Breyer, Ginsburg and Kagan.[223] During her first couple of years there, Sotomayor voted with Ginsburg and Breyer 90 percent of the time, one of the highest agreement rates on the Court.[217][224] In a 2015 article titled \"Ranking the Most Liberal Modern Supreme Court Justices\", Alex Greer identified Sotomayor as representing a more liberal voting pattern than both Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[225] Greer placed Sotomayor as having the most liberal voting history of all the current sitting Justices, and slightly less liberal than her predecessors Thurgood Marshall and John Marshall Harlan II on the Court.[225]\n\n\nChief Justice Roberts, together with Justices Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito (and former Justice Scalia) had comprised the identifiable conservative wing of the Court.[226] Although five of the justices on the Supreme Court in 2009 self-identified as having Roman Catholic affiliation, Sotomayor's voting history identifies her singly among them with the liberal bloc of the Court. However, there is a wide divergence among Catholics in general in their approaches to the law.[3] Due to her upbringing and her past jobs and positions, Sotomayor has brought one of the more diverse sets of life experiences to the Court.[227]\n\n\nThere have been some deviations from the ideological pattern. In a 2013 book on the Roberts Court, author Marcia Coyle assessed Sotomayor's position on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as a strong guarantee of the right of a defendant to confront his or her accusers.[223] Sotomayor's judicial philosophy on the issue is seen as being in parity with Elena Kagan and, unexpectedly for Sotomayor, also in at least partial agreement with the originalist reading of Antonin Scalia when applied to the clause.\n\n\nOn January 20 and 21, 2013, Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Joe Biden for the inauguration of his second term. Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a president or vice president.[228] On January 20, 2021, Sotomayor administered the oath of office to Kamala Harris for her inauguration as vice president, the first woman to ever hold the office.[229]\n\n\nBy the end of her fifth year on the Court, Sotomayor had become especially visible in oral arguments and in passionate dissents from various majority rulings, especially those involving issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.[230] Sotomayor has shown her individuality on the Court in a number of decisions. In her reading of the constitutionality of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan.[231] In dealing with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his statement that \"the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\" by stating, \"I don't borrow Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is... Our society is too complex to use that kind of analysis.\"[232] In the manufacturer liability case of *Williamson v. Mazda*, which the Court decided unanimously, she wrote a separate concurring opinion.[233] Sotomayor's rapport with her clerks is seen as more formalistic than some of the other justices as she requires detailed and rigorous evaluations of cases she is considering with a table of contents attached.[234] When compared to Kagan directly, one of their colleagues stated, \"Neither of them is a shrinking violet\". Coyle, in her 2013 book on the Roberts Court, stated that: \"Both women are more vocal during arguments than the justices whom they succeeded, and they have energized the moderate-liberal side of the bench.\"[235]\n\n\nDuring her tenure on the Court, Sotomayor has also become recognizable as being among the Court's strongest voices in supporting the rights of the accused.[236] She has been identified by Laurence Tribe as the foremost voice on the Court calling for reforming criminal justice adjudication—in particular as it relates misconduct by police and prosecutors, abuses in prisons, concerns about how the death penalty is used, and the potential for loss of privacy—and Tribe has compared her will to reform in general to that of past Chief Justice Earl Warren.[237]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of *The Week* wrote that an \"unexpected civil libertarian alliance\" was developing between Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch \"in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach.\"[238]\n\n\nCourt staff working for Sotomayor have suggested public institutions such as colleges and libraries where she has held lectures, speeches and other events to buy her books to have available for purchase, which reportedly earned Sotomayor $3.7 million. Her court staff has also been promoting Sotomayor's commercial events aimed to sell her own memoir or children's books. Use of government staff is prohibited for such activities in other government branches.[239]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor in 2017\n#### Miranda warnings[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion in *J.D.B. v. North Carolina*, in which the Supreme Court held that age is relevant when determining when a person is in police custody for *Miranda* purposes. J.D.B. was a 13-year-old student enrolled in special education classes whom police had suspected of committing two robberies. A police investigator visited J.D.B. at school, where he was interrogated by the investigator, a uniformed police officer, and school officials. J.D.B. subsequently confessed to his crimes and was convicted. J.D.B. was not given a *Miranda* warning during the interrogation, nor an opportunity to contact his legal guardian. In determining that a child's age properly informs the *Miranda* custody analysis, Sotomayor wrote that \"to hold... that a child's age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody— and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults—would be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that *Miranda* guarantees to adults\".[240] Sotomayor's opinion cited the Court's earlier decisions in *Stansbury v. California* (holding that a child's age \"would have affected how a reasonable person\" would \"perceive his or her freedom to leave\") and *Yarborough v. Alvarado* (holding that a child's age \"generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception\"). Sotomayor also pointed out that the law recognizes that a child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (*e.g.*, limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent). Associate Justice Samuel Alito, jointed by three other justices, wrote a dissenting opinion.\n\n\n\n#### Stolen Valor Act[edit]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Alvarez* (2012), the Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act (a federal law that criminalized false statements about having received a military medal) on First Amendment grounds. While a 6–3 majority of the Court agreed that the law was an unconstitutional violation of the Free Speech Clause, it could not agree on a single rationale. Sotomayor was among four justices, along with Justices Roberts, Ginsburg and Kennedy, who concluded that a statement's falsity is not enough, by itself, to exclude speech from First Amendment protection. Justices Breyer and Kagan concluded that while false statements were entitled to some protection, the act was invalid because it could have achieved its objectives in less restrictive ways. Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito dissented.[241]\n\n\n\n#### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* (2012), Sotomayor was part of a 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). Legal writer Jeffrey Toobin wrote, \"Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions about the facts of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of applying the same principle to health insurance as well).\"[242] Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: \"Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?\" For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.[242]\n\n\nIn 2014, Sotomayor dissented from a 6–3 ruling that granted Wheaton College of Illinois, a religiously affiliated university, an exemption from complying with the Affordable Care Act (ACA)'s mandate on contraception.[243] The ruling, which came the immediate wake of the Court's 5–4 decision in *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, in which the conservative bloc had prevailed, was opposed by the court's three female members: Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan. Writing in dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the case was at odds with the majority's previous statements in *Hobby Lobby* and said, \"Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ... Not today.\" Sotomayor stated further her opinion that the decision risked depriving \"hundreds of Wheaton's employees and students of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage.\"[243]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was part of a 5–3 majority in *Arizona v. United States* (2012), that struck down several aspects of the Arizona SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration law.[244][245]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment, privacy rights, & qualified immunity[edit]\n\n\nOn the Court, Sotomayor has taken positions in favor of an expansive view of the Fourth Amendment protections relating to privacy rights and search and seizure.[246][247] In *United States v. Jones* (2012), all nine justices agreed that a warrant was likely to be required before police could place a GPS tracking device on a suspect's car. Most justices sided with a narrow opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, but Sotomayor (in a lone concurrence) advocated a more expansive view of privacy rights in a digital age, calling for a re-assessment of the longstanding third-party doctrine: \"It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties.\"[248] The following year, federal judge Richard J. Leon cited this concurrence in his ruling that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephony records likely violated the Fourth Amendment.[248] Law professors Adam Winkler and Laurence Tribe were among those who said that Sotomayor's *Jones* concurrence had been influential in calling out the need for a new basis in understanding privacy requirements in a world, as she wrote, \"in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\"[248]\n\n\nIn *Missouri v. McNeely* (2013), Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion holding that a warrant is required before police take a nonconsensual blood test of a motorist suspected of drunk driving.[247] In *Navarette v. California* (2014), Sotomayor joined Justice Scalia's dissent from an opinion finding no Fourth Amendment violation from a traffic stop and drug seizure based solely on an anonymous tip submitted to 9-1-1.[247] Sotomayor was the lone dissenter in *Mullenix v. Luna* (2015), a case in which the Court held, *per curiam*, that an officer who fired six shots at a fleeing fugitive in a high-speed car chase was entitled to qualified immunity; Sotomayor argued that \"By sanctioning a 'shoot first, think later' approach to policing, the Court renders the protections of the Fourth Amendment hollow.\"[247][249]\n\n\nIn *Utah v. Strieff*, a case involving the exclusionary rule, Sotomayor wrote a dissent from the Court's ruling that evidence obtained as a result of an illegal police stop could be admitted if the stopped person was later found to have an outstanding traffic warrant,[247][250] writing that it was a \"remarkable proposition\" that the existence of a warrant could justify a stop illegally based on police officers' \"whim or hunch\".[250] Echoing her earlier dissent in *Heien v. North Carolina* (2014), and citing the works of figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and Ta-Nehisi Coates, Sotomayor wrote that *Strieff* and other Supreme Court Fourth Amendment jurisprudence sent the message \"that you are not the citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state, just waiting to be catalogued.\"[251][252]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental law[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was the sole dissenter in *BP P.L.C. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore* (2021), a case that made it harder for cities and states to win lawsuits against polluters.\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn *Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson* (2021), a case regarding an abortion law in Texas that allows private citizens to sue abortion providers, Sotomayor wrote a sharp dissenting opinion, joined by justices Breyer and Kagan. By a 5–4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the Texas law to stay in effect. Sotomayor concluded that \"Today's fractured Court evinces no such courage. While the Court properly holds that this suit may proceed against the licensing officials, it errs gravely in foreclosing relief against state-court officials and the state attorney general. By so doing, the Court leaves all manner of constitutional rights more vulnerable than ever before, to the great detriment of our Constitution and our Republic.\"[253]\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor with her nephews at the original Yankee Stadium in 2007\nSotomayor was an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law from 1998 to 2007.[254] There she taught trial and appellate advocacy as well as a federal appellate court seminar.[254] Beginning in 1999, she was also a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School in a paying, adjunct faculty position.[84][255] While there she created and co-taught a class called the Federal Appellate Externship each semester from 2000 until her departure; it combined classroom, moot court, and Second Circuit chambers work.[255] She became a member of the Board of Trustees of Princeton University in 2006, concluding her term in 2011.[47][256] In 2008, Sotomayor became a member of the Belizean Grove, an invitation-only women's group modeled after the men's Bohemian Grove.[257] On June 19, 2009, Sotomayor resigned from the Belizean Grove after Republican politicians voiced concerns over the group's membership policy.[258]\n\n\nSotomayor has maintained a public presence, mostly through making speeches, since joining the federal judiciary and throughout her time on the Supreme Court.[259][260] She gave over 180 speeches between 1993 and 2009, about half of which either focused on issues of ethnicity or gender or were delivered to minority or women's groups.[259] While on the Supreme Court she has been invited to give commencement addresses at a number of universities including New York University (2012),[261] Yale University (2013),[262] and the University of Puerto Rico (2014).[260][263] Her speeches have tended to give a more defined picture of her worldview than her rulings on the bench.[169] The themes of her speeches have often focused on ethnic identity and experience, the need for diversity, and America's struggle with the implications of its diverse makeup.[169] She has also presented her career achievements as an example of the success of affirmative action policies in university admissions, saying \"I am the perfect affirmative action baby\" in regard to her belief that her admission test scores were not comparable to those of her classmates.[31][32] During 2012 while already on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor made two appearances as herself on the children's television program *Sesame Street*, explaining what a vocational career is in general and then demonstrating how a judge hears a case.[264][265]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Sotomayor signed a contract with Alfred A. Knopf to publish a memoir about the early part of her life.[266] She received an advance of nearly $1.2 million for the work,[267] which was published in January 2013 and titled *My Beloved World*[58] (*Mi mundo adorado* in the simultaneously published Spanish edition). It focuses on her life up to 1992, with recollections of growing up in housing projects in New York and descriptions of the challenges she faced.[58] It received good reviews, with Michiko Kakutani of *The New York Times* describing it as \"a compelling and powerfully written memoir about identity and coming of age. ... It's an eloquent and affecting testament to the triumph of brains and hard work over circumstance, of a childhood dream realized through extraordinary will and dedication.\"[268] She staged a book tour to promote the work,[269] and it debuted atop the *New York Times* Best Seller List.[270]\n\n\nIn 2020, Justice Sotomayor was reportedly targeted by the same gunman, an angry lawyer, who entered U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas's home, shooting her husband and killing her son. The gunman had subsequently killed himself, after which his detailed planning notes regarding Sotomayor were found.[271]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Sonia Sotomayor swore in Kamala Harris as the Vice President of the United States. It was considered historic as Sotomayor is the first woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court and Harris is the first woman, African-American, and Asian-American Vice President.[272]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor at the 2017 John P. Frank Memorial Lecture at Arizona State University as the guest of honor\nSotomayor has received honorary law degrees from Lehman College (1999),[104] Princeton University (2001),[104] Brooklyn Law School (2001),[104] Pace University School of Law (2003),[273] Hofstra University (2006),[84] Northeastern University School of Law (2007),[274] Howard University (2010),[275] St. Lawrence University (2010),[276] Paris Nanterre University (2010),[277] New York University (2012),[261] Yale University (2013),[262] the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras (2014),[263] and an honorary doctorate of human letters from Manhattan College (2019).[278]\n\n\nShe was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2002.[279] She was given the Outstanding Latino Professional Award in 2006 by the Latino/a Law Students Association.[280] In 2008, *Esquire* magazine included Sotomayor on its list of \"The 75 Most Influential People of the 21st Century\".[281] In 2013, Sotomayor won the Woodrow Wilson Award at her alma mater Princeton University.[282]\n\n\nIn June 2010, the Bronxdale Houses development, where Sotomayor grew up, was renamed after her. The Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses and Justice Sonia Sotomayor Community Center comprise 28 buildings with some 3,500 residents. While many New York housing developments are named after well-known people, this was only the second to be named after a former resident.[283] In 2011, the Sonia M. Sotomayor Learning Academies, a public high school complex in Los Angeles, was named after her.[284]\n\n\nIn 2013, a painting featuring her, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan was unveiled at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[285]\n\n\nIn May 2015 she received the Katharine Hepburn medal from Bryn Mawr College.[286]\n\n\nIn 2019, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[287]\n\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* Sotomayor, Sonia (2022) *Just Help!

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010, and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court.\n\n\nKagan was born and raised in New York City. After graduating from Princeton University, Worcester College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She began her career as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, leaving to serve as Associate White House Counsel, and later as a policy adviser under President Bill Clinton. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expired without action, she became a professor at Harvard Law School and was later named its first female dean.\n\n\nIn 2009, Kagan became the first female solicitor general of the United States.[5] The following year, President Obama nominated her to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy arising from the impending retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens. The United States Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37. As of 2022, she is the most recent justice appointed without any prior judicial experience. She is considered part of the Court's liberal wing, but tends to be its most moderate justice. She has written the majority opinion in some landmark cases, such as *Cooper v. Harris*, *Chiafalo v. Washington*, and *Kisor v. Wilkie*, as well as several notable dissenting opinions, such as in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, *West Virginia v. EPA*, *Brnovich v. DNC*, *Janus v. AFSCME*, and *Seila Law v. CFPB*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKagan was born on April 28, 1960, in Manhattan, the second of three children[6][7] of Robert Kagan, an attorney who represented tenants trying to remain in their homes, and Gloria (Gittelman) Kagan, who taught at Hunter College Elementary School.[8][9] Both her parents were the children of Russian Jewish immigrants.[9] Kagan was raised in New York City.[10] She has two brothers, Marc and Irving.[11]\n\n\nKagan and her family lived in a third-floor apartment at West End Avenue and 75th Street,[12] and attended Lincoln Square Synagogue.[13] She was independent and strong-willed in her youth and, according to a former law partner of her father's, clashed with her Orthodox rabbi, Shlomo Riskin, over aspects of her bat mitzvah.[12] \"She had strong opinions about what a bat mitzvah should be like, which didn't parallel the wishes of the rabbi,\" her father's colleague said.[14] Kagan and Riskin negotiated a solution. Riskin had never performed a ritual bat mitzvah before.[13] She \"felt very strongly that there should be ritual bat mitzvah in the synagogue, no less important than the ritual bar mitzvah. This was really the first formal bat mitzvah we had\", he said.[13] Kagan asked to read from the Torah on a Saturday morning as the boys did, but ultimately read from the Book of Ruth on a Friday night.[13] She now practices Conservative Judaism.[13]\n\n\nKagan's childhood friend Margaret Raymond recalled that she was a teenage smoker but not a partier.[12] On Saturday nights, Raymond and Kagan were \"more apt to sit on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and talk.\"[12] Kagan also loved literature and reread Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* every year.[12] In her 1977 Hunter College High School yearbook, she is pictured in a judge's robe and holding a gavel.[15] Next to the photo is a quotation from former Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter: \"Government is itself an art, one of the subtlest of arts.\"[16]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan graduates from Harvard Law School in 1986\nKagan attended Hunter College High School, where her mother taught. The school had a reputation as one of the most elite learning institutions for high school girls and attracted students from all over New York City. Kagan emerged as one of the school's more outstanding students.[17] She was elected president of the student government and served on a student-faculty consultative committee.[18] Kagan then attended Princeton University, graduating in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, in history.[19] She was particularly drawn to American history and archival research.[20] She wrote a senior thesis under historian Sean Wilentz titled \"To the Final Conflict: Socialism in New York City, 1900–1933\". In it she wrote, \"Through its own internal feuding, then, the SP [Socialist Party] exhausted itself forever. The story is a sad but also a chastening one for those who, more than half a century after socialism's decline, still wish to change America.\"[21] Wilentz says Kagan did not mean to defend socialism, noting that she \"was interested in it. To study something is not to endorse it.\"[12]\n\n\nAs an undergraduate, Kagan also served as editorial chair of *The Daily Princetonian*.[19][22] Along with eight other students,[a] she penned a \"Declaration of the Campaign for a Democratic University\". It called for \"a fundamental restructuring of university governance\" and condemned Princeton's administration for making decisions \"behind closed doors\".[23] Despite the liberal tone of *The Daily Princetonian*'s editorials, Kagan was politically restrained in her dealings with fellow reporters. Her *Daily Princetonian* colleague Steven Bernstein has said he \"cannot recall a time in which Kagan expressed her political views\".[24] He described Kagan's political stances as \"sort of liberal, democratic, progressive tradition, and everything with lower case\".[24]\n\n\nIn 1980, Kagan received Princeton's Daniel M. Sachs Class of 1960 Graduating Scholarship,[b] one of the highest general awards the university confers. This enabled her to study at Worcester College, Oxford. As part of her graduation requirement, Kagan wrote a thesis called \"The Development and Erosion of the American Exclusionary Rule: A Study in Judicial Method\". It presented a critical look at the exclusionary rule and its evolution on the Supreme Court—the Warren Court, in particular.[26] She earned a Master of Philosophy in politics at Oxford in 1983.[27]\n\n\nIn 1983, at age 23, Kagan entered Harvard Law School. Her adjustment to Harvard's atmosphere was rocky; she received the worst grades of her entire law school career in her first semester. Kagan went on to earn an A in 17 of the 21 courses she took at Harvard, and she became a supervisory editor of the *Harvard Law Review*.[28] She worked as a summer associate at the Wall Street law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, where she worked in the litigation department.[29] She graduated in 1986 with a Juris Doctor *magna cum laude*.[30][31] Her friend Jeffrey Toobin recalls that Kagan \"stood out from the start as one with a formidable mind. She's good with people. At the time, the law school was a politically charged and divided place. She navigated the factions with ease, and won the respect of everyone.\"[32]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Kagan was a law clerk for judge Abner J. Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1987 to 1988. She became one of Mikva's favorite clerks; he called her \"the pick of the litter\".[33] From 1988 to 1989, Kagan clerked for justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. Marshall said he hired Kagan to help him put the \"spark\" back into his opinions as the Court had been undergoing a conservative shift since William Rehnquist became Chief Justice in 1986.[34] Marshall nicknamed the 5-foot-3-inch (1.60-metre) Kagan \"Shorty\".[12]\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, Kagan was in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm Williams & Connolly.[35] As a junior associate, she drafted briefs and conducted discovery.[36] During her short time at the firm, she handled five lawsuits that involved First Amendment or media law issues and libel issues.[37]\n\n\nIn 1991, Kagan became an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School.[38] While there she first met Barack Obama, a guest lecturer at the school.[39][40] While on the UC faculty, Kagan published a law review article on the regulation of First Amendment hate speech in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul*;[41] an article discussing the significance of governmental motive in regulating speech;[42] and a review of a book by Stephen L. Carter discussing the judicial confirmation process.[43] In the first article, which became highly influential, Kagan argued that the Supreme Court should examine governmental motives when deciding First Amendment cases and analyzed historic draft-card burning and flag burning cases in light of free speech arguments.[44]\n\n\nIn 1993, Senator Joe Biden appointed Kagan as a special counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee. During this time, she worked on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[45]\n\n\nKagan became a tenured professor of law in 1995.[38] According to her colleagues, Kagan's students complimented and admired her from the beginning, and she was granted tenure \"despite the reservations of some colleagues who thought she had not published enough\".[12]\n\n\n\n### Clinton administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan in the Oval Office with President Bill Clinton in 1997 during her tenure as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy\nKagan served as Associate White House Counsel for Bill Clinton from 1995 to 1996, when Mikva served as White House Counsel. She worked on such issues affecting the Clinton administration as the Whitewater controversy, the White House travel office controversy, and *Clinton v. Jones*.[46] From 1997 to 1999, she worked as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council. Kagan worked on topics like budget appropriations, campaign finance reform, and social welfare issues. Her work is catalogued in the Clinton Library.[47] Kagan coauthored a 1997 memo urging Clinton to support a ban on late-term abortions: \"We recommend that you endorse the Daschle amendment in order to sustain your credibility on HR 1122 and prevent Congress from overriding your veto.\"[48]\n\n\nOn June 17, 1999, Clinton nominated Kagan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to replace James L. Buckley, who took senior status in 1996. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican Chairman, Orrin Hatch, scheduled no hearing, effectively ending her nomination. When the Senate term ended, her nomination lapsed, as did that of fellow Clinton nominee Allen Snyder.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Academia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan as Harvard Law School dean in 2008\n![](image)Kagan's 2009 official portrait as Harvard Law School dean\nAfter her service in the White House and her lapsed judicial nomination, Kagan returned to academia in 1999. She initially sought to return to the University of Chicago, but she had given up her tenured position during her extended stint in the Clinton Administration, and the school chose not to rehire her, reportedly due to doubts about her commitment to academia.[51] Kagan quickly found a position as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School. While there, she authored a law review article on United States administrative law, focusing on the president's role in formulating and influencing federal administrative law. The article was honored as the year's top scholarly article by the American Bar Association's Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice.[52]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kagan was named a full professor at Harvard Law School and in 2003 she was named dean of the Law School by Harvard University President Lawrence Summers.[53] She succeeded Robert C. Clark, who had served as dean for over a decade. The focus of her tenure was on improving student satisfaction. Efforts included constructing new facilities and reforming the first-year curriculum as well as aesthetic changes and creature comforts, such as free morning coffee. She has been credited for a consensus-building leadership style that defused the school's previous ideological discord.[54][55][56]\n\n\nAs dean, Kagan inherited a $400 million capital campaign, \"Setting the Standard,\" in 2003. It ended in 2008 with a record-breaking $476 million raised, 19% more than the original goal.[57] Kagan made a number of prominent new hires, increasing the size of the faculty considerably. Her coups included hiring legal scholar Cass Sunstein away from the University of Chicago[58] and Lawrence Lessig away from Stanford.[59] She also made an effort to hire conservative scholars, such as former Bush administration official Jack Goldsmith, for the traditionally liberal-leaning faculty.[55][60]\n\n\nAccording to Kevin Washburn, then dean of the University of New Mexico School of Law, Kagan transformed Harvard Law School from a harsh environment for students to one that was much more student-focused.[56]\n\n\n\nDuring her deanship, Kagan upheld a decades-old policy barring military recruiters from the Office of Career Services because she felt the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy discriminated against gays and lesbians. According to Campus Progress, \n\n\n> As dean, Kagan supported a lawsuit intended to overturn the Solomon Amendment so military recruiters might be banned from the grounds of schools like Harvard. When a federal appeals court ruled The Pentagon could not withhold funds, she banned the military from Harvard's campus once again. The case was challenged in the Supreme Court, which ruled the military could indeed require schools to allow recruiters if they wanted to receive federal money. Kagan, though she allowed the military back, simultaneously urged students to demonstrate against Don't Ask, Don't Tell.[61][62]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2003, Kagan sent an email to students and faculty deploring that military recruiters had shown up on campus in violation of this policy. The email read in part, \"This action causes me deep distress. I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy\".[63] She also wrote that it was \"a profound wrong—a moral injustice of the first order\".[63]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Kagan was a member of the Research Advisory Council of the Goldman Sachs Global Markets Institute. She received a $10,000 stipend for her service.[64]\n\n\nBy early 2007, Kagan was a finalist for the presidency of Harvard University after Lawrence Summers's resignation the previous year. The position ultimately went to Drew Gilpin Faust instead. Kagan was reportedly disappointed, and law school students threw her a party to express their appreciation for her leadership.[65]\n\n\n\n### Solicitor General[edit]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2009, President-elect Barack Obama announced he would nominate Kagan to be Solicitor General.[66][67] She was vetted for the position of Deputy Attorney General before her selection as Solicitor General.[68] At the time of her nomination, Kagan had never argued a case before any court.[69] At least two previous solicitors general, Robert Bork and Kenneth Starr, had no previous Supreme Court appearances.[70]\n\n\nThe two main questions senators had for Kagan during her confirmation hearings were whether she would defend statutes that she personally opposed and whether she was qualified to be Solicitor General given her lack of courtroom experience.[71] Kagan testified that she would defend laws, such as the Defense of Marriage Act, pursuant to which states were not required to recognize same-sex marriages originating in other states, \"if there is any reasonable basis to do so\".[72] The Senate confirmed her on March 19, 2009, by a vote of 61 to 31.[73] She was the first woman to hold the position.[74] Upon taking office, Kagan pledged to defend any statute as long as there was a colorable argument to be made, regardless of her personal opinions.[71] As Solicitor General, Kagan's job was to act as the lawyer for the United States and defend legislation and executive actions in appeals before the Supreme Court.[74][45] Thus the arguments she made as Solicitor General were not necessarily indicative of her personal beliefs.[74]\n\n\nKagan's first appearance before the Supreme Court was on September 9, 2009, one month before the typical start of a new term in October, in the re-argument of *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[75] During argument, she asked the Court to uphold a 1990 precedent that allowed the government to restrict corporations' use of their treasuries to campaign for or against political candidates. As an alternative argument, Kagan further contended that if the Court would not uphold precedent, it should keep its ruling narrowly focused on corporations that resembled the petitioning organization, Citizens United, rather than reconsidering the constitutionality of broader restrictions on corporate campaign finance.[75][76][77] In a 5–4 decision, the Court overturned precedent and allowed corporations to spend freely in elections, a major defeat for the Obama administration.[78]\n\n\nDuring her 15 months as Solicitor General, Kagan argued six cases before the Supreme Court.[79] *The Washington Post* described her style during argument as \"confident\" and \"conversational\".[74] She helped win four cases: *Salazar v. Buono*, 559 U.S. 700 (2010), *United States v. Comstock*, 560 U.S. 126 (2010), *Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project*, 561 U.S. 1 (2010), and *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).[80][c]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n#### Nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elena Kagan Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Kagan meets with then President Obama in the Oval Office, April 2010, a month before nominating her to the U.S. Supreme Court\nObama nominates Kagan to be an Associate Justice for the United States Supreme Court\nBefore Obama's election, Kagan was the subject of media speculation as a potential Supreme Court nominee if a Democratic president were elected in 2008.[82] Obama had his first Supreme Court vacancy to fill in 2009 when Associate Justice David H. Souter announced his upcoming retirement.[83] Senior Obama adviser David Axelrod later recounted that during the search for a new justice, Antonin Scalia told him he hoped Obama would nominate Kagan, because of her intelligence.[84] On May 13, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Obama was considering Kagan, among others.[85] On May 26, 2009, Obama announced that he had chosen Sonia Sotomayor.[86]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens announced he would retire at the start of the Court's summer 2010 recess, triggering new speculation about potential replacements, and Kagan was once again considered a contender.[87] In a *Fresh Dialogues* interview, Jeffrey Toobin, a Supreme Court analyst and Kagan's friend and law school classmate,[88] speculated that she would be Obama's nominee, describing her as \"very much an Obama-type person, a moderate Democrat, a consensus builder\".[89] This alarmed some liberals and progressives, who worried that \"replacing Stevens with Kagan risks moving the Court to the right, perhaps substantially to the right\".[90]\n\n\nOn May 10, 2010, Obama nominated Kagan to the Supreme Court.[91] The deans of over one-third of the country's law schools, 69 people in total, endorsed the nomination in an open letter in early June. It lauded what it called her coalition-building skills and \"understanding of both doctrine and policy\" as well as her written record of legal analysis.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Confirmation hearings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan, Obama, and Chief Justice John Roberts before her investiture ceremony, October 1, 2010\n![](image)Kagan (right), then a Supreme Court nominee, meets with U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen\nKagan's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on June 28.[93] As they began, Kagan was expected to be confirmed, with Senator John Cornyn calling her \"justice-to-be\".[94] During the hearings, she demonstrated a deep knowledge of Supreme Court cases, expounding upon cases senators mentioned in their questions to her without taking notes on the questions. A number of Democratic senators criticized recent decisions of the court as \"activist\", but Kagan avoided joining in their criticisms.[95] Like many prior nominees, including Chief Justice John Roberts, she declined to answer whether she thought particular cases were correctly decided or how she would vote on particular issues.[95][96] Senators Jon Kyl and Arlen Specter[d] criticized her evasiveness. Specter said it obscured the way justices actually ruled once on the Court.[96] He noted that Kagan published an article in the *University of Chicago Law Review* in 1995 in which she criticized the evasiveness she came to practice.[98][94] Republican senators criticized Kagan's background as more political than judicial; she responded by promising to be impartial and fair.[93] On July 20, 2010, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13–6 to recommend Kagan's confirmation to the full Senate. On August 5 the full Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37.[99] The voting was largely along party lines, with five Republicans (Richard Lugar, Judd Gregg, Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and Olympia Snowe) supporting her and one Democrat (Ben Nelson) opposing.[100]\n\n\nKagan's swearing-in ceremony took place on August 7, 2010, at the White House. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, at which time she became the 112th justice (100th associate justice) of the Supreme Court.[101][102] She is the first person appointed to the Court without any prior experience as a judge since William Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell Jr., who both became members in 1972.[103][104][105] She is the fourth female justice in the court's history,[e] and the eighth Jewish justice.[106][f]\n\n\nIdeologically, Kagan is part of the Supreme Court's liberal wing:[108][109][110] she voted with the liberal bloc in *King v. Burwell*, 576 U.S. 988 (2015), finding that Obamacare's subsidies and individual mandate are constitutional, and in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644 (2015), which prohibits states from outlawing same-sex marriage.[111] In 2018, *Slate* observed that Kagan had crossed ideological lines on multiple cases during the preceding term, and considered her to be part of a centrist bloc along with Justices Roberts, Stephen Breyer, and Anthony Kennedy.[112] Still, *FiveThirtyEight* observed that Kagan voted with her more liberal peers, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, over 90% of the time.[113] Also during the 2017–18 term, Kagan most commonly agreed with Breyer; they voted together in 93% of cases. She agreed least often with Justice Samuel Alito, in 58.82% of cases.[114]\n\n\nBecause of her service as solicitor general, Kagan recused herself from 28 out of the 78 cases heard during her first year on the Court to avoid conflicts of interest.[115] In 2017, she recused herself from the immigrant-detention case *Jennings v. Rodriguez* because she authorized a filing in the case when she was solicitor general.[116]\n\n\nKagan was the circuit justice, the justice responsible for handling emergency requests, for the Sixth and Seventh Circuits.[117] After Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, she was assigned to the Ninth Circuit, the largest US circuit court by area. It includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Nevada, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Washington state.[118][117]\n\n\n\n#### Jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nKagan's first opinion as a justice, *Ransom v. FIA Card Services*, was a statutory interpretation case where the Court was tasked with determining what income a debtor was allowed to shield from creditors in bankruptcy.[119] In an 8–1 decision, she held that the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy statute precludes a debtor from taking an allowance for car-related expenses if the debtor owns the car outright and does not make loan or lease payments. She reasoned the word \"applicable\" was key to the statute, and debtors could only take allowances for car-related costs that applied.[120][121] Kagan wrote the majority opinion in *Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC*. In the 6–3 decision in favor of Marvel, she held that a patentee cannot receive royalties after the patent has expired.[122] Her opinion included several references to Spider-Man.[123]\n\n\n\n##### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch at President Donald Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address\nKagan's first dissent came in the First Amendment case *Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn*, 563 U.S. 125 (2011).[124] Writing for the liberal wing, she took issue with the majority's creation of an exception to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.[124] The majority held that Arizona taxpayers cannot challenge tax credits for those who donate to groups that provide scholarships to religious schools, drawing a distinction between the way the Court treats tax credits and grants.[124][125] Kagan deemed this distinction \"arbitrary\" because tax credits and grants can be used to achieve the same objectives. She viewed the majority's decision as creating a loophole for governments to fund religion.[124] In another Establishment Clause case, *Town of Greece v. Galloway*, 572 U.S. 565 (2014), Kagan wrote a dissent arguing that a prayer at a town council meeting failed to treat all Americans the same regardless of religion.[126] *Greece* involved a town in New York inviting chaplains, for several years all Christian, to give a prayer before town council meetings.[127] Unlike *Marsh v. Chambers*, 463 U.S. 783 (1983), where the Supreme Court had permitted a state legislature to open with a prayer, Kagan noted the board in *Greece* was a forum for ordinary citizens.[128] She argued the use of prayer showed a preference for a particular religion and thus violated Americans' First Amendment rights.[128]\n\n\n\n##### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nKagan dissented in *Luis v. United States*, 578 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2016), where the five-justice majority held that the pretrial freezing of untainted assets not traced back to criminal activity was a violation of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel when those assets were needed to retain counsel of the defendant's choosing.[129] The defendant, Sila Luis, had been charged with Medicare fraud, in which prosecutors alleged he illegally charged $45 million for unneeded services. The prosecutors asked a judge to freeze $2 million of Luis's assets, which Luis said she needed to pay legal bills, after she had already spent most of the $45 million she made from the alleged scheme.[130] An earlier Supreme Court case, *United States v. Monsanto*, 491 U.S. 600 (1989), held that a court could freeze a defendant's assets pretrial, including funds obtained through the alleged sale of drugs, even when those assets were being used to hire an attorney.[131] The majority sought to distinguish their holding in *Luis* from *Monsanto* based upon the nature of the funds being frozen; Luis's funds were not directly linked to her crime and Monsanto's funds were.[129][131] Kennedy dissented in *Luis* because he did not think criminal defendants should be treated differently based on how quickly they spent their illegal proceeds. Kagan agreed with Kennedy that the Court's decision created inequity and drew an arbitrary distinction, but further opined that *Monsanto* might have been wrongly decided.[131] She suggested she would be willing to overturn such precedent in the future, but declined to do so in the case at bar because Luis had not sought that relief.[129][131][130] Her vote thus rested on procedural grounds as she expressed skepticism that the government should be able to freeze the assets of a criminal defendant not yet convicted, and thus still benefiting from the presumption of innocence, by merely showing probable cause that the property will be subject to forfeiture.[131]\n\n\n\n##### Gerrymandering[edit]\n\n\nKagan wrote for the majority in *Cooper v. Harris*, 581 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017), striking down the configuration of two of North Carolina's congressional districts.[132] The Court held the districts' boundaries were unconstitutional because they relied excessively on race and did not pass the strict scrutiny standard of review.[133][134][135] In a footnote, Kagan set forth a new principle, that congressional districts drawn with race as the dominant factor may be found to be an unlawful racial gerrymander even if they have another goal, such as sorting voters by political affiliation.[134] Applying this principle to the facts of the case, the Court unanimously struck down North Carolina's District 1, where state lawmakers had increased the state's black voting-age population by 4.1% even though the black population had already been able to elect preferred candidates before the district lines were redrawn.[133] The increase of black voters in District 1 resulted in a decrease of black voters in other districts.[135] The Court also struck down District 12 by a vote of 5–3 for similar shifts in its racial composition. The dissent argued that those challenging the validity of the district had not proved that race caused the change in District 12.[133] Kagan quoted Court precedent that race must only be a predominant consideration, and that challengers did not need to prove politics was not a motivating factor.[133][134]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Kagan dissented in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, a 5-4 ruling that held that partisan gerrymandering is a non-justiciable claim. Kagan wrote, \"Of all times to abandon the Court’s duty to declare the law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court’s role in that system is to defend its foundations. None is more important than free and fair elections. With respect but deep sadness, I dissent.\"[136] Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor joined her dissent.\n\n\n\n##### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Brnovich v. DNC*, Kagan wrote the dissenting opinion and was joined by Breyer and Sotomayor. She would have struck down the Arizona voting laws that throw out votes that are cast out-of-precinct and ban ballot harvesting. Kagan wrote that African-American, Latino, and Native American voters are disproportionately likely to have their votes thrown out for being out-of-precinct (compared to White voters). She concluded, \"The law that confronted one of this country’s most enduring wrongs; pledged to give every American, of every race, an equal chance to participate in our democracy; and now stands as the crucial tool to achieve that goal. That law, of all laws, deserves the sweep and power Congress gave it. That law, of all laws, should not be diminished by this Court.\"[137]\n\n\n\n##### Environment[edit]\n\n\nJoined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, Kagan dissented in *West Virginia v. EPA*, which struck down the proposed Clean Power Plan. She wrote, \"It is EPA (that's the Environmental Protection Agency, in case the majority forgot) acting to address the greatest environmental challenge of our time. So too, there is nothing special about the Plan's 'who': fossil-fuel-fired power plants. In Utility Air, we thought EPA's regulation of churches and schools highly unusual. But fossil-fuel-fired plants? Those plants pollute—a lot—and so they have long lived under the watchful eye of EPA. That was true even before EPA began regulating carbon dioxide.\" Kagan concluded, \"The subject matter of the regulation here makes the Court's intervention all the more troubling. Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change. And let's say the obvious: The stakes here are high. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants' carbon dioxide emissions. The Court appoints itself—instead of Congress or the expert agency—the decision-maker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening. Respectfully, I dissent.\"[138][139]\n\n\n\n#### Writing style[edit]\n\n\nIn her first term on the Court, Kagan did not write any separate opinions, and wrote the fewest opinions of any justice. She wrote only majority opinions or dissents that more senior justices assigned to her, and in which she and a group of justices agreed upon a rationale for deciding the case. This tendency to write for a group rather than herself made it difficult to discern her own views or where she might lean in future cases.[140] She wrote the fewest opinions for the terms from 2011 through 2014, tying with Kennedy in 2011 and 2013.[141]\n\n\nKagan's writing has been characterized as conversational, employing a range of rhetorical styles.[142] She has said that she approaches writing on the Court like she used to approach the classroom, with numerous strategies to engage the reader.[143] Her opinions use examples and analogies to make them more accessible to a broad audience.[140][144]\n\n\n\n#### Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first four female U.S. Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Kagan, October 2010. (O'Connor is not wearing a robe because she had retired before the picture was taken).\nLike other justices, Kagan makes public appearances when she is not hearing cases.[145] In her first four years on the Court, she made at least 20 public appearances.[146] Kagan tends to choose speaking engagements that allow her to speak to students.[145]\n\n\n*Time* magazine named Kagan one of its Time 100 most influential people for 2013. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the article on Kagan, calling her \"an incisive legal thinker\" and \"excellent communicator\".[147] That same year, a painting of the four women to have served as Supreme Court justices, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and O'Connor, was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[148] In 2018, Kagan received the Marshall-Wythe Medallion from William & Mary Law School,[149] and an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Hunter College.[150]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKagan has never married. During her confirmation, a photo of her playing softball, which is sometimes characterized in popular culture as unfeminine, led to unsubstantiated claims that Kagan was a lesbian.[151] Her friends have criticized the rumors. Kagan's law school roommate Sarah Walzer said, \"I've known her for most of her adult life and I know she's straight.\"[152]\n\n\nKagan's Harvard colleagues and friends have characterized her as a good conversationalist, warm, with a good sense of humor.[153] Before joining the Supreme Court, she was known to play poker and smoke cigars.[153][154]\n\n\nEarly in her tenure as a justice, Kagan began socializing with several of her new colleagues.[155] She attended the opera with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, had dinner with Sonia Sotomayor, attended legal events with Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, and went hunting with Antonin Scalia.[155] The hunting trips stemmed from a promise Kagan made to U.S. Senator Jim Risch of Idaho during a meeting before her confirmation; Risch expressed concern that, as a New York City native, Kagan did not understand the importance of hunting to his constituents. Kagan initially offered to go hunting with Risch before promising instead to go hunting with Scalia if confirmed. According to Kagan, Scalia laughed when she told him of the promise and took her to his hunting club for the first of several hunting trips.[156] Kagan is known to spend time with longtime friends from law school and her stint in the Clinton administration rather than attending Washington, D.C., social events she is invited to as a justice.[155]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates\n* Bill Clinton judicial appointment controversies\n* Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of Jewish American jurists\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 4)\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 10)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Princeton student body president and future Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, was one of the other students.\n2. **^** Fellowship in memory of Rhodes Scholar from Princeton, Daniel M.

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010, and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court.\n\n\nKagan was born and raised in New York City. After graduating from Princeton University, Worcester College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She began her career as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, leaving to serve as Associate White House Counsel, and later as a policy adviser under President Bill Clinton. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expired without action, she became a professor at Harvard Law School and was later named its first female dean.\n\n\nIn 2009, Kagan became the first female solicitor general of the United States.[5] The following year, President Obama nominated her to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy arising from the impending retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens. The United States Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37. As of 2022, she is the most recent justice appointed without any prior judicial experience. She is considered part of the Court's liberal wing, but tends to be its most moderate justice. She has written the majority opinion in some landmark cases, such as *Cooper v. Harris*, *Chiafalo v. Washington*, and *Kisor v. Wilkie*, as well as several notable dissenting opinions, such as in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, *West Virginia v. EPA*, *Brnovich v. DNC*, *Janus v. AFSCME*, and *Seila Law v. CFPB*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKagan was born on April 28, 1960, in Manhattan, the second of three children[6][7] of Robert Kagan, an attorney who represented tenants trying to remain in their homes, and Gloria (Gittelman) Kagan, who taught at Hunter College Elementary School.[8][9] Both her parents were the children of Russian Jewish immigrants.[9] Kagan was raised in New York City.[10] She has two brothers, Marc and Irving.[11]\n\n\nKagan and her family lived in a third-floor apartment at West End Avenue and 75th Street,[12] and attended Lincoln Square Synagogue.[13] She was independent and strong-willed in her youth and, according to a former law partner of her father's, clashed with her Orthodox rabbi, Shlomo Riskin, over aspects of her bat mitzvah.[12] \"She had strong opinions about what a bat mitzvah should be like, which didn't parallel the wishes of the rabbi,\" her father's colleague said.[14] Kagan and Riskin negotiated a solution. Riskin had never performed a ritual bat mitzvah before.[13] She \"felt very strongly that there should be ritual bat mitzvah in the synagogue, no less important than the ritual bar mitzvah. This was really the first formal bat mitzvah we had\", he said.[13] Kagan asked to read from the Torah on a Saturday morning as the boys did, but ultimately read from the Book of Ruth on a Friday night.[13] She now practices Conservative Judaism.[13]\n\n\nKagan's childhood friend Margaret Raymond recalled that she was a teenage smoker but not a partier.[12] On Saturday nights, Raymond and Kagan were \"more apt to sit on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and talk.\"[12] Kagan also loved literature and reread Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* every year.[12] In her 1977 Hunter College High School yearbook, she is pictured in a judge's robe and holding a gavel.[15] Next to the photo is a quotation from former Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter: \"Government is itself an art, one of the subtlest of arts.\"[16]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan graduates from Harvard Law School in 1986\nKagan attended Hunter College High School, where her mother taught. The school had a reputation as one of the most elite learning institutions for high school girls and attracted students from all over New York City. Kagan emerged as one of the school's more outstanding students.[17] She was elected president of the student government and served on a student-faculty consultative committee.[18] Kagan then attended Princeton University, graduating in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, in history.[19] She was particularly drawn to American history and archival research.[20] She wrote a senior thesis under historian Sean Wilentz titled \"To the Final Conflict: Socialism in New York City, 1900–1933\". In it she wrote, \"Through its own internal feuding, then, the SP [Socialist Party] exhausted itself forever. The story is a sad but also a chastening one for those who, more than half a century after socialism's decline, still wish to change America.\"[21] Wilentz says Kagan did not mean to defend socialism, noting that she \"was interested in it. To study something is not to endorse it.\"[12]\n\n\nAs an undergraduate, Kagan also served as editorial chair of *The Daily Princetonian*.[19][22] Along with eight other students,[a] she penned a \"Declaration of the Campaign for a Democratic University\". It called for \"a fundamental restructuring of university governance\" and condemned Princeton's administration for making decisions \"behind closed doors\".[23] Despite the liberal tone of *The Daily Princetonian*'s editorials, Kagan was politically restrained in her dealings with fellow reporters. Her *Daily Princetonian* colleague Steven Bernstein has said he \"cannot recall a time in which Kagan expressed her political views\".[24] He described Kagan's political stances as \"sort of liberal, democratic, progressive tradition, and everything with lower case\".[24]\n\n\nIn 1980, Kagan received Princeton's Daniel M. Sachs Class of 1960 Graduating Scholarship,[b] one of the highest general awards the university confers. This enabled her to study at Worcester College, Oxford. As part of her graduation requirement, Kagan wrote a thesis called \"The Development and Erosion of the American Exclusionary Rule: A Study in Judicial Method\". It presented a critical look at the exclusionary rule and its evolution on the Supreme Court—the Warren Court, in particular.[26] She earned a Master of Philosophy in politics at Oxford in 1983.[27]\n\n\nIn 1983, at age 23, Kagan entered Harvard Law School. Her adjustment to Harvard's atmosphere was rocky; she received the worst grades of her entire law school career in her first semester. Kagan went on to earn an A in 17 of the 21 courses she took at Harvard, and she became a supervisory editor of the *Harvard Law Review*.[28] She worked as a summer associate at the Wall Street law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, where she worked in the litigation department.[29] She graduated in 1986 with a Juris Doctor *magna cum laude*.[30][31] Her friend Jeffrey Toobin recalls that Kagan \"stood out from the start as one with a formidable mind. She's good with people. At the time, the law school was a politically charged and divided place. She navigated the factions with ease, and won the respect of everyone.\"[32]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Kagan was a law clerk for judge Abner J. Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1987 to 1988. She became one of Mikva's favorite clerks; he called her \"the pick of the litter\".[33] From 1988 to 1989, Kagan clerked for justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. Marshall said he hired Kagan to help him put the \"spark\" back into his opinions as the Court had been undergoing a conservative shift since William Rehnquist became Chief Justice in 1986.[34] Marshall nicknamed the 5-foot-3-inch (1.60-metre) Kagan \"Shorty\".[12]\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, Kagan was in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm Williams & Connolly.[35] As a junior associate, she drafted briefs and conducted discovery.[36] During her short time at the firm, she handled five lawsuits that involved First Amendment or media law issues and libel issues.[37]\n\n\nIn 1991, Kagan became an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School.[38] While there she first met Barack Obama, a guest lecturer at the school.[39][40] While on the UC faculty, Kagan published a law review article on the regulation of First Amendment hate speech in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul*;[41] an article discussing the significance of governmental motive in regulating speech;[42] and a review of a book by Stephen L. Carter discussing the judicial confirmation process.[43] In the first article, which became highly influential, Kagan argued that the Supreme Court should examine governmental motives when deciding First Amendment cases and analyzed historic draft-card burning and flag burning cases in light of free speech arguments.[44]\n\n\nIn 1993, Senator Joe Biden appointed Kagan as a special counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee. During this time, she worked on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[45]\n\n\nKagan became a tenured professor of law in 1995.[38] According to her colleagues, Kagan's students complimented and admired her from the beginning, and she was granted tenure \"despite the reservations of some colleagues who thought she had not published enough\".[12]\n\n\n\n### Clinton administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan in the Oval Office with President Bill Clinton in 1997 during her tenure as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy\nKagan served as Associate White House Counsel for Bill Clinton from 1995 to 1996, when Mikva served as White House Counsel. She worked on such issues affecting the Clinton administration as the Whitewater controversy, the White House travel office controversy, and *Clinton v. Jones*.[46] From 1997 to 1999, she worked as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council. Kagan worked on topics like budget appropriations, campaign finance reform, and social welfare issues. Her work is catalogued in the Clinton Library.[47] Kagan coauthored a 1997 memo urging Clinton to support a ban on late-term abortions: \"We recommend that you endorse the Daschle amendment in order to sustain your credibility on HR 1122 and prevent Congress from overriding your veto.\"[48]\n\n\nOn June 17, 1999, Clinton nominated Kagan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to replace James L. Buckley, who took senior status in 1996. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican Chairman, Orrin Hatch, scheduled no hearing, effectively ending her nomination. When the Senate term ended, her nomination lapsed, as did that of fellow Clinton nominee Allen Snyder.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Academia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan as Harvard Law School dean in 2008\n![](image)Kagan's 2009 official portrait as Harvard Law School dean\nAfter her service in the White House and her lapsed judicial nomination, Kagan returned to academia in 1999. She initially sought to return to the University of Chicago, but she had given up her tenured position during her extended stint in the Clinton Administration, and the school chose not to rehire her, reportedly due to doubts about her commitment to academia.[51] Kagan quickly found a position as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School. While there, she authored a law review article on United States administrative law, focusing on the president's role in formulating and influencing federal administrative law. The article was honored as the year's top scholarly article by the American Bar Association's Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice.[52]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kagan was named a full professor at Harvard Law School and in 2003 she was named dean of the Law School by Harvard University President Lawrence Summers.[53] She succeeded Robert C. Clark, who had served as dean for over a decade. The focus of her tenure was on improving student satisfaction. Efforts included constructing new facilities and reforming the first-year curriculum as well as aesthetic changes and creature comforts, such as free morning coffee. She has been credited for a consensus-building leadership style that defused the school's previous ideological discord.[54][55][56]\n\n\nAs dean, Kagan inherited a $400 million capital campaign, \"Setting the Standard,\" in 2003. It ended in 2008 with a record-breaking $476 million raised, 19% more than the original goal.[57] Kagan made a number of prominent new hires, increasing the size of the faculty considerably. Her coups included hiring legal scholar Cass Sunstein away from the University of Chicago[58] and Lawrence Lessig away from Stanford.[59] She also made an effort to hire conservative scholars, such as former Bush administration official Jack Goldsmith, for the traditionally liberal-leaning faculty.[55][60]\n\n\nAccording to Kevin Washburn, then dean of the University of New Mexico School of Law, Kagan transformed Harvard Law School from a harsh environment for students to one that was much more student-focused.[56]\n\n\n\nDuring her deanship, Kagan upheld a decades-old policy barring military recruiters from the Office of Career Services because she felt the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy discriminated against gays and lesbians. According to Campus Progress, \n\n\n> As dean, Kagan supported a lawsuit intended to overturn the Solomon Amendment so military recruiters might be banned from the grounds of schools like Harvard. When a federal appeals court ruled The Pentagon could not withhold funds, she banned the military from Harvard's campus once again. The case was challenged in the Supreme Court, which ruled the military could indeed require schools to allow recruiters if they wanted to receive federal money. Kagan, though she allowed the military back, simultaneously urged students to demonstrate against Don't Ask, Don't Tell.[61][62]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2003, Kagan sent an email to students and faculty deploring that military recruiters had shown up on campus in violation of this policy. The email read in part, \"This action causes me deep distress. I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy\".[63] She also wrote that it was \"a profound wrong—a moral injustice of the first order\".[63]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Kagan was a member of the Research Advisory Council of the Goldman Sachs Global Markets Institute. She received a $10,000 stipend for her service.[64]\n\n\nBy early 2007, Kagan was a finalist for the presidency of Harvard University after Lawrence Summers's resignation the previous year. The position ultimately went to Drew Gilpin Faust instead. Kagan was reportedly disappointed, and law school students threw her a party to express their appreciation for her leadership.[65]\n\n\n\n### Solicitor General[edit]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2009, President-elect Barack Obama announced he would nominate Kagan to be Solicitor General.[66][67] She was vetted for the position of Deputy Attorney General before her selection as Solicitor General.[68] At the time of her nomination, Kagan had never argued a case before any court.[69] At least two previous solicitors general, Robert Bork and Kenneth Starr, had no previous Supreme Court appearances.[70]\n\n\nThe two main questions senators had for Kagan during her confirmation hearings were whether she would defend statutes that she personally opposed and whether she was qualified to be Solicitor General given her lack of courtroom experience.[71] Kagan testified that she would defend laws, such as the Defense of Marriage Act, pursuant to which states were not required to recognize same-sex marriages originating in other states, \"if there is any reasonable basis to do so\".[72] The Senate confirmed her on March 19, 2009, by a vote of 61 to 31.[73] She was the first woman to hold the position.[74] Upon taking office, Kagan pledged to defend any statute as long as there was a colorable argument to be made, regardless of her personal opinions.[71] As Solicitor General, Kagan's job was to act as the lawyer for the United States and defend legislation and executive actions in appeals before the Supreme Court.[74][45] Thus the arguments she made as Solicitor General were not necessarily indicative of her personal beliefs.[74]\n\n\nKagan's first appearance before the Supreme Court was on September 9, 2009, one month before the typical start of a new term in October, in the re-argument of *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[75] During argument, she asked the Court to uphold a 1990 precedent that allowed the government to restrict corporations' use of their treasuries to campaign for or against political candidates. As an alternative argument, Kagan further contended that if the Court would not uphold precedent, it should keep its ruling narrowly focused on corporations that resembled the petitioning organization, Citizens United, rather than reconsidering the constitutionality of broader restrictions on corporate campaign finance.[75][76][77] In a 5–4 decision, the Court overturned precedent and allowed corporations to spend freely in elections, a major defeat for the Obama administration.[78]\n\n\nDuring her 15 months as Solicitor General, Kagan argued six cases before the Supreme Court.[79] *The Washington Post* described her style during argument as \"confident\" and \"conversational\".[74] She helped win four cases: *Salazar v. Buono*, 559 U.S. 700 (2010), *United States v. Comstock*, 560 U.S. 126 (2010), *Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project*, 561 U.S. 1 (2010), and *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).[80][c]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n#### Nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elena Kagan Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Kagan meets with then President Obama in the Oval Office, April 2010, a month before nominating her to the U.S. Supreme Court\nObama nominates Kagan to be an Associate Justice for the United States Supreme Court\nBefore Obama's election, Kagan was the subject of media speculation as a potential Supreme Court nominee if a Democratic president were elected in 2008.[82] Obama had his first Supreme Court vacancy to fill in 2009 when Associate Justice David H. Souter announced his upcoming retirement.[83] Senior Obama adviser David Axelrod later recounted that during the search for a new justice, Antonin Scalia told him he hoped Obama would nominate Kagan, because of her intelligence.[84] On May 13, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Obama was considering Kagan, among others.[85] On May 26, 2009, Obama announced that he had chosen Sonia Sotomayor.[86]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens announced he would retire at the start of the Court's summer 2010 recess, triggering new speculation about potential replacements, and Kagan was once again considered a contender.[87] In a *Fresh Dialogues* interview, Jeffrey Toobin, a Supreme Court analyst and Kagan's friend and law school classmate,[88] speculated that she would be Obama's nominee, describing her as \"very much an Obama-type person, a moderate Democrat, a consensus builder\".[89] This alarmed some liberals and progressives, who worried that \"replacing Stevens with Kagan risks moving the Court to the right, perhaps substantially to the right\".[90]\n\n\nOn May 10, 2010, Obama nominated Kagan to the Supreme Court.[91] The deans of over one-third of the country's law schools, 69 people in total, endorsed the nomination in an open letter in early June. It lauded what it called her coalition-building skills and \"understanding of both doctrine and policy\" as well as her written record of legal analysis.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Confirmation hearings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan, Obama, and Chief Justice John Roberts before her investiture ceremony, October 1, 2010\n![](image)Kagan (right), then a Supreme Court nominee, meets with U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen\nKagan's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on June 28.[93] As they began, Kagan was expected to be confirmed, with Senator John Cornyn calling her \"justice-to-be\".[94] During the hearings, she demonstrated a deep knowledge of Supreme Court cases, expounding upon cases senators mentioned in their questions to her without taking notes on the questions. A number of Democratic senators criticized recent decisions of the court as \"activist\", but Kagan avoided joining in their criticisms.[95] Like many prior nominees, including Chief Justice John Roberts, she declined to answer whether she thought particular cases were correctly decided or how she would vote on particular issues.[95][96] Senators Jon Kyl and Arlen Specter[d] criticized her evasiveness. Specter said it obscured the way justices actually ruled once on the Court.[96] He noted that Kagan published an article in the *University of Chicago Law Review* in 1995 in which she criticized the evasiveness she came to practice.[98][94] Republican senators criticized Kagan's background as more political than judicial; she responded by promising to be impartial and fair.[93] On July 20, 2010, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13–6 to recommend Kagan's confirmation to the full Senate. On August 5 the full Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37.[99] The voting was largely along party lines, with five Republicans (Richard Lugar, Judd Gregg, Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and Olympia Snowe) supporting her and one Democrat (Ben Nelson) opposing.[100]\n\n\nKagan's swearing-in ceremony took place on August 7, 2010, at the White House. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, at which time she became the 112th justice (100th associate justice) of the Supreme Court.[101][102] She is the first person appointed to the Court without any prior experience as a judge since William Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell Jr., who both became members in 1972.[103][104][105] She is the fourth female justice in the court's history,[e] and the eighth Jewish justice.[106][f]\n\n\nIdeologically, Kagan is part of the Supreme Court's liberal wing:[108][109][110] she voted with the liberal bloc in *King v. Burwell*, 576 U.S. 988 (2015), finding that Obamacare's subsidies and individual mandate are constitutional, and in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644 (2015), which prohibits states from outlawing same-sex marriage.[111] In 2018, *Slate* observed that Kagan had crossed ideological lines on multiple cases during the preceding term, and considered her to be part of a centrist bloc along with Justices Roberts, Stephen Breyer, and Anthony Kennedy.[112] Still, *FiveThirtyEight* observed that Kagan voted with her more liberal peers, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, over 90% of the time.[113] Also during the 2017–18 term, Kagan most commonly agreed with Breyer; they voted together in 93% of cases. She agreed least often with Justice Samuel Alito, in 58.82% of cases.[114]\n\n\nBecause of her service as solicitor general, Kagan recused herself from 28 out of the 78 cases heard during her first year on the Court to avoid conflicts of interest.[115] In 2017, she recused herself from the immigrant-detention case *Jennings v. Rodriguez* because she authorized a filing in the case when she was solicitor general.[116]\n\n\nKagan was the circuit justice, the justice responsible for handling emergency requests, for the Sixth and Seventh Circuits.[117] After Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, she was assigned to the Ninth Circuit, the largest US circuit court by area. It includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Nevada, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Washington state.[118][117]\n\n\n\n#### Jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nKagan's first opinion as a justice, *Ransom v. FIA Card Services*, was a statutory interpretation case where the Court was tasked with determining what income a debtor was allowed to shield from creditors in bankruptcy.[119] In an 8–1 decision, she held that the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy statute precludes a debtor from taking an allowance for car-related expenses if the debtor owns the car outright and does not make loan or lease payments. She reasoned the word \"applicable\" was key to the statute, and debtors could only take allowances for car-related costs that applied.[120][121] Kagan wrote the majority opinion in *Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC*. In the 6–3 decision in favor of Marvel, she held that a patentee cannot receive royalties after the patent has expired.[122] Her opinion included several references to Spider-Man.[123]\n\n\n\n##### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch at President Donald Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address\nKagan's first dissent came in the First Amendment case *Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn*, 563 U.S. 125 (2011).[124] Writing for the liberal wing, she took issue with the majority's creation of an exception to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.[124] The majority held that Arizona taxpayers cannot challenge tax credits for those who donate to groups that provide scholarships to religious schools, drawing a distinction between the way the Court treats tax credits and grants.[124][125] Kagan deemed this distinction \"arbitrary\" because tax credits and grants can be used to achieve the same objectives. She viewed the majority's decision as creating a loophole for governments to fund religion.[124] In another Establishment Clause case, *Town of Greece v. Galloway*, 572 U.S. 565 (2014), Kagan wrote a dissent arguing that a prayer at a town council meeting failed to treat all Americans the same regardless of religion.[126] *Greece* involved a town in New York inviting chaplains, for several years all Christian, to give a prayer before town council meetings.[127] Unlike *Marsh v. Chambers*, 463 U.S. 783 (1983), where the Supreme Court had permitted a state legislature to open with a prayer, Kagan noted the board in *Greece* was a forum for ordinary citizens.[128] She argued the use of prayer showed a preference for a particular religion and thus violated Americans' First Amendment rights.[128]\n\n\n\n##### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nKagan dissented in *Luis v. United States*, 578 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2016), where the five-justice majority held that the pretrial freezing of untainted assets not traced back to criminal activity was a violation of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel when those assets were needed to retain counsel of the defendant's choosing.[129] The defendant, Sila Luis, had been charged with Medicare fraud, in which prosecutors alleged he illegally charged $45 million for unneeded services. The prosecutors asked a judge to freeze $2 million of Luis's assets, which Luis said she needed to pay legal bills, after she had already spent most of the $45 million she made from the alleged scheme.[130] An earlier Supreme Court case, *United States v. Monsanto*, 491 U.S. 600 (1989), held that a court could freeze a defendant's assets pretrial, including funds obtained through the alleged sale of drugs, even when those assets were being used to hire an attorney.[131] The majority sought to distinguish their holding in *Luis* from *Monsanto* based upon the nature of the funds being frozen; Luis's funds were not directly linked to her crime and Monsanto's funds were.[129][131] Kennedy dissented in *Luis* because he did not think criminal defendants should be treated differently based on how quickly they spent their illegal proceeds. Kagan agreed with Kennedy that the Court's decision created inequity and drew an arbitrary distinction, but further opined that *Monsanto* might have been wrongly decided.[131] She suggested she would be willing to overturn such precedent in the future, but declined to do so in the case at bar because Luis had not sought that relief.[129][131][130] Her vote thus rested on procedural grounds as she expressed skepticism that the government should be able to freeze the assets of a criminal defendant not yet convicted, and thus still benefiting from the presumption of innocence, by merely showing probable cause that the property will be subject to forfeiture.[131]\n\n\n\n##### Gerrymandering[edit]\n\n\nKagan wrote for the majority in *Cooper v. Harris*, 581 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017), striking down the configuration of two of North Carolina's congressional districts.[132] The Court held the districts' boundaries were unconstitutional because they relied excessively on race and did not pass the strict scrutiny standard of review.[133][134][135] In a footnote, Kagan set forth a new principle, that congressional districts drawn with race as the dominant factor may be found to be an unlawful racial gerrymander even if they have another goal, such as sorting voters by political affiliation.[134] Applying this principle to the facts of the case, the Court unanimously struck down North Carolina's District 1, where state lawmakers had increased the state's black voting-age population by 4.1% even though the black population had already been able to elect preferred candidates before the district lines were redrawn.[133] The increase of black voters in District 1 resulted in a decrease of black voters in other districts.[135] The Court also struck down District 12 by a vote of 5–3 for similar shifts in its racial composition. The dissent argued that those challenging the validity of the district had not proved that race caused the change in District 12.[133] Kagan quoted Court precedent that race must only be a predominant consideration, and that challengers did not need to prove politics was not a motivating factor.[133][134]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Kagan dissented in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, a 5-4 ruling that held that partisan gerrymandering is a non-justiciable claim. Kagan wrote, \"Of all times to abandon the Court’s duty to declare the law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court’s role in that system is to defend its foundations. None is more important than free and fair elections. With respect but deep sadness, I dissent.\"[136] Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor joined her dissent.\n\n\n\n##### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Brnovich v. DNC*, Kagan wrote the dissenting opinion and was joined by Breyer and Sotomayor. She would have struck down the Arizona voting laws that throw out votes that are cast out-of-precinct and ban ballot harvesting. Kagan wrote that African-American, Latino, and Native American voters are disproportionately likely to have their votes thrown out for being out-of-precinct (compared to White voters). She concluded, \"The law that confronted one of this country’s most enduring wrongs; pledged to give every American, of every race, an equal chance to participate in our democracy; and now stands as the crucial tool to achieve that goal. That law, of all laws, deserves the sweep and power Congress gave it. That law, of all laws, should not be diminished by this Court.\"[137]\n\n\n\n##### Environment[edit]\n\n\nJoined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, Kagan dissented in *West Virginia v. EPA*, which struck down the proposed Clean Power Plan. She wrote, \"It is EPA (that's the Environmental Protection Agency, in case the majority forgot) acting to address the greatest environmental challenge of our time. So too, there is nothing special about the Plan's 'who': fossil-fuel-fired power plants. In Utility Air, we thought EPA's regulation of churches and schools highly unusual. But fossil-fuel-fired plants? Those plants pollute—a lot—and so they have long lived under the watchful eye of EPA. That was true even before EPA began regulating carbon dioxide.\" Kagan concluded, \"The subject matter of the regulation here makes the Court's intervention all the more troubling. Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change. And let's say the obvious: The stakes here are high. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants' carbon dioxide emissions. The Court appoints itself—instead of Congress or the expert agency—the decision-maker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening. Respectfully, I dissent.\"[138][139]\n\n\n\n#### Writing style[edit]\n\n\nIn her first term on the Court, Kagan did not write any separate opinions, and wrote the fewest opinions of any justice. She wrote only majority opinions or dissents that more senior justices assigned to her, and in which she and a group of justices agreed upon a rationale for deciding the case. This tendency to write for a group rather than herself made it difficult to discern her own views or where she might lean in future cases.[140] She wrote the fewest opinions for the terms from 2011 through 2014, tying with Kennedy in 2011 and 2013.[141]\n\n\nKagan's writing has been characterized as conversational, employing a range of rhetorical styles.[142] She has said that she approaches writing on the Court like she used to approach the classroom, with numerous strategies to engage the reader.[143] Her opinions use examples and analogies to make them more accessible to a broad audience.[140][144]\n\n\n\n#### Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first four female U.S. Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Kagan, October 2010. (O'Connor is not wearing a robe because she had retired before the picture was taken).\nLike other justices, Kagan makes public appearances when she is not hearing cases.[145] In her first four years on the Court, she made at least 20 public appearances.[146] Kagan tends to choose speaking engagements that allow her to speak to students.[145]\n\n\n*Time* magazine named Kagan one of its Time 100 most influential people for 2013. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the article on Kagan, calling her \"an incisive legal thinker\" and \"excellent communicator\".[147] That same year, a painting of the four women to have served as Supreme Court justices, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and O'Connor, was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[148] In 2018, Kagan received the Marshall-Wythe Medallion from William & Mary Law School,[149] and an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Hunter College.[150]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKagan has never married. During her confirmation, a photo of her playing softball, which is sometimes characterized in popular culture as unfeminine, led to unsubstantiated claims that Kagan was a lesbian.[151] Her friends have criticized the rumors. Kagan's law school roommate Sarah Walzer said, \"I've known her for most of her adult life and I know she's straight.\"[152]\n\n\nKagan's Harvard colleagues and friends have characterized her as a good conversationalist, warm, with a good sense of humor.[153] Before joining the Supreme Court, she was known to play poker and smoke cigars.[153][154]\n\n\nEarly in her tenure as a justice, Kagan began socializing with several of her new colleagues.[155] She attended the opera with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, had dinner with Sonia Sotomayor, attended legal events with Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, and went hunting with Antonin Scalia.[155] The hunting trips stemmed from a promise Kagan made to U.S. Senator Jim Risch of Idaho during a meeting before her confirmation; Risch expressed concern that, as a New York City native, Kagan did not understand the importance of hunting to his constituents. Kagan initially offered to go hunting with Risch before promising instead to go hunting with Scalia if confirmed. According to Kagan, Scalia laughed when she told him of the promise and took her to his hunting club for the first of several hunting trips.[156] Kagan is known to spend time with longtime friends from law school and her stint in the Clinton administration rather than attending Washington, D.C., social events she is invited to as a justice.[155]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates\n* Bill Clinton judicial appointment controversies\n* Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of Jewish American jurists\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 4)\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 10)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Princeton student body president and future Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, was one of the other students.\n2. **^** Fellowship in memory of Rhodes Scholar from Princeton, Daniel M.

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on January 31, 2017, and has served since April 10, 2017.\n\n\nGorsuch spent his early life in Denver, Colorado, then lived in Bethesda, Maryland, while attending Georgetown Preparatory School. Upon graduating, he matriculated at Columbia University, where he became an established writer. Gorsuch received his legal education at Harvard Law School and in 1993, after 15 years as a practicing attorney, obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in jurisprudence from the University of Oxford on a Marshall Scholarship. His doctoral thesis concerned the morality of assisted suicide and was written under the supervision of legal philosopher John Finnis.\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Gorsuch was in private practice with the law firm of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick. He was the principal deputy associate attorney general at the United States Department of Justice from 2005 until his appointment to the Tenth Circuit. President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on May 10, 2006, to replace Judge David M. Ebel, who achieved senior status that same year.\n\n\nGorsuch is a proponent of textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in interpreting the United States Constitution.[2][3][4] Along with Justice Clarence Thomas, he is an advocate of natural law jurisprudence.[5] Gorsuch clerked for Judge David B. Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992 and U.S. Supreme Court justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994. He is the first Supreme Court justice to serve alongside a justice for whom he once clerked (Kennedy).[6] During his tenure on the Supreme Court he has written the majority opinion in landmark cases such as *Bostock v. Clayton County* on LGBT rights, *McGirt v. Oklahoma* on Native American law, *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* on personal religious observance, *303 Creative LLC v. Elenis* on free speech, and *Ramos v. Louisiana* on juries' guilty verdicts.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch was born on August 29, 1967, in Denver, Colorado, to Anne Gorsuch Burford (née McGill; 1942–2004) and David Ronald Gorsuch (1937–2001).[7][8] He was the eldest of three children,[9] and is a fourth-generation Coloradan.[10] Both of Gorsuch's parents were lawyers, and his mother served in the Colorado House of Representatives from 1976 to 1980. In 1981, she was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the first woman to serve as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.[11][12]\n\n\nAfter his mother's appointment, Gorsuch's family moved to Bethesda, Maryland. He enrolled in Georgetown Preparatory School,[13] a selective Jesuit college-preparatory school, arriving as a freshman in 1981.[14] He was two years junior to future justice Brett Kavanaugh, a classmate he later clerked with at the Supreme Court. Gorsuch was a member of Georgetown Prep's debate, forensics, and international relations clubs,[15] and served as a United States Senate page in the early 1980s.[16] He graduated in 1985 as student body president; in contrast to Kavanaugh, he was described as a fairly outgoing and extroverted student.[15][17]\n\n\nGorsuch attended Columbia University after high school, graduating in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*, in political science. He undertook a heavier courseload to graduate in three years.[18] As an undergraduate, he wrote for the *Columbia Daily Spectator*[19] and co-founded the satirical student publication *The Fed* in 1986.[20][21] Gorsuch distinguished himself as an active debater and an ardent conservative, publishing pieces that criticized left-wing politics. After a brief stint as a writer for a short-lived journal, he led efforts to establish *The Fed* as a conservative alternative to liberal campus newspapers.[18] He was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity[22] and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.[23][18][24]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Columbia, Gorsuch attended Harvard Law School on a Harry S. Truman Scholarship.[25][26] At Harvard, he had been an editor of the *Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy*[27][23] and was a member of the Lincoln's Inn Society, the Harvard Prison Legal Assistance Project, and the Harvard Defenders program.[28][29] Gorsuch was described as a committed conservative who supported the Gulf War and congressional term limits on \"a campus full of ardent liberals\".[30] Despite his contrasting political views, he was generally well-liked by students.[31] Philip C. Berg, a classmate and close friend, remembered him as \"very sensitive\" and non-confrontational, recalling when he received Gorsuch's support in coming out.[28] Gorsuch graduated in 1991 with a Juris Doctor, *cum laude*. Future President Barack Obama was among his classmates.[32]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch served as a law clerk for Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992. After spending a year at Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, Gorsuch clerked for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994.[23][26][33] His work with White occurred right after White retired from the Supreme Court; therefore, Gorsuch assisted White with his work on the Tenth Circuit, where White sat by designation.[23] Gorsuch was part of a group of five law clerks assigned that year that included Brett Kavanaugh, who described Gorsuch at the time, saying: \"He fit into the place very easily. He's just an easy guy to get along with. He doesn't have sharp elbows. We had a wide range of views, but we all really got along well.\"[34]\n\n\n\n### Private law practice[edit]\n\n\nInstead of joining an established law firm, Gorsuch decided to join the two-year-old boutique firm of Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel (now Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick), where he focused on trial work.[12] After winning his first trial as lead attorney, a jury member told Gorsuch he was like Perry Mason.[12] He was an associate in the Washington, D.C., law firm from 1995 to 1997 and a partner from 1998 to 2005.[23][35] Gorsuch's clients included Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz.[36] At Kellogg Huber, Gorsuch focused on commercial matters, including contracts, antitrust, RICO, and securities fraud.[23]\n\n\nIn 2002, Gorsuch wrote an op-ed criticizing the Senate for delaying the nominations of Merrick Garland and John Roberts to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, writing, \"the most impressive judicial nominees are grossly mistreated\" by the Senate.[37]\n\n\nIn 2004, Gorsuch received a Doctor of Philosophy in legal philosophy from the University of Oxford, where he completed research on assisted suicide and euthanasia as a postgraduate student at University College.[38][27][23] A Marshall Scholarship enabled him to study at Oxford in 1992–93, where he was supervised by the natural law philosopher John Finnis.[39] His thesis was also supervised by Canadian legal scholar Timothy Endicott of Balliol College, Oxford.[38][40] In 1996, Gorsuch married Louise, an Englishwoman and champion equestrienne on Oxford's riding team whom he met during his stay there.[12][41]\n\n\nIn 2005, at Kellogg Huber, Gorsuch wrote a brief denouncing class action lawsuits by attorneys on behalf of shareholders. In the case of *Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo*, Gorsuch opined, \"The free ride to fast riches enjoyed by securities class action attorneys in recent years appeared to hit a speed bump\" and \"the problem is that securities fraud litigation imposes an enormous toll on the economy, affecting virtually every public corporation in America at one time or another and costing businesses billions of dollars in settlements every year\".[35]\n\n\n\n### U.S. Department of Justice[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch served as Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General, Robert McCallum, at the United States Department of Justice from June 2005 until July 2006.[23][42] As McCallum's principal deputy, he assisted in managing the Department of Justice's civil litigation components, which included the antitrust, civil, civil rights, environment, and tax divisions.[23]\n\n\nWhile managing the United States Department of Justice Civil Division, Gorsuch was tasked with all the \"terror litigation\" arising from the president's War on Terror, successfully defending the extraordinary rendition of Khalid El-Masri, fighting the disclosure of Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse photographs, and, in November 2005, traveling to inspect the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.[43]\n\n\nGorsuch helped Attorney General Alberto Gonzales prepare for hearings after the public revelation of NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07), and worked with Senator Lindsey Graham in drafting the provisions in the Detainee Treatment Act that attempted to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over the detainees.[44]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (2006–2017)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\nIn January 2006, Philip Anschutz recommended Gorsuch's nomination to Colorado's U.S. senator Wayne Allard and White House Counsel Harriet Miers.[36] On May 10, 2006, President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to the seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated by Judge David M. Ebel, who was taking senior status.[27] Like Ebel, Gorsuch was a former clerk of Justice White. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him \"well qualified\" in 2006.[23][45][46]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2006, Gorsuch was confirmed by unanimous voice vote in the U.S. Senate.[47][48] He was Bush's fifth appointment to the Tenth Circuit.[49] When Gorsuch began his tenure at Denver's Byron White United States Courthouse, Justice Kennedy administered the oath of office.[37]\n\n\nDuring his time on the Tenth Circuit, ten of Gorsuch's law clerks went on to become Supreme Court clerks, and he was sometimes regarded as a \"feeder judge\".[50] One of his former clerks, Jonathan Papik, became an associate justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court in 2018.[51]\n\n\n\n### Freedom of religion[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch advocates a broad definition of religious freedom that is inimical to church–state separation advocates.[52][53][54]\n\n\nIn *Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius* (2013), Gorsuch wrote a concurrence when the *en banc* circuit found the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate on a private business violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.[55] That ruling was upheld 5–4 by the Supreme Court in *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.* (2014).[56] When a panel of the court denied similar claims under the same act in *Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell* (2015), Gorsuch joined Judges Harris Hartz, Paul Joseph Kelly Jr., Timothy Tymkovich, and Jerome Holmes in their dissent to the denial of rehearing *en banc*.[57] That ruling was vacated and remanded to the Tenth Circuit by the *per curiam* Supreme Court in *Zubik v. Burwell* (2016).[56]\n\n\nIn *Pleasant Grove City v. Summum* (2007), he joined Judge Michael W. McConnell's dissent from the denial of rehearing *en banc*, taking the view that the government's display of a donated Ten Commandments monument in a public park did not obligate the government to display other offered monuments.[58] The Supreme Court subsequently adopted most of the dissent's view, reversing the Tenth Circuit's judgment.[56] Gorsuch has written, \"the law [...] doesn't just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation's long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance\".[59]\n\n\n\n### Administrative law[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has called for reconsideration of *Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.* (1984), in which the Supreme Court instructed courts to grant deference to federal agencies' interpretation of ambiguous laws and regulations. In *Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch* (2016), Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that court review was required before an executive agency could reject the circuit court's interpretation of an immigration law.[60][61]\n\n\nAlone, Gorsuch added a concurring opinion, criticizing *Chevron* deference and *National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services* (2005) as an \"abdication of judicial duty\" and writing that deference is \"more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design\".[62][63]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Hinckley* (2008), Gorsuch argued that one possible reading of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act likely violates the nondelegation doctrine.[64] Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg had held the same view in their 2012 dissent in *Reynolds v. United States*.[65]\n\n\n\n### Interstate commerce[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has been an opponent of the dormant Commerce Clause, which allows state laws to be declared unconstitutional if they too greatly burden interstate commerce. In 2011, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that the dormant Commerce Clause did not prevent the Oklahoma Water Resources Board from blocking water exports to Texas.[66] A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed that ruling in *Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann* (2013).[67]\n\n\nIn 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that federal courts could not hear a challenge to Colorado's internet sales tax.[68] A unanimous Supreme Court reversed that ruling in *Direct Marketing Ass'n v. Brohl* (2015).[67] In 2016, the Tenth Circuit panel rejected the challenger's dormant commerce clause claim, with Gorsuch writing a concurrence.[69]\n\n\nIn *Energy and Environmental Legal Institute v. Joshua Epel* (2015), Gorsuch held that Colorado's mandates for renewable energy did not violate the commerce clause by putting out-of-state coal companies at a disadvantage.[70] He wrote that the Colorado renewable energy law \"isn't a price-control statute, it doesn't link prices paid in Colorado with those paid out of state, and it does not discriminate against out-of-staters\".[71][72]\n\n\n\n### Campaign finance[edit]\n\n\nIn *Riddle v. Hickenlooper* (2014), Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel of the Tenth Circuit in finding that it was unconstitutional for a Colorado law to set the limit on donations for write-in candidates at half the amount for major party candidates.[73] He added a concurrence noting that although the standard of review of campaign finance in the United States is unclear, the Colorado law would fail even under intermediate scrutiny.[74]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Planned Parenthood v. Herbert* (2016), Gorsuch wrote for the four dissenting judges when the Tenth Circuit denied a full rehearing of a divided panel opinion that had ordered the Utah governor to resume the organization's funding, which Herbert had blocked in response to a video controversy.[75][76]\n\n\nIn *A.M. v. Holmes* (2016), the Tenth Circuit considered a case in which a 13-year-old child was arrested for burping and laughing in gym class. The child was handcuffed and arrested based on a New Mexico statute that makes it a misdemeanor to disrupt school activities. The child's family brought a federal § 1983 civil rights action against school officials and the school resource officer who made the arrest, arguing that it was a false arrest that violated the child's constitutional rights. In a 94-page majority opinion, the Tenth Circuit held that the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity from suit.[77] Gorsuch wrote a four-page dissent, arguing that the New Mexico Court of Appeals had \"long ago alerted law enforcement\" that the statute that the officer relied upon for the child's arrest does not criminalize noises or diversions that merely disturb order in a classroom.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n### Criminal law[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that a court may still order criminals to pay restitution even after it missed a statutory deadline.[80] The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling 5–4 in *Dolan v. United States* (2010).[67]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Games-Perez* (2012), Gorsuch ruled on a case where a felon owned a gun in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), but alleged that he did not know that he was a felon at the time. Gorsuch joined the majority in upholding the conviction based on Tenth Circuit precedent, but filed a concurring opinion arguing that said precedent was wrongly decided: \"The only statutory element separating innocent (even constitutionally protected) gun possession from criminal conduct in §§ 922(g) and 924(a) is a prior felony conviction. So the presumption that the government must prove mens rea here applies with full force.\"[81] In the 2019 case *Rehaif v. United States*, the Supreme Court overruled this decision, with Gorsuch joining.\n\n\nIn 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that intent does not need to be proven under a bank fraud statute.[82] A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed that ruling in *Loughrin v. United States* (2014).[67] In 2015, Gorsuch wrote a dissent to the denial of rehearing *en banc* when the Tenth Circuit found that a convicted sex offender had to register with Kansas after he moved to the Philippines.[83] A unanimous Supreme Court reversed the Tenth Circuit in *Nichols v. United States* (2016).[67]\n\n\n\n### Death penalty[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch favors a strict reading of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).[56] In 2015, he wrote for the court when it permitted Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to order the execution of Scott Eizember, prompting a 30-page dissent by Judge Mary Beck Briscoe.[84][85] After the state's unsuccessful execution of Clayton Lockett, Gorsuch joined Briscoe when the court unanimously allowed Pruitt to continue using the same lethal injection protocol. The Supreme Court upheld that ruling 5–4 in *Glossip v. Gross* (2015).[86]\n\n\n\n### List of judicial opinions[edit]\n\n\nDuring his tenure on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, Gorsuch authored 212 published opinions.[87] Some of those are:\n\n\n\n* *United States v. Hinckley*, 550 F. 3d 926 (2008), on principles of interpretation and construction of a statute, according to plain meaning and context\n* *United States v.

Obama had nominated Garland on March 16, 2016, but Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley did not schedule a hearing for him, leaving Garland's nomination to expire on January 3, 2017.[93] Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell invoked the so-called \"Biden Rule\" (of 1992) to justify the Senate's refusal to consider Garland's nomination in a general election year.[94][95][96]\n\n\nTrump formally transmitted his nomination to the Senate on February 1, 2017.[97] The American Bar Association unanimously gave Gorsuch its top rating—\"Well Qualified\"—to serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.[98] His confirmation hearing before the Senate started on March 20, 2017.[99]\n\n\nOn April 3, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved his nomination with a party-line 11–9 vote.[100] On April 6, 2017, Democrats filibustered (prevented cloture) the confirmation vote, after which Republicans invoked the \"nuclear option\", allowing a filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee to be broken by a simple majority vote.[101]\n\n\nOn April 4, BuzzFeed and *Politico* ran articles highlighting similar language occurring in Gorsuch's book *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia* and an earlier law review article by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma, Indiana's deputy attorney general. Academic experts contacted by *Politico* \"differed in their assessment of what Gorsuch did, ranging from calling it a clear impropriety to mere sloppiness.\"[102][103][104][105]\n\n\nJohn Finnis, who supervised Gorsuch's dissertation at Oxford, said, \"The allegation is entirely without foundation. The book is meticulous in its citation of primary sources. The allegation that the book is guilty of plagiarism because it does not cite secondary sources which draw on those same primary sources is, frankly, absurd.\" Kuzma said, \"I have reviewed both passages and do not see an issue here, even though the language is similar. These passages are factual, not analytical in nature, framing both the technical legal and medical circumstances of the 'Baby/Infant Doe' case that occurred in 1982.\"[103] In his book on Gorsuch, John Greenya described how Gorsuch was challenged during his confirmation hearings concerning some of his dissertation advisor's more strident views, which Gorsuch generally disagreed with.[106]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2017, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court by a 54–45 vote, with three Democrats (Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Manchin, and Joe Donnelly) joining all Republicans in attendance.[107]\n\n\nGorsuch received his commission on April 8, 2017.[108] He was sworn into office on Monday, April 10, 2017, in two ceremonies. The chief justice of the United States administered the constitutional oath of office in a private ceremony at 9 a.m. at the Supreme Court, making Gorsuch the 101st associate justice of the Court. At 11 a.m., Justice Kennedy administered the judicial oath of office in a public ceremony at the White House Rose Garden.[109][110][111]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2017–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Banking regulation[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch wrote his first U.S. Supreme Court decision for a unanimous court in *Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.*, 582 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017). The Court ruled against the borrowers, holding that Santander in this case was not a debt collector under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act since it purchased the original defaulted car loans from CitiFinancial for pennies on the dollar, making Santander the owner of the debts and not merely an agent.[112] When the act was enacted, regulations were put on institutions that collected other companies' debts, but the act left unaddressed businesses collecting their own debts.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch joined the majority in *National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra* and *Janus v. AFSCME*, which both held unconstitutional certain forms of compelled speech.[115][116]\n\n\nGorsuch authored the majority opinion in *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* (2022), which concerned a public high school football coach who was fired for praying on the field after games. The opinion held that the coach's conduct was protected by both the Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment, and that the school's attempt to stop him was not mandated by the amendment's Establishment Clause.[117]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, in *Pavan v. Smith*, the Supreme Court \"summarily overruled\" the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to deny same-sex married parents the same right to appear on the birth certificate.[118] Gorsuch wrote a dissent, joined by Thomas and Alito, arguing that the Court should have fully heard the arguments of the case.[119]\n\n\nIn 2020, Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion in the combined cases of *Bostock v. Clayton County*, *Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda*, and *R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission*, ruling that businesses cannot discriminate in employment against LGBTQ people. He argued that discrimination based on sexual orientation was illegal discrimination on the basis of sex, because the employer would be discriminating \"for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex\".[120] The ruling was 6–3, with Gorsuch joined by Chief Justice Roberts and the Court's four Democratic appointees.[121][122] Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh dissented from the decision, arguing that it improperly extended the Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity.[123]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Gorsuch agreed with the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to deny an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[124] In June 2021, he joined the justices in the unanimous Fulton v. City of Philadelphia decision, ruling in favor of a Catholic adoption agency that had been denied a contract by the City of Philadelphia due to the agency's refusal to adopt to same-sex couples.[125] Gorsuch and Thomas joined Alito's concurrence, which argued for reconsidering, possibly overturning, *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[126] Also in 2021, Gorsuch was one of three justices, with Thomas and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington State florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[127][128][129] In November 2021, Gorsuch dissented from the Court's 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[130] The decision to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor; Thomas and Alito also dissented.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2019\nGorsuch joined Thomas's dissent from denial of certiorari in *Peruta v. San Diego County*, in which the Ninth Circuit had upheld California's restrictive concealed carry laws.[133]\n\n\nGorsuch wrote a statement regarding the denial of an application for a stay presented to Roberts in *Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives*, a 2019 D.C. Circuit case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. In his statement Gorsuch criticized the Trump Administration's action as well as the justification the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit used for upholding the ban.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### Vagueness doctrine[edit]\n\n\nIn *Sessions v. Dimaya* (2018), the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 to uphold the Ninth Circuit's decision that the residual clause in the Immigration and Nationality Act was unconstitutionally vague. Gorsuch joined Justices Kagan, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor in the opinion, and wrote a separate concurrence reiterating the importance of the vagueness doctrine within Scalia's 2015 opinion in *Johnson*.[136] In *United States v. Davis* (2019), Gorsuch wrote the Opinion of the Court striking down the residual clause of the Hobbs Act based on the rationale used in *Dimaya*.[137][138]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Gorsuch dissented when the Court voted against hearing cases brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[139] He and Alito joined Thomas's dissent arguing that it was the Court's job to hear the case.[140]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Gorsuch sided with three of the Court's other conservative justices, rejecting a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[141] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would require that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[142] In June 2020, the Supreme Court struck down Louisiana's abortion restriction in *June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo*, a 5–4 decision; Gorsuch was among the four dissenters.[143][144] In September 2021, the Supreme Court declined a petition to block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks; the vote was 5–4 with Gorsuch in the majority, joined by Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett.[145]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Gorsuch was among the five justices who formed the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which ruled there is no constitutional right to abortion, overruling *Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[146]\n\n\n\n### Native American law[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch is regarded as an authority on American Indian law.[147] During his time on the Supreme Court, he has frequently affirmed tribal rights; his appointment to the Court was supported by multiple tribes and Native American organizations due to his favorable rulings as a Tenth Circuit judge.[148][149]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Gorsuch joined the four liberal justices (in two plurality opinions) in a 5–4 majority in *Washington State Dept. of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc.*[150] The Court's decision sided with the Yakama Nation, striking down a Washington state tax on transporting gasoline, on the basis of an 1855 treaty in which the Yakama ceded a large portion of Washington in exchange for certain rights.[151] In his concurrence, which was joined by Ginsburg, Gorsuch ended his opinion by writing: \"Really, this case just tells an old and familiar story. The State of Washington includes millions of acres that the Yakamas ceded to the United States under significant pressure. In return, the government supplied a handful of modest promises. The state is now dissatisfied with the consequences of one of those promises. It is a new day, and now it wants more. But today and to its credit, the Court holds the parties to the terms of their deal. It is the least we can do.\"[152]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Gorsuch again joined the four more liberal justices in a decision favorable to Native Americans' treaty rights, signing on to Justice Sotomayor's opinion to reach a 5–4 decision in *Herrera v. Wyoming*. The case held that hunting rights in Montana and Wyoming, granted by the U.S. government to the Native American Crow people by an 1868 treaty, were not extinguished by the 1890 grant of statehood to Wyoming.[153]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Gorsuch again joined the liberal justices to make a 5–4 majority in *McGirt v. Oklahoma*. The case considered whether much of eastern Oklahoma still remained under the jurisdiction of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\", given that the Native American Treaties that had designated the region as under their reservation status had never been dissolved by Congress, and, if so, whether crimes committed by Native Americans against other Native Americans on tribal land were under the jurisdiction of Native Courts.[154] The landmark decision in the affirmative, written by Gorsuch, found that \"For Major Crimes Act purposes, land reserved for the Creek Nation since the 19th century remains 'Indian country.'\"[155][156] In the opinion, he wrote: \"Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law. Because Congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word.\"[156] The case was later reviewed in the June 2022 case Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, which considered whether non-Natives who committed crimes against Natives on Native American territory can be charged under the sole jurisdiction of Native American tribal courts.[157][158] While the state of Oklahoma had initially argued for the overturning of *McGirt*, the Court agreed to hear only issues relating to the impacts of *McGirt*.[159] The 5-4 decision by Justice Brett Kavanaugh opposed the more expanded viewpoint of non-Native criminal jurisdiction, with the opinion giving jurisdiction over such crimes to both tribal and federal/state governments. Gorsuch derided the opinion in his dissent, writing, \"Where this Court once stood firm, today it wilts.\"[160][161]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2022, Gorsuch, Barrett, and the three liberal justices ruled in favor of the Native American Tribes of Texas in the case *Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas*. The case concerned a dispute over whether Texas could control and regulate gambling on Texan Native American reservations. The initial conflict had developed from the tribes' having been in a trust with Texas from 1968 to 1987 before being granted a federal trust, resulting in a statute governing the tribes' subjugation to Texas's gambling restrictions.[162] The ruling emphasized that the tribes have the power to regulate electronic bingo games on their land regardless of the state's prohibition of non-prohibited gambling. Thus, as long as a game is not outright prohibited by the state of Texas, the state government cannot impose regulations upon tribal games. Gorsuch emphasized in his opinion that \"None of this is to say that the Tribe may offer gaming on whatever terms it wishes [...] Other gaming activities are subject to tribal regulation and must conform to the terms and conditions set forth in federal law.\"[163]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 restrictions[edit]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Gorsuch joined the majority opinion in *Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*, which struck down COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the state of New York on houses of worship.[164]\n\n\nOn May 18, 2023, Gorsuch issued a statement about the Court's decision to dismiss a lawsuit by several states aimed at continuing Title 42 expulsions of immigrants, a policy instituted to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 cases to the United States. His statement criticized many of the restrictions the government had imposed since the pandemic started and said, \"Since March 2020, we may have experienced the greatest intrusions on civil liberties in the peacetime history of this country.\"[165]\n\n\n\n## Legal philosophy[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch is a proponent of originalism, the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment, and of textualism, the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering the legislative history and underlying purpose of the law.[2][3][4] An editorial in the *National Catholic Register* opined that Gorsuch's judicial decisions lean more toward natural law philosophy.[166]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of *The Week* wrote that an \"unexpected civil libertarian alliance\" was developing between Gorsuch and Sotomayor \"in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach.\"[167]\n\n\n\n### Voting alignment[edit]\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight used Lee Epstein et al.'s Judicial Common Space scores[168] (which are not based on a judge's behavior, but rather the ideology scores of either home state senators or the appointing president) to find a close alignment between the conservatism of other appellate and Supreme Court judges such as Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito.[169] *The Washington Post*'s statistical analysis estimated that the ideologies of most of Trump's announced candidates were \"statistically indistinguishable\" and also associated Gorsuch with Kavanaugh and Alito.[170]\n\n\n\n### Judicial activism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch in 2019\nIn a 2016 speech at Case Western Reserve University, Gorsuch said that judges should strive to apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be—not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best.[171]\n\n\nIn a 2005 *National Review* article, Gorsuch argued that \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda\" and that they are \"failing to reach out and persuade the public\". He wrote that, in doing so, American liberals are circumventing the democratic process on issues like gay marriage, school vouchers, and assisted suicide, and this has led to a compromised judiciary, which is no longer independent. Gorsuch wrote that American liberals' \"overweening addiction\" to using the courts for social debate is \"bad for the nation and bad for the judiciary\".[47][172]\n\n\n\n### Federalism and state power[edit]\n\n\nJustin Marceau, a professor at the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law, called Gorsuch \"a predictably socially conservative judge who tends to favor state power over federal power\". Marceau added that this is important because federal laws have been used to try to reel in \"rogue\" state laws in civil rights cases.[173]\n\n\n\n### Assisted suicide[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2006, Gorsuch's book *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia*, developed from his doctoral thesis, was published by Princeton University Press.[38][174][175][176] In the book, Gorsuch makes clear his personal opposition to euthanasia and assisted suicide, arguing that the U.S. should \"retain existing law [banning assisted suicide and euthanasia] on the basis that human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable, and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.\"[59][175][177]\n\n\n\n### Statutory interpretation[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has been considered to follow in Scalia's footsteps as a textualist in statutory interpretation of the plain meaning of the law.[178][179] This was exemplified in his majority opinion in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, 590 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2020), which ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 grants protection from employment discrimination due to sexual orientation and gender identity. Gorsuch wrote in the decision, \"An employer who fired an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\"[180][181][182]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch and family with Donald Trump, Anthony Kennedy, and Mike Pence prior to his swearing-in\nGorsuch and his wife, Marie Louise Gorsuch,[183] a British citizen, met at Oxford. The two married at St. Nicholas' Anglican Church in Henley-on-Thames in 1996.[184][185] They live in Boulder, Colorado, and have two daughters.[186][187][188]\n\n\nGorsuch enjoys the outdoors and fly fishing; he went fly fishing on at least one occasion with Justice Scalia.[10][189] He raises horses, chickens, and goats, and often arranges ski trips with colleagues and friends.[56]\n\n\nHe has authored two nonfiction books. The first, *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia*, was published by Princeton University Press in July 2006.[190] He is a co-author of *The Law of Judicial Precedent*, published by Thomson West in 2016.[35]\n\n\nIn 2017, after his announcement as a Supreme Court nominee, *the New York Times* reported that Gorsuch owned a timeshare outside Granby, Colorado, with associates of Philip Anschutz, that was later sold the same year.[36] Reporting from *Politico* in April 2023 revealed that Gorsuch had sold the cabin to Brian Duffy, the CEO of the law firm Greenberg Traurig, which litigates cases before the Supreme Court, but failed to disclose the purchaser's identity on his federal disclosure forms.[191] The property was listed for sale for a few years but did not go under contract until the week after Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court.[191][192] Since 2017, Greenberg Traurig has been involved in at least 22 cases before or presented to the Supreme Court.[191][193]\n\n\nGorsuch has been active in several professional associations throughout his legal career,[23] including the American Bar Association, the American Trial Lawyers Association, Phi Beta Kappa, the Republican National Lawyers Association, and the New York, Colorado, and District of Columbia Bar Associations.[23] In May 2019, it was announced that Gorsuch would become the new chairman of the board of the National Constitution Center, succeeding former vice president Joe Biden.[194]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch was the first member of a mainline Protestant denomination to sit on the Supreme Court since the retirement of John Paul Stevens in 2010.[195][196][197] He and his two siblings were raised Catholic and attended weekly Mass.[198][186] His wife, Louise, is British-born; the two met while Neil was studying at Oxford. Louise was raised in the Church of England.[199]\n\n\nWhen the couple returned to the United States they joined Holy Comforter, an Episcopal parish in Vienna, Virginia, attending weekly services. Gorsuch volunteered there as an usher.[197] The Gorsuch family later attended St. John's Episcopal Church in Boulder, Colorado, a liberal church with a longstanding open-door policy for the LGBT community.[91][200][201] During his 2017 confirmation hearing, responding to a senator's question about his faith, Gorsuch replied, \"I attend an Episcopal church in Boulder with my family, senator.\"[202][203][204] After marrying in a non-Catholic ceremony and joining an Episcopal church, Gorsuch has not publicly clarified his religious affiliation.[199]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch received the Edward J. Randolph Award for outstanding service to the Department of Justice and the Harry S. Truman Foundation's Stevens Award for outstanding public service in the field of law.[188]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* Gorsuch, Neil (2004). *The right to receive assistance in suicide and euthanasia, with particular reference to the law of the United States* (DPhil thesis).

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on January 31, 2017, and has served since April 10, 2017.\n\n\nGorsuch spent his early life in Denver, Colorado, then lived in Bethesda, Maryland, while attending Georgetown Preparatory School. Upon graduating, he matriculated at Columbia University, where he became an established writer. Gorsuch received his legal education at Harvard Law School and in 1993, after 15 years as a practicing attorney, obtained a Doctor of Philosophy in jurisprudence from the University of Oxford on a Marshall Scholarship. His doctoral thesis concerned the morality of assisted suicide and was written under the supervision of legal philosopher John Finnis.\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 2005, Gorsuch was in private practice with the law firm of Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick. He was the principal deputy associate attorney general at the United States Department of Justice from 2005 until his appointment to the Tenth Circuit. President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on May 10, 2006, to replace Judge David M. Ebel, who achieved senior status that same year.\n\n\nGorsuch is a proponent of textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in interpreting the United States Constitution.[2][3][4] Along with Justice Clarence Thomas, he is an advocate of natural law jurisprudence.[5] Gorsuch clerked for Judge David B. Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992 and U.S. Supreme Court justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994. He is the first Supreme Court justice to serve alongside a justice for whom he once clerked (Kennedy).[6] During his tenure on the Supreme Court he has written the majority opinion in landmark cases such as *Bostock v. Clayton County* on LGBT rights, *McGirt v. Oklahoma* on Native American law, *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* on personal religious observance, *303 Creative LLC v. Elenis* on free speech, and *Ramos v. Louisiana* on juries' guilty verdicts.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch was born on August 29, 1967, in Denver, Colorado, to Anne Gorsuch Burford (née McGill; 1942–2004) and David Ronald Gorsuch (1937–2001).[7][8] He was the eldest of three children,[9] and is a fourth-generation Coloradan.[10] Both of Gorsuch's parents were lawyers, and his mother served in the Colorado House of Representatives from 1976 to 1980. In 1981, she was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the first woman to serve as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.[11][12]\n\n\nAfter his mother's appointment, Gorsuch's family moved to Bethesda, Maryland. He enrolled in Georgetown Preparatory School,[13] a selective Jesuit college-preparatory school, arriving as a freshman in 1981.[14] He was two years junior to future justice Brett Kavanaugh, a classmate he later clerked with at the Supreme Court. Gorsuch was a member of Georgetown Prep's debate, forensics, and international relations clubs,[15] and served as a United States Senate page in the early 1980s.[16] He graduated in 1985 as student body president; in contrast to Kavanaugh, he was described as a fairly outgoing and extroverted student.[15][17]\n\n\nGorsuch attended Columbia University after high school, graduating in 1988 with a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*, in political science. He undertook a heavier courseload to graduate in three years.[18] As an undergraduate, he wrote for the *Columbia Daily Spectator*[19] and co-founded the satirical student publication *The Fed* in 1986.[20][21] Gorsuch distinguished himself as an active debater and an ardent conservative, publishing pieces that criticized left-wing politics. After a brief stint as a writer for a short-lived journal, he led efforts to establish *The Fed* as a conservative alternative to liberal campus newspapers.[18] He was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity[22] and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society.[23][18][24]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Columbia, Gorsuch attended Harvard Law School on a Harry S. Truman Scholarship.[25][26] At Harvard, he had been an editor of the *Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy*[27][23] and was a member of the Lincoln's Inn Society, the Harvard Prison Legal Assistance Project, and the Harvard Defenders program.[28][29] Gorsuch was described as a committed conservative who supported the Gulf War and congressional term limits on \"a campus full of ardent liberals\".[30] Despite his contrasting political views, he was generally well-liked by students.[31] Philip C. Berg, a classmate and close friend, remembered him as \"very sensitive\" and non-confrontational, recalling when he received Gorsuch's support in coming out.[28] Gorsuch graduated in 1991 with a Juris Doctor, *cum laude*. Future President Barack Obama was among his classmates.[32]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch served as a law clerk for Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from 1991 to 1992. After spending a year at Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, Gorsuch clerked for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994.[23][26][33] His work with White occurred right after White retired from the Supreme Court; therefore, Gorsuch assisted White with his work on the Tenth Circuit, where White sat by designation.[23] Gorsuch was part of a group of five law clerks assigned that year that included Brett Kavanaugh, who described Gorsuch at the time, saying: \"He fit into the place very easily. He's just an easy guy to get along with. He doesn't have sharp elbows. We had a wide range of views, but we all really got along well.\"[34]\n\n\n\n### Private law practice[edit]\n\n\nInstead of joining an established law firm, Gorsuch decided to join the two-year-old boutique firm of Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel (now Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick), where he focused on trial work.[12] After winning his first trial as lead attorney, a jury member told Gorsuch he was like Perry Mason.[12] He was an associate in the Washington, D.C., law firm from 1995 to 1997 and a partner from 1998 to 2005.[23][35] Gorsuch's clients included Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz.[36] At Kellogg Huber, Gorsuch focused on commercial matters, including contracts, antitrust, RICO, and securities fraud.[23]\n\n\nIn 2002, Gorsuch wrote an op-ed criticizing the Senate for delaying the nominations of Merrick Garland and John Roberts to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, writing, \"the most impressive judicial nominees are grossly mistreated\" by the Senate.[37]\n\n\nIn 2004, Gorsuch received a Doctor of Philosophy in legal philosophy from the University of Oxford, where he completed research on assisted suicide and euthanasia as a postgraduate student at University College.[38][27][23] A Marshall Scholarship enabled him to study at Oxford in 1992–93, where he was supervised by the natural law philosopher John Finnis.[39] His thesis was also supervised by Canadian legal scholar Timothy Endicott of Balliol College, Oxford.[38][40] In 1996, Gorsuch married Louise, an Englishwoman and champion equestrienne on Oxford's riding team whom he met during his stay there.[12][41]\n\n\nIn 2005, at Kellogg Huber, Gorsuch wrote a brief denouncing class action lawsuits by attorneys on behalf of shareholders. In the case of *Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo*, Gorsuch opined, \"The free ride to fast riches enjoyed by securities class action attorneys in recent years appeared to hit a speed bump\" and \"the problem is that securities fraud litigation imposes an enormous toll on the economy, affecting virtually every public corporation in America at one time or another and costing businesses billions of dollars in settlements every year\".[35]\n\n\n\n### U.S. Department of Justice[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch served as Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General, Robert McCallum, at the United States Department of Justice from June 2005 until July 2006.[23][42] As McCallum's principal deputy, he assisted in managing the Department of Justice's civil litigation components, which included the antitrust, civil, civil rights, environment, and tax divisions.[23]\n\n\nWhile managing the United States Department of Justice Civil Division, Gorsuch was tasked with all the \"terror litigation\" arising from the president's War on Terror, successfully defending the extraordinary rendition of Khalid El-Masri, fighting the disclosure of Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse photographs, and, in November 2005, traveling to inspect the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.[43]\n\n\nGorsuch helped Attorney General Alberto Gonzales prepare for hearings after the public revelation of NSA warrantless surveillance (2001–07), and worked with Senator Lindsey Graham in drafting the provisions in the Detainee Treatment Act that attempted to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over the detainees.[44]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (2006–2017)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit\nIn January 2006, Philip Anschutz recommended Gorsuch's nomination to Colorado's U.S. senator Wayne Allard and White House Counsel Harriet Miers.[36] On May 10, 2006, President George W. Bush nominated Gorsuch to the seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated by Judge David M. Ebel, who was taking senior status.[27] Like Ebel, Gorsuch was a former clerk of Justice White. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him \"well qualified\" in 2006.[23][45][46]\n\n\nOn July 20, 2006, Gorsuch was confirmed by unanimous voice vote in the U.S. Senate.[47][48] He was Bush's fifth appointment to the Tenth Circuit.[49] When Gorsuch began his tenure at Denver's Byron White United States Courthouse, Justice Kennedy administered the oath of office.[37]\n\n\nDuring his time on the Tenth Circuit, ten of Gorsuch's law clerks went on to become Supreme Court clerks, and he was sometimes regarded as a \"feeder judge\".[50] One of his former clerks, Jonathan Papik, became an associate justice of the Nebraska Supreme Court in 2018.[51]\n\n\n\n### Freedom of religion[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch advocates a broad definition of religious freedom that is inimical to church–state separation advocates.[52][53][54]\n\n\nIn *Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius* (2013), Gorsuch wrote a concurrence when the *en banc* circuit found the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate on a private business violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.[55] That ruling was upheld 5–4 by the Supreme Court in *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.* (2014).[56] When a panel of the court denied similar claims under the same act in *Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell* (2015), Gorsuch joined Judges Harris Hartz, Paul Joseph Kelly Jr., Timothy Tymkovich, and Jerome Holmes in their dissent to the denial of rehearing *en banc*.[57] That ruling was vacated and remanded to the Tenth Circuit by the *per curiam* Supreme Court in *Zubik v. Burwell* (2016).[56]\n\n\nIn *Pleasant Grove City v. Summum* (2007), he joined Judge Michael W. McConnell's dissent from the denial of rehearing *en banc*, taking the view that the government's display of a donated Ten Commandments monument in a public park did not obligate the government to display other offered monuments.[58] The Supreme Court subsequently adopted most of the dissent's view, reversing the Tenth Circuit's judgment.[56] Gorsuch has written, \"the law [...] doesn't just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation's long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance\".[59]\n\n\n\n### Administrative law[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has called for reconsideration of *Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.* (1984), in which the Supreme Court instructed courts to grant deference to federal agencies' interpretation of ambiguous laws and regulations. In *Gutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch* (2016), Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that court review was required before an executive agency could reject the circuit court's interpretation of an immigration law.[60][61]\n\n\nAlone, Gorsuch added a concurring opinion, criticizing *Chevron* deference and *National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services* (2005) as an \"abdication of judicial duty\" and writing that deference is \"more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design\".[62][63]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Hinckley* (2008), Gorsuch argued that one possible reading of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act likely violates the nondelegation doctrine.[64] Justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg had held the same view in their 2012 dissent in *Reynolds v. United States*.[65]\n\n\n\n### Interstate commerce[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has been an opponent of the dormant Commerce Clause, which allows state laws to be declared unconstitutional if they too greatly burden interstate commerce. In 2011, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that the dormant Commerce Clause did not prevent the Oklahoma Water Resources Board from blocking water exports to Texas.[66] A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed that ruling in *Tarrant Regional Water District v. Herrmann* (2013).[67]\n\n\nIn 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that federal courts could not hear a challenge to Colorado's internet sales tax.[68] A unanimous Supreme Court reversed that ruling in *Direct Marketing Ass'n v. Brohl* (2015).[67] In 2016, the Tenth Circuit panel rejected the challenger's dormant commerce clause claim, with Gorsuch writing a concurrence.[69]\n\n\nIn *Energy and Environmental Legal Institute v. Joshua Epel* (2015), Gorsuch held that Colorado's mandates for renewable energy did not violate the commerce clause by putting out-of-state coal companies at a disadvantage.[70] He wrote that the Colorado renewable energy law \"isn't a price-control statute, it doesn't link prices paid in Colorado with those paid out of state, and it does not discriminate against out-of-staters\".[71][72]\n\n\n\n### Campaign finance[edit]\n\n\nIn *Riddle v. Hickenlooper* (2014), Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel of the Tenth Circuit in finding that it was unconstitutional for a Colorado law to set the limit on donations for write-in candidates at half the amount for major party candidates.[73] He added a concurrence noting that although the standard of review of campaign finance in the United States is unclear, the Colorado law would fail even under intermediate scrutiny.[74]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Planned Parenthood v. Herbert* (2016), Gorsuch wrote for the four dissenting judges when the Tenth Circuit denied a full rehearing of a divided panel opinion that had ordered the Utah governor to resume the organization's funding, which Herbert had blocked in response to a video controversy.[75][76]\n\n\nIn *A.M. v. Holmes* (2016), the Tenth Circuit considered a case in which a 13-year-old child was arrested for burping and laughing in gym class. The child was handcuffed and arrested based on a New Mexico statute that makes it a misdemeanor to disrupt school activities. The child's family brought a federal § 1983 civil rights action against school officials and the school resource officer who made the arrest, arguing that it was a false arrest that violated the child's constitutional rights. In a 94-page majority opinion, the Tenth Circuit held that the defendants enjoyed qualified immunity from suit.[77] Gorsuch wrote a four-page dissent, arguing that the New Mexico Court of Appeals had \"long ago alerted law enforcement\" that the statute that the officer relied upon for the child's arrest does not criminalize noises or diversions that merely disturb order in a classroom.[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n### Criminal law[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Gorsuch wrote for a unanimous panel finding that a court may still order criminals to pay restitution even after it missed a statutory deadline.[80] The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling 5–4 in *Dolan v. United States* (2010).[67]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Games-Perez* (2012), Gorsuch ruled on a case where a felon owned a gun in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), but alleged that he did not know that he was a felon at the time. Gorsuch joined the majority in upholding the conviction based on Tenth Circuit precedent, but filed a concurring opinion arguing that said precedent was wrongly decided: \"The only statutory element separating innocent (even constitutionally protected) gun possession from criminal conduct in §§ 922(g) and 924(a) is a prior felony conviction. So the presumption that the government must prove mens rea here applies with full force.\"[81] In the 2019 case *Rehaif v. United States*, the Supreme Court overruled this decision, with Gorsuch joining.\n\n\nIn 2013, Gorsuch joined a unanimous panel finding that intent does not need to be proven under a bank fraud statute.[82] A unanimous Supreme Court affirmed that ruling in *Loughrin v. United States* (2014).[67] In 2015, Gorsuch wrote a dissent to the denial of rehearing *en banc* when the Tenth Circuit found that a convicted sex offender had to register with Kansas after he moved to the Philippines.[83] A unanimous Supreme Court reversed the Tenth Circuit in *Nichols v. United States* (2016).[67]\n\n\n\n### Death penalty[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch favors a strict reading of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).[56] In 2015, he wrote for the court when it permitted Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to order the execution of Scott Eizember, prompting a 30-page dissent by Judge Mary Beck Briscoe.[84][85] After the state's unsuccessful execution of Clayton Lockett, Gorsuch joined Briscoe when the court unanimously allowed Pruitt to continue using the same lethal injection protocol. The Supreme Court upheld that ruling 5–4 in *Glossip v. Gross* (2015).[86]\n\n\n\n### List of judicial opinions[edit]\n\n\nDuring his tenure on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, Gorsuch authored 212 published opinions.[87] Some of those are:\n\n\n\n* *United States v. Hinckley*, 550 F. 3d 926 (2008), on principles of interpretation and construction of a statute, according to plain meaning and context\n* *United States v.

Obama had nominated Garland on March 16, 2016, but Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley did not schedule a hearing for him, leaving Garland's nomination to expire on January 3, 2017.[93] Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell invoked the so-called \"Biden Rule\" (of 1992) to justify the Senate's refusal to consider Garland's nomination in a general election year.[94][95][96]\n\n\nTrump formally transmitted his nomination to the Senate on February 1, 2017.[97] The American Bar Association unanimously gave Gorsuch its top rating—\"Well Qualified\"—to serve as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.[98] His confirmation hearing before the Senate started on March 20, 2017.[99]\n\n\nOn April 3, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved his nomination with a party-line 11–9 vote.[100] On April 6, 2017, Democrats filibustered (prevented cloture) the confirmation vote, after which Republicans invoked the \"nuclear option\", allowing a filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee to be broken by a simple majority vote.[101]\n\n\nOn April 4, BuzzFeed and *Politico* ran articles highlighting similar language occurring in Gorsuch's book *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia* and an earlier law review article by Abigail Lawlis Kuzma, Indiana's deputy attorney general. Academic experts contacted by *Politico* \"differed in their assessment of what Gorsuch did, ranging from calling it a clear impropriety to mere sloppiness.\"[102][103][104][105]\n\n\nJohn Finnis, who supervised Gorsuch's dissertation at Oxford, said, \"The allegation is entirely without foundation. The book is meticulous in its citation of primary sources. The allegation that the book is guilty of plagiarism because it does not cite secondary sources which draw on those same primary sources is, frankly, absurd.\" Kuzma said, \"I have reviewed both passages and do not see an issue here, even though the language is similar. These passages are factual, not analytical in nature, framing both the technical legal and medical circumstances of the 'Baby/Infant Doe' case that occurred in 1982.\"[103] In his book on Gorsuch, John Greenya described how Gorsuch was challenged during his confirmation hearings concerning some of his dissertation advisor's more strident views, which Gorsuch generally disagreed with.[106]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2017, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court by a 54–45 vote, with three Democrats (Heidi Heitkamp, Joe Manchin, and Joe Donnelly) joining all Republicans in attendance.[107]\n\n\nGorsuch received his commission on April 8, 2017.[108] He was sworn into office on Monday, April 10, 2017, in two ceremonies. The chief justice of the United States administered the constitutional oath of office in a private ceremony at 9 a.m. at the Supreme Court, making Gorsuch the 101st associate justice of the Court. At 11 a.m., Justice Kennedy administered the judicial oath of office in a public ceremony at the White House Rose Garden.[109][110][111]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2017–present)[edit]\n\n\n### Banking regulation[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch wrote his first U.S. Supreme Court decision for a unanimous court in *Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc.*, 582 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017). The Court ruled against the borrowers, holding that Santander in this case was not a debt collector under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act since it purchased the original defaulted car loans from CitiFinancial for pennies on the dollar, making Santander the owner of the debts and not merely an agent.[112] When the act was enacted, regulations were put on institutions that collected other companies' debts, but the act left unaddressed businesses collecting their own debts.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch joined the majority in *National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra* and *Janus v. AFSCME*, which both held unconstitutional certain forms of compelled speech.[115][116]\n\n\nGorsuch authored the majority opinion in *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* (2022), which concerned a public high school football coach who was fired for praying on the field after games. The opinion held that the coach's conduct was protected by both the Free Speech and Free Exercise clauses of the First Amendment, and that the school's attempt to stop him was not mandated by the amendment's Establishment Clause.[117]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, in *Pavan v. Smith*, the Supreme Court \"summarily overruled\" the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision to deny same-sex married parents the same right to appear on the birth certificate.[118] Gorsuch wrote a dissent, joined by Thomas and Alito, arguing that the Court should have fully heard the arguments of the case.[119]\n\n\nIn 2020, Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion in the combined cases of *Bostock v. Clayton County*, *Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda*, and *R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission*, ruling that businesses cannot discriminate in employment against LGBTQ people. He argued that discrimination based on sexual orientation was illegal discrimination on the basis of sex, because the employer would be discriminating \"for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex\".[120] The ruling was 6–3, with Gorsuch joined by Chief Justice Roberts and the Court's four Democratic appointees.[121][122] Justices Thomas, Alito, and Kavanaugh dissented from the decision, arguing that it improperly extended the Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity.[123]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Gorsuch agreed with the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to deny an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[124] In June 2021, he joined the justices in the unanimous Fulton v. City of Philadelphia decision, ruling in favor of a Catholic adoption agency that had been denied a contract by the City of Philadelphia due to the agency's refusal to adopt to same-sex couples.[125] Gorsuch and Thomas joined Alito's concurrence, which argued for reconsidering, possibly overturning, *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[126] Also in 2021, Gorsuch was one of three justices, with Thomas and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington State florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[127][128][129] In November 2021, Gorsuch dissented from the Court's 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[130] The decision to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor; Thomas and Alito also dissented.[131][132]\n\n\n\n### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2019\nGorsuch joined Thomas's dissent from denial of certiorari in *Peruta v. San Diego County*, in which the Ninth Circuit had upheld California's restrictive concealed carry laws.[133]\n\n\nGorsuch wrote a statement regarding the denial of an application for a stay presented to Roberts in *Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives*, a 2019 D.C. Circuit case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. In his statement Gorsuch criticized the Trump Administration's action as well as the justification the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit used for upholding the ban.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### Vagueness doctrine[edit]\n\n\nIn *Sessions v. Dimaya* (2018), the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 to uphold the Ninth Circuit's decision that the residual clause in the Immigration and Nationality Act was unconstitutionally vague. Gorsuch joined Justices Kagan, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor in the opinion, and wrote a separate concurrence reiterating the importance of the vagueness doctrine within Scalia's 2015 opinion in *Johnson*.[136] In *United States v. Davis* (2019), Gorsuch wrote the Opinion of the Court striking down the residual clause of the Hobbs Act based on the rationale used in *Dimaya*.[137][138]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Gorsuch dissented when the Court voted against hearing cases brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[139] He and Alito joined Thomas's dissent arguing that it was the Court's job to hear the case.[140]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Gorsuch sided with three of the Court's other conservative justices, rejecting a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[141] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would require that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[142] In June 2020, the Supreme Court struck down Louisiana's abortion restriction in *June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo*, a 5–4 decision; Gorsuch was among the four dissenters.[143][144] In September 2021, the Supreme Court declined a petition to block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks; the vote was 5–4 with Gorsuch in the majority, joined by Thomas, Alito, Kavanaugh, and Barrett.[145]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Gorsuch was among the five justices who formed the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which ruled there is no constitutional right to abortion, overruling *Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[146]\n\n\n\n### Native American law[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch is regarded as an authority on American Indian law.[147] During his time on the Supreme Court, he has frequently affirmed tribal rights; his appointment to the Court was supported by multiple tribes and Native American organizations due to his favorable rulings as a Tenth Circuit judge.[148][149]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Gorsuch joined the four liberal justices (in two plurality opinions) in a 5–4 majority in *Washington State Dept. of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc.*[150] The Court's decision sided with the Yakama Nation, striking down a Washington state tax on transporting gasoline, on the basis of an 1855 treaty in which the Yakama ceded a large portion of Washington in exchange for certain rights.[151] In his concurrence, which was joined by Ginsburg, Gorsuch ended his opinion by writing: \"Really, this case just tells an old and familiar story. The State of Washington includes millions of acres that the Yakamas ceded to the United States under significant pressure. In return, the government supplied a handful of modest promises. The state is now dissatisfied with the consequences of one of those promises. It is a new day, and now it wants more. But today and to its credit, the Court holds the parties to the terms of their deal. It is the least we can do.\"[152]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Gorsuch again joined the four more liberal justices in a decision favorable to Native Americans' treaty rights, signing on to Justice Sotomayor's opinion to reach a 5–4 decision in *Herrera v. Wyoming*. The case held that hunting rights in Montana and Wyoming, granted by the U.S. government to the Native American Crow people by an 1868 treaty, were not extinguished by the 1890 grant of statehood to Wyoming.[153]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Gorsuch again joined the liberal justices to make a 5–4 majority in *McGirt v. Oklahoma*. The case considered whether much of eastern Oklahoma still remained under the jurisdiction of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\", given that the Native American Treaties that had designated the region as under their reservation status had never been dissolved by Congress, and, if so, whether crimes committed by Native Americans against other Native Americans on tribal land were under the jurisdiction of Native Courts.[154] The landmark decision in the affirmative, written by Gorsuch, found that \"For Major Crimes Act purposes, land reserved for the Creek Nation since the 19th century remains 'Indian country.'\"[155][156] In the opinion, he wrote: \"Today we are asked whether the land these treaties promised remains an Indian reservation for purposes of federal criminal law. Because Congress has not said otherwise, we hold the government to its word.\"[156] The case was later reviewed in the June 2022 case Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta, which considered whether non-Natives who committed crimes against Natives on Native American territory can be charged under the sole jurisdiction of Native American tribal courts.[157][158] While the state of Oklahoma had initially argued for the overturning of *McGirt*, the Court agreed to hear only issues relating to the impacts of *McGirt*.[159] The 5-4 decision by Justice Brett Kavanaugh opposed the more expanded viewpoint of non-Native criminal jurisdiction, with the opinion giving jurisdiction over such crimes to both tribal and federal/state governments. Gorsuch derided the opinion in his dissent, writing, \"Where this Court once stood firm, today it wilts.\"[160][161]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2022, Gorsuch, Barrett, and the three liberal justices ruled in favor of the Native American Tribes of Texas in the case *Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas*. The case concerned a dispute over whether Texas could control and regulate gambling on Texan Native American reservations. The initial conflict had developed from the tribes' having been in a trust with Texas from 1968 to 1987 before being granted a federal trust, resulting in a statute governing the tribes' subjugation to Texas's gambling restrictions.[162] The ruling emphasized that the tribes have the power to regulate electronic bingo games on their land regardless of the state's prohibition of non-prohibited gambling. Thus, as long as a game is not outright prohibited by the state of Texas, the state government cannot impose regulations upon tribal games. Gorsuch emphasized in his opinion that \"None of this is to say that the Tribe may offer gaming on whatever terms it wishes [...] Other gaming activities are subject to tribal regulation and must conform to the terms and conditions set forth in federal law.\"[163]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 restrictions[edit]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Gorsuch joined the majority opinion in *Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*, which struck down COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the state of New York on houses of worship.[164]\n\n\nOn May 18, 2023, Gorsuch issued a statement about the Court's decision to dismiss a lawsuit by several states aimed at continuing Title 42 expulsions of immigrants, a policy instituted to prevent the introduction of COVID-19 cases to the United States. His statement criticized many of the restrictions the government had imposed since the pandemic started and said, \"Since March 2020, we may have experienced the greatest intrusions on civil liberties in the peacetime history of this country.\"[165]\n\n\n\n## Legal philosophy[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch is a proponent of originalism, the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment, and of textualism, the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering the legislative history and underlying purpose of the law.[2][3][4] An editorial in the *National Catholic Register* opined that Gorsuch's judicial decisions lean more toward natural law philosophy.[166]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of *The Week* wrote that an \"unexpected civil libertarian alliance\" was developing between Gorsuch and Sotomayor \"in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach.\"[167]\n\n\n\n### Voting alignment[edit]\n\n\nFiveThirtyEight used Lee Epstein et al.'s Judicial Common Space scores[168] (which are not based on a judge's behavior, but rather the ideology scores of either home state senators or the appointing president) to find a close alignment between the conservatism of other appellate and Supreme Court judges such as Kavanaugh, Thomas, and Alito.[169] *The Washington Post*'s statistical analysis estimated that the ideologies of most of Trump's announced candidates were \"statistically indistinguishable\" and also associated Gorsuch with Kavanaugh and Alito.[170]\n\n\n\n### Judicial activism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch in 2019\nIn a 2016 speech at Case Western Reserve University, Gorsuch said that judges should strive to apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be—not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best.[171]\n\n\nIn a 2005 *National Review* article, Gorsuch argued that \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda\" and that they are \"failing to reach out and persuade the public\". He wrote that, in doing so, American liberals are circumventing the democratic process on issues like gay marriage, school vouchers, and assisted suicide, and this has led to a compromised judiciary, which is no longer independent. Gorsuch wrote that American liberals' \"overweening addiction\" to using the courts for social debate is \"bad for the nation and bad for the judiciary\".[47][172]\n\n\n\n### Federalism and state power[edit]\n\n\nJustin Marceau, a professor at the University of Denver's Sturm College of Law, called Gorsuch \"a predictably socially conservative judge who tends to favor state power over federal power\". Marceau added that this is important because federal laws have been used to try to reel in \"rogue\" state laws in civil rights cases.[173]\n\n\n\n### Assisted suicide[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2006, Gorsuch's book *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia*, developed from his doctoral thesis, was published by Princeton University Press.[38][174][175][176] In the book, Gorsuch makes clear his personal opposition to euthanasia and assisted suicide, arguing that the U.S. should \"retain existing law [banning assisted suicide and euthanasia] on the basis that human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable, and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.\"[59][175][177]\n\n\n\n### Statutory interpretation[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch has been considered to follow in Scalia's footsteps as a textualist in statutory interpretation of the plain meaning of the law.[178][179] This was exemplified in his majority opinion in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, 590 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2020), which ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 grants protection from employment discrimination due to sexual orientation and gender identity. Gorsuch wrote in the decision, \"An employer who fired an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.\"[180][181][182]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gorsuch and family with Donald Trump, Anthony Kennedy, and Mike Pence prior to his swearing-in\nGorsuch and his wife, Marie Louise Gorsuch,[183] a British citizen, met at Oxford. The two married at St. Nicholas' Anglican Church in Henley-on-Thames in 1996.[184][185] They live in Boulder, Colorado, and have two daughters.[186][187][188]\n\n\nGorsuch enjoys the outdoors and fly fishing; he went fly fishing on at least one occasion with Justice Scalia.[10][189] He raises horses, chickens, and goats, and often arranges ski trips with colleagues and friends.[56]\n\n\nHe has authored two nonfiction books. The first, *The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia*, was published by Princeton University Press in July 2006.[190] He is a co-author of *The Law of Judicial Precedent*, published by Thomson West in 2016.[35]\n\n\nIn 2017, after his announcement as a Supreme Court nominee, *the New York Times* reported that Gorsuch owned a timeshare outside Granby, Colorado, with associates of Philip Anschutz, that was later sold the same year.[36] Reporting from *Politico* in April 2023 revealed that Gorsuch had sold the cabin to Brian Duffy, the CEO of the law firm Greenberg Traurig, which litigates cases before the Supreme Court, but failed to disclose the purchaser's identity on his federal disclosure forms.[191] The property was listed for sale for a few years but did not go under contract until the week after Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court.[191][192] Since 2017, Greenberg Traurig has been involved in at least 22 cases before or presented to the Supreme Court.[191][193]\n\n\nGorsuch has been active in several professional associations throughout his legal career,[23] including the American Bar Association, the American Trial Lawyers Association, Phi Beta Kappa, the Republican National Lawyers Association, and the New York, Colorado, and District of Columbia Bar Associations.[23] In May 2019, it was announced that Gorsuch would become the new chairman of the board of the National Constitution Center, succeeding former vice president Joe Biden.[194]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch was the first member of a mainline Protestant denomination to sit on the Supreme Court since the retirement of John Paul Stevens in 2010.[195][196][197] He and his two siblings were raised Catholic and attended weekly Mass.[198][186] His wife, Louise, is British-born; the two met while Neil was studying at Oxford. Louise was raised in the Church of England.[199]\n\n\nWhen the couple returned to the United States they joined Holy Comforter, an Episcopal parish in Vienna, Virginia, attending weekly services. Gorsuch volunteered there as an usher.[197] The Gorsuch family later attended St. John's Episcopal Church in Boulder, Colorado, a liberal church with a longstanding open-door policy for the LGBT community.[91][200][201] During his 2017 confirmation hearing, responding to a senator's question about his faith, Gorsuch replied, \"I attend an Episcopal church in Boulder with my family, senator.\"[202][203][204] After marrying in a non-Catholic ceremony and joining an Episcopal church, Gorsuch has not publicly clarified his religious affiliation.[199]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nGorsuch received the Edward J. Randolph Award for outstanding service to the Department of Justice and the Harry S. Truman Foundation's Stevens Award for outstanding public service in the field of law.[188]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* Gorsuch, Neil (2004). *The right to receive assistance in suicide and euthanasia, with particular reference to the law of the United States* (DPhil thesis).

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018, and has served since October 6, 2018. He was previously a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[2]\n\n\nKavanaugh studied history at Yale University, where he joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He then attended Yale Law School, after which he began his career as a law clerk working under Judge Ken Starr. After Starr left the D.C. Circuit to become the head of the Office of Independent Counsel, Kavanaugh assisted him with investigations concerning President Bill Clinton, including drafting the *Starr Report* recommending Clinton's impeachment. He joined the Bush administration as White House staff secretary and was a central figure in its efforts to identify and confirm judicial nominees.[3] Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2003. His confirmation hearings were contentious and stalled for three years over charges of partisanship. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit in May 2006.[2][4][5]\n\n\nPresident Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 9, 2018, to fill the position vacated by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Later in July, Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in the early 1980s.[6][7][8] Three other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, one of whom later recanted her story.[9][10][11][12] None of the accusations were corroborated by eyewitness testimony, and Kavanaugh denied them. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a supplemental hearing over the allegations and voted 11–10 along party lines to advance the confirmation to a full Senate vote.[13] On October 6, the full Senate confirmed Kavanaugh by a vote of 50–48.[14][15]\n\n\nSince the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, Kavanaugh has come to be regarded as a swing vote on the Court.[16][17] He was the target of an assassination attempt in June 2022; the suspect had hoped to disrupt the rulings in *Dobbs* and *Bruen*.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was born on February 12, 1965, in Washington, D.C.,[19] the son of Martha Gamble (*née* Murphy) and Everett Edward Kavanaugh Jr.[20][21] He is of Irish Catholic descent on both sides of his family. His paternal great-grandfather immigrated to the United States from Roscommon, Ireland, in the late 19th century,[22][23] and his maternal Irish lineage goes back to his great-great-grandparents settling in New Jersey.[22] Kavanaugh's father was a lawyer and served as the president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association for two decades.[24] His mother was a history teacher at Woodson and McKinley high schools in Washington in the 1960s and 1970s. She earned a Juris Doctor degree from American University in 1978 and served from 1995 to 2001 as a Maryland Circuit Court judge in Montgomery County, Maryland.[25][26]\n\n\nKavanaugh was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. As a teenager, he attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys' college prep school, where he was two years ahead of Neil Gorsuch, with whom he later clerked at the Supreme Court and eventually served with as a Supreme Court justice.[27][28] He was captain of the basketball team and was a wide receiver and cornerback on the football team.[29] Kavanaugh was also friends with classmate Mark Judge; both were in the same class with Maryland state senator Richard Madaleno.[30][31][32][33] In his yearbook Kavanaugh called himself a \"Renate Alumnius\", a reference to a female student at a nearby Catholic school.[34]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Prep in 1983,[34] Kavanaugh went to Yale University, as had his paternal grandfather.[35][36] Several of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates remembered him as a \"serious but not showy student\" who loved sports, especially basketball.[37] He unsuccessfully tried out for the Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team and later played for two years on the junior varsity team.[37] He wrote articles about basketball and other sports for the *Yale Daily News*,[37] and was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.[38][39] He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts *cum laude* in history.[37]\n\n\nKavanaugh then attended Yale Law School, where he lived in a group house with future judge James E. Boasberg and played basketball with professor George L. Priest (sponsor of the school's Federalist Society).[40] He was a member of the *Yale Law Journal* and served as a notes editor during his third year. Kavanaugh graduated from Yale Law with a Juris Doctor degree in 1990.[41]\n\n\n\n## Legal career (1990–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (second from left) with President George W. Bush and White House staffers\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh served as a law clerk for Judge Walter King Stapleton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1990 to 1991.[40] During his clerkship, Stapleton wrote the majority opinion in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, in which the Third Circuit upheld many of Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions.[40] Kavanaugh then clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1991 to 1992. Yale Law professor George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] Kavanaugh interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1992 term, but was not offered a clerkship.[40]\n\n\nAfter working as a summer associate for the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, Kavanaugh earned a one-year fellowship with the Solicitor General of the United States, Ken Starr, from 1992 to 1993.[42][43][44] He then clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994,[42] alongside Neil Gorsuch and with future federal judge Gary Feinerman.[27]\n\n\n\n### Ken Starr associate counsel[edit]\n\n\nAfter his Supreme Court clerkship, Kavanaugh again worked for Ken Starr until 1997 as an Associate Counsel in the Office of the Independent Counsel with colleagues Rod Rosenstein and Alex Azar.[45] In that capacity, he reopened an investigation into the 1993 gunshot death of Vincent Foster.[45][46][47] After three years, the investigation concluded that Foster had committed suicide. In a September 2018 *New York Times* op-ed, Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz criticized Kavanaugh for having invested federal money and other resources into investigating partisan conspiracy theories surrounding the cause of Foster's death.[48]\n\n\nAfter working in private practice in 1997–98, Kavanaugh rejoined Starr as an Associate Counselor in 1998.[49] In *Swidler & Berlin v. United States* (1998), Kavanaugh argued his first and only case before the Supreme Court. Arguing for Starr's office, Kavanaugh asked the Court to disregard attorney–client privilege in relation to the investigation of Foster's death.[50] The court rejected Kavanaugh's arguments by a vote of 6–3.[51]\n\n\nKavanaugh was a principal author of the *Starr Report*, released in September 1998, on the Bill Clinton–Monica Lewinsky sex scandal; the report argued on broad grounds for Clinton's impeachment.[45] Kavanaugh had urged Starr to ask Clinton sexually graphic questions,[52][53] and described Clinton as being involved in \"a conspiracy to obstruct justice\", having \"disgraced his office\" and \"lied to the American people\".[54][55] The report provided extensive and explicit descriptions of each of Clinton's sexual encounters with Lewinsky, a level of detail the authors called \"essential\" to the case against Clinton.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (blue shirt) with President Bush, Andy Card, and Condoleezza Rice\nIn December 2000, Kavanaugh joined the legal team of George W. Bush, which was trying to stop the ballot recount in Florida.[57] After Bush became president in January 2001, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales hired Kavanaugh as an associate.[40] There, Kavanaugh worked on the Enron scandal, the successful nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, and the unsuccessful nomination of Miguel Estrada to the Court of Appeals.[40] Starting in July 2003, he served as Assistant to the President and White House staff secretary,[43] succeeding Harriet Miers.[58] In that position he was responsible for coordinating all documents going to and from the president.\n\n\n\n### Private practice[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1997 to 1998, Kavanaugh was an associate at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Kavanaugh rejoined Kirkland & Ellis in 1999 and eventually became a partner.[49][43] While there in 2000, he was *pro bono* counsel of record for relatives of Elián González, a six-year-old rescued Cuban boy. After the boy's mother's death at sea, his relatives in the U.S. wanted to keep him from returning to the care of his sole surviving parent, his father in Cuba. Kavanaugh was among a series of lawyers who unsuccessfully sought to stop efforts to repatriate González to Cuba.[59] The district court, Circuit Court and Supreme Court all followed precedent, refusing to block the repatriation.[60]\n\n\nAlso at Kirkland & Ellis, Kavanaugh authored two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court that supported religious activities and expressions in public places.[60] The first, in *Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe* (2000), argued that a student speaker at football games voted for by a majority of students should be treated as private speech in a limited public forum; the second, in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School*, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61]\n\n\n\n### Federalist Society[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W. Bush, he held a key position that involved judicial appointments. Bush judicial nominees who were Federalist Society members included John Roberts and Samuel Alito, both appointed to the Supreme Court, and about half the judges appointed to the courts of appeals.[64]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Circuit Judge (2006–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh is sworn into the D.C. Circuit by Justice Anthony Kennedy as his wife holds the bible and President Bush looks on, 2006. Coincidentally, Kavanaugh would be sworn into the U.S. Supreme Court 12 years later as Kennedy's replacement.\nPresident George W. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 25, 2003,[65] but his nomination stalled in the Senate for nearly three years. Democratic senators accused him of being too partisan, with Senator Dick Durbin calling him the \"Forrest Gump of Republican politics\".[66][67] In 2003, the American Bar Association had rated Kavanaugh \"well qualified\" (its highest category), but after doing dozens more interviews in 2006, downgraded him to \"qualified\".[68]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee recommended he be confirmed on a 10–8 party-line vote on May 11, 2006,[69] and he was confirmed by the Senate on May 26 by a vote of 57–36.[70][71] Kavanaugh was sworn in on June 1.[72] He was the fourth judge nominated to the D.C. Circuit by Bush and confirmed. Kavanaugh began hearing cases on September 11 and had his formal investiture on September 27.[73]\n\n\nIn July 2007, senators Patrick Leahy and Dick Durbin accused Kavanaugh of lying to the Judiciary Committee when he denied being involved in formulating the Bush administration's detention and interrogation policies. In 2002, Kavanaugh had told other White House lawyers that he believed Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy would not approve of denying legal counsel to prisoners detained as enemy combatants.[74][75] The issue reemerged in July 2018 after Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.[76]\n\n\n\n### Notable cases[edit]\n\n\nOn the 14 occasions on which Kavanaugh authored opinions that were considered by the Supreme Court, the Court adopted his position 13 times and reversed his position once. These included cases involving environmental regulations, criminal procedure, the separation of powers and extraterritorial jurisdiction in human rights abuse cases.[40][77] He was regarded as a feeder judge.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn the October 2017 decision *Garza v. Hargan*, Kavanaugh joined an unsigned, divided panel of the D.C. Circuit in holding that the Office of Refugee Resettlement does not violate an unaccompanied alien minor's constitutional right to an abortion by requiring that she first be appointed a sponsor before traveling to obtain the abortion, provided \"the process of securing a sponsor to whom the minor is released occurs expeditiously\".[79][80] Days later, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment, with Kavanaugh dissenting.[80][81] In his dissent, he criticized the majority for creating \"a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand\".[82] The girl then obtained an abortion.[80] In 2018, in a follow-up petition from the Solicitor General of the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the *en banc* D.C. Circuit's judgment and the girl's claim was ultimately dismissed as moot and does not serve as precedent.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case.[84][85] In his dissent, he compared the individual mandate to a tax. After a unanimous panel found that the ACA did not violate the Constitution's Origination Clause in *Sissel v. United States Department of Health & Human Services* (2014), Kavanaugh wrote a long dissent from the denial of rehearing *en banc*.[86][87] In May 2015, he dissented from a decision that denied an en banc rehearing of *Priests for Life v. HHS*, in which the panel upheld the ACA's contraceptive mandate accommodations against Priests for Life's Religious Freedom Restoration Act claims.[88][89] In *Zubik v. Burwell* (2016), the Supreme Court vacated the circuit's judgment in a per curiam decision.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Appointments Clause and separation of powers[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2008, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit found that the Constitution's Appointments Clause did not prevent the Sarbanes–Oxley Act from creating a board whose members were not directly removable by the president.[91][92] In *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board* (2010), the Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's judgment by a vote of 5–4.[93]\n\n\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh found that those directly regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could challenge the constitutionality of its design.[94][95] In October 2016, he wrote for a divided panel finding that the CFPB's design was unconstitutional, and made the CFPB director removable by the president of the United States.[96][97] In January 2018, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment by a vote of 7–3, over Kavanaugh's dissent.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Kavanaugh issued an extraordinary writ of *mandamus* requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the license application of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, over the dissent of Judge Merrick Garland.[100][101] In April 2014, Kavanaugh dissented when the court found that Labor Secretary Tom Perez could issue workplace safety citations against SeaWorld regarding the multiple killings of its workers by Tilikum, an orca.[102][103]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh wrote for a divided panel striking down a Clean Air Act regulation, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 6–2 in *EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P.* (2014).[104][105] Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* of a unanimous panel opinion upholding the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5–4 in *Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency* (2014).[106][107] After Kavanaugh dissented from a *per curiam* decision allowing the agency to disregard cost–benefit analysis, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5–4 in *Michigan v. EPA* (2015).[108][109]\n\n\n\n#### Extraterritorial jurisdiction[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp.* (2007), Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court allowed a lawsuit making accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Indonesia to proceed, arguing that the claims were not justiciable.[110][111] He dissented again when the circuit court later found that the corporation could be sued under the Alien Tort Statute of 1789.[77][112][113]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment and free speech[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote for unanimous three-judge district courts when they held that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act could restrict soft money donations to political parties and forbid campaign contributions by foreign citizens.[114][115] The Supreme Court summarily affirmed both those judgments on direct appeal.[116]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Free Speech Clause did not forbid the government from requiring meatpackers to include a country of origin label on their products.[117][118] In *United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC* (2016), he dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear a rejected challenge to the net neutrality rule, writing, \"Congress did not clearly authorize the FCC to issue the net neutrality rule.\"[43][119][120]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment and civil liberties[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2010, Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* after the circuit found that attaching a Global Positioning System tracking device to a vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[121][122] The Supreme Court then affirmed the circuit's judgment in *United States v. Jones* (2012).[123] In February 2016, Kavanaugh dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear police officers' rejected claims of qualified immunity for arresting partygoers in a vacant house.[43][124] The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the circuit's judgment in *District of Columbia v. Wesby* (2018).[125]\n\n\nIn *Klayman v. Obama* (2015), Kavanaugh concurred when the circuit court denied an *en banc* rehearing of its decision to vacate a district court order blocking the National Security Agency's warrantless bulk collection of telephony metadata,[126][127] writing that the metadata collection was not a search, and even if it were, no reasonable suspicion would be required because of the government's special need to prevent terrorist attacks.[128]\n\n\n\n#### National security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh holds his daughter while greeting British Prime Minister Tony Blair and President George W. Bush.\nIn April 2009, Kavanaugh wrote a long concurrence when the court found that detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had no right to advance notice before being transferred to another country.[129][130] In *Kiyemba v. Obama* (2010), the Supreme Court vacated that judgment while refusing to review the matter.[131] In June 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence in judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory owners could not bring a defamation suit regarding the government's allegations that they were terrorists.[132][133] In October 2012, he wrote for a unanimous court when it found that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause made it unlawful for the government to prosecute Salim Hamdan under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 on charges of providing material support for terrorism.[134][135]\n\n\nIn August 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy concurrence when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear Ghaleb Nassar Al Bihani's rejected claims that the international law of war limits the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[43][136] In 2014, he concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* circuit found that Ali al-Bahlul could be retroactively convicted of war crimes, provided the existing statute already made it a crime \"because it does not alter the definition of the crime, the defenses or the punishment\".[137][138] In October 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the plurality opinion when the *en banc* circuit found al-Bahlul could be convicted by a military commission even if his offenses are not internationally recognized as war crimes.[139][140]\n\n\nIn *Meshal v. Higgenbotham* (2016), Kavanaugh concurred when the divided panel threw out a claim by an American that he had been disappeared by the FBI in a Kenyan black site.[141][142]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment and gun ownership[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court found that a ban on the sale of semi-automatic rifles was permissible under the Second Amendment. This case followed the landmark Supreme Court ruling *District of Columbia v. Heller* (2008).[143][144]\n\n\n\n#### Vaccine regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion in *Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs v. Sebelius*,[145] holding that opponents of thimerosal-preserved vaccines lacked standing to challenge determinations by the Food and Drug Administration that vaccines and their components are safe and effective. SCOTUSblog provided the case as an example of the fact that \"[e]ven when Kavanaugh rejects a claim, he sometimes uses his discussion of standing to show that he has heard the plaintiff's argument and taken it seriously\".[146] Bloomberg wrote, \"Kavanaugh's opinion for the court repeatedly went out of its way to show it respected the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs's (CoMeD) 'genuine concern' regarding thimerosal\", but nevertheless \"said the coalition was required to seek a ban through the executive or legislative branches\".[147]\n\n\n\n### Law clerk hiring practices[edit]\n\n\nTwenty-five of Kavanaugh's 48 law clerks have been women, and 13 people of color.[148] Some have been children of other judges and high-profile legal figures, including Clayton Kozinski (son of former federal Judge Alex Kozinski), Porter Wilkinson (daughter of Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III), Philip Alito (son of Justice Samuel Alito), Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld (daughter of Yale Law professors Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld), and Emily Chertoff (daughter of former DHS secretary Michael Chertoff).[149][150]\n\n\nOn September 20, 2018, *The Guardian* reported that two Yale professors had advised female law students at Yale that their physical appearance and femininity could play a role in securing a clerkship with Kavanaugh. Rubenfeld said that Kavanaugh \"hires women with a certain look\" but did not say what that \"look\" was.[151] Unnamed sources reported that Chua said that female applicants should exude \"model-like\" femininity and \"dress outgoing\" in job interviews with Kavanaugh. Responding to the report, Chua denied that Kavanaugh's hiring decisions were affected by female applicants' attractiveness, saying, \"Judge Kavanaugh's first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence.\"[151] Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken announced an investigation of the matter,[152] but Yale did not find any cause for sanction. Chua returned to regular teaching in 2019.[153]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh and his family with President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018\nOn July 2, 2018, Kavanaugh was one of four U.S. Court of Appeals judges to receive a personal 45-minute interview by President Donald Trump as a potential replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy.[154] On July 9, Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.[155][156] In his first public speech after the nomination, Kavanaugh said, \"No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.\"[157]\n\n\n\n### Legal philosophy and approach[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on |\n| Conservatismin the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Schools\n* Compassionate\n* Fiscal\n* Fusion\n* Libertarian\n* Moderate\n* Movement\n* Neo\n* Paleo\n* Progressive\n* Social\n* Traditionalist\n |\n| Principles\n* American exceptionalism\n* Anti-communism\n* Christian nationalism\n* Classical liberalism\n* Constitutionalism\n* Familialism\n* Family values\n* Federalism\n\t+ States' rights\n* Judeo-Christian values\n* Individualism\n* Law and order\n* Limited government\n* Militarism\n* Moral absolutism\n* Natural law\n* Patriotism\n* Republicanism\n* Right to bear arms\n* Rule of law\n* Tradition\n |\n| History\n* Conservative coalition\n* Conservative Democrat\n* Conservative Manifesto\n* Loyalists\n* McCarthyism\n* Modern timeline\n* New Right\n* Old Right\n* Overview\n* Reagan Doctrine\n* Reaganomics\n* Stalwart Republicans\n* Southern Agrarians\n |\n| Intellectuals\n* Anton\n* Babbitt\n* Bell\n* Bellow\n* Bloom\n* Boorstin\n* Buckley\n* Burnham\n* Chambers\n* Conquest\n* Derbyshire\n* Dolan\n* Durant\n* Eastman\n* Eliot\n* Francis\n* George\n* Goldberg\n* Gottfried\n* Hanson\n* Hazony\n* Hoppe\n* Jaffa\n* Kimball\n* Kirk\n* Kirkpatrick\n* Kreeft\n* Kristol (Irving)\n* Kuehnelt-Leddihn\n* Laffer\n* Lasch\n* Lovecraft\n* Lukacs\n* Mansfield\n* Mencken\n* Meyer\n* Molnar\n* Murray\n* Nisbet\n* Nock\n* O'Connor\n* Ong\n* Ransom\n* Repplier\n* Santayana\n* Sowell\n* Strauss\n* Sumner\n* Viereck\n* Voegelin\n* Washington\n* Weaver\n* Yarvin\n |\n| Politicians\n* Abbott\n* Adams\n* Quincy Adams\n* Agnew\n* Buchanan\n* Bush (George H.

Wade*, which ruled abortion bans unconstitutional, and *Furman v. Georgia*, which ruled all existing death penalty statutes unconstitutional.[160][161] Two law professors evaluated Kavanaugh's appellate court decisions for the *Washington Post,* rating his decisions in four areas: rights of criminal defendants; support for rules regarding stricter enforcement of environmental protection; upholding the rights of labor unions; and siding with those bringing suits alleging discrimination. They found he had the most conservative voting record on the D.C. Circuit in three of those policy areas, and the second-most in the fourth, between 2003 and 2018.[162]\n\n\nDuring his hearing, Kavanaugh said that he had often said the four greatest moments in Supreme Court history were *Brown v. Board of Education*, *Marbury v. Madison*, *Youngstown Steel*, and *United States v. Nixon*, with *Brown* the single greatest.[163]\n\n\nAccording to the Judicial Common Space scores, a score based on the ideology scores of the home state senators and the president who nominated the judge to the federal bench, Clarence Thomas was the only justice more conservative than Kavanaugh. By this metric, Kavanaugh's confirmation shifted the court to the right.[164] Had Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland been confirmed in 2016, Stephen Breyer would have become the median swing vote when Kennedy retired. However, since Antonin Scalia was replaced by another conservative (Gorsuch), it was expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would become the median swing vote on the Supreme Court upon Kavanaugh's confirmation.[165]\n\n\n\n### Senate Judiciary Committee public hearings[edit]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled three or four days of public hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination, commencing on September 4, 2018. The hearings were delayed at the onset by objections from the Democratic members about the absence of records of Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush administration. The Democrats also complained that 42,000 pages of documents had been received only the night before the first day of hearings.[166] Republicans asserted that the volume of documents available on Kavanaugh equaled that of the previous five nominees to the court; the Democrats responded that only 15% of the documents they had requested about Kavanaugh had been provided. Numerous motions by the Democrats to adjourn or suspend the hearings were ruled out of order by Chairman Chuck Grassley, who argued that Kavanaugh had written over 300 legal opinions available for review. The first day's session closed after statements from each senator and the nominee, with question-and-answer periods to begin the next day.[167]\n\n\nDuring the first round of questions from senators on September 5, 2018, Kavanaugh held to his earlier stated position that he would not express an opinion on matters that might come before the Court. He thus refused to promise to recuse himself from any case, including any that might involve Trump. He also declined to comment on coverage of preexisting healthcare conditions, semiautomatic rifle possession, *Roe v. Wade*, or the president's power to self-pardon. He expounded at length on various Constitutional amendments, stare decisis (the role of legal precedent in shaping subsequent judicial rulings), and the president's power to dismiss federal employees. As in the previous session, there were frequent outbursts of protest in the audience, requiring security intervention and removal, as well as repeated procedural objections by Democrats.[168]\n\n\nThe committee's third day of hearings began with a furor over the release of emails by Kavanaugh related to concern about potential racial profiling in security screenings. The day continued with Kavanaugh's attempts to articulate his jurisprudence, including refusing to answer direct questions about matters he called hypothetical.[169] Senator Chris Coons had tendered Kavanaugh written questions about any knowledge of inappropriate behavior on the part of judge Alex Kozinski, for whom Kavanaugh had clerked, including his circulations of sexually explicit emails via his \"Easy Rider Gag List\". According to *The Intercept*, though Coons had asked him to review his emails from Kozinski, Kavanaugh replied, \"I do not remember\".[170] During his testimony, Kavanaugh said that Kozinski's 2017 exposure as an alleged prolific sexual harasser was a surprising \"gut punch\". *The Guardian* reported that their sources disputed Kavanaugh's account because Kozinski's alleged behavior was reportedly widely known among those in the judicial system and its exposure culminated in his abrupt resignation from the bench.[171]\n\n\n\nThe committee released a 2003 email in which Kavanaugh said, \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to [*Roe v. Wade*] as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current justices on the Court would do so.\"[172] Kavanaugh stressed that he was commenting on the views of legal scholars at the time, not his own views, and noted that the case had been reaffirmed on a number of occasions since 2003.[173] Senator Susan Collins indicated that Kavanaugh's statement did not contradict his personal assurance to her that *Roe* is settled law.[174] Kavanaugh noted that *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992), which reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*, was \"precedent on precedent\". According to Kavanaugh, *Casey* is a key decision about when the Court's precedent may be overturned.[175]\n\n\nOn September 27, the committee held an additional day of public hearings to discuss allegations that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct while in high school. The only witnesses were Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, his accuser.[176] Republican members of the committee did not question Ford directly; questioning on their behalf was done by Rachel Mitchell, a career prosecutor from Maricopa County, Arizona.[177] Grassley cut her questioning short, after which the Republican members of the committee questioned him themselves.[178][179] Alternating with their questions, Democratic members of the committee questioned Ford and Kavanaugh.[180] Ford repeated and expanded upon her earlier allegations, saying that Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, both \"visibly drunk\", had locked her into a bedroom, where Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes while Judge watched. She said she \"believed he was going to rape me\" and feared for her life when he held his hand over her mouth. In his opening statement, Kavanaugh claimed the accusations were a \"political hit\" by left-wing activists and Democrats, saying he faced retaliation \"on behalf of the Clintons\" for his work on the Starr Report against Bill Clinton.[181][182][183] Leland Keyser, Ford's friend who Ford said was present during the alleged attack, has denied that it took place, and questioned certain aspects of the story. Keyser also stated she felt pressured by people to support Ford's story, something she told the FBI about.[184] In response to his testimony, more than 2,400 law professors signed a letter saying that the Senate should not confirm him because \"he did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land.\"[185]\n\n\n\n### Sexual assault allegations[edit]\n\n\n#### Christine Blasey Ford[edit]\n\n\nIn early July 2018, Kavanaugh's name was on a shortlist of nominees for the Supreme Court. Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, contacted a *Washington Post* tipline and her U.S. Representative, Anna Eshoo, with accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.[7][186] On July 30, 2018, Ford wrote to Senator Dianne Feinstein to inform her of her accusation against Kavanaugh,[187] requesting that it be kept confidential.[188] After a September 12 report in *The Intercept*,[7][186][189] Feinstein confirmed that a complaint had been made against Kavanaugh by a woman who had requested not to be identified. Feinstein said that the woman had claimed that, when they were both in high school, Kavanaugh had tried to force himself on her while she was being physically restrained.[190][191] The same day, Feinstein said she had forwarded the woman's accusation to federal authorities.[192][193]\n\n\nOn September 16, Ford publicized her allegations and claimed Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was 15 and he was 17.[194][195] She said that in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, one of Kavanaugh's friends from Georgetown Prep, corralled her in a bedroom at a house party in Maryland and turned up the music playing in the room. According to Ford, Kavanaugh pinned her to the bed, groped her, ground against her, tried to pull off her clothes, and covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream.[196] Ford said she was afraid that Kavanaugh might inadvertently kill her during the attack,[197] and believed he was going to rape her.[198] Ford stated that she escaped when Judge jumped on the bed, knocking them all to the floor.[194][199]\n\n\nKavanaugh issued the following statement through the White House: \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\"[193][192] Republicans criticized the decision to withhold \"a vague, anonymous accusation for months\" before releasing it on the \"eve of [Kavanaugh's] confirmation\" as an attempt to delay his confirmation hearings.[200][201] Kavanaugh released a statement on the evening before his and Ford's scheduled testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said that due to the serious nature of the allegations, both he and Ford deserved to be heard. He also stated, \"I am innocent of this charge.\"[202]\n\n\nOn September 19, the Senate Judiciary Committee invited Kavanaugh and Ford to testify about the allegation. Kavanaugh agreed to testify on September 19.[203] Ford requested that the FBI investigate the matter first, but Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley declined the request, and gave Ford a deadline of September 21 to inform the committee whether she intended to testify. He added that Ford was welcome to appear before the committee privately or publicly.[204] On September 20, Ford's attorney opened negotiations with the committee to reschedule the hearing under \"terms that are fair and which ensure her safety\".[205] A bipartisan Judiciary Committee panel and Ford's representatives agreed to a hearing after September 24.[206]\n\n\nFord stated that Leland Ingham Keyser, a lifelong friend, was present at the party where the alleged assault took place. On September 22, Keyser stated through her attorney that she did not know Kavanaugh and had no memory of the party or a sexual assault. The attorney did confirm that Keyser was a friend of Ford's,[207] and Keyser told *The Washington Post* that she believed Ford's allegation.[208][209]\n\n\nOn October 4, 2018, the White House announced that it had found no corroboration of Ford's allegation after reviewing the FBI's latest probe into Kavanaugh's past.[210] Her attorneys tweeted, \"Those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth.\"[211]\n\n\nIn September 2019, *New York Times* reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin published *The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation*. They reported that Keyser \"thought the whole setup Ford described ... sounded wrong\", and that she \"challenged Ford's accuracy\", quoting Keyser as saying, \"I don't have any confidence in the story\".[212] According to *The Washington Post*, the book revealed that \"Keyser also said she spoke with many people who 'wanted me to remember something different'—suggesting that there was pressure on her to toe the line [against Kavanaugh]\".[213]\n\n\n\n#### Deborah Ramirez[edit]\n\n\nOn September 23, 2018, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of *The New Yorker* published an article with another sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh. Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, alleged he exposed himself to her and thrust his penis against her face after they had both been drinking at a college party during the 1983–84 academic year. Kavanaugh said, \"This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen.\"[214] *The New Yorker* spoke to four classmates, three identified as eyewitnesses but all denied witnessing the event.[214] *The New York Times* interviewed several dozen of Ramirez's classmates in an attempt to corroborate her story, and could find no firsthand witnesses to the alleged assault, but several classmates recalled that they had heard about it in the subsequent days and believed Ramirez.[215] According to *The New York Times*, \"Ramirez herself told the press and friends that, initially, she was not absolutely certain it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her, but after corresponding with friends who had secondhand knowledge of the incident, and taking time to refresh her recollection, stated that she was certain Kavanaugh was her assailant.\"[216] *The Washington Post* analyzed Ramirez's allegation and concluded, \"Ramirez's accusation has the dual distinction of having more potential corroboration and less actual corroboration than Ford's\".[217]\n\n\n\n#### Julie Swetnick[edit]\n\n\nAttorney Michael Avenatti tweeted on September 23, 2018, that he represented a woman who had \"credible information\" about Kavanaugh and Judge. Avenatti said his client would be willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[218][219][220] On September 26, Avenatti revealed the woman to be Julie Swetnick, a former government employee. In a sworn statement, Swetnick described attending \"well over ten house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the years 1981–1983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present\". She described witnessing efforts by Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Kavanaugh called her allegations \"ridiculous\" and Avenatti's allegation as a whole a \"farce\".[10] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that it had contacted \"dozens\" of her former classmates and colleagues but failed to reach anyone with knowledge of her allegations and that none of her friends had come forward publicly to support her claims.[221] In an interview with NBC News, Swetnick clarified that she did not personally witness Kavanaugh or Judge spike any drinks, and accused Avenatti of twisting her words. She further clarified that she did not personally witness efforts by Kavanaugh or Judge to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Swetnick provided NBC News with the names of friends who attended the parties, but none could corroborate her claims, while some said they did not know her.[222][223] Grassley referred Swetnick and Avenatti to the Justice Department for criminal investigation regarding claims that they engaged in \"conspiracy, false statements and obstruction of Congress\".[224]\n\n\n\n#### Judy Munro-Leighton[edit]\n\n\nOn September 19, Judy Munro-Leighton accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in an anonymous letter signed \"Jane Doe\", which was addressed to Grassley but mailed to Senator Kamala Harris. On September 26, the Senate committee interrogated Kavanaugh about this accusation. Kavanaugh called the accusation \"ridiculous\".[11] On November 1, Munro-Leighton talked to committee staff members. During the conversation she changed her story, denying that she had penned the anonymous letter and saying she had contacted Congress as \"a ploy\" to \"get attention\".[225] On November 2, Grassley announced Munro-Leighton's identity, and described her accusations as fabricated.[11] She was referred to the Department of Justice and FBI for making false accusations and obstructing justice.[11]\n\n\n\n#### FBI investigation and ethics complaints[edit]\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Republican leadership of the committee indicated that they planned to hold a committee vote on the nomination the next day, September 28, with a procedural vote on the Senate floor on September 29.[226] On September 28, the committee voted along party lines to advance the nomination to the full Senate; Senator Jeff Flake's vote in support was conditioned on delaying the vote in the full Senate for a week to allow the FBI to investigate Ford's claims. Later, Senators Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski also said they would not vote to confirm without an FBI investigation.[227] On this request from the Judiciary Committee, Trump ordered a \"supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file\", to be limited in scope and completed within a week.[228] The report was transmitted to the White House on October 3 and from there to the Senate on October 4, where senators were permitted to review the report one at a time in secrecy. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote on the confirmation on October 6.[229] Democrats called the FBI investigation incomplete, a \"farce\", a \"sham\" and \"a horrific cover-up\" that omitted key witnesses at the White House's direction.[230][231] According to *The Washington Post*, the White House stopped the FBI from investigating possible falsehoods in Kavanaugh's testimony to Congress about his drinking habits during his youth.[211]\n\n\nEighty-three ethics complaints were brought against Kavanaugh regarding his conduct during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Chief Justice Roberts appointed a special federal panel of judges to investigate them. In December 2018, the panel dismissed all the complaints, calling them \"serious\" but deciding that lower court judges have no authority to investigate Supreme Court justices.[232]\n\n\n\n#### 2023 *Justice* film[edit]\n\n\nDoug Liman's 2023 documentary *Justice* recounts the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, including the testimony of Ford and Ramirez. It features a never-before-heard audio recording made by Partnership for Public Service president and CEO Max Stier, a Yale colleague of Kavanaugh's, that corroborates Ramirez's charges and suggests that Kavanaugh violated another unnamed woman. Stier says that he witnessed Kavanaugh with his pants down with a group of rowdy soccer players forcing a drunk female freshman to hold Kavanaugh's penis. Stier also says that he had heard from classmates about Ramirez's similar encounter with Kavanaugh, which she personally describes in the film.[233]\n\n\nThe documentary also highlights the narratives Kavanaugh advanced to sway public opinion and gain Republicans' support, which reviewers described as misleading. Reviewers were persuaded that Kavanaugh and his team were aware of Ford's and Ramirez's charges before they became public and preemptively countered them by planting alternate narratives with friends and acquaintances.[234][235]\n\n\n\n### Senate action[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, the Senate voted 51–49 to invoke cloture, advancing the nomination to a final floor vote expected on October 6. This was enabled through the application of the so-called \"nuclear option\", or a simple majority vote, rather than the historical three-fifths supermajority in place before April 2017.[236] The vote was along party lines, with the exception of Democrat Joe Manchin voting yes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voting no.[237][238]\n\n\nOn October 6, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by a 50–48 vote.[239] One senator, Republican Steve Daines, who supported the nomination, was absent during the vote due to his attendance at his daughter's wedding that day, and Murkowski voted \"present\" despite her opposition so that their votes would cancel out and the balance of the vote would be retained—a rarely used traditional courtesy known as a \"pair between senators\".[240] All Republicans except Daines and Murkowski voted to confirm Kavanaugh, and all Democrats except Joe Manchin voted not to.[241] Kavanaugh's confirmation vote was historically close. The only Supreme Court confirmation that was closer was the vote on Stanley Matthews, nominated by President James A. Garfield in 1881. Matthews was confirmed by a single vote, 24–23; no other justice has been confirmed by a single vote.[242][243][244] In *percentage* terms, Kavanaugh's vote was even closer than Matthews's. Matthews received 51.06% of the vote to Kavanaugh's 51.02%.[245]\n\n\n\n### Swearing-in[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th justice of the Supreme Court on the evening of October 6, 2018.[246] The Constitutional Oath was administered by Chief Justice Roberts and the Judicial Oath was administered by Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded on the Court. This private ceremony was followed by a public ceremony at the White House on October 8.[15][247][248] Upon joining the Court, Kavanaugh became the first Supreme Court justice to hire an all-female team of law clerks.[249][250]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2018–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh being sworn in to succeed Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice on October 8, 2018\nKavanaugh began his tenure as Supreme Court justice on October 9, 2018, hearing arguments for *Stokeling v. United States* and *United States v. Stitt*.[251]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Kavanaugh was reassigned to both the Sixth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit.[252] He had previously been assigned to the Seventh Circuit, which covers federal courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.[253] Circuit justices are principally responsible for responding to emergency requests (for example, applications for emergency stays of executions)[254] that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by the assigned justice alone or else by the justice's referring them to the full Court for review.\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote his first Supreme Court opinion on January 8, 2019, in *Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc.*, a unanimous decision reversing an appeals court opinion that had allowed a court to decide whether an issue in a contract between a dental equipment manufacturer and distributor should be decided by arbitration.[255]\n\n\nOn February 27, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the court's liberal justices in *Garza v. Idaho*, a case in which the Court held that the Sixth Amendment's presumption of prejudice resulting from ineffective assistance of counsel applies to situations in which an attorney declines to file an appeal because an appeal waiver was signed as part of a plea agreement.[256]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, as a swing vote, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four more liberal justices to decline to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas, which sought to block women from choosing to receive Medicaid-funded medical care from Planned Parenthood clinics. Two lower appeals courts had ruled that the federal law creating Medicaid protects patients' rights to choose any provider which is \"qualified to perform\" the needed services.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Kavanaugh joined three of his conservative colleagues in voting to reject a stay of a Louisiana law to restrict abortion.[258] He issued his own dissenting opinion.[259] *CNBC* reported that \"Kavanaugh agreed [with three conservative justices], but wrote separately that he would be open to reconsidering the legality of the law if the dire warnings from abortion rights groups materialized.\"[260] The Supreme Court decided this case, *June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo*, on June 29, 2020, striking down Louisiana's requirement for abortion providers to hold hospital admitting privileges. Kavanaugh dissented.[261] In September 2021, by a 5–4 vote, the Court declined an emergency petition to temporarily block enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans nearly all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Kavanaugh was in the majority, joined by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett.[262] In June 2022, in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, Kavanaugh joined the same four justices in voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[263]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nAlso in February, Kavanaugh was part of the majority in decisions relating to the death penalty. On February 7, 2019, he was part of the majority in a 5–4 decision rejecting a Muslim prisoner's request to delay his execution in order to have an imam present.[264] On February 19, 2019, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four liberal justices in a 6–3 decision blocking the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[265][266] In January 2022, he voted with the majority in a 5–4 decision to allow an execution to proceed in Alabama.[267] In 2023 Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion in *Reed v. Goertz*, ruling that Texas death row inmate Rodney Reed could seek DNA testing on evidence in his case despite the state's statute of limitations on such testing.[268]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2020, in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 that the workplace nondiscrimination protections in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should be interpreted as protecting people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Kavanaugh wrote a dissent in which he argued that sexual orientation discrimination has always been understood as distinct from sex discrimination. He conceded that sexual orientation discrimination \"may, as a very literal matter, entail making a distinction based on sex\"; nonetheless, he said, \"to fire one employee because she is a woman and another employee because he is gay implicates two distinct societal concerns, reveals two distinct biases, imposes two distinct harms, and falls within two distinct statutory prohibitions.\" He said that any change to the relevant law ought to be made by Congress, not by judges; and that \"both the rule of law and democratic accountability badly suffer when a court adopts a hidden or obscure interpretation of the law, and not its ordinary meaning.\"[269] Kavanaugh's dissent did not discuss gender identity or use the word \"transgender\", although transgender rights were at issue in the case. In a footnote, he wrote that his analysis \"on the basis of sexual orientation would apply in much the same way to discrimination on the basis of gender identity.\"[270] In October 2020, Kavanaugh agreed with the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to deny an appeal brought by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[271]\n\n\nIn 2021, Kavanaugh joined the majority opinion in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic adoption and social service agency that had been denied funding by the City of Philadelphia because it does not place children for adoption with same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices\".[272] The same month, Kavanaugh was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist, whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower courts' judgments in place.[273][274][275] In November 2021, Kavanaugh voted with the majority of justices in a 6–3 decision to decline to hear an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[276] Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented; because four votes are required to hear an appeal, the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[277][278]\n\n\n\n### President Trump's taxes[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2020, in *Trump v. Vance*, the Supreme Court ruled in two 7–2 decisions that the Manhattan District Attorney could access Trump's tax records, but that the issue of whether Congress could access the same records needed to be processed through the lower courts. Kavanaugh joined Roberts, Gorsuch, and the court's four Democratic appointees in the majority;[279] Justices Thomas and Alito dissented.[280] The rulings mean that the Manhattan DA will have access to the records while Congress does not, pending the outcome of the case in lower courts.[281]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nEight days before the 2020 presidential election Kavanaugh concurred that absentee votes properly cast in Wisconsin but received after November 3 must be discarded, joining the Court's conservatives in a ruling that requires deferral to state officials on elections.[282][283] On October 19, Kavanaugh voted to grant a request for a stay that would have prevented ballots sent before Election Day but delivered within three days after it from being counted. The Court was split 4–4, so the ruling by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania requiring all votes to be counted stood, but the case may be reheard.[284] Kavanaugh sided with Roberts and three liberal justices in a 5-3 majority to allow voting extension in North Carolina.[285]\n\n\n\n### Compensation of college athletes[edit]\n\n\nIn his concurrence in *National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston* in June 2021, in which the Court ruled unanimously that college sports were not exempt from antitrust law, Kavanaugh called the NCAA \"a massive money-raising enterprise on the backs of student athletes who are not fairly compensated.\" No one else, he said, could \"not ... pay workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate.\" He said there were \"serious questions\" about other rules on compensation.[286]\n\n\n\n### Attempted assassination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brett Kavanaugh assassination plot\n\nIn the early morning of June 8, 2022, Nicholas John Roske traveled from California to Kavanaugh's home in Maryland with plans to break into the home, murder Kavanaugh, and commit suicide.[18][287] After seeing two U.S. Marshals outside Kavanaugh's home, Roske turned himself in by calling 9-1-1. He said his attempt to murder Kavanaugh stemmed from dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, as well as the potential for the Court to loosen gun control laws under the Second Amendment. Roske was armed with a pistol, two magazines and ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, a screwdriver, a nail punch, a crowbar, a pistol light, duct tape, and other items. He has been charged with attempted murder.[18]\n\n\n\n## Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh taught full-term courses on separation of powers at Harvard Law School from 2008 to 2015, on the Supreme Court at Harvard Law School between 2014 and 2018, on National Security and Foreign Relations Law at Yale Law School in 2011, and on Constitutional Interpretation at Georgetown University Law Center in 2007. He was named the Samuel Williston Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School in 2009.[288] In 2008, Kavanaugh was hired as a visiting professor by Elena Kagan, then the dean of Harvard Law School. According to *The Boston Globe*, he was generous with his time and accessible, and quickly became a student favorite. He often dined in Cambridge with students and offered references and career advice.[289][290] Kavanaugh received high evaluations from his students, including J. D. Vance.[291] After the allegations of sexual misconduct against him, Harvard Law School graduates[*which?*] petitioned Harvard to rescind Kavanaugh's position as a lecturer.[*citation needed*] Shortly thereafter, Kavanaugh voluntarily withdrew from teaching at Harvard for the 2019 winter semester.[292] In the summer of 2019, he joined the faculty of George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School as a visiting professor, co-teaching a summer course in Runnymede, England, on the origins and creation of the United States Constitution.[293]\n\n\nIn 2009, Kavanaugh wrote an article for the *Minnesota Law Review* in which he argued that Congress should exempt U.S. presidents from civil lawsuits while in office[294] because, among other things, such lawsuits could be \"time-consuming and distracting\" for the president and would thus \"ill serve the public interest, especially in times of financial or national security crisis\".[295] Kavanaugh argued that if a president \"does something dastardly\", they may be impeached by the House of Representatives, convicted by the Senate, and criminally prosecuted after leaving office.[294] He asserted that the U.S. would have been better off if President Clinton could have \"focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots\".[294] This article garnered attention in 2018 when Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court by Trump, whose 2016 presidential campaign was at the time the subject of a federal probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.[295]\n\n\nWhen reviewing a book on statutory interpretation by Second Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, Kavanaugh observed that judges often cannot agree on a statute if its text is ambiguous.[296] To remedy this, he encouraged judges to first seek the \"best reading\" of the statute, through \"interpreting the words of the statute\" as well as the context of the statute as a whole, and only then apply other interpretive techniques that may justify an interpretation that differs from the \"best meaning\", such as constitutional avoidance, legislative history, and Chevron deference.[296]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Kavanaugh family with President Bush\nKavanaugh and Ashley Estes, the personal secretary to former President George W. Bush,[297] married in 2004; the couple have two daughters.[298] They live in Chevy Chase Section Five, Maryland.[40]\n\n\nKavanaugh ran the Boston Marathon in 2010 and 2015.[299] His bibs bore non-qualifying numbers, assigned for a charity or a \"guest\" rather than an age-based time qualifier.[300] He also has completed many shorter races, from 5 km to 10 miles.[301][302]\n\n\nKavanaugh is a Roman Catholic[297] and serves as a regular lector at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament at Hanceville, Alabama. He has helped serve meals to the homeless as part of church programs, and has tutored at the Washington Jesuit Academy, a Catholic private school in the District of Columbia.[297][303]\n\n\nAt his May 2006 confirmation hearing to the District of Columbia Circuit, he stated that he was a registered Republican.[1] In 2018, Kavanaugh's reported salary was $220,600 as a federal judge and $27,000 as a lecturer at Harvard Law School.[304]\n\n\nIn 2022, Kavanaugh's home was the site of protests following the leak of a draft majority opinion for the Supreme Court case *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.*[305][306]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Kavanaugh, Brett (1989). \"Note: Defense Presence and Participation: A Procedural Minimum for Batson v.

He was nominated by President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018, and has served since October 6, 2018. He was previously a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[2]\n\n\nKavanaugh studied history at Yale University, where he joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He then attended Yale Law School, after which he began his career as a law clerk working under Judge Ken Starr. After Starr left the D.C. Circuit to become the head of the Office of Independent Counsel, Kavanaugh assisted him with investigations concerning President Bill Clinton, including drafting the *Starr Report* recommending Clinton's impeachment. He joined the Bush administration as White House staff secretary and was a central figure in its efforts to identify and confirm judicial nominees.[3] Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 2003. His confirmation hearings were contentious and stalled for three years over charges of partisanship. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the D.C. Circuit in May 2006.[2][4][5]\n\n\nPresident Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court on July 9, 2018, to fill the position vacated by Justice Anthony Kennedy. Later in July, Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her in the early 1980s.[6][7][8] Three other women also accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, one of whom later recanted her story.[9][10][11][12] None of the accusations were corroborated by eyewitness testimony, and Kavanaugh denied them. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a supplemental hearing over the allegations and voted 11–10 along party lines to advance the confirmation to a full Senate vote.[13] On October 6, the full Senate confirmed Kavanaugh by a vote of 50–48.[14][15]\n\n\nSince the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, Kavanaugh has come to be regarded as a swing vote on the Court.[16][17] He was the target of an assassination attempt in June 2022; the suspect had hoped to disrupt the rulings in *Dobbs* and *Bruen*.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was born on February 12, 1965, in Washington, D.C.,[19] the son of Martha Gamble (*née* Murphy) and Everett Edward Kavanaugh Jr.[20][21] He is of Irish Catholic descent on both sides of his family. His paternal great-grandfather immigrated to the United States from Roscommon, Ireland, in the late 19th century,[22][23] and his maternal Irish lineage goes back to his great-great-grandparents settling in New Jersey.[22] Kavanaugh's father was a lawyer and served as the president of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association for two decades.[24] His mother was a history teacher at Woodson and McKinley high schools in Washington in the 1960s and 1970s. She earned a Juris Doctor degree from American University in 1978 and served from 1995 to 2001 as a Maryland Circuit Court judge in Montgomery County, Maryland.[25][26]\n\n\nKavanaugh was raised in Bethesda, Maryland. As a teenager, he attended Georgetown Preparatory School, a Jesuit boys' college prep school, where he was two years ahead of Neil Gorsuch, with whom he later clerked at the Supreme Court and eventually served with as a Supreme Court justice.[27][28] He was captain of the basketball team and was a wide receiver and cornerback on the football team.[29] Kavanaugh was also friends with classmate Mark Judge; both were in the same class with Maryland state senator Richard Madaleno.[30][31][32][33] In his yearbook Kavanaugh called himself a \"Renate Alumnius\", a reference to a female student at a nearby Catholic school.[34]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Georgetown Prep in 1983,[34] Kavanaugh went to Yale University, as had his paternal grandfather.[35][36] Several of Kavanaugh's Yale classmates remembered him as a \"serious but not showy student\" who loved sports, especially basketball.[37] He unsuccessfully tried out for the Yale Bulldogs men's basketball team and later played for two years on the junior varsity team.[37] He wrote articles about basketball and other sports for the *Yale Daily News*,[37] and was a member of the fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon.[38][39] He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts *cum laude* in history.[37]\n\n\nKavanaugh then attended Yale Law School, where he lived in a group house with future judge James E. Boasberg and played basketball with professor George L. Priest (sponsor of the school's Federalist Society).[40] He was a member of the *Yale Law Journal* and served as a notes editor during his third year. Kavanaugh graduated from Yale Law with a Juris Doctor degree in 1990.[41]\n\n\n\n## Legal career (1990–2006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (second from left) with President George W. Bush and White House staffers\n### Clerkships[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh served as a law clerk for Judge Walter King Stapleton of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1990 to 1991.[40] During his clerkship, Stapleton wrote the majority opinion in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, in which the Third Circuit upheld many of Pennsylvania's abortion restrictions.[40] Kavanaugh then clerked for Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from 1991 to 1992. Yale Law professor George Priest recommended Kavanaugh to Kozinski, who was regarded as a feeder judge.[40] Kavanaugh interviewed for a clerkship with Chief Justice William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court during the 1992 term, but was not offered a clerkship.[40]\n\n\nAfter working as a summer associate for the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, Kavanaugh earned a one-year fellowship with the Solicitor General of the United States, Ken Starr, from 1992 to 1993.[42][43][44] He then clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy from 1993 to 1994,[42] alongside Neil Gorsuch and with future federal judge Gary Feinerman.[27]\n\n\n\n### Ken Starr associate counsel[edit]\n\n\nAfter his Supreme Court clerkship, Kavanaugh again worked for Ken Starr until 1997 as an Associate Counsel in the Office of the Independent Counsel with colleagues Rod Rosenstein and Alex Azar.[45] In that capacity, he reopened an investigation into the 1993 gunshot death of Vincent Foster.[45][46][47] After three years, the investigation concluded that Foster had committed suicide. In a September 2018 *New York Times* op-ed, Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz criticized Kavanaugh for having invested federal money and other resources into investigating partisan conspiracy theories surrounding the cause of Foster's death.[48]\n\n\nAfter working in private practice in 1997–98, Kavanaugh rejoined Starr as an Associate Counselor in 1998.[49] In *Swidler & Berlin v. United States* (1998), Kavanaugh argued his first and only case before the Supreme Court. Arguing for Starr's office, Kavanaugh asked the Court to disregard attorney–client privilege in relation to the investigation of Foster's death.[50] The court rejected Kavanaugh's arguments by a vote of 6–3.[51]\n\n\nKavanaugh was a principal author of the *Starr Report*, released in September 1998, on the Bill Clinton–Monica Lewinsky sex scandal; the report argued on broad grounds for Clinton's impeachment.[45] Kavanaugh had urged Starr to ask Clinton sexually graphic questions,[52][53] and described Clinton as being involved in \"a conspiracy to obstruct justice\", having \"disgraced his office\" and \"lied to the American people\".[54][55] The report provided extensive and explicit descriptions of each of Clinton's sexual encounters with Lewinsky, a level of detail the authors called \"essential\" to the case against Clinton.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh (blue shirt) with President Bush, Andy Card, and Condoleezza Rice\nIn December 2000, Kavanaugh joined the legal team of George W. Bush, which was trying to stop the ballot recount in Florida.[57] After Bush became president in January 2001, White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales hired Kavanaugh as an associate.[40] There, Kavanaugh worked on the Enron scandal, the successful nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts, and the unsuccessful nomination of Miguel Estrada to the Court of Appeals.[40] Starting in July 2003, he served as Assistant to the President and White House staff secretary,[43] succeeding Harriet Miers.[58] In that position he was responsible for coordinating all documents going to and from the president.\n\n\n\n### Private practice[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1997 to 1998, Kavanaugh was an associate at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Kavanaugh rejoined Kirkland & Ellis in 1999 and eventually became a partner.[49][43] While there in 2000, he was *pro bono* counsel of record for relatives of Elián González, a six-year-old rescued Cuban boy. After the boy's mother's death at sea, his relatives in the U.S. wanted to keep him from returning to the care of his sole surviving parent, his father in Cuba. Kavanaugh was among a series of lawyers who unsuccessfully sought to stop efforts to repatriate González to Cuba.[59] The district court, Circuit Court and Supreme Court all followed precedent, refusing to block the repatriation.[60]\n\n\nAlso at Kirkland & Ellis, Kavanaugh authored two amicus briefs to the Supreme Court that supported religious activities and expressions in public places.[60] The first, in *Santa Fe Independent School District v. Doe* (2000), argued that a student speaker at football games voted for by a majority of students should be treated as private speech in a limited public forum; the second, in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School*, argued that a Christian Bible instruction program should have the same after-school access to school facilities as other non-curriculum-related student groups.[61]\n\n\n\n### Federalist Society[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh has been a member of the Federalist Society since 1988.[62][63] In the administration of George W. Bush, he held a key position that involved judicial appointments. Bush judicial nominees who were Federalist Society members included John Roberts and Samuel Alito, both appointed to the Supreme Court, and about half the judges appointed to the courts of appeals.[64]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Circuit Judge (2006–2018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh is sworn into the D.C. Circuit by Justice Anthony Kennedy as his wife holds the bible and President Bush looks on, 2006. Coincidentally, Kavanaugh would be sworn into the U.S. Supreme Court 12 years later as Kennedy's replacement.\nPresident George W. Bush nominated Kavanaugh to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on July 25, 2003,[65] but his nomination stalled in the Senate for nearly three years. Democratic senators accused him of being too partisan, with Senator Dick Durbin calling him the \"Forrest Gump of Republican politics\".[66][67] In 2003, the American Bar Association had rated Kavanaugh \"well qualified\" (its highest category), but after doing dozens more interviews in 2006, downgraded him to \"qualified\".[68]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee recommended he be confirmed on a 10–8 party-line vote on May 11, 2006,[69] and he was confirmed by the Senate on May 26 by a vote of 57–36.[70][71] Kavanaugh was sworn in on June 1.[72] He was the fourth judge nominated to the D.C. Circuit by Bush and confirmed. Kavanaugh began hearing cases on September 11 and had his formal investiture on September 27.[73]\n\n\nIn July 2007, senators Patrick Leahy and Dick Durbin accused Kavanaugh of lying to the Judiciary Committee when he denied being involved in formulating the Bush administration's detention and interrogation policies. In 2002, Kavanaugh had told other White House lawyers that he believed Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy would not approve of denying legal counsel to prisoners detained as enemy combatants.[74][75] The issue reemerged in July 2018 after Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court.[76]\n\n\n\n### Notable cases[edit]\n\n\nOn the 14 occasions on which Kavanaugh authored opinions that were considered by the Supreme Court, the Court adopted his position 13 times and reversed his position once. These included cases involving environmental regulations, criminal procedure, the separation of powers and extraterritorial jurisdiction in human rights abuse cases.[40][77] He was regarded as a feeder judge.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn the October 2017 decision *Garza v. Hargan*, Kavanaugh joined an unsigned, divided panel of the D.C. Circuit in holding that the Office of Refugee Resettlement does not violate an unaccompanied alien minor's constitutional right to an abortion by requiring that she first be appointed a sponsor before traveling to obtain the abortion, provided \"the process of securing a sponsor to whom the minor is released occurs expeditiously\".[79][80] Days later, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment, with Kavanaugh dissenting.[80][81] In his dissent, he criticized the majority for creating \"a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand\".[82] The girl then obtained an abortion.[80] In 2018, in a follow-up petition from the Solicitor General of the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the *en banc* D.C. Circuit's judgment and the girl's claim was ultimately dismissed as moot and does not serve as precedent.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction in the case.[84][85] In his dissent, he compared the individual mandate to a tax. After a unanimous panel found that the ACA did not violate the Constitution's Origination Clause in *Sissel v. United States Department of Health & Human Services* (2014), Kavanaugh wrote a long dissent from the denial of rehearing *en banc*.[86][87] In May 2015, he dissented from a decision that denied an en banc rehearing of *Priests for Life v. HHS*, in which the panel upheld the ACA's contraceptive mandate accommodations against Priests for Life's Religious Freedom Restoration Act claims.[88][89] In *Zubik v. Burwell* (2016), the Supreme Court vacated the circuit's judgment in a per curiam decision.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Appointments Clause and separation of powers[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2008, Kavanaugh dissented when the D.C. Circuit found that the Constitution's Appointments Clause did not prevent the Sarbanes–Oxley Act from creating a board whose members were not directly removable by the president.[91][92] In *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board* (2010), the Supreme Court reversed the circuit court's judgment by a vote of 5–4.[93]\n\n\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh found that those directly regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could challenge the constitutionality of its design.[94][95] In October 2016, he wrote for a divided panel finding that the CFPB's design was unconstitutional, and made the CFPB director removable by the president of the United States.[96][97] In January 2018, the *en banc* D.C. Circuit reversed that judgment by a vote of 7–3, over Kavanaugh's dissent.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Kavanaugh issued an extraordinary writ of *mandamus* requiring the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the license application of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, over the dissent of Judge Merrick Garland.[100][101] In April 2014, Kavanaugh dissented when the court found that Labor Secretary Tom Perez could issue workplace safety citations against SeaWorld regarding the multiple killings of its workers by Tilikum, an orca.[102][103]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh wrote for a divided panel striking down a Clean Air Act regulation, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 6–2 in *EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P.* (2014).[104][105] Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* of a unanimous panel opinion upholding the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5–4 in *Utility Air Regulatory Group v. Environmental Protection Agency* (2014).[106][107] After Kavanaugh dissented from a *per curiam* decision allowing the agency to disregard cost–benefit analysis, the Supreme Court reversed by a vote of 5–4 in *Michigan v. EPA* (2015).[108][109]\n\n\n\n#### Extraterritorial jurisdiction[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp.* (2007), Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court allowed a lawsuit making accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Indonesia to proceed, arguing that the claims were not justiciable.[110][111] He dissented again when the circuit court later found that the corporation could be sued under the Alien Tort Statute of 1789.[77][112][113]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment and free speech[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote for unanimous three-judge district courts when they held that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act could restrict soft money donations to political parties and forbid campaign contributions by foreign citizens.[114][115] The Supreme Court summarily affirmed both those judgments on direct appeal.[116]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Free Speech Clause did not forbid the government from requiring meatpackers to include a country of origin label on their products.[117][118] In *United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC* (2016), he dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear a rejected challenge to the net neutrality rule, writing, \"Congress did not clearly authorize the FCC to issue the net neutrality rule.\"[43][119][120]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment and civil liberties[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2010, Kavanaugh dissented from the denial of rehearing *en banc* after the circuit found that attaching a Global Positioning System tracking device to a vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.[121][122] The Supreme Court then affirmed the circuit's judgment in *United States v. Jones* (2012).[123] In February 2016, Kavanaugh dissented when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear police officers' rejected claims of qualified immunity for arresting partygoers in a vacant house.[43][124] The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the circuit's judgment in *District of Columbia v. Wesby* (2018).[125]\n\n\nIn *Klayman v. Obama* (2015), Kavanaugh concurred when the circuit court denied an *en banc* rehearing of its decision to vacate a district court order blocking the National Security Agency's warrantless bulk collection of telephony metadata,[126][127] writing that the metadata collection was not a search, and even if it were, no reasonable suspicion would be required because of the government's special need to prevent terrorist attacks.[128]\n\n\n\n#### National security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh holds his daughter while greeting British Prime Minister Tony Blair and President George W. Bush.\nIn April 2009, Kavanaugh wrote a long concurrence when the court found that detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp had no right to advance notice before being transferred to another country.[129][130] In *Kiyemba v. Obama* (2010), the Supreme Court vacated that judgment while refusing to review the matter.[131] In June 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a concurrence in judgment when the *en banc* D.C. Circuit found that the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory owners could not bring a defamation suit regarding the government's allegations that they were terrorists.[132][133] In October 2012, he wrote for a unanimous court when it found that the Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause made it unlawful for the government to prosecute Salim Hamdan under the Military Commissions Act of 2006 on charges of providing material support for terrorism.[134][135]\n\n\nIn August 2010, Kavanaugh wrote a lengthy concurrence when the *en banc* circuit refused to rehear Ghaleb Nassar Al Bihani's rejected claims that the international law of war limits the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists.[43][136] In 2014, he concurred in the judgment when the *en banc* circuit found that Ali al-Bahlul could be retroactively convicted of war crimes, provided the existing statute already made it a crime \"because it does not alter the definition of the crime, the defenses or the punishment\".[137][138] In October 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the plurality opinion when the *en banc* circuit found al-Bahlul could be convicted by a military commission even if his offenses are not internationally recognized as war crimes.[139][140]\n\n\nIn *Meshal v. Higgenbotham* (2016), Kavanaugh concurred when the divided panel threw out a claim by an American that he had been disappeared by the FBI in a Kenyan black site.[141][142]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment and gun ownership[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Kavanaugh dissented when the circuit court found that a ban on the sale of semi-automatic rifles was permissible under the Second Amendment. This case followed the landmark Supreme Court ruling *District of Columbia v. Heller* (2008).[143][144]\n\n\n\n#### Vaccine regulation[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion in *Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs v. Sebelius*,[145] holding that opponents of thimerosal-preserved vaccines lacked standing to challenge determinations by the Food and Drug Administration that vaccines and their components are safe and effective. SCOTUSblog provided the case as an example of the fact that \"[e]ven when Kavanaugh rejects a claim, he sometimes uses his discussion of standing to show that he has heard the plaintiff's argument and taken it seriously\".[146] Bloomberg wrote, \"Kavanaugh's opinion for the court repeatedly went out of its way to show it respected the Coalition for Mercury-Free Drugs's (CoMeD) 'genuine concern' regarding thimerosal\", but nevertheless \"said the coalition was required to seek a ban through the executive or legislative branches\".[147]\n\n\n\n### Law clerk hiring practices[edit]\n\n\nTwenty-five of Kavanaugh's 48 law clerks have been women, and 13 people of color.[148] Some have been children of other judges and high-profile legal figures, including Clayton Kozinski (son of former federal Judge Alex Kozinski), Porter Wilkinson (daughter of Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III), Philip Alito (son of Justice Samuel Alito), Sophia Chua-Rubenfeld (daughter of Yale Law professors Amy Chua and Jed Rubenfeld), and Emily Chertoff (daughter of former DHS secretary Michael Chertoff).[149][150]\n\n\nOn September 20, 2018, *The Guardian* reported that two Yale professors had advised female law students at Yale that their physical appearance and femininity could play a role in securing a clerkship with Kavanaugh. Rubenfeld said that Kavanaugh \"hires women with a certain look\" but did not say what that \"look\" was.[151] Unnamed sources reported that Chua said that female applicants should exude \"model-like\" femininity and \"dress outgoing\" in job interviews with Kavanaugh. Responding to the report, Chua denied that Kavanaugh's hiring decisions were affected by female applicants' attractiveness, saying, \"Judge Kavanaugh's first and only litmus test in hiring has been excellence.\"[151] Yale Law School Dean Heather Gerken announced an investigation of the matter,[152] but Yale did not find any cause for sanction. Chua returned to regular teaching in 2019.[153]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh and his family with President Donald Trump on July 9, 2018\nOn July 2, 2018, Kavanaugh was one of four U.S. Court of Appeals judges to receive a personal 45-minute interview by President Donald Trump as a potential replacement for Justice Anthony Kennedy.[154] On July 9, Trump nominated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.[155][156] In his first public speech after the nomination, Kavanaugh said, \"No president has ever consulted more widely or talked with more people from more backgrounds to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.\"[157]\n\n\n\n### Legal philosophy and approach[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on |\n| Conservatismin the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Schools\n* Compassionate\n* Fiscal\n* Fusion\n* Libertarian\n* Moderate\n* Movement\n* Neo\n* Paleo\n* Progressive\n* Social\n* Traditionalist\n |\n| Principles\n* American exceptionalism\n* Anti-communism\n* Christian nationalism\n* Classical liberalism\n* Constitutionalism\n* Familialism\n* Family values\n* Federalism\n\t+ States' rights\n* Judeo-Christian values\n* Individualism\n* Law and order\n* Limited government\n* Militarism\n* Moral absolutism\n* Natural law\n* Patriotism\n* Republicanism\n* Right to bear arms\n* Rule of law\n* Tradition\n |\n| History\n* Conservative coalition\n* Conservative Democrat\n* Conservative Manifesto\n* Loyalists\n* McCarthyism\n* Modern timeline\n* New Right\n* Old Right\n* Overview\n* Reagan Doctrine\n* Reaganomics\n* Stalwart Republicans\n* Southern Agrarians\n |\n| Intellectuals\n* Anton\n* Babbitt\n* Bell\n* Bellow\n* Bloom\n* Boorstin\n* Buckley\n* Burnham\n* Chambers\n* Conquest\n* Derbyshire\n* Dolan\n* Durant\n* Eastman\n* Eliot\n* Francis\n* George\n* Goldberg\n* Gottfried\n* Hanson\n* Hazony\n* Hoppe\n* Jaffa\n* Kimball\n* Kirk\n* Kirkpatrick\n* Kreeft\n* Kristol (Irving)\n* Kuehnelt-Leddihn\n* Laffer\n* Lasch\n* Lovecraft\n* Lukacs\n* Mansfield\n* Mencken\n* Meyer\n* Molnar\n* Murray\n* Nisbet\n* Nock\n* O'Connor\n* Ong\n* Ransom\n* Repplier\n* Santayana\n* Sowell\n* Strauss\n* Sumner\n* Viereck\n* Voegelin\n* Washington\n* Weaver\n* Yarvin\n |\n| Politicians\n* Abbott\n* Adams\n* Quincy Adams\n* Agnew\n* Buchanan\n* Bush (George H.

Wade*, which ruled abortion bans unconstitutional, and *Furman v. Georgia*, which ruled all existing death penalty statutes unconstitutional.[160][161] Two law professors evaluated Kavanaugh's appellate court decisions for the *Washington Post,* rating his decisions in four areas: rights of criminal defendants; support for rules regarding stricter enforcement of environmental protection; upholding the rights of labor unions; and siding with those bringing suits alleging discrimination. They found he had the most conservative voting record on the D.C. Circuit in three of those policy areas, and the second-most in the fourth, between 2003 and 2018.[162]\n\n\nDuring his hearing, Kavanaugh said that he had often said the four greatest moments in Supreme Court history were *Brown v. Board of Education*, *Marbury v. Madison*, *Youngstown Steel*, and *United States v. Nixon*, with *Brown* the single greatest.[163]\n\n\nAccording to the Judicial Common Space scores, a score based on the ideology scores of the home state senators and the president who nominated the judge to the federal bench, Clarence Thomas was the only justice more conservative than Kavanaugh. By this metric, Kavanaugh's confirmation shifted the court to the right.[164] Had Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland been confirmed in 2016, Stephen Breyer would have become the median swing vote when Kennedy retired. However, since Antonin Scalia was replaced by another conservative (Gorsuch), it was expected that Chief Justice John Roberts would become the median swing vote on the Supreme Court upon Kavanaugh's confirmation.[165]\n\n\n\n### Senate Judiciary Committee public hearings[edit]\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled three or four days of public hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination, commencing on September 4, 2018. The hearings were delayed at the onset by objections from the Democratic members about the absence of records of Kavanaugh's time in the George W. Bush administration. The Democrats also complained that 42,000 pages of documents had been received only the night before the first day of hearings.[166] Republicans asserted that the volume of documents available on Kavanaugh equaled that of the previous five nominees to the court; the Democrats responded that only 15% of the documents they had requested about Kavanaugh had been provided. Numerous motions by the Democrats to adjourn or suspend the hearings were ruled out of order by Chairman Chuck Grassley, who argued that Kavanaugh had written over 300 legal opinions available for review. The first day's session closed after statements from each senator and the nominee, with question-and-answer periods to begin the next day.[167]\n\n\nDuring the first round of questions from senators on September 5, 2018, Kavanaugh held to his earlier stated position that he would not express an opinion on matters that might come before the Court. He thus refused to promise to recuse himself from any case, including any that might involve Trump. He also declined to comment on coverage of preexisting healthcare conditions, semiautomatic rifle possession, *Roe v. Wade*, or the president's power to self-pardon. He expounded at length on various Constitutional amendments, stare decisis (the role of legal precedent in shaping subsequent judicial rulings), and the president's power to dismiss federal employees. As in the previous session, there were frequent outbursts of protest in the audience, requiring security intervention and removal, as well as repeated procedural objections by Democrats.[168]\n\n\nThe committee's third day of hearings began with a furor over the release of emails by Kavanaugh related to concern about potential racial profiling in security screenings. The day continued with Kavanaugh's attempts to articulate his jurisprudence, including refusing to answer direct questions about matters he called hypothetical.[169] Senator Chris Coons had tendered Kavanaugh written questions about any knowledge of inappropriate behavior on the part of judge Alex Kozinski, for whom Kavanaugh had clerked, including his circulations of sexually explicit emails via his \"Easy Rider Gag List\". According to *The Intercept*, though Coons had asked him to review his emails from Kozinski, Kavanaugh replied, \"I do not remember\".[170] During his testimony, Kavanaugh said that Kozinski's 2017 exposure as an alleged prolific sexual harasser was a surprising \"gut punch\". *The Guardian* reported that their sources disputed Kavanaugh's account because Kozinski's alleged behavior was reportedly widely known among those in the judicial system and its exposure culminated in his abrupt resignation from the bench.[171]\n\n\n\nThe committee released a 2003 email in which Kavanaugh said, \"I am not sure that all legal scholars refer to [*Roe v. Wade*] as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current justices on the Court would do so.\"[172] Kavanaugh stressed that he was commenting on the views of legal scholars at the time, not his own views, and noted that the case had been reaffirmed on a number of occasions since 2003.[173] Senator Susan Collins indicated that Kavanaugh's statement did not contradict his personal assurance to her that *Roe* is settled law.[174] Kavanaugh noted that *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992), which reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*, was \"precedent on precedent\". According to Kavanaugh, *Casey* is a key decision about when the Court's precedent may be overturned.[175]\n\n\nOn September 27, the committee held an additional day of public hearings to discuss allegations that Kavanaugh engaged in sexual misconduct while in high school. The only witnesses were Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, his accuser.[176] Republican members of the committee did not question Ford directly; questioning on their behalf was done by Rachel Mitchell, a career prosecutor from Maricopa County, Arizona.[177] Grassley cut her questioning short, after which the Republican members of the committee questioned him themselves.[178][179] Alternating with their questions, Democratic members of the committee questioned Ford and Kavanaugh.[180] Ford repeated and expanded upon her earlier allegations, saying that Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge, both \"visibly drunk\", had locked her into a bedroom, where Kavanaugh groped her and tried to take off her clothes while Judge watched. She said she \"believed he was going to rape me\" and feared for her life when he held his hand over her mouth. In his opening statement, Kavanaugh claimed the accusations were a \"political hit\" by left-wing activists and Democrats, saying he faced retaliation \"on behalf of the Clintons\" for his work on the Starr Report against Bill Clinton.[181][182][183] Leland Keyser, Ford's friend who Ford said was present during the alleged attack, has denied that it took place, and questioned certain aspects of the story. Keyser also stated she felt pressured by people to support Ford's story, something she told the FBI about.[184] In response to his testimony, more than 2,400 law professors signed a letter saying that the Senate should not confirm him because \"he did not display the impartiality and judicial temperament requisite to sit on the highest court of our land.\"[185]\n\n\n\n### Sexual assault allegations[edit]\n\n\n#### Christine Blasey Ford[edit]\n\n\nIn early July 2018, Kavanaugh's name was on a shortlist of nominees for the Supreme Court. Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University, contacted a *Washington Post* tipline and her U.S. Representative, Anna Eshoo, with accusations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were in high school.[7][186] On July 30, 2018, Ford wrote to Senator Dianne Feinstein to inform her of her accusation against Kavanaugh,[187] requesting that it be kept confidential.[188] After a September 12 report in *The Intercept*,[7][186][189] Feinstein confirmed that a complaint had been made against Kavanaugh by a woman who had requested not to be identified. Feinstein said that the woman had claimed that, when they were both in high school, Kavanaugh had tried to force himself on her while she was being physically restrained.[190][191] The same day, Feinstein said she had forwarded the woman's accusation to federal authorities.[192][193]\n\n\nOn September 16, Ford publicized her allegations and claimed Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was 15 and he was 17.[194][195] She said that in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, one of Kavanaugh's friends from Georgetown Prep, corralled her in a bedroom at a house party in Maryland and turned up the music playing in the room. According to Ford, Kavanaugh pinned her to the bed, groped her, ground against her, tried to pull off her clothes, and covered her mouth with his hand when she tried to scream.[196] Ford said she was afraid that Kavanaugh might inadvertently kill her during the attack,[197] and believed he was going to rape her.[198] Ford stated that she escaped when Judge jumped on the bed, knocking them all to the floor.[194][199]\n\n\nKavanaugh issued the following statement through the White House: \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation. I did not do this back in high school or at any time.\"[193][192] Republicans criticized the decision to withhold \"a vague, anonymous accusation for months\" before releasing it on the \"eve of [Kavanaugh's] confirmation\" as an attempt to delay his confirmation hearings.[200][201] Kavanaugh released a statement on the evening before his and Ford's scheduled testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. He said that due to the serious nature of the allegations, both he and Ford deserved to be heard. He also stated, \"I am innocent of this charge.\"[202]\n\n\nOn September 19, the Senate Judiciary Committee invited Kavanaugh and Ford to testify about the allegation. Kavanaugh agreed to testify on September 19.[203] Ford requested that the FBI investigate the matter first, but Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley declined the request, and gave Ford a deadline of September 21 to inform the committee whether she intended to testify. He added that Ford was welcome to appear before the committee privately or publicly.[204] On September 20, Ford's attorney opened negotiations with the committee to reschedule the hearing under \"terms that are fair and which ensure her safety\".[205] A bipartisan Judiciary Committee panel and Ford's representatives agreed to a hearing after September 24.[206]\n\n\nFord stated that Leland Ingham Keyser, a lifelong friend, was present at the party where the alleged assault took place. On September 22, Keyser stated through her attorney that she did not know Kavanaugh and had no memory of the party or a sexual assault. The attorney did confirm that Keyser was a friend of Ford's,[207] and Keyser told *The Washington Post* that she believed Ford's allegation.[208][209]\n\n\nOn October 4, 2018, the White House announced that it had found no corroboration of Ford's allegation after reviewing the FBI's latest probe into Kavanaugh's past.[210] Her attorneys tweeted, \"Those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth.\"[211]\n\n\nIn September 2019, *New York Times* reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin published *The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation*. They reported that Keyser \"thought the whole setup Ford described ... sounded wrong\", and that she \"challenged Ford's accuracy\", quoting Keyser as saying, \"I don't have any confidence in the story\".[212] According to *The Washington Post*, the book revealed that \"Keyser also said she spoke with many people who 'wanted me to remember something different'—suggesting that there was pressure on her to toe the line [against Kavanaugh]\".[213]\n\n\n\n#### Deborah Ramirez[edit]\n\n\nOn September 23, 2018, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of *The New Yorker* published an article with another sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh. Deborah Ramirez, who attended Yale University with Kavanaugh, alleged he exposed himself to her and thrust his penis against her face after they had both been drinking at a college party during the 1983–84 academic year. Kavanaugh said, \"This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen.\"[214] *The New Yorker* spoke to four classmates, three identified as eyewitnesses but all denied witnessing the event.[214] *The New York Times* interviewed several dozen of Ramirez's classmates in an attempt to corroborate her story, and could find no firsthand witnesses to the alleged assault, but several classmates recalled that they had heard about it in the subsequent days and believed Ramirez.[215] According to *The New York Times*, \"Ramirez herself told the press and friends that, initially, she was not absolutely certain it was Kavanaugh who assaulted her, but after corresponding with friends who had secondhand knowledge of the incident, and taking time to refresh her recollection, stated that she was certain Kavanaugh was her assailant.\"[216] *The Washington Post* analyzed Ramirez's allegation and concluded, \"Ramirez's accusation has the dual distinction of having more potential corroboration and less actual corroboration than Ford's\".[217]\n\n\n\n#### Julie Swetnick[edit]\n\n\nAttorney Michael Avenatti tweeted on September 23, 2018, that he represented a woman who had \"credible information\" about Kavanaugh and Judge. Avenatti said his client would be willing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[218][219][220] On September 26, Avenatti revealed the woman to be Julie Swetnick, a former government employee. In a sworn statement, Swetnick described attending \"well over ten house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the years 1981–1983 where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present\". She described witnessing efforts by Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Kavanaugh called her allegations \"ridiculous\" and Avenatti's allegation as a whole a \"farce\".[10] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that it had contacted \"dozens\" of her former classmates and colleagues but failed to reach anyone with knowledge of her allegations and that none of her friends had come forward publicly to support her claims.[221] In an interview with NBC News, Swetnick clarified that she did not personally witness Kavanaugh or Judge spike any drinks, and accused Avenatti of twisting her words. She further clarified that she did not personally witness efforts by Kavanaugh or Judge to cause girls to become inebriated so they could be gang raped. Swetnick provided NBC News with the names of friends who attended the parties, but none could corroborate her claims, while some said they did not know her.[222][223] Grassley referred Swetnick and Avenatti to the Justice Department for criminal investigation regarding claims that they engaged in \"conspiracy, false statements and obstruction of Congress\".[224]\n\n\n\n#### Judy Munro-Leighton[edit]\n\n\nOn September 19, Judy Munro-Leighton accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in an anonymous letter signed \"Jane Doe\", which was addressed to Grassley but mailed to Senator Kamala Harris. On September 26, the Senate committee interrogated Kavanaugh about this accusation. Kavanaugh called the accusation \"ridiculous\".[11] On November 1, Munro-Leighton talked to committee staff members. During the conversation she changed her story, denying that she had penned the anonymous letter and saying she had contacted Congress as \"a ploy\" to \"get attention\".[225] On November 2, Grassley announced Munro-Leighton's identity, and described her accusations as fabricated.[11] She was referred to the Department of Justice and FBI for making false accusations and obstructing justice.[11]\n\n\n\n#### FBI investigation and ethics complaints[edit]\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the Republican leadership of the committee indicated that they planned to hold a committee vote on the nomination the next day, September 28, with a procedural vote on the Senate floor on September 29.[226] On September 28, the committee voted along party lines to advance the nomination to the full Senate; Senator Jeff Flake's vote in support was conditioned on delaying the vote in the full Senate for a week to allow the FBI to investigate Ford's claims. Later, Senators Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski also said they would not vote to confirm without an FBI investigation.[227] On this request from the Judiciary Committee, Trump ordered a \"supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaugh's file\", to be limited in scope and completed within a week.[228] The report was transmitted to the White House on October 3 and from there to the Senate on October 4, where senators were permitted to review the report one at a time in secrecy. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote on the confirmation on October 6.[229] Democrats called the FBI investigation incomplete, a \"farce\", a \"sham\" and \"a horrific cover-up\" that omitted key witnesses at the White House's direction.[230][231] According to *The Washington Post*, the White House stopped the FBI from investigating possible falsehoods in Kavanaugh's testimony to Congress about his drinking habits during his youth.[211]\n\n\nEighty-three ethics complaints were brought against Kavanaugh regarding his conduct during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Chief Justice Roberts appointed a special federal panel of judges to investigate them. In December 2018, the panel dismissed all the complaints, calling them \"serious\" but deciding that lower court judges have no authority to investigate Supreme Court justices.[232]\n\n\n\n#### 2023 *Justice* film[edit]\n\n\nDoug Liman's 2023 documentary *Justice* recounts the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, including the testimony of Ford and Ramirez. It features a never-before-heard audio recording made by Partnership for Public Service president and CEO Max Stier, a Yale colleague of Kavanaugh's, that corroborates Ramirez's charges and suggests that Kavanaugh violated another unnamed woman. Stier says that he witnessed Kavanaugh with his pants down with a group of rowdy soccer players forcing a drunk female freshman to hold Kavanaugh's penis. Stier also says that he had heard from classmates about Ramirez's similar encounter with Kavanaugh, which she personally describes in the film.[233]\n\n\nThe documentary also highlights the narratives Kavanaugh advanced to sway public opinion and gain Republicans' support, which reviewers described as misleading. Reviewers were persuaded that Kavanaugh and his team were aware of Ford's and Ramirez's charges before they became public and preemptively countered them by planting alternate narratives with friends and acquaintances.[234][235]\n\n\n\n### Senate action[edit]\n\n\nOn October 5, the Senate voted 51–49 to invoke cloture, advancing the nomination to a final floor vote expected on October 6. This was enabled through the application of the so-called \"nuclear option\", or a simple majority vote, rather than the historical three-fifths supermajority in place before April 2017.[236] The vote was along party lines, with the exception of Democrat Joe Manchin voting yes and Republican Lisa Murkowski voting no.[237][238]\n\n\nOn October 6, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court by a 50–48 vote.[239] One senator, Republican Steve Daines, who supported the nomination, was absent during the vote due to his attendance at his daughter's wedding that day, and Murkowski voted \"present\" despite her opposition so that their votes would cancel out and the balance of the vote would be retained—a rarely used traditional courtesy known as a \"pair between senators\".[240] All Republicans except Daines and Murkowski voted to confirm Kavanaugh, and all Democrats except Joe Manchin voted not to.[241] Kavanaugh's confirmation vote was historically close. The only Supreme Court confirmation that was closer was the vote on Stanley Matthews, nominated by President James A. Garfield in 1881. Matthews was confirmed by a single vote, 24–23; no other justice has been confirmed by a single vote.[242][243][244] In *percentage* terms, Kavanaugh's vote was even closer than Matthews's. Matthews received 51.06% of the vote to Kavanaugh's 51.02%.[245]\n\n\n\n### Swearing-in[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th justice of the Supreme Court on the evening of October 6, 2018.[246] The Constitutional Oath was administered by Chief Justice Roberts and the Judicial Oath was administered by Kennedy, whom Kavanaugh succeeded on the Court. This private ceremony was followed by a public ceremony at the White House on October 8.[15][247][248] Upon joining the Court, Kavanaugh became the first Supreme Court justice to hire an all-female team of law clerks.[249][250]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2018–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kavanaugh being sworn in to succeed Anthony Kennedy as an associate justice on October 8, 2018\nKavanaugh began his tenure as Supreme Court justice on October 9, 2018, hearing arguments for *Stokeling v. United States* and *United States v. Stitt*.[251]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Kavanaugh was reassigned to both the Sixth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit.[252] He had previously been assigned to the Seventh Circuit, which covers federal courts in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.[253] Circuit justices are principally responsible for responding to emergency requests (for example, applications for emergency stays of executions)[254] that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by the assigned justice alone or else by the justice's referring them to the full Court for review.\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh wrote his first Supreme Court opinion on January 8, 2019, in *Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc.*, a unanimous decision reversing an appeals court opinion that had allowed a court to decide whether an issue in a contract between a dental equipment manufacturer and distributor should be decided by arbitration.[255]\n\n\nOn February 27, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the court's liberal justices in *Garza v. Idaho*, a case in which the Court held that the Sixth Amendment's presumption of prejudice resulting from ineffective assistance of counsel applies to situations in which an attorney declines to file an appeal because an appeal waiver was signed as part of a plea agreement.[256]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, as a swing vote, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four more liberal justices to decline to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas, which sought to block women from choosing to receive Medicaid-funded medical care from Planned Parenthood clinics. Two lower appeals courts had ruled that the federal law creating Medicaid protects patients' rights to choose any provider which is \"qualified to perform\" the needed services.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Kavanaugh joined three of his conservative colleagues in voting to reject a stay of a Louisiana law to restrict abortion.[258] He issued his own dissenting opinion.[259] *CNBC* reported that \"Kavanaugh agreed [with three conservative justices], but wrote separately that he would be open to reconsidering the legality of the law if the dire warnings from abortion rights groups materialized.\"[260] The Supreme Court decided this case, *June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo*, on June 29, 2020, striking down Louisiana's requirement for abortion providers to hold hospital admitting privileges. Kavanaugh dissented.[261] In September 2021, by a 5–4 vote, the Court declined an emergency petition to temporarily block enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans nearly all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Kavanaugh was in the majority, joined by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett.[262] In June 2022, in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, Kavanaugh joined the same four justices in voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[263]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nAlso in February, Kavanaugh was part of the majority in decisions relating to the death penalty. On February 7, 2019, he was part of the majority in a 5–4 decision rejecting a Muslim prisoner's request to delay his execution in order to have an imam present.[264] On February 19, 2019, Kavanaugh joined Roberts and the Court's four liberal justices in a 6–3 decision blocking the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[265][266] In January 2022, he voted with the majority in a 5–4 decision to allow an execution to proceed in Alabama.[267] In 2023 Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion in *Reed v. Goertz*, ruling that Texas death row inmate Rodney Reed could seek DNA testing on evidence in his case despite the state's statute of limitations on such testing.[268]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2020, in *Bostock v. Clayton County*, the Supreme Court ruled 6–3 that the workplace nondiscrimination protections in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should be interpreted as protecting people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Kavanaugh wrote a dissent in which he argued that sexual orientation discrimination has always been understood as distinct from sex discrimination. He conceded that sexual orientation discrimination \"may, as a very literal matter, entail making a distinction based on sex\"; nonetheless, he said, \"to fire one employee because she is a woman and another employee because he is gay implicates two distinct societal concerns, reveals two distinct biases, imposes two distinct harms, and falls within two distinct statutory prohibitions.\" He said that any change to the relevant law ought to be made by Congress, not by judges; and that \"both the rule of law and democratic accountability badly suffer when a court adopts a hidden or obscure interpretation of the law, and not its ordinary meaning.\"[269] Kavanaugh's dissent did not discuss gender identity or use the word \"transgender\", although transgender rights were at issue in the case. In a footnote, he wrote that his analysis \"on the basis of sexual orientation would apply in much the same way to discrimination on the basis of gender identity.\"[270] In October 2020, Kavanaugh agreed with the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to deny an appeal brought by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[271]\n\n\nIn 2021, Kavanaugh joined the majority opinion in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic adoption and social service agency that had been denied funding by the City of Philadelphia because it does not place children for adoption with same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices\".[272] The same month, Kavanaugh was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist, whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower courts' judgments in place.[273][274][275] In November 2021, Kavanaugh voted with the majority of justices in a 6–3 decision to decline to hear an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[276] Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented; because four votes are required to hear an appeal, the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[277][278]\n\n\n\n### President Trump's taxes[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2020, in *Trump v. Vance*, the Supreme Court ruled in two 7–2 decisions that the Manhattan District Attorney could access Trump's tax records, but that the issue of whether Congress could access the same records needed to be processed through the lower courts. Kavanaugh joined Roberts, Gorsuch, and the court's four Democratic appointees in the majority;[279] Justices Thomas and Alito dissented.[280] The rulings mean that the Manhattan DA will have access to the records while Congress does not, pending the outcome of the case in lower courts.[281]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nEight days before the 2020 presidential election Kavanaugh concurred that absentee votes properly cast in Wisconsin but received after November 3 must be discarded, joining the Court's conservatives in a ruling that requires deferral to state officials on elections.[282][283] On October 19, Kavanaugh voted to grant a request for a stay that would have prevented ballots sent before Election Day but delivered within three days after it from being counted. The Court was split 4–4, so the ruling by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania requiring all votes to be counted stood, but the case may be reheard.[284] Kavanaugh sided with Roberts and three liberal justices in a 5-3 majority to allow voting extension in North Carolina.[285]\n\n\n\n### Compensation of college athletes[edit]\n\n\nIn his concurrence in *National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston* in June 2021, in which the Court ruled unanimously that college sports were not exempt from antitrust law, Kavanaugh called the NCAA \"a massive money-raising enterprise on the backs of student athletes who are not fairly compensated.\" No one else, he said, could \"not ... pay workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate.\" He said there were \"serious questions\" about other rules on compensation.[286]\n\n\n\n### Attempted assassination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brett Kavanaugh assassination plot\n\nIn the early morning of June 8, 2022, Nicholas John Roske traveled from California to Kavanaugh's home in Maryland with plans to break into the home, murder Kavanaugh, and commit suicide.[18][287] After seeing two U.S. Marshals outside Kavanaugh's home, Roske turned himself in by calling 9-1-1. He said his attempt to murder Kavanaugh stemmed from dissatisfaction with the Supreme Court's leaked draft opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, as well as the potential for the Court to loosen gun control laws under the Second Amendment. Roske was armed with a pistol, two magazines and ammunition, pepper spray, zip ties, a hammer, a screwdriver, a nail punch, a crowbar, a pistol light, duct tape, and other items. He has been charged with attempted murder.[18]\n\n\n\n## Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nKavanaugh taught full-term courses on separation of powers at Harvard Law School from 2008 to 2015, on the Supreme Court at Harvard Law School between 2014 and 2018, on National Security and Foreign Relations Law at Yale Law School in 2011, and on Constitutional Interpretation at Georgetown University Law Center in 2007. He was named the Samuel Williston Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School in 2009.[288] In 2008, Kavanaugh was hired as a visiting professor by Elena Kagan, then the dean of Harvard Law School. According to *The Boston Globe*, he was generous with his time and accessible, and quickly became a student favorite. He often dined in Cambridge with students and offered references and career advice.[289][290] Kavanaugh received high evaluations from his students, including J. D. Vance.[291] After the allegations of sexual misconduct against him, Harvard Law School graduates[*which?*] petitioned Harvard to rescind Kavanaugh's position as a lecturer.[*citation needed*] Shortly thereafter, Kavanaugh voluntarily withdrew from teaching at Harvard for the 2019 winter semester.[292] In the summer of 2019, he joined the faculty of George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School as a visiting professor, co-teaching a summer course in Runnymede, England, on the origins and creation of the United States Constitution.[293]\n\n\nIn 2009, Kavanaugh wrote an article for the *Minnesota Law Review* in which he argued that Congress should exempt U.S. presidents from civil lawsuits while in office[294] because, among other things, such lawsuits could be \"time-consuming and distracting\" for the president and would thus \"ill serve the public interest, especially in times of financial or national security crisis\".[295] Kavanaugh argued that if a president \"does something dastardly\", they may be impeached by the House of Representatives, convicted by the Senate, and criminally prosecuted after leaving office.[294] He asserted that the U.S. would have been better off if President Clinton could have \"focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots\".[294] This article garnered attention in 2018 when Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court by Trump, whose 2016 presidential campaign was at the time the subject of a federal probe by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.[295]\n\n\nWhen reviewing a book on statutory interpretation by Second Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann, Kavanaugh observed that judges often cannot agree on a statute if its text is ambiguous.[296] To remedy this, he encouraged judges to first seek the \"best reading\" of the statute, through \"interpreting the words of the statute\" as well as the context of the statute as a whole, and only then apply other interpretive techniques that may justify an interpretation that differs from the \"best meaning\", such as constitutional avoidance, legislative history, and Chevron deference.[296]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Kavanaugh family with President Bush\nKavanaugh and Ashley Estes, the personal secretary to former President George W. Bush,[297] married in 2004; the couple have two daughters.[298] They live in Chevy Chase Section Five, Maryland.[40]\n\n\nKavanaugh ran the Boston Marathon in 2010 and 2015.[299] His bibs bore non-qualifying numbers, assigned for a charity or a \"guest\" rather than an age-based time qualifier.[300] He also has completed many shorter races, from 5 km to 10 miles.[301][302]\n\n\nKavanaugh is a Roman Catholic[297] and serves as a regular lector at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament at Hanceville, Alabama. He has helped serve meals to the homeless as part of church programs, and has tutored at the Washington Jesuit Academy, a Catholic private school in the District of Columbia.[297][303]\n\n\nAt his May 2006 confirmation hearing to the District of Columbia Circuit, he stated that he was a registered Republican.[1] In 2018, Kavanaugh's reported salary was $220,600 as a federal judge and $27,000 as a lecturer at Harvard Law School.[304]\n\n\nIn 2022, Kavanaugh's home was the site of protests following the leak of a draft majority opinion for the Supreme Court case *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.*[305][306]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Kavanaugh, Brett (1989). \"Note: Defense Presence and Participation: A Procedural Minimum for Batson v.

Barrett was a U.S. circuit judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from 2017 to 2020.\n\n\nBarrett graduated from Rhodes College before attending Notre Dame Law School, earning a J.D. with distinction in 1997. She then clerked for Judge Laurence Silberman and Justice Antonin Scalia. In 2002, Barrett joined the faculty at Notre Dame Law School, becoming a professor in 2010. While serving on the federal bench, she has continued to teach civil procedure, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nOn September 26, 2020, Trump nominated Barrett to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court of the United States.[6][7][8] Her nomination was controversial because the 2020 presidential election was only 38 days away and Senate Republicans had refused to hold hearings for Merrick Garland during an election year in 2016.[9] The next month, the U.S. Senate voted 52–48 to confirm her nomination, with all Democrats and one Republican in opposition.[10]\n\n\nDescribed as a protégée of Justice Antonin Scalia,[11][12][13] Barrett supports textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in constitutional interpretation.[14][15][16] She is generally considered to be among the Court's conservative bloc.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAmy Vivian Coney was born in 1972 in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Linda (*née* Vath) and Michael Coney.[17][18] The eldest of seven children, she has five sisters and a brother. Her father worked as an attorney for Shell Oil Company, and her mother was a high school French teacher and homemaker. Barrett has Irish and French ancestry.[19][20] Her maternal ancestors were from Ballyconnell, County Cavan, Ireland, while there is also Irish lineage among her father's ancestors. Her great-great-grandparents emigrated from France to New Orleans.[21] Her family is devoutly Catholic, and her father is an ordained deacon at St. Catherine of Siena Parish in Metairie, Louisiana, where she grew up.[22][23]\n\n\nBarrett attended St. Mary's Dominican High School, an all-girls Roman Catholic high school in New Orleans.[24] She was student body vice president of the school and graduated in 1990.[25] After high school, Barrett attended Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, where she majored in English literature and minored in French. She considers herself \"somewhat fluent\" in French, but with a Louisiana accent.[26] Barrett graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*, and was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa and Phi Beta Kappa.[27] In her graduating class, she was named most outstanding English department graduate.[28]\n\n\nBarrett then attended Notre Dame Law School on a full-tuition scholarship. She was an executive editor of the *Notre Dame Law Review* and graduated in 1997 ranked first in her class with a Juris Doctor, *summa cum laude*.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Clerkships and private practice[edit]\n\n\nBarrett spent two years as a judicial law clerk after law school, first for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1997 to 1998, and then for Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1998 to 1999.[30]\n\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Barrett practiced law at Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin, a boutique law firm for litigation in Washington, D.C., that merged with the Houston, Texas-based law firm Baker Botts in 2001.[29][31] While at Baker Botts, she worked on *Bush v. Gore*, the lawsuit that grew out of the 2000 United States presidential election, providing research and briefing assistance for the firm's representation of George W. Bush.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Barrett was a visiting associate professor and John M. Olin Fellow in Law at George Washington University Law School. In 2002, she joined the faculty of her alma mater, Notre Dame Law School.[34] At Notre Dame, she taught federal courts, evidence, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation. In 2007, she was a visiting professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.[35] Barrett was named a professor of law at Notre Dame in 2010, and from 2014 to 2017 held Notre Dame's Diane and M.O. Miller II Research Chair of Law.[36] Her scholarship focused on constitutional law, originalism, statutory interpretation, and *stare decisis*.[28] Her academic work has been published in the *Columbia*, *Cornell*, *Virginia*, *Notre Dame*, and *Texas* law reviews.[34]\n\n\nAt Notre Dame, Barrett received the \"Distinguished Professor of the Year\" award three times.[34] From 2011 to 2016, she spoke on constitutional law at Blackstone Legal Fellowship, a summer program for law school students that the Alliance Defending Freedom established to inspire a \"distinctly Christian worldview in every area of law\".[37] While serving on the Seventh Circuit, Barrett commuted between Chicago and South Bend, continuing to teach courses on statutory interpretation and constitutional theory.[38][39]\n\n\nIn 2010, Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Barrett to serve on the Advisory Committee for the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.[34]\n\n\n\n## Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (2017–2020)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nFile:Prof Amy Coney Barrett 2 10.jpgBarrett before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 6, 2017\nOn May 8, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit—the federal appellate court covering Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin—after Judge John Daniel Tinder took senior status.[5][40] A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on her nomination was held on September 6, 2017.[41] During the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein questioned Barrett about a law review article Barrett co-wrote in 1998 with Professor John H. Garvey in which they argued that Catholic judges should in some cases recuse themselves from death penalty cases due to their moral objections to the death penalty.[42] Asked to \"elaborate on the statements and discuss how you view the issue of faith versus fulfilling the responsibility as a judge today,\" Barrett said that she had participated in many death-penalty appeals while serving as law clerk to Scalia, adding, \"My personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge\"[43][44] and \"It is never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law.\"[45] Barrett emphasized that the article was written in her third year in law school and that she was \"very much the junior partner in our collaboration.\"[46] Worried that Barrett would not uphold *Roe v. Wade* given her Catholic beliefs, Feinstein followed Barrett's response by saying, \"the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is a concern.\"[47][48][49]\n\n\nThe hearing made Barrett popular with religious conservatives.[29] Feinstein's and other senators' questioning was criticized by some Republicans and other observers, such as university presidents John I. Jenkins of the University of Notre Dame and Christopher Eisgruber of Princeton, as an improper inquiry into a nominee's religious belief that employed an unconstitutional \"religious test\" for office;[45][50] others, such as Nan Aron, defended Feinstein's line of questioning.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Judge Laurence Silberman, for whom Barrett first clerked after law school, swearing her in at her investiture for the Seventh Circuit in 2018\nLambda Legal, an LGBT civil rights organization, co-signed a letter with 26 other gay rights organizations opposing Barrett's nomination. The letter expressed doubts about her ability to separate faith from her rulings on LGBT matters.[52][53] During her Senate hearing, Barrett was questioned about landmark LGBTQ legal precedents such as *Obergefell v. Hodges*, *United States v. Windsor*, and *Lawrence v. Texas*. She said these cases are \"binding precedents\" that she intended to \"faithfully follow if confirmed\" to the appeals court, as required by law.[52] The letter Lambda Legal co-signed read, \"Simply repeating that she would be bound by Supreme Court precedent does not illuminate—indeed, it obfuscates—how Professor Barrett would interpret and apply precedent when faced with the sorts of dilemmas that, in her view, 'put Catholic judges in a bind.'\"[52]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was supported by every law clerk she had worked with and all of her 49 faculty colleagues at Notre Dame Law school. 450 former students signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee supporting her nomination.[54][55]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11–9 on party lines to recommend Barrett and report her nomination to the full Senate.[56][57] On October 30, the Senate invoked cloture by a vote of 54–42.[58] It confirmed her by a vote of 55–43 on October 31, with three Democrats—Joe Donnelly, Tim Kaine, and Joe Manchin—voting for her.[27] She received her commission two days later.[2] Barrett is the first and only woman to occupy an Indiana seat on the Seventh Circuit.[59]\n\n\n\n### Selected cases[edit]\n\n\nOral arguments from *Cook County, Illinois v. Chad F. Wolf*, one of the last cases that Barrett took in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020\nOn the Seventh Circuit, Barrett wrote 79 majority opinions (including two that were amended and one that was withdrawn on rehearing), four concurring opinions (one a per curiam opinion), and six dissenting opinions (six published and one in an unpublished order).[35]\n\n\n\n#### Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, the court, in a unanimous decision written by Barrett, reinstated a suit brought by a male Purdue University student (John Doe) who had been found guilty of sexual assault by Purdue University, which resulted in a one-year suspension, loss of his Navy ROTC scholarship, and expulsion from the ROTC affecting his ability to pursue his chosen career in the Navy.[60][61] Doe alleged the school's Advisory Committee on Equity discriminated against him on the basis of his sex and violated his rights to due process by not interviewing the alleged victim, not allowing him to present evidence in his defense, including an erroneous statement that he confessed to some of the alleged assault, and appearing to believe the victim instead of the accused without hearing from either party or having even read the investigation report. The court found that Doe had adequately alleged that the university deprived him of his occupational liberty without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and had violated his Title IX rights \"by imposing a punishment infected by sex bias\", and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.[62][63]\n\n\n\n#### Employment discrimination[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, the Seventh Circuit rejected the federal government's appeal in a civil lawsuit against AutoZone; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argued that AutoZone's assignment of employees to different stores based on race (e.g., \"sending African American employees to stores in heavily African American neighborhoods\") violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Following this, Barrett joined the court as it received a petition for rehearing *en banc*. Three judges—Chief Judge Diane Wood and judges Ilana Rovner and David Hamilton—voted to grant rehearing, and criticized the three-judge panel's opinion as upholding a \"separate-but-equal arrangement\". Barrett did not join the panel opinion, but voted with four judges to deny the petition to rehear the case. The petition was unsuccessful by a 5–3 decision.[64][29]\n\n\nIn 2019, Barrett wrote the unanimous three-judge panel opinion affirming summary judgment in the case of *Smith v. Illinois Department of Transportation*. Smith was a Black employee who claimed racial discrimination upon his dismissal by the department and that he was called a \"stupid-ass nigger\" by a Black supervisor; the department claimed Smith failed work-level expectations during probationary periods. Barrett wrote that usage of the racial slur was egregious, but Smith's testimony showed no evidence that his subjective experience of the workplace changed because of the slur, nor did it change the department's fact that his discharge was related to \"poor performance\".[65][66]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Barrett wrote a 40-page dissent when the majority upheld a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's controversial \"public charge rule\", which heightened the standard for obtaining a green card.[67] In her dissent, she argued that any noncitizens who disenrolled from government benefits because of the rule did so due to confusion about the rule itself rather than from its application, writing that the vast majority of the people subject to the rule are not eligible for government benefits in the first place. On the merits, Barrett departed from her colleagues Wood and Rovner, who held that DHS's interpretation of that provision was unreasonable under *Chevron* Step Two. Barrett would have held that the new rule fell within the broad scope of discretion granted to the Executive by Congress through the Immigration and Nationality Act.[68] The public charge issue is the subject of a circuit split.[68][69]\n\n\nIn May 2019, the court rejected a Yemeni citizen and her U.S. citizen husband's challenge to a consular officer's decision to twice deny her visa application under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The U.S. citizen argued that this had deprived him of a constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse.[70] In a 2–1 majority opinion authored by Barrett, the court held that the plaintiff's claim was properly dismissed under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. Barrett declined to address whether the husband had been denied a constitutional right (or whether the constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse existed at all) because the consular officer's decision to deny the visa application was facially legitimate and bona fide, and under Supreme Court precedent, in such a case courts will not \"look behind the exercise of that discretion\". The dispute concerned what it takes to satisfy this standard. A petition for rehearing *en banc* was denied, with Chief Judge Wood, joined by Rovner and Hamilton, dissenting. Barrett wrote a rare opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing *en banc* (joined by Judge Joel Flaum).[70][71]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion-related cases[edit]\n\n\nBarrett had never ruled directly on abortion before joining the Supreme Court, but she did vote to rehear a successful challenge to Indiana's parental notification law in 2019. In 2018, she voted against striking down another Indiana law requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains. In both cases, Barrett voted with the minority. The Supreme Court later reinstated the fetal remains law, and in July 2020 it ordered a rehearing in the parental notification case.[72][73]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision upholding a Chicago \"bubble ordinance\" that prohibits approaching within a certain distance of an abortion clinic or its patrons without consent.[74][75] Citing the Supreme Court's buffer zone decision in *Hill v. Colorado*, the court rejected the plaintiffs' challenge to the ordinance on First Amendment grounds.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Barrett dissented when the court upheld the federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms.[77] The majority rejected the as-applied challenge raised by plaintiff Rickey Kanter, who had been convicted of felony mail fraud, and upheld the felony dispossession statute as \"substantially related to an important government interest in preventing gun violence.\" In her dissent, Barrett argued that while the government has a legitimate interest in denying gun possession to felons convicted of violent crimes, there is no evidence that denying guns to nonviolent felons promotes this interest, and that the law violates the Second Amendment.[78] President Trump pardoned Kanter in December 2020.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Criminal procedure[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Barrett dissented when the panel majority found that an accused murderer's right to counsel was violated when the state trial judge directly questioned the accused while forbidding his attorney from speaking.[80] Following rehearing *en banc*, a majority of the circuit's judges agreed with her position.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it determined that the police had lacked probable cause to search a vehicle based solely upon an anonymous tip that people were \"playing with guns\", because no crime had been alleged.[82] Barrett distinguished *Navarette v. California* and wrote, \"the police were right to respond to the anonymous call by coming to the parking lot to determine what was happening. But determining what was happening and immediately seizing people upon arrival are two different things, and the latter was premature...Watson's case presents a close call. But this one falls on the wrong side of the Fourth Amendment.\"[83]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it found that police officers had been unreasonable to assume \"that a woman who answers the door in a bathrobe has authority to consent to a search of a male suspect's residence.\" Therefore, the district court should have granted the defendant's motion to suppress evidence found in the residence as the fruit of an unconstitutional search.[84][85]\n\n\n\n#### Qualified immunity[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it denied qualified immunity to a civil lawsuit sought by a defendant who as a homicide detective had knowingly provided false and misleading information in the probable cause affidavit that was used to obtain an arrest warrant for the plaintiff.[86] (The charges were later dropped and the plaintiff was released.) The court found the defendant's lies and omissions violated \"clearly established law\" and the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights and thus the detective was not shielded by qualified immunity.[87]\n\n\nIn *Howard v. Koeller* (7th Cir. 2018), in an unsigned order by a three-judge panel that included Barrett, the court found that qualified immunity did not protect a prison officer who had labeled a prisoner a \"snitch\" and thereby exposed him to risk from his fellow inmates.[88][89]\n\n\n\n#### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Orchard Hill Building Co. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers*, 893 F.3d 1017 (7th Cir. 2018), Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision, written by Judge Amy J. St. Eve, in a case brought by a property developer challenging the Corps' determination that a wetland 11 mi (18 km) from the nearest navigable river was among the \"waters of the United States.\"[90] The court found that the Corps had not provided substantial evidence of a significant nexus to navigable‐in‐fact waters under Justice Kennedy's concurrence in the Supreme Court's decision in *Rapanos v. United States*. The case was remanded to the Corps to reconsider whether such a significant nexus exists between the wetlands in question and navigable waters for it to maintain jurisdiction over the land.[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### Consumer protection[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that a plaintiff could not sue Teva Pharmaceuticals for alleged defects in her IUD due to the lack of supportive expert testimony, writing, \"the issue of causation in her case is not obvious.\"[93][94][95]\n\n\n\n#### Coronavirus measures[edit]\n\n\nIn early September 2020, Barrett joined Wood's opinion upholding the district court's denial of the Illinois Republican Party's request for a preliminary injunction to block Governor J. B. Pritzker's COVID-19 orders.[30][96] On August 12, 2021, she rejected a challenge to Indiana University's vaccine mandate, marking the first legal test of COVID-19 vaccine mandates before the Supreme Court.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Civil procedure and standing[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act cannot create a cause of action for a debtor who received collection letters lacking notices required by the statute because she suffered no injury-in-fact to create constitutional standing to sue under Article III.[98] Wood dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc. The issue created a circuit split.[99][100][101]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it held that a Teamsters local did not have standing to appeal an order in the *Shakman* case because it was not formally a party to the case.[102] The union had not intervened in the action, but rather merely submitted a memorandum in the district court opposing a motion, which the Seventh Circuit determined was insufficient to give the union a right to appeal.[103]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the Supreme Court on September 26, 2020\nBarrett was on Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees since 2017, almost immediately after her court of appeals confirmation.[104] In July 2018, after Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement announcement, she was reportedly one of three finalists Trump considered, along with Kavanaugh and Judge Raymond Kethledge.[36][105][106]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh's selection in 2018, Barrett was viewed as a possible nominee for a future U.S. Supreme Court vacancy.[107] After the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on September 18, 2020, Barrett was widely mentioned as the front-runner to succeed her.[108] On September 26, 2020, Trump announced his intention to nominate Barrett to fill the vacancy created by Ginsburg's death.[7][109]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was generally supported by Republicans, who sought to confirm her before the 2020 United States presidential election.[110] She was a favorite among the Christian right and social conservatives.[72][111][112] Democrats generally opposed the nomination, and were opposed to filling the court vacancy while election voting was already underway in many states.[110] Many observers were angered by the move to fill the vacancy only four months before the end of Trump's term, as the Senate Republican majority had refused to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016, more than ten months before the end of his presidency.[110][113][114]\n\n\nIn October, the American Bar Association rated Barrett \"well qualified\" for the Supreme Court opening, its highest rating.[115] The ABA confines its evaluation to the qualities of \"integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament\".[116] Barrett's nomination came during a White House COVID-19 outbreak. On October 5, Senator Lindsey Graham formally scheduled the confirmation hearing,[117] which began on October 12 as planned and lasted four days.[118][119] On October 22, the Judiciary Committee reported her confirmation favorably by a 12–0 vote, with all 10 Democrats boycotting the committee meeting.[120][121] On October 25, the Senate voted mostly along party lines to end debate on the confirmation.[122] On October 26, the Senate confirmed Barrett to the Supreme Court by a vote of 52–48, 30 days after her nomination and 8 days before the 2020 presidential election. Every Republican senator except Susan Collins voted to confirm her, whereas every member of the Senate Democratic Caucus[123] voted in opposition.[124] Barrett is the first justice since 1870 to be confirmed without a single vote from the Senate minority party.[125][126]\n\n\nThe nature of her appointment was criticized by numerous Democratic politicians; Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called it \"the most illegitimate process I have ever witnessed in the Senate.\"[127] Republicans responded that they were merely exercising their constitutional rights, and that accusations of hypocrisy were nothing more than \"an unwarranted tantrum from the left\".[127]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2020–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Clarence Thomas administers the oath of office to Barrett on October 26, 2020, at the White House alongside President Donald Trump\n![](image)Chief Justice John Roberts administers the judicial oath to Barrett on October 27, 2020. Justice Barrett's husband, Jesse M. Barrett, holds the Bible.\nBarrett became the 103rd associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States on October 27, 2020. On the evening of the confirmation vote, Trump hosted a swearing-in ceremony at the White House. As Barrett requested, Justice Clarence Thomas administered the oath of office to her,[126][128][129] the first of two necessary oaths. She took the judicial oath, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, the next day.[130]\n\n\nUpon joining the Court, Barrett became the only justice who did not receive their Juris Doctor from Harvard or Yale.[131] She is also the first justice without an Ivy League degree since the 2010 retirement of John Paul Stevens (who graduated from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University School of Law) and the first to be appointed since Sandra Day O'Connor, who graduated from Stanford University and Stanford Law School.[132] She is the first graduate of Notre Dame Law School and the first former member of the Notre Dame faculty to serve on the Supreme Court.[133]\n\n\nBarrett uses her maiden and married surnames in public. She has chosen to be called \"Justice Barrett\" in written orders and opinions of the court,[134] as she did as a Seventh Circuit judge.[135]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Barrett was assigned to the Seventh Circuit.[136] This assignment's duties include responding to emergency applications to the Court that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by herself or else by referring them to the full Court for review.[136][137]\n\n\n\n### Early oral argument participation[edit]\n\n\nHaving hired her allotted four law clerks, Barrett took part in her first oral argument on November 2, hearing the case *U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club.*[138][139]\n\n\nOn November 4, the Court heard *Fulton v. Philadelphia*, in which the plaintiff, Catholic Social Services, sued the city of Philadelphia after being denied a new contract under the city's Fair Practices Ordinance, which bars discrimination in public accommodations. The Archdiocese-affiliated CSS said that for religious reasons it cannot properly vet potential foster parents who are gay couples. CSS argued that under relevant precedent, the Court should find that CSS as a faith-based charity was unfairly singled out, given that the city allows race- and disability-based exceptions within foster-care placements.[140][141] CSS further claimed the law is shown not to be neutral as required by the Court's 1990 decision *Employment Division v. Smith*, which allows the government to enforce neutral and generally applicable laws without having to make exceptions for individual religions, because the city labeled CSS's motives \"discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom.\"[141][142] According to the *New York Times,* Barrett's questions during oral arguments were \"evenhanded and did not reveal her position.\"[143]\n\n\n\n### First votes as a justice[edit]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Barrett joined the Supreme Court's majority in *Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*,[144] 592 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2020), in an unsigned[145] 5–4 preliminary injunction in favor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Orthodox Jewish organization Agudath Israel of America, saying that certain COVID-19 restrictions instituted by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had likely violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, in that they \"single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment.\"[146][147][148][149] The Court said that the restrictions had likely impinged on the fundamental right of the free exercise of religion without their (in constitutional legal parlance) passing the legal test of \"strict scrutiny.\"[150] Cuomo's order was more restrictive than governmental orders involved in similar cases involving churches in California and Nevada that the Court had allowed to stand by a 5–4 vote.[151][152][153] Ross Guberman, author of *Point Taken: How to Write Like the World's Best Judges*, told the *Times* he believed Barrett was the principal author of the Court's decision because of its measured tone and word choices, including its use of the word \"show\".[154]\n\n\nBarrett delivered her first concurring opinion on February 5, 2021, in the case *South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom*.[155][156]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Barrett joined the majority, in a 5–4 vote, to reject a petition to temporarily block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh joined her in the majority.[157]\nIn June 2022, Barrett joined with the same majority in *Dobbs v. Jackson*, voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[158]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2022, the Supreme Court voted to allow the execution of an inmate to proceed in Alabama; the case was decided by a 5–4 vote, with Barrett joining Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in dissent.[159]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote her first majority opinion in *United States Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club*, which was decided on March 4, 2021.[155][160][161] Traditionally the first opinion delivered by a new justice reflects the opinion of a unanimous court, but not always. While Gorsuch and Kavanaugh wrote unanimous first opinions, Barrett, like her predecessor Justice Ginsburg, wrote an opinion for a divided court.[155][162][163]\n\n\nAlthough Barrett ruled against environmentalists in March, she voted against oil refineries in her first dissent, *Hollyfrontier Cheyenne Refining v. Renewable Fuels Association*.[164]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights and issues[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Barrett joined a unanimous decision in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic social service agency that had been denied funding from the City of Philadelphia because it does not adopt to same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[165] In the same month, Barrett was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower court judgments in place.[166][167][168] In November 2021, Barrett voted with the majority in a 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[169] The Court's decision not to hear the case left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the transgender patient; Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented.[170][171]\n\n\n\n### Vaccine requirements[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote a concurring opinion in *Does v. Mills,* a case challenging Maine's vaccine requirement for health care workers. She was in the majority in the 6–3 decision to deny a stay of the vaccine requirement, explaining that the case had not been fully briefed or argued.*[172]*\n\n\n\n## Judicial philosophy, academic writings, speeches, and political views[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on |\n| Conservatismin the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Schools\n* Compassionate\n* Fiscal\n* Fusion\n* Libertarian\n* Moderate\n* Movement\n* Neo\n* Paleo\n* Progressive\n* Social\n* Traditionalist\n |\n| Principles\n* American exceptionalism\n* Anti-communism\n* Christian nationalism\n* Classical liberalism\n* Constitutionalism\n* Familialism\n* Family values\n* Federalism\n\t+ States' rights\n* Judeo-Christian values\n* Individualism\n* Law and order\n* Limited government\n* Militarism\n* Moral absolutism\n* Natural law\n* Patriotism\n* Republicanism\n* Right to bear arms\n* Rule of law\n* Tradition\n |\n| History\n* Conservative coalition\n* Conservative Democrat\n* Conservative Manifesto\n* Loyalists\n* McCarthyism\n* Modern timeline\n* New Right\n* Old Right\n* Overview\n* Reagan Doctrine\n* Reaganomics\n* Stalwart Republicans\n* Southern Agrarians\n |\n| Intellectuals\n* Anton\n* Babbitt\n* Bell\n* Bellow\n* Bloom\n* Boorstin\n* Buckley\n* Burnham\n* Chambers\n* Conquest\n* Derbyshire\n* Dolan\n* Durant\n* Eastman\n* Eliot\n* Francis\n* George\n* Goldberg\n* Gottfried\n* Hanson\n* Hazony\n* Hoppe\n* Jaffa\n* Kimball\n* Kirk\n* Kirkpatrick\n* Kreeft\n* Kristol (Irving)\n* Kuehnelt-Leddihn\n* Laffer\n* Lasch\n* Lovecraft\n* Lukacs\n* Mansfield\n* Mencken\n* Meyer\n* Molnar\n* Murray\n* Nisbet\n* Nock\n* O'Connor\n* Ong\n* Ransom\n* Repplier\n* Santayana\n* Sowell\n* Strauss\n* Sumner\n* Viereck\n* Voegelin\n* Washington\n* Weaver\n* Yarvin\n |\n| Politicians\n* Abbott\n* Adams\n* Quincy Adams\n* Agnew\n* Buchanan\n* Bush (George H.

Jay Schweikert, who advocates for the Court's or Congress's elimination of qualified immunity,[176] believes that her \"decisions all look like reasonable applications of existing precedent.\"[175][177] Legal commentator Jacob Sullum argues that while Barrett was on the Seventh Circuit she took \"a constrained view of the doctrine's scope.\"[178]\n\n\n\n### Textualism and originalism[edit]\n\n\nBarrett is considered a textualist, a proponent of the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering their legislative history or underlying purpose,[179][180][181][182] and an originalist (of the original-public-meaning, rather than original-intent, variety), a proponent of the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment.[179][183][184][185] According to her, \"Originalism is characterized by a commitment to two core principles. First, the meaning of the constitutional text is fixed at the time of its ratification. Second, the historical meaning of the text 'has legal significance and is authoritative in most circumstances.'\"[183] For the purpose of \"describing the disagreement between originalists and nonoriginalists about the authoritativeness of the original public meaning,\" she refers[183] to a section of a law review article by Keith Whittington, \"Originalism: A Critical Introduction\",[186] that reads, \"Critics of originalism have suggested a range of considerations that might trump original meaning if the two were to come into conflict. From this perspective, fidelity to original meaning is not the chief goal of constitutional theory. ...Confronted with suitably unpleasant results, the nonoriginalist might posit that the original meaning should be sacrificed. Alternatively, we might think that contemporary public opinion should trump original meaning. ...Underlying all these considerations is a view that courts are authorized to impose constitutional rules other than those adopted by the constitutional drafters. ...the originalist must insist that judges not close their eyes to the discoverable meaning of the Constitution and announce some other constitutional rule to supersede it. It is at that point that the originalist and the nonoriginalist must part ways.\"[186]\n\n\nTextualism, Barrett says, requires that judges construe statutory language consistent with its \"ordinary meaning\": \"The law is comprised of words—and textualists emphasize that words mean what they say, not what a judge thinks that they ought to say.\" According to Barrett, \"Textualism stands in contrast to purposivism, a method of statutory interpretation that was dominant through much of the 20th century.\" If a court concludes that statutory language appears to be in tension with a statute's overarching goal, \"purposivists argue that a judge should go with the goal rather than the text\". For Barrett, textualism is not literalism, nor is it about rigid dictionary definitions. \"It is about identifying the plain communicative content of the words\".[187]\n\n\nBarrett clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, and has spoken and written of her admiration of his adherence to the text of statutes and to originalism,[188] writing: \"His judicial philosophy is mine, too. A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\"[189] In one article she quoted Scalia on the importance of the original meaning of the Constitution: \"The validity of government depends upon the consent of the governed ... [s]o what the people agreed to when they adopted the Constitution ... is what ought to govern us.\"[183] In a 2017 article in the law review *Constitutional Commentary*, reviewing a book by Randy E. Barnett, Barrett wrote: \"The Constitution's original public meaning is important not because adhering to it limits judicial discretion, but because it is the law. ...The Constitution's meaning is fixed until lawfully changed; thus, the court must stick with the original public meaning of the text even if it rules out the preference of a current majority.\"[190][191]\n\n\nAccording to Barrett, textualists believe that when a court interprets the words of statutes, it should use the most natural meaning of those words to an ordinary skilled user of words at the time, even if the court believes that the legislature intended that the words be understood in a different sense. If the legislature wishes the words of a statute to carry a meaning different from how a non-legislator would understand them, it is free to define the terms in the statute. As Scalia put it, \"[A]ll we can know is that [the legislature] voted for a text that they presumably thought would be read the same way any reasonable English speaker would read it.\" Scalia insisted that \"it is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than by what the lawmaker promulgated.\"[192][193]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of legal process theory, which gives a more expansive role to theory in shaping the interpretation of law than do textualism and originalism.[192][193] She said that one example of the \"process-based\" approach can be found in *King v. Burwell*, in which the Supreme Court, for reasons related to the unorthodox legislative process that produced the Affordable Care Act, interpreted the phrase \"Exchange established by the State\" to mean \"Exchange established by the State or the federal government.\"[193]\n\n\n\n#### Suspension of habeas corpus[edit]\n\n\nIn a journal article, \"Suspension and Delegation\",[194] Barrett noted that constitutionally only Congress has the authority to decide the terms under which *habeas corpus* may be legitimately suspended.[195] In all but one of the previous suspensions of habeas corpus, Barrett thought that Congress violated the Constitution \"by enacting a suspension statute before an invasion or rebellion occurred—and in some instances, before one was even on the horizon.\"[81][194] In an educational essay, she sided with the dissenters in *Boumediene v. Bush* after considering historical factors.[196]\n\n\n\n### Precedent[edit]\n\n\nAt her 2017 Senate confirmation hearing for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett said she would follow Supreme Court precedent while on the appellate bench. In 2020, during her nomination acceptance speech at the White House Rose Garden, Barrett said, \"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold\";[197][198] she also said judges \"must apply the law as written\".[199][200] She explained her view of precedent in response to questions at the hearing.[201]\n\n\nIn a 2013 article in the *Texas Law Review* on the doctrine of *stare decisis*, Barrett listed seven cases that she believed should be considered \"superprecedents\"—cases the Court would never consider overturning. They included *Brown v. Board of Education* and *Mapp v. Ohio* (incorporating the Fourth Amendment onto the states),[202] but specifically excluded *Roe v. Wade* (1973). In explaining why it was excluded, Barrett referenced scholarship agreeing that in order to qualify as \"superprecedent\", a decision must have widespread support from not only jurists but politicians and the public at large to the extent of becoming immune to reversal or challenge (for example, the constitutionality of paper money). She argued that the people must trust a ruling's validity to such an extent that the matter has been taken \"off of the Court's agenda\", with lower courts no longer taking challenges to them seriously. Barrett pointed to *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992) as evidence that *Roe* had not attained this status, and quoted Richard H. Fallon Jr.: \"[A] decision as fiercely and enduringly contested as *Roe v. Wade* has acquired no immunity from serious judicial reconsideration, even if arguments for overruling it ought not succeed.\"[202][203]\n\n\nConcerning the relationship of textualism to precedent, Barrett said, \"It makes sense that one committed to a textualist theory would more often find precedent in conflict with her interpretation of the Constitution than would one who takes a more flexible, all-things-considered approach.\"[202] She referenced a study by Michael Gerhardt which found that, as of 1994, no two justices in that century had called for overruling more precedents than Justices Scalia and Hugo Black, both of whom were textualists, even though Black was a liberal and Scalia a conservative. Gerhardt also found that during the Rehnquist Court's last 11 years, the average number of times a justice called for the overruling of precedent was higher for textualist justices, with one per year coming from Ginsburg (non-textualist) up to just over two per year from Thomas (textualist). Gerhardt wrote that not all the calls for overruling were related to textualism issues, and that one must be careful in the inferences one draws from the numbers, which \"do not indicate either why or on what basis the justices urged overruling.\"[202]\n\n\n\n### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Barrett signed a letter criticizing the Obama administration's approach to providing employees of religious institutions with birth control coverage without having the religious institutions pay for it, calling it an \"assault\" to religious liberty.[204]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in *National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius* (2012), which upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. She wrote in 2017: \"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did—as a penalty—he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\"[191][205][204][206]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nBarrett opposes abortion.[207][208] In 2006, she signed an advertisement placed by St. Joseph County Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, in a South Bend, Indiana, newspaper. The ad read: \"We, the following citizens of Michiana, oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death. Please continue to pray to end abortion.\" An unsigned, second page of the advertisement read, \"It's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of *Roe v. Wade* and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\"[209][210][211] In 2013, Barrett signed another ad against *Roe v. Wade* that appeared in Notre Dame's student newspaper and described the decision as having \"killed 55 million unborn children\". The same year, she spoke at two anti-abortion events at the university.[212]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barrett and her family with President Trump on September 26, 2020\n![](image)Then-Judge Barrett with her husband, Jesse, in 2018\nIn 1999, Barrett married fellow Notre Dame Law School graduate Jesse M. Barrett, a partner at SouthBank Legal – LaDue Curran & Kuehn LLC, in South Bend, Indiana,[213] and a law professor at Notre Dame Law School.[214] Previously, Jesse Barrett had worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana for 13 years.[215] The couple live in South Bend and have seven children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti, one in 2005 and one after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[32][216] Their youngest biological child has Down syndrome.[217]\n\n\nBarrett is a practicing Catholic.[218] Since birth, she has been a member of the Christian parachurch community People of Praise,[219] an ecumenical covenant community founded in South Bend. Associated with the Catholic charismatic renewal movement but not formally affiliated with the Catholic Church,[220][221][222] about 90% of its approximately 1,700 members are Catholic.[220][222] In People of Praise, Barrett has served as a laypastoral women's leader in a position once termed \"handmaiden\" but now termed \"women leader\".[223][224]\n\n\nAccording to *Politico*, \"a copy of Barrett's ballot history from the Indiana Statewide Voter Registration System obtained by POLITICO [shows] Barrett voted in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, and the 2016 Republican primary, though she pulled a Democratic ballot in the 2011 primary.\"[38]\n\n\n\n## Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nBarrett was a member of the Federalist Society from 2005 to 2006 and from 2014 to 2017.[48][27][29] She is a member of the American Law Institute.[225]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Barrett's academic publications:[226]\n\n\n\n* Amy Coney Barrett; John H.

Barrett was a U.S. circuit judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from 2017 to 2020.\n\n\nBarrett graduated from Rhodes College before attending Notre Dame Law School, earning a J.D. with distinction in 1997. She then clerked for Judge Laurence Silberman and Justice Antonin Scalia. In 2002, Barrett joined the faculty at Notre Dame Law School, becoming a professor in 2010. While serving on the federal bench, she has continued to teach civil procedure, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nOn September 26, 2020, Trump nominated Barrett to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court of the United States.[6][7][8] Her nomination was controversial because the 2020 presidential election was only 38 days away and Senate Republicans had refused to hold hearings for Merrick Garland during an election year in 2016.[9] The next month, the U.S. Senate voted 52–48 to confirm her nomination, with all Democrats and one Republican in opposition.[10]\n\n\nDescribed as a protégée of Justice Antonin Scalia,[11][12][13] Barrett supports textualism in statutory interpretation and originalism in constitutional interpretation.[14][15][16] She is generally considered to be among the Court's conservative bloc.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAmy Vivian Coney was born in 1972 in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Linda (*née* Vath) and Michael Coney.[17][18] The eldest of seven children, she has five sisters and a brother. Her father worked as an attorney for Shell Oil Company, and her mother was a high school French teacher and homemaker. Barrett has Irish and French ancestry.[19][20] Her maternal ancestors were from Ballyconnell, County Cavan, Ireland, while there is also Irish lineage among her father's ancestors. Her great-great-grandparents emigrated from France to New Orleans.[21] Her family is devoutly Catholic, and her father is an ordained deacon at St. Catherine of Siena Parish in Metairie, Louisiana, where she grew up.[22][23]\n\n\nBarrett attended St. Mary's Dominican High School, an all-girls Roman Catholic high school in New Orleans.[24] She was student body vice president of the school and graduated in 1990.[25] After high school, Barrett attended Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, where she majored in English literature and minored in French. She considers herself \"somewhat fluent\" in French, but with a Louisiana accent.[26] Barrett graduated in 1994 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*, and was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa and Phi Beta Kappa.[27] In her graduating class, she was named most outstanding English department graduate.[28]\n\n\nBarrett then attended Notre Dame Law School on a full-tuition scholarship. She was an executive editor of the *Notre Dame Law Review* and graduated in 1997 ranked first in her class with a Juris Doctor, *summa cum laude*.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Legal career[edit]\n\n\n### Clerkships and private practice[edit]\n\n\nBarrett spent two years as a judicial law clerk after law school, first for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1997 to 1998, and then for Justice Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1998 to 1999.[30]\n\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, Barrett practiced law at Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin, a boutique law firm for litigation in Washington, D.C., that merged with the Houston, Texas-based law firm Baker Botts in 2001.[29][31] While at Baker Botts, she worked on *Bush v. Gore*, the lawsuit that grew out of the 2000 United States presidential election, providing research and briefing assistance for the firm's representation of George W. Bush.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and scholarship[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Barrett was a visiting associate professor and John M. Olin Fellow in Law at George Washington University Law School. In 2002, she joined the faculty of her alma mater, Notre Dame Law School.[34] At Notre Dame, she taught federal courts, evidence, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation. In 2007, she was a visiting professor at the University of Virginia School of Law.[35] Barrett was named a professor of law at Notre Dame in 2010, and from 2014 to 2017 held Notre Dame's Diane and M.O. Miller II Research Chair of Law.[36] Her scholarship focused on constitutional law, originalism, statutory interpretation, and *stare decisis*.[28] Her academic work has been published in the *Columbia*, *Cornell*, *Virginia*, *Notre Dame*, and *Texas* law reviews.[34]\n\n\nAt Notre Dame, Barrett received the \"Distinguished Professor of the Year\" award three times.[34] From 2011 to 2016, she spoke on constitutional law at Blackstone Legal Fellowship, a summer program for law school students that the Alliance Defending Freedom established to inspire a \"distinctly Christian worldview in every area of law\".[37] While serving on the Seventh Circuit, Barrett commuted between Chicago and South Bend, continuing to teach courses on statutory interpretation and constitutional theory.[38][39]\n\n\nIn 2010, Chief Justice John Roberts appointed Barrett to serve on the Advisory Committee for the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.[34]\n\n\n\n## Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals (2017–2020)[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nFile:Prof Amy Coney Barrett 2 10.jpgBarrett before the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 6, 2017\nOn May 8, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit—the federal appellate court covering Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin—after Judge John Daniel Tinder took senior status.[5][40] A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on her nomination was held on September 6, 2017.[41] During the hearing, Senator Dianne Feinstein questioned Barrett about a law review article Barrett co-wrote in 1998 with Professor John H. Garvey in which they argued that Catholic judges should in some cases recuse themselves from death penalty cases due to their moral objections to the death penalty.[42] Asked to \"elaborate on the statements and discuss how you view the issue of faith versus fulfilling the responsibility as a judge today,\" Barrett said that she had participated in many death-penalty appeals while serving as law clerk to Scalia, adding, \"My personal church affiliation or my religious belief would not bear on the discharge of my duties as a judge\"[43][44] and \"It is never appropriate for a judge to impose that judge's personal convictions, whether they arise from faith or anywhere else, on the law.\"[45] Barrett emphasized that the article was written in her third year in law school and that she was \"very much the junior partner in our collaboration.\"[46] Worried that Barrett would not uphold *Roe v. Wade* given her Catholic beliefs, Feinstein followed Barrett's response by saying, \"the dogma lives loudly within you, and that is a concern.\"[47][48][49]\n\n\nThe hearing made Barrett popular with religious conservatives.[29] Feinstein's and other senators' questioning was criticized by some Republicans and other observers, such as university presidents John I. Jenkins of the University of Notre Dame and Christopher Eisgruber of Princeton, as an improper inquiry into a nominee's religious belief that employed an unconstitutional \"religious test\" for office;[45][50] others, such as Nan Aron, defended Feinstein's line of questioning.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Judge Laurence Silberman, for whom Barrett first clerked after law school, swearing her in at her investiture for the Seventh Circuit in 2018\nLambda Legal, an LGBT civil rights organization, co-signed a letter with 26 other gay rights organizations opposing Barrett's nomination. The letter expressed doubts about her ability to separate faith from her rulings on LGBT matters.[52][53] During her Senate hearing, Barrett was questioned about landmark LGBTQ legal precedents such as *Obergefell v. Hodges*, *United States v. Windsor*, and *Lawrence v. Texas*. She said these cases are \"binding precedents\" that she intended to \"faithfully follow if confirmed\" to the appeals court, as required by law.[52] The letter Lambda Legal co-signed read, \"Simply repeating that she would be bound by Supreme Court precedent does not illuminate—indeed, it obfuscates—how Professor Barrett would interpret and apply precedent when faced with the sorts of dilemmas that, in her view, 'put Catholic judges in a bind.'\"[52]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was supported by every law clerk she had worked with and all of her 49 faculty colleagues at Notre Dame Law school. 450 former students signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee supporting her nomination.[54][55]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11–9 on party lines to recommend Barrett and report her nomination to the full Senate.[56][57] On October 30, the Senate invoked cloture by a vote of 54–42.[58] It confirmed her by a vote of 55–43 on October 31, with three Democrats—Joe Donnelly, Tim Kaine, and Joe Manchin—voting for her.[27] She received her commission two days later.[2] Barrett is the first and only woman to occupy an Indiana seat on the Seventh Circuit.[59]\n\n\n\n### Selected cases[edit]\n\n\nOral arguments from *Cook County, Illinois v. Chad F. Wolf*, one of the last cases that Barrett took in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2020\nOn the Seventh Circuit, Barrett wrote 79 majority opinions (including two that were amended and one that was withdrawn on rehearing), four concurring opinions (one a per curiam opinion), and six dissenting opinions (six published and one in an unpublished order).[35]\n\n\n\n#### Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, the court, in a unanimous decision written by Barrett, reinstated a suit brought by a male Purdue University student (John Doe) who had been found guilty of sexual assault by Purdue University, which resulted in a one-year suspension, loss of his Navy ROTC scholarship, and expulsion from the ROTC affecting his ability to pursue his chosen career in the Navy.[60][61] Doe alleged the school's Advisory Committee on Equity discriminated against him on the basis of his sex and violated his rights to due process by not interviewing the alleged victim, not allowing him to present evidence in his defense, including an erroneous statement that he confessed to some of the alleged assault, and appearing to believe the victim instead of the accused without hearing from either party or having even read the investigation report. The court found that Doe had adequately alleged that the university deprived him of his occupational liberty without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and had violated his Title IX rights \"by imposing a punishment infected by sex bias\", and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.[62][63]\n\n\n\n#### Employment discrimination[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, the Seventh Circuit rejected the federal government's appeal in a civil lawsuit against AutoZone; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission argued that AutoZone's assignment of employees to different stores based on race (e.g., \"sending African American employees to stores in heavily African American neighborhoods\") violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Following this, Barrett joined the court as it received a petition for rehearing *en banc*. Three judges—Chief Judge Diane Wood and judges Ilana Rovner and David Hamilton—voted to grant rehearing, and criticized the three-judge panel's opinion as upholding a \"separate-but-equal arrangement\". Barrett did not join the panel opinion, but voted with four judges to deny the petition to rehear the case. The petition was unsuccessful by a 5–3 decision.[64][29]\n\n\nIn 2019, Barrett wrote the unanimous three-judge panel opinion affirming summary judgment in the case of *Smith v. Illinois Department of Transportation*. Smith was a Black employee who claimed racial discrimination upon his dismissal by the department and that he was called a \"stupid-ass nigger\" by a Black supervisor; the department claimed Smith failed work-level expectations during probationary periods. Barrett wrote that usage of the racial slur was egregious, but Smith's testimony showed no evidence that his subjective experience of the workplace changed because of the slur, nor did it change the department's fact that his discharge was related to \"poor performance\".[65][66]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Barrett wrote a 40-page dissent when the majority upheld a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration's controversial \"public charge rule\", which heightened the standard for obtaining a green card.[67] In her dissent, she argued that any noncitizens who disenrolled from government benefits because of the rule did so due to confusion about the rule itself rather than from its application, writing that the vast majority of the people subject to the rule are not eligible for government benefits in the first place. On the merits, Barrett departed from her colleagues Wood and Rovner, who held that DHS's interpretation of that provision was unreasonable under *Chevron* Step Two. Barrett would have held that the new rule fell within the broad scope of discretion granted to the Executive by Congress through the Immigration and Nationality Act.[68] The public charge issue is the subject of a circuit split.[68][69]\n\n\nIn May 2019, the court rejected a Yemeni citizen and her U.S. citizen husband's challenge to a consular officer's decision to twice deny her visa application under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The U.S. citizen argued that this had deprived him of a constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse.[70] In a 2–1 majority opinion authored by Barrett, the court held that the plaintiff's claim was properly dismissed under the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. Barrett declined to address whether the husband had been denied a constitutional right (or whether the constitutional right to live in the United States with his spouse existed at all) because the consular officer's decision to deny the visa application was facially legitimate and bona fide, and under Supreme Court precedent, in such a case courts will not \"look behind the exercise of that discretion\". The dispute concerned what it takes to satisfy this standard. A petition for rehearing *en banc* was denied, with Chief Judge Wood, joined by Rovner and Hamilton, dissenting. Barrett wrote a rare opinion concurring in the denial of rehearing *en banc* (joined by Judge Joel Flaum).[70][71]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion-related cases[edit]\n\n\nBarrett had never ruled directly on abortion before joining the Supreme Court, but she did vote to rehear a successful challenge to Indiana's parental notification law in 2019. In 2018, she voted against striking down another Indiana law requiring burial or cremation of fetal remains. In both cases, Barrett voted with the minority. The Supreme Court later reinstated the fetal remains law, and in July 2020 it ordered a rehearing in the parental notification case.[72][73]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision upholding a Chicago \"bubble ordinance\" that prohibits approaching within a certain distance of an abortion clinic or its patrons without consent.[74][75] Citing the Supreme Court's buffer zone decision in *Hill v. Colorado*, the court rejected the plaintiffs' challenge to the ordinance on First Amendment grounds.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Barrett dissented when the court upheld the federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms.[77] The majority rejected the as-applied challenge raised by plaintiff Rickey Kanter, who had been convicted of felony mail fraud, and upheld the felony dispossession statute as \"substantially related to an important government interest in preventing gun violence.\" In her dissent, Barrett argued that while the government has a legitimate interest in denying gun possession to felons convicted of violent crimes, there is no evidence that denying guns to nonviolent felons promotes this interest, and that the law violates the Second Amendment.[78] President Trump pardoned Kanter in December 2020.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Criminal procedure[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Barrett dissented when the panel majority found that an accused murderer's right to counsel was violated when the state trial judge directly questioned the accused while forbidding his attorney from speaking.[80] Following rehearing *en banc*, a majority of the circuit's judges agreed with her position.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2018, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it determined that the police had lacked probable cause to search a vehicle based solely upon an anonymous tip that people were \"playing with guns\", because no crime had been alleged.[82] Barrett distinguished *Navarette v. California* and wrote, \"the police were right to respond to the anonymous call by coming to the parking lot to determine what was happening. But determining what was happening and immediately seizing people upon arrival are two different things, and the latter was premature...Watson's case presents a close call. But this one falls on the wrong side of the Fourth Amendment.\"[83]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it found that police officers had been unreasonable to assume \"that a woman who answers the door in a bathrobe has authority to consent to a search of a male suspect's residence.\" Therefore, the district court should have granted the defendant's motion to suppress evidence found in the residence as the fruit of an unconstitutional search.[84][85]\n\n\n\n#### Qualified immunity[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Barrett wrote for a unanimous panel when it denied qualified immunity to a civil lawsuit sought by a defendant who as a homicide detective had knowingly provided false and misleading information in the probable cause affidavit that was used to obtain an arrest warrant for the plaintiff.[86] (The charges were later dropped and the plaintiff was released.) The court found the defendant's lies and omissions violated \"clearly established law\" and the plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights and thus the detective was not shielded by qualified immunity.[87]\n\n\nIn *Howard v. Koeller* (7th Cir. 2018), in an unsigned order by a three-judge panel that included Barrett, the court found that qualified immunity did not protect a prison officer who had labeled a prisoner a \"snitch\" and thereby exposed him to risk from his fellow inmates.[88][89]\n\n\n\n#### Environment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Orchard Hill Building Co. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers*, 893 F.3d 1017 (7th Cir. 2018), Barrett joined a unanimous panel decision, written by Judge Amy J. St. Eve, in a case brought by a property developer challenging the Corps' determination that a wetland 11 mi (18 km) from the nearest navigable river was among the \"waters of the United States.\"[90] The court found that the Corps had not provided substantial evidence of a significant nexus to navigable‐in‐fact waters under Justice Kennedy's concurrence in the Supreme Court's decision in *Rapanos v. United States*. The case was remanded to the Corps to reconsider whether such a significant nexus exists between the wetlands in question and navigable waters for it to maintain jurisdiction over the land.[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### Consumer protection[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2018, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that a plaintiff could not sue Teva Pharmaceuticals for alleged defects in her IUD due to the lack of supportive expert testimony, writing, \"the issue of causation in her case is not obvious.\"[93][94][95]\n\n\n\n#### Coronavirus measures[edit]\n\n\nIn early September 2020, Barrett joined Wood's opinion upholding the district court's denial of the Illinois Republican Party's request for a preliminary injunction to block Governor J. B. Pritzker's COVID-19 orders.[30][96] On August 12, 2021, she rejected a challenge to Indiana University's vaccine mandate, marking the first legal test of COVID-19 vaccine mandates before the Supreme Court.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Civil procedure and standing[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it found that the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act cannot create a cause of action for a debtor who received collection letters lacking notices required by the statute because she suffered no injury-in-fact to create constitutional standing to sue under Article III.[98] Wood dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc. The issue created a circuit split.[99][100][101]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Barrett wrote for the unanimous panel when it held that a Teamsters local did not have standing to appeal an order in the *Shakman* case because it was not formally a party to the case.[102] The union had not intervened in the action, but rather merely submitted a memorandum in the district court opposing a motion, which the Seventh Circuit determined was insufficient to give the union a right to appeal.[103]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President Donald Trump nominated Barrett to the Supreme Court on September 26, 2020\nBarrett was on Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees since 2017, almost immediately after her court of appeals confirmation.[104] In July 2018, after Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement announcement, she was reportedly one of three finalists Trump considered, along with Kavanaugh and Judge Raymond Kethledge.[36][105][106]\n\n\nAfter Kavanaugh's selection in 2018, Barrett was viewed as a possible nominee for a future U.S. Supreme Court vacancy.[107] After the death of Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on September 18, 2020, Barrett was widely mentioned as the front-runner to succeed her.[108] On September 26, 2020, Trump announced his intention to nominate Barrett to fill the vacancy created by Ginsburg's death.[7][109]\n\n\nBarrett's nomination was generally supported by Republicans, who sought to confirm her before the 2020 United States presidential election.[110] She was a favorite among the Christian right and social conservatives.[72][111][112] Democrats generally opposed the nomination, and were opposed to filling the court vacancy while election voting was already underway in many states.[110] Many observers were angered by the move to fill the vacancy only four months before the end of Trump's term, as the Senate Republican majority had refused to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland in 2016, more than ten months before the end of his presidency.[110][113][114]\n\n\nIn October, the American Bar Association rated Barrett \"well qualified\" for the Supreme Court opening, its highest rating.[115] The ABA confines its evaluation to the qualities of \"integrity, professional competence, and judicial temperament\".[116] Barrett's nomination came during a White House COVID-19 outbreak. On October 5, Senator Lindsey Graham formally scheduled the confirmation hearing,[117] which began on October 12 as planned and lasted four days.[118][119] On October 22, the Judiciary Committee reported her confirmation favorably by a 12–0 vote, with all 10 Democrats boycotting the committee meeting.[120][121] On October 25, the Senate voted mostly along party lines to end debate on the confirmation.[122] On October 26, the Senate confirmed Barrett to the Supreme Court by a vote of 52–48, 30 days after her nomination and 8 days before the 2020 presidential election. Every Republican senator except Susan Collins voted to confirm her, whereas every member of the Senate Democratic Caucus[123] voted in opposition.[124] Barrett is the first justice since 1870 to be confirmed without a single vote from the Senate minority party.[125][126]\n\n\nThe nature of her appointment was criticized by numerous Democratic politicians; Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called it \"the most illegitimate process I have ever witnessed in the Senate.\"[127] Republicans responded that they were merely exercising their constitutional rights, and that accusations of hypocrisy were nothing more than \"an unwarranted tantrum from the left\".[127]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court (2020–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Clarence Thomas administers the oath of office to Barrett on October 26, 2020, at the White House alongside President Donald Trump\n![](image)Chief Justice John Roberts administers the judicial oath to Barrett on October 27, 2020. Justice Barrett's husband, Jesse M. Barrett, holds the Bible.\nBarrett became the 103rd associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States on October 27, 2020. On the evening of the confirmation vote, Trump hosted a swearing-in ceremony at the White House. As Barrett requested, Justice Clarence Thomas administered the oath of office to her,[126][128][129] the first of two necessary oaths. She took the judicial oath, administered by Chief Justice John Roberts, the next day.[130]\n\n\nUpon joining the Court, Barrett became the only justice who did not receive their Juris Doctor from Harvard or Yale.[131] She is also the first justice without an Ivy League degree since the 2010 retirement of John Paul Stevens (who graduated from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University School of Law) and the first to be appointed since Sandra Day O'Connor, who graduated from Stanford University and Stanford Law School.[132] She is the first graduate of Notre Dame Law School and the first former member of the Notre Dame faculty to serve on the Supreme Court.[133]\n\n\nBarrett uses her maiden and married surnames in public. She has chosen to be called \"Justice Barrett\" in written orders and opinions of the court,[134] as she did as a Seventh Circuit judge.[135]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Barrett was assigned to the Seventh Circuit.[136] This assignment's duties include responding to emergency applications to the Court that arise from the circuit's jurisdiction, either by herself or else by referring them to the full Court for review.[136][137]\n\n\n\n### Early oral argument participation[edit]\n\n\nHaving hired her allotted four law clerks, Barrett took part in her first oral argument on November 2, hearing the case *U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club.*[138][139]\n\n\nOn November 4, the Court heard *Fulton v. Philadelphia*, in which the plaintiff, Catholic Social Services, sued the city of Philadelphia after being denied a new contract under the city's Fair Practices Ordinance, which bars discrimination in public accommodations. The Archdiocese-affiliated CSS said that for religious reasons it cannot properly vet potential foster parents who are gay couples. CSS argued that under relevant precedent, the Court should find that CSS as a faith-based charity was unfairly singled out, given that the city allows race- and disability-based exceptions within foster-care placements.[140][141] CSS further claimed the law is shown not to be neutral as required by the Court's 1990 decision *Employment Division v. Smith*, which allows the government to enforce neutral and generally applicable laws without having to make exceptions for individual religions, because the city labeled CSS's motives \"discrimination that occurs under the guise of religious freedom.\"[141][142] According to the *New York Times,* Barrett's questions during oral arguments were \"evenhanded and did not reveal her position.\"[143]\n\n\n\n### First votes as a justice[edit]\n\n\nOn November 26, 2020, Barrett joined the Supreme Court's majority in *Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo*,[144] 592 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2020), in an unsigned[145] 5–4 preliminary injunction in favor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and the Orthodox Jewish organization Agudath Israel of America, saying that certain COVID-19 restrictions instituted by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had likely violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, in that they \"single out houses of worship for especially harsh treatment.\"[146][147][148][149] The Court said that the restrictions had likely impinged on the fundamental right of the free exercise of religion without their (in constitutional legal parlance) passing the legal test of \"strict scrutiny.\"[150] Cuomo's order was more restrictive than governmental orders involved in similar cases involving churches in California and Nevada that the Court had allowed to stand by a 5–4 vote.[151][152][153] Ross Guberman, author of *Point Taken: How to Write Like the World's Best Judges*, told the *Times* he believed Barrett was the principal author of the Court's decision because of its measured tone and word choices, including its use of the word \"show\".[154]\n\n\nBarrett delivered her first concurring opinion on February 5, 2021, in the case *South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom*.[155][156]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, Barrett joined the majority, in a 5–4 vote, to reject a petition to temporarily block a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy; Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh joined her in the majority.[157]\nIn June 2022, Barrett joined with the same majority in *Dobbs v. Jackson*, voting to completely overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*.[158]\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2022, the Supreme Court voted to allow the execution of an inmate to proceed in Alabama; the case was decided by a 5–4 vote, with Barrett joining Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in dissent.[159]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote her first majority opinion in *United States Fish and Wildlife Service v. Sierra Club*, which was decided on March 4, 2021.[155][160][161] Traditionally the first opinion delivered by a new justice reflects the opinion of a unanimous court, but not always. While Gorsuch and Kavanaugh wrote unanimous first opinions, Barrett, like her predecessor Justice Ginsburg, wrote an opinion for a divided court.[155][162][163]\n\n\nAlthough Barrett ruled against environmentalists in March, she voted against oil refineries in her first dissent, *Hollyfrontier Cheyenne Refining v. Renewable Fuels Association*.[164]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights and issues[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Barrett joined a unanimous decision in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, ruling in favor of a Catholic social service agency that had been denied funding from the City of Philadelphia because it does not adopt to same-sex couples; the ruling also declined to overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[165] In the same month, Barrett was among the six justices who rejected the appeal of a Washington State florist whom lower courts had ruled violated non-discrimination laws by refusing to sell floral arrangements to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage, leaving the lower court judgments in place.[166][167][168] In November 2021, Barrett voted with the majority in a 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[169] The Court's decision not to hear the case left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the transgender patient; Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented.[170][171]\n\n\n\n### Vaccine requirements[edit]\n\n\nBarrett wrote a concurring opinion in *Does v. Mills,* a case challenging Maine's vaccine requirement for health care workers. She was in the majority in the 6–3 decision to deny a stay of the vaccine requirement, explaining that the case had not been fully briefed or argued.*[172]*\n\n\n\n## Judicial philosophy, academic writings, speeches, and political views[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on |\n| Conservatismin the United States |\n| ![](image) |\n| Schools\n* Compassionate\n* Fiscal\n* Fusion\n* Libertarian\n* Moderate\n* Movement\n* Neo\n* Paleo\n* Progressive\n* Social\n* Traditionalist\n |\n| Principles\n* American exceptionalism\n* Anti-communism\n* Christian nationalism\n* Classical liberalism\n* Constitutionalism\n* Familialism\n* Family values\n* Federalism\n\t+ States' rights\n* Judeo-Christian values\n* Individualism\n* Law and order\n* Limited government\n* Militarism\n* Moral absolutism\n* Natural law\n* Patriotism\n* Republicanism\n* Right to bear arms\n* Rule of law\n* Tradition\n |\n| History\n* Conservative coalition\n* Conservative Democrat\n* Conservative Manifesto\n* Loyalists\n* McCarthyism\n* Modern timeline\n* New Right\n* Old Right\n* Overview\n* Reagan Doctrine\n* Reaganomics\n* Stalwart Republicans\n* Southern Agrarians\n |\n| Intellectuals\n* Anton\n* Babbitt\n* Bell\n* Bellow\n* Bloom\n* Boorstin\n* Buckley\n* Burnham\n* Chambers\n* Conquest\n* Derbyshire\n* Dolan\n* Durant\n* Eastman\n* Eliot\n* Francis\n* George\n* Goldberg\n* Gottfried\n* Hanson\n* Hazony\n* Hoppe\n* Jaffa\n* Kimball\n* Kirk\n* Kirkpatrick\n* Kreeft\n* Kristol (Irving)\n* Kuehnelt-Leddihn\n* Laffer\n* Lasch\n* Lovecraft\n* Lukacs\n* Mansfield\n* Mencken\n* Meyer\n* Molnar\n* Murray\n* Nisbet\n* Nock\n* O'Connor\n* Ong\n* Ransom\n* Repplier\n* Santayana\n* Sowell\n* Strauss\n* Sumner\n* Viereck\n* Voegelin\n* Washington\n* Weaver\n* Yarvin\n |\n| Politicians\n* Abbott\n* Adams\n* Quincy Adams\n* Agnew\n* Buchanan\n* Bush (George H.

Jay Schweikert, who advocates for the Court's or Congress's elimination of qualified immunity,[176] believes that her \"decisions all look like reasonable applications of existing precedent.\"[175][177] Legal commentator Jacob Sullum argues that while Barrett was on the Seventh Circuit she took \"a constrained view of the doctrine's scope.\"[178]\n\n\n\n### Textualism and originalism[edit]\n\n\nBarrett is considered a textualist, a proponent of the idea that statutes should be interpreted literally, without considering their legislative history or underlying purpose,[179][180][181][182] and an originalist (of the original-public-meaning, rather than original-intent, variety), a proponent of the idea that the Constitution should be interpreted as perceived at the time of enactment.[179][183][184][185] According to her, \"Originalism is characterized by a commitment to two core principles. First, the meaning of the constitutional text is fixed at the time of its ratification. Second, the historical meaning of the text 'has legal significance and is authoritative in most circumstances.'\"[183] For the purpose of \"describing the disagreement between originalists and nonoriginalists about the authoritativeness of the original public meaning,\" she refers[183] to a section of a law review article by Keith Whittington, \"Originalism: A Critical Introduction\",[186] that reads, \"Critics of originalism have suggested a range of considerations that might trump original meaning if the two were to come into conflict. From this perspective, fidelity to original meaning is not the chief goal of constitutional theory. ...Confronted with suitably unpleasant results, the nonoriginalist might posit that the original meaning should be sacrificed. Alternatively, we might think that contemporary public opinion should trump original meaning. ...Underlying all these considerations is a view that courts are authorized to impose constitutional rules other than those adopted by the constitutional drafters. ...the originalist must insist that judges not close their eyes to the discoverable meaning of the Constitution and announce some other constitutional rule to supersede it. It is at that point that the originalist and the nonoriginalist must part ways.\"[186]\n\n\nTextualism, Barrett says, requires that judges construe statutory language consistent with its \"ordinary meaning\": \"The law is comprised of words—and textualists emphasize that words mean what they say, not what a judge thinks that they ought to say.\" According to Barrett, \"Textualism stands in contrast to purposivism, a method of statutory interpretation that was dominant through much of the 20th century.\" If a court concludes that statutory language appears to be in tension with a statute's overarching goal, \"purposivists argue that a judge should go with the goal rather than the text\". For Barrett, textualism is not literalism, nor is it about rigid dictionary definitions. \"It is about identifying the plain communicative content of the words\".[187]\n\n\nBarrett clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, and has spoken and written of her admiration of his adherence to the text of statutes and to originalism,[188] writing: \"His judicial philosophy is mine, too. A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold.\"[189] In one article she quoted Scalia on the importance of the original meaning of the Constitution: \"The validity of government depends upon the consent of the governed ... [s]o what the people agreed to when they adopted the Constitution ... is what ought to govern us.\"[183] In a 2017 article in the law review *Constitutional Commentary*, reviewing a book by Randy E. Barnett, Barrett wrote: \"The Constitution's original public meaning is important not because adhering to it limits judicial discretion, but because it is the law. ...The Constitution's meaning is fixed until lawfully changed; thus, the court must stick with the original public meaning of the text even if it rules out the preference of a current majority.\"[190][191]\n\n\nAccording to Barrett, textualists believe that when a court interprets the words of statutes, it should use the most natural meaning of those words to an ordinary skilled user of words at the time, even if the court believes that the legislature intended that the words be understood in a different sense. If the legislature wishes the words of a statute to carry a meaning different from how a non-legislator would understand them, it is free to define the terms in the statute. As Scalia put it, \"[A]ll we can know is that [the legislature] voted for a text that they presumably thought would be read the same way any reasonable English speaker would read it.\" Scalia insisted that \"it is simply incompatible with democratic government, or indeed, even with fair government, to have the meaning of a law determined by what the lawgiver meant, rather than by what the lawmaker promulgated.\"[192][193]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of legal process theory, which gives a more expansive role to theory in shaping the interpretation of law than do textualism and originalism.[192][193] She said that one example of the \"process-based\" approach can be found in *King v. Burwell*, in which the Supreme Court, for reasons related to the unorthodox legislative process that produced the Affordable Care Act, interpreted the phrase \"Exchange established by the State\" to mean \"Exchange established by the State or the federal government.\"[193]\n\n\n\n#### Suspension of habeas corpus[edit]\n\n\nIn a journal article, \"Suspension and Delegation\",[194] Barrett noted that constitutionally only Congress has the authority to decide the terms under which *habeas corpus* may be legitimately suspended.[195] In all but one of the previous suspensions of habeas corpus, Barrett thought that Congress violated the Constitution \"by enacting a suspension statute before an invasion or rebellion occurred—and in some instances, before one was even on the horizon.\"[81][194] In an educational essay, she sided with the dissenters in *Boumediene v. Bush* after considering historical factors.[196]\n\n\n\n### Precedent[edit]\n\n\nAt her 2017 Senate confirmation hearing for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, Barrett said she would follow Supreme Court precedent while on the appellate bench. In 2020, during her nomination acceptance speech at the White House Rose Garden, Barrett said, \"Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold\";[197][198] she also said judges \"must apply the law as written\".[199][200] She explained her view of precedent in response to questions at the hearing.[201]\n\n\nIn a 2013 article in the *Texas Law Review* on the doctrine of *stare decisis*, Barrett listed seven cases that she believed should be considered \"superprecedents\"—cases the Court would never consider overturning. They included *Brown v. Board of Education* and *Mapp v. Ohio* (incorporating the Fourth Amendment onto the states),[202] but specifically excluded *Roe v. Wade* (1973). In explaining why it was excluded, Barrett referenced scholarship agreeing that in order to qualify as \"superprecedent\", a decision must have widespread support from not only jurists but politicians and the public at large to the extent of becoming immune to reversal or challenge (for example, the constitutionality of paper money). She argued that the people must trust a ruling's validity to such an extent that the matter has been taken \"off of the Court's agenda\", with lower courts no longer taking challenges to them seriously. Barrett pointed to *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (1992) as evidence that *Roe* had not attained this status, and quoted Richard H. Fallon Jr.: \"[A] decision as fiercely and enduringly contested as *Roe v. Wade* has acquired no immunity from serious judicial reconsideration, even if arguments for overruling it ought not succeed.\"[202][203]\n\n\nConcerning the relationship of textualism to precedent, Barrett said, \"It makes sense that one committed to a textualist theory would more often find precedent in conflict with her interpretation of the Constitution than would one who takes a more flexible, all-things-considered approach.\"[202] She referenced a study by Michael Gerhardt which found that, as of 1994, no two justices in that century had called for overruling more precedents than Justices Scalia and Hugo Black, both of whom were textualists, even though Black was a liberal and Scalia a conservative. Gerhardt also found that during the Rehnquist Court's last 11 years, the average number of times a justice called for the overruling of precedent was higher for textualist justices, with one per year coming from Ginsburg (non-textualist) up to just over two per year from Thomas (textualist). Gerhardt wrote that not all the calls for overruling were related to textualism issues, and that one must be careful in the inferences one draws from the numbers, which \"do not indicate either why or on what basis the justices urged overruling.\"[202]\n\n\n\n### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Barrett signed a letter criticizing the Obama administration's approach to providing employees of religious institutions with birth control coverage without having the religious institutions pay for it, calling it an \"assault\" to religious liberty.[204]\n\n\nBarrett has been critical of the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in *National Federation of Independent Businesses v. Sebelius* (2012), which upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. She wrote in 2017: \"Chief Justice Roberts pushed the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. He construed the penalty imposed on those without health insurance as a tax, which permitted him to sustain the statute as a valid exercise of the taxing power; had he treated the payment as the statute did—as a penalty—he would have had to invalidate the statute as lying beyond Congress's commerce power.\"[191][205][204][206]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nBarrett opposes abortion.[207][208] In 2006, she signed an advertisement placed by St. Joseph County Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, in a South Bend, Indiana, newspaper. The ad read: \"We, the following citizens of Michiana, oppose abortion on demand and defend the right to life from fertilization to natural death. Please continue to pray to end abortion.\" An unsigned, second page of the advertisement read, \"It's time to put an end to the barbaric legacy of *Roe v. Wade* and restore laws that protect the lives of unborn children.\"[209][210][211] In 2013, Barrett signed another ad against *Roe v. Wade* that appeared in Notre Dame's student newspaper and described the decision as having \"killed 55 million unborn children\". The same year, she spoke at two anti-abortion events at the university.[212]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barrett and her family with President Trump on September 26, 2020\n![](image)Then-Judge Barrett with her husband, Jesse, in 2018\nIn 1999, Barrett married fellow Notre Dame Law School graduate Jesse M. Barrett, a partner at SouthBank Legal – LaDue Curran & Kuehn LLC, in South Bend, Indiana,[213] and a law professor at Notre Dame Law School.[214] Previously, Jesse Barrett had worked as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana for 13 years.[215] The couple live in South Bend and have seven children, two of whom were adopted from Haiti, one in 2005 and one after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.[32][216] Their youngest biological child has Down syndrome.[217]\n\n\nBarrett is a practicing Catholic.[218] Since birth, she has been a member of the Christian parachurch community People of Praise,[219] an ecumenical covenant community founded in South Bend. Associated with the Catholic charismatic renewal movement but not formally affiliated with the Catholic Church,[220][221][222] about 90% of its approximately 1,700 members are Catholic.[220][222] In People of Praise, Barrett has served as a laypastoral women's leader in a position once termed \"handmaiden\" but now termed \"women leader\".[223][224]\n\n\nAccording to *Politico*, \"a copy of Barrett's ballot history from the Indiana Statewide Voter Registration System obtained by POLITICO [shows] Barrett voted in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, and the 2016 Republican primary, though she pulled a Democratic ballot in the 2011 primary.\"[38]\n\n\n\n## Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nBarrett was a member of the Federalist Society from 2005 to 2006 and from 2014 to 2017.[48][27][29] She is a member of the American Law Institute.[225]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Barrett's academic publications:[226]\n\n\n\n* Amy Coney Barrett; John H.

Jackson was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Joe Biden on February 25, 2022, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate and sworn into office that same year.[1][2] She is the first black woman and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\n\nJackson was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Miami, Florida. She received her undergraduate and legal education at Harvard University, where she served as an editor of the *Harvard Law Review*, and clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer, whose seat she later assumed on the Supreme Court.[3] From 2010 to 2014, Jackson was the vice chairwoman of the United States Sentencing Commission. In 2013, President Barack Obama appointed her as a district judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where she served until 2021. Since 2016, Jackson has been a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJackson was born on September 14, 1970, in Washington, D.C.,[4] to parents who had been educated at historically black colleges and universities.[5][6][7] Her father, Johnny Brown, attended the University of Miami School of Law and became chief attorney for the Miami-Dade County School Board. Her mother, Ellery, was school principal at the New World School of the Arts in Miami.[8][9] One of her uncles, Calvin Ross, served as the chief of the Miami Police Department.[8]\n\n\nJackson grew up in Miami and attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School.[10] She distinguished herself as a champion debater,[11] winning the national oratory title at the National Catholic Forensic League championships in New Orleans during her senior year.[12] She has recalled her experience with high school debate as one \"that I can say without hesitation was the one activity that best prepared me for future success in law and in life.\"[13] In 1988, Jackson graduated from Palmetto as senior class president.[11][14] In her high school yearbook, she was quoted as saying that she wanted \"to go into law and eventually have a judicial appointment\".[15]\n\n\nAfter high school, Jackson matriculated at Harvard University to study government, having applied despite her guidance counselor's advice to set her sights lower.[16] She took classes in drama and performed improv comedy, forming a diverse friend group.[17][18] As a member of the Black Students Association, she led protests against a student who displayed a Confederate flag from his dormitory window and protested the lack of full-time professors in the Afro-American Studies Department. While a freshman, Jackson enrolled in Michael Sandel's course *Justice*, which she has called a major influence during her undergraduate years.[18]\n\n\nIn 1989, when Jackson was a college student, an uncle, Thomas Brown Jr., was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent cocaine conviction after federal agents found 14 kilograms of cocaine wrapped in duct tape. Years later, Jackson persuaded a law firm to take his case *pro bono*, and President Barack Obama eventually commuted his sentence.[19][20]\n\n\nJackson graduated from Harvard in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*.[21][11] Her senior thesis was titled \"The Hand of Oppression: Plea Bargaining Processes and the Coercion of Criminal Defendants\".[22] From 1992 to 1993, Jackson worked as a staff reporter and researcher for *Time* magazine,[23] attending Harvard Law School shortly afterward. She was a supervising editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1996 with a Juris Doctor, *cum laude*.[24][25]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Jackson served as a law clerk to Judge Patti B. Saris of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts from 1996 to 1997,[23] then to Judge Bruce M. Selya of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit from 1997 to 1998.[26] She spent a year in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin (now part of Baker Botts), then clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer from 1999 to 2000.[10][27]\n\n\nJackson returned to private legal practice at the law firm of Goodwin Procter from 2000 to 2002, then under Kenneth Feinberg at the law firm now called Feinberg & Rozen LLP from 2002 to 2003.[28][29] From 2003 to 2005, she was an assistant special counsel to the United States Sentencing Commission.[30] From 2005 to 2007, Jackson was an assistant federal public defender in Washington, D.C., where she handled cases before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[31] A review by *The* *Washington Post* of cases Jackson handled during her time as a public defender showed that \"she won uncommon victories against the government that shortened or erased lengthy prison terms\".[32] From 2007 to 2010, Jackson was an appellate specialist in private practice at the law firm of Morrison & Foerster.[29][27]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Sentencing Commission (2010–2014)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2009, President Obama nominated Jackson as vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission.[33][34] The Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote on November 5, 2009. The Senate confirmed her nomination by voice vote on February 11, 2010.[35] She succeeded Michael E. Horowitz, who had served from 2003 until 2009. Jackson served on the Sentencing Commission until 2014.[36][27] During her time on the commission, it retroactively amended the sentencing guidelines to reduce the guideline range for crack cocaine offenses,[37] and enacted the \"drugs minus two\" amendment, which implemented a two offense-level reduction for drug crimes.[38]\n\n\n\n## District Court (2013–2021)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson on the bench of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (pictured in 2019)\nOn September 20, 2012, Obama nominated Jackson to serve as a United States district judge for the District of Columbia to the seat vacated by retiring judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr.[39] Republican U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, a relative by marriage, introduced Jackson at her December 2012 confirmation hearing and said, \"Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji's intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal.\"[8] On February 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote.[40] She was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on March 22, received her commission on March 26,[27] and was sworn in by Justice Breyer in May.[41] Her service as a district judge ended on June 17, 2021, when she was elevated to the court of appeals.[27]\n\n\nDuring her time on the district court, Jackson wrote multiple decisions adverse to the positions of the Trump administration. In her opinion ordering Trump's former White House counsel Don McGahn to comply with a legislative subpoena, she wrote that \"presidents are not kings\".[42] Jackson handled a number of challenges to executive agency actions that raised questions of administrative law. She also issued rulings in several cases that gained particular political attention.[43]\n\n\n*Bloomberg Law* reported in spring 2021 that conservative activists were pointing to certain decisions by Jackson that had been reversed on appeal as a \"potential blemish on her record\".[44] In 2019, Jackson ruled that provisions in three Trump executive orders conflicted with federal employee rights to collective bargaining. Her decision was reversed unanimously by the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit also reversed another 2019 decision, involving a challenge to a Department of Homeland Security decision to expand the agency's definition of which non-citizens can be deported. Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron defended Jackson's record, saying she \"has written nearly 600 opinions and been reversed less than twelve times\".[44]\n\n\n\n### Selected rulings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson in 2020\nIn *American Meat Institute v. U.S. Department of Agriculture* (2013), Jackson rejected the meat packing industry's request for a preliminary injunction to block a United States Department of Agriculture rule requiring them to identify animals' country of origin. Jackson found that the rule likely did not violate the First Amendment.[45][46]\n\n\nIn *Depomed v. Department of Health and Human Services* (2014), Jackson ruled that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it failed to grant pharmaceutical company Depomed market exclusivity for its orphan drug Gralise. She concluded that the Orphan Drug Act required the FDA to grant Gralise exclusivity.[47]\n\n\nIn *Pierce v. District of Columbia* (2015), Jackson ruled that the D.C. Department of Corrections violated the rights of a deaf inmate under the Americans with Disabilities Act because jail officials failed to provide the inmate with reasonable accommodations, or to assess his need for reasonable accommodations, during his detention in 2012. She held that \"the District's willful blindness regarding\" Pierce's need for accommodation and its half-hearted attempt to provide Pierce with a random assortment of auxiliary aids—and only after he specifically requested them—fell far short of what the law requires.\"[48]\n\n\nIn April and June 2018, Jackson presided over two cases challenging the Department of Health and Human Services' decision to terminate grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs two years early.[49] She ruled that the decision to terminate the grants early without explanation was arbitrary and capricious.[50]\n\n\nIn *American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump* (2018), Jackson invalidated provisions of three executive orders that would have limited the time federal employee labor union officials could spend with union members, the issues that unions could bargain over in negotiations, and the rights of disciplined workers to appeal disciplinary actions. She ruled that the executive orders violated the right of federal employees to collectively bargain, as guaranteed by the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.[51] The D.C. Circuit vacated this ruling on jurisdictional grounds in 2019.[52][53]\n\n\nIn 2018, Jackson dismissed 40 wrongful death and product liability lawsuits stemming from the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which had been combined into a single multidistrict litigation. She held that under the doctrine of *forum non conveniens*, the suits should be brought in Malaysia, not the U.S. The D.C. Circuit affirmed this ruling in 2020.[54][55][56][57]\n\n\nIn 2019, in *Center for Biological Diversity v. McAleenan*, Jackson held that Congress had, through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to hear non-constitutional challenges to the United States Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to waive certain environmental requirements to facilitate construction of a border wall on the United States and Mexico border.[58]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a preliminary injunction in *Make The Road New York v. McAleenan*, blocking a Trump administration rule that would have expanded expedited removal (\"fast-track\" deportations) without immigration court hearings for undocumented immigrants.[59] She found that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because its decision was arbitrary and capricious and the agency did not seek public comment before issuing the rule.[60] In a 2–1 ruling in 2020, the D.C. Circuit reversed the entry of the preliminary injunction, ruling that the IIRIRA (by committing the matter to the executive branch's \"sole and unreviewable discretion\") precluded APA review of the decision.[61]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a ruling in *Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Representatives v. McGahn*, in which the House Committee on the Judiciary sued former White House Counsel Don McGahn to compel him to comply with the subpoena to appear at an impeachment inquiry hearing on issues of alleged obstruction of justice by the Trump administration. McGahn declined to comply with the subpoena after President Donald Trump, relying on a legal theory of executive testimonial immunity, ordered McGahn not to testify. In a lengthy opinion, Jackson ruled in favor of the House Committee and held that senior-level presidential aides \"who have been subpoenaed for testimony by an authorized committee of Congress must appear for testimony in response to that subpoena\" even if the president orders them not to do so.[62] Jackson rejected the administration's assertion of executive testimonial immunity by holding that \"with respect to senior-level presidential aides, absolute immunity from compelled congressional process simply does not exist\".[63] According to her, that conclusion was \"inescapable precisely because compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct, not a political one, and per the Constitution, no one is above the law.\"[63][64][65] Jackson's use of the phrase \"presidents are not kings\" gained popular attention in subsequent media reporting on the ruling.[66][67][68][69] Noting that she took four months to resolve the case, including writing a 120-page opinion, *The Washington Post* wrote: \"That slow pace contributed to helping Mr. Trump run out the clock on the congressional oversight effort before the 2020 election.\"[8] The ruling was appealed by the United States Department of Justice,[70] and the D.C. Circuit affirmed part of Jackson's decision in August 2020.[71] While the case remained pending, on June 4, 2021, McGahn testified behind closed doors under an agreement reached with the Biden administration.[72]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals (2021–2022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson with Justice Stephen BreyerOn March 30, 2021, President Biden announced his intention to nominate Jackson as a United States circuit judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.[73] On April 19, 2021, her nomination was sent to the Senate. Biden nominated Jackson to the seat vacated by Judge Merrick Garland, who had stepped down to become U.S. Attorney General.[74] The American Bar Association appraised Jackson as \"well qualified with no recusals or abstentions\".[75]\n\n\nOn April 28, 2021, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[76] During her confirmation hearing, Jackson was questioned about several of her rulings against the Trump administration.[77] On May 20, Jackson's nomination was reported out of committee by a 13–9 vote.[78] On June 8, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture on her nomination. On June 10, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 52–46 vote.[79] On June 14, her nomination was confirmed by a 53–44 vote. Republican senators Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham, and Lisa Murkowski joined all 50 Democrats in voting to confirm Jackson.[80] She received her judicial commission on June 17, 2021.[81] Her service as a circuit judge ended on June 29, 2022, the day before she was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.[27]\n\n\nIn her first written opinion for the court of appeals, Jackson, joined by the rest of the panel, invalidated a 2020 rule by the Federal Labor Relations Authority that had restricted the bargaining power of federal-sector labor unions.[82]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Jackson delivers remarks on her nomination in the Grand Foyer of the White House. (February 25, 2022)\n![](image)Justice Breyer administering the Judicial Oath to Jackson (June 30, 2022)\nIn early 2016, Obama administration officials vetted Jackson as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[83][84][85] Jackson was one of five candidates interviewed as a potential nominee.[86]\n\n\nIn early 2022, news outlets speculated that Biden would nominate Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill the seat vacated by Justice Breyer.[87][88][89][90] Biden pledged during the 2020 United States presidential election campaign to appoint a Black woman to the court should a vacancy occur.[87] Jackson's appointment to the D.C. Circuit, considered the second-most influential federal court, was viewed as preparation for a potential promotion to the Supreme Court.[91]\n\n\nJackson's potential nomination to the Supreme Court was supported by civil rights and liberal advocacy organizations.[19] Her potential nomination was opposed by Republican Party leaders and senators.[92][93][94] *The Washington Post* wrote that Jackson's experience as a public defender \"has endeared her to the more liberal base of the Democratic Party\".[95] While her supporters have touted her history as a public defender as an asset, during her 2021 confirmation hearing, Republicans tried to cast it as a liability.[32]\n\n\nOn February 25, 2022, Biden announced that Jackson was his nominee to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court.[96] Her nomination was sent to the Senate on February 28.[97] Her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee was held on March 21.[98] After the Judiciary Committee deadlocked on her nomination by an 11–11 vote, the Senate discharged the committee from further consideration of her nomination by a 53–47 vote.[99][100][101][102] The next day, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of her nomination by a 53–47 vote,[103] and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer then filed cloture on her nomination.[104] On April 7, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 53–47 vote.[105][106] Later that day, she was confirmed by the same margin.[107] Republicans Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins joined all Democrats in confirming Jackson to the Supreme Court.[108] She received her judicial commission as an associate justice on April 8.[27] She was sworn in and became an associate justice at noon on June 30, 2022, when Breyer's retirement went into effect.[109][110][111][112]\n\n\n\n## U. S. Supreme Court (2022–present)[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court released its final merit opinions on the morning of June 30, 2022. At noon, Breyer officially retired and Jackson was sworn in, becoming the first Black woman[13][11] and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.[113][114][115][116]\n\n\nOn July 21, Jackson voted on her first Supreme Court case, joining the dissent in a 5–4 decision refusing to block a district court ruling that prevented the Biden administration from setting new enforcement priorities for immigrants entering the U.S. or living in the country illegally.[117] She participated in her first oral argument as an associate justice on October 3, in *Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency*.[118] On November 7 she wrote her first opinion, a two-page dissent from a denial of review in the case of a death row inmate in *Chinn v. Shoop*; the opinion was joined by Justice Sotomayor.[119]\n\n\nTwo contributors to *SCOTUSBlog* noted that, since joining the Court at the beginning of the 2022 term, Jackson was the most active participant in oral arguments, speaking an average of 1,350 words per argument, while the eight other justices each spoke on average fewer than 1,000.[120] On February 28, 2023, Jackson authored her first majority opinion for a unanimous court in *Delaware v. Pennsylvania*, which involved how unclaimed money from MoneyGrams are distributed among individual states.[121]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2022, Jackson was assigned as the circuit justice for the First Circuit.[122]\n\n\n\n### Labor disputes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, Jackson wrote the sole dissenting opinion in Glacier Northwest, Inc. v. Teamsters, concerning the power of employers to sue labor unions regarding the destruction of employer property following a strike. She wrote that the majority's decision failed \"Congress's intent with respect to the Board's primary role in adjudicating labor disputes\" and ran the risk of potential \"erosion of the right to strike\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Judicial philosophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson at the James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner on February 24, 2020\nJackson says she does not have a particular judicial philosophy;[124] instead, she says she has a perspective on legal analysis or a \"judicial methodology\".[125][126] Though she has not embraced the label, Jackson has expressed that she sees value in originalism, saying the \"Constitution is fixed in its meaning\", and has explicitly criticized living constitutionalism.[126]\n\n\nIn January 2022, *The New York Times* reported that Jackson had \"not yet written a body of appeals court opinions expressing a legal philosophy\" because she had joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the summer of 2021. However, *The Times* said, Jackson's earlier rulings \"comported with those of a liberal-leaning judge\", including her opinions blocking various Trump administration actions.[8] Additionally, a review of over 500 of her judicial opinions indicated that she would likely be as liberal as Breyer, the justice she replaced.[127]\n\n\nAccording to Sahil Kapur, writing for NBC News, \"Jackson fits well with the Democratic Party and the progressive movement's agenda\" due to her relative youth, background as a public defender, and history of labor-friendly rulings.[128]\n\n\n*Politico* reported that \"Jackson is popular with liberal legal activists looking to replace Breyer with a justice willing to engage in ideological combat with the court's conservatives.\"[129]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Jackson married surgeon Patrick Graves Jackson, whom she met at Harvard College.[130] He is a descendant of Continental Congress delegate Jonathan Jackson[131] and is related to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.[132] The couple have two daughters.[133][134][135] Jackson is a non-denominational Protestant.[136] In a 2017 speech, she said, \"I am fairly certain that if you traced my family lineage back past my grandparents—who were raised in Georgia, by the way—you would find that my ancestors were slaves on both sides.\"[137] Jackson's paternal ancestry can be traced to Houston County, Georgia,[138] while her maternal ancestry can be traced to Calhoun County, Georgia.[139] Through her marriage, Jackson is related to former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.[140]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nJackson is a member of the Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services as well as Harvard University's Board of Overseers and the Council of the American Law Institute.[141] She also serves on the board of Georgetown Day School[142] and the U.S. Supreme Court Fellows Commission.[143]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2011, she served on the advisory board of Montrose Christian School, a Baptist school.[144] Jackson has served as a judge in several mock trials with the Shakespeare Theatre Company[145][146][147] and for the Historical Society of the District of Columbia's Mock Court Program.[148] In 2018, she presided over a mock trial hosted by Drexel University's Thomas R. Kline School of Law \"to determine if Vice President Aaron Burr was guilty of murdering\" Alexander Hamilton.[149]\n\n\nIn 2017, Jackson presented at the University of Georgia School of Law's 35th Edith House Lecture.[150] In 2018, she was a panelist at the National Constitution Center's town hall on Alexander Hamilton's legacy.[151] In 2020, Jackson gave the Martin Luther King Jr. Day lecture at the University of Michigan Law School[152] and was honored at the University of Chicago Law School's third annual Judge James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner, hosted by the school's Black Law Students Association.[153] In 2022, she received the Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award, presented by Awards Council members Justice Amy Coney Barrett and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.[154][155]\n\n\nJackson became an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority in 2023.[156]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n* Recent Case (1995). \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) – Scope of Liability after Reves v.

Jackson was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Joe Biden on February 25, 2022, and confirmed by the U.S. Senate and sworn into office that same year.[1][2] She is the first black woman and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\n\nJackson was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Miami, Florida. She received her undergraduate and legal education at Harvard University, where she served as an editor of the *Harvard Law Review*, and clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer, whose seat she later assumed on the Supreme Court.[3] From 2010 to 2014, Jackson was the vice chairwoman of the United States Sentencing Commission. In 2013, President Barack Obama appointed her as a district judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, where she served until 2021. Since 2016, Jackson has been a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJackson was born on September 14, 1970, in Washington, D.C.,[4] to parents who had been educated at historically black colleges and universities.[5][6][7] Her father, Johnny Brown, attended the University of Miami School of Law and became chief attorney for the Miami-Dade County School Board. Her mother, Ellery, was school principal at the New World School of the Arts in Miami.[8][9] One of her uncles, Calvin Ross, served as the chief of the Miami Police Department.[8]\n\n\nJackson grew up in Miami and attended Miami Palmetto Senior High School.[10] She distinguished herself as a champion debater,[11] winning the national oratory title at the National Catholic Forensic League championships in New Orleans during her senior year.[12] She has recalled her experience with high school debate as one \"that I can say without hesitation was the one activity that best prepared me for future success in law and in life.\"[13] In 1988, Jackson graduated from Palmetto as senior class president.[11][14] In her high school yearbook, she was quoted as saying that she wanted \"to go into law and eventually have a judicial appointment\".[15]\n\n\nAfter high school, Jackson matriculated at Harvard University to study government, having applied despite her guidance counselor's advice to set her sights lower.[16] She took classes in drama and performed improv comedy, forming a diverse friend group.[17][18] As a member of the Black Students Association, she led protests against a student who displayed a Confederate flag from his dormitory window and protested the lack of full-time professors in the Afro-American Studies Department. While a freshman, Jackson enrolled in Michael Sandel's course *Justice*, which she has called a major influence during her undergraduate years.[18]\n\n\nIn 1989, when Jackson was a college student, an uncle, Thomas Brown Jr., was sentenced to life in prison for a nonviolent cocaine conviction after federal agents found 14 kilograms of cocaine wrapped in duct tape. Years later, Jackson persuaded a law firm to take his case *pro bono*, and President Barack Obama eventually commuted his sentence.[19][20]\n\n\nJackson graduated from Harvard in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts, *magna cum laude*.[21][11] Her senior thesis was titled \"The Hand of Oppression: Plea Bargaining Processes and the Coercion of Criminal Defendants\".[22] From 1992 to 1993, Jackson worked as a staff reporter and researcher for *Time* magazine,[23] attending Harvard Law School shortly afterward. She was a supervising editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1996 with a Juris Doctor, *cum laude*.[24][25]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Jackson served as a law clerk to Judge Patti B. Saris of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts from 1996 to 1997,[23] then to Judge Bruce M. Selya of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit from 1997 to 1998.[26] She spent a year in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm of Miller Cassidy Larroca & Lewin (now part of Baker Botts), then clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer from 1999 to 2000.[10][27]\n\n\nJackson returned to private legal practice at the law firm of Goodwin Procter from 2000 to 2002, then under Kenneth Feinberg at the law firm now called Feinberg & Rozen LLP from 2002 to 2003.[28][29] From 2003 to 2005, she was an assistant special counsel to the United States Sentencing Commission.[30] From 2005 to 2007, Jackson was an assistant federal public defender in Washington, D.C., where she handled cases before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.[31] A review by *The* *Washington Post* of cases Jackson handled during her time as a public defender showed that \"she won uncommon victories against the government that shortened or erased lengthy prison terms\".[32] From 2007 to 2010, Jackson was an appellate specialist in private practice at the law firm of Morrison & Foerster.[29][27]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Sentencing Commission (2010–2014)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2009, President Obama nominated Jackson as vice chair of the United States Sentencing Commission.[33][34] The Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote on November 5, 2009. The Senate confirmed her nomination by voice vote on February 11, 2010.[35] She succeeded Michael E. Horowitz, who had served from 2003 until 2009. Jackson served on the Sentencing Commission until 2014.[36][27] During her time on the commission, it retroactively amended the sentencing guidelines to reduce the guideline range for crack cocaine offenses,[37] and enacted the \"drugs minus two\" amendment, which implemented a two offense-level reduction for drug crimes.[38]\n\n\n\n## District Court (2013–2021)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson on the bench of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (pictured in 2019)\nOn September 20, 2012, Obama nominated Jackson to serve as a United States district judge for the District of Columbia to the seat vacated by retiring judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr.[39] Republican U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, a relative by marriage, introduced Jackson at her December 2012 confirmation hearing and said, \"Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji's intellect, for her character, for her integrity, it is unequivocal.\"[8] On February 14, 2013, the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably reported her nomination by voice vote.[40] She was confirmed by the Senate by voice vote on March 22, received her commission on March 26,[27] and was sworn in by Justice Breyer in May.[41] Her service as a district judge ended on June 17, 2021, when she was elevated to the court of appeals.[27]\n\n\nDuring her time on the district court, Jackson wrote multiple decisions adverse to the positions of the Trump administration. In her opinion ordering Trump's former White House counsel Don McGahn to comply with a legislative subpoena, she wrote that \"presidents are not kings\".[42] Jackson handled a number of challenges to executive agency actions that raised questions of administrative law. She also issued rulings in several cases that gained particular political attention.[43]\n\n\n*Bloomberg Law* reported in spring 2021 that conservative activists were pointing to certain decisions by Jackson that had been reversed on appeal as a \"potential blemish on her record\".[44] In 2019, Jackson ruled that provisions in three Trump executive orders conflicted with federal employee rights to collective bargaining. Her decision was reversed unanimously by the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit also reversed another 2019 decision, involving a challenge to a Department of Homeland Security decision to expand the agency's definition of which non-citizens can be deported. Alliance for Justice President Nan Aron defended Jackson's record, saying she \"has written nearly 600 opinions and been reversed less than twelve times\".[44]\n\n\n\n### Selected rulings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackson in 2020\nIn *American Meat Institute v. U.S. Department of Agriculture* (2013), Jackson rejected the meat packing industry's request for a preliminary injunction to block a United States Department of Agriculture rule requiring them to identify animals' country of origin. Jackson found that the rule likely did not violate the First Amendment.[45][46]\n\n\nIn *Depomed v. Department of Health and Human Services* (2014), Jackson ruled that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it failed to grant pharmaceutical company Depomed market exclusivity for its orphan drug Gralise. She concluded that the Orphan Drug Act required the FDA to grant Gralise exclusivity.[47]\n\n\nIn *Pierce v. District of Columbia* (2015), Jackson ruled that the D.C. Department of Corrections violated the rights of a deaf inmate under the Americans with Disabilities Act because jail officials failed to provide the inmate with reasonable accommodations, or to assess his need for reasonable accommodations, during his detention in 2012. She held that \"the District's willful blindness regarding\" Pierce's need for accommodation and its half-hearted attempt to provide Pierce with a random assortment of auxiliary aids—and only after he specifically requested them—fell far short of what the law requires.\"[48]\n\n\nIn April and June 2018, Jackson presided over two cases challenging the Department of Health and Human Services' decision to terminate grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs two years early.[49] She ruled that the decision to terminate the grants early without explanation was arbitrary and capricious.[50]\n\n\nIn *American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v. Trump* (2018), Jackson invalidated provisions of three executive orders that would have limited the time federal employee labor union officials could spend with union members, the issues that unions could bargain over in negotiations, and the rights of disciplined workers to appeal disciplinary actions. She ruled that the executive orders violated the right of federal employees to collectively bargain, as guaranteed by the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.[51] The D.C. Circuit vacated this ruling on jurisdictional grounds in 2019.[52][53]\n\n\nIn 2018, Jackson dismissed 40 wrongful death and product liability lawsuits stemming from the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which had been combined into a single multidistrict litigation. She held that under the doctrine of *forum non conveniens*, the suits should be brought in Malaysia, not the U.S. The D.C. Circuit affirmed this ruling in 2020.[54][55][56][57]\n\n\nIn 2019, in *Center for Biological Diversity v. McAleenan*, Jackson held that Congress had, through the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, stripped federal courts of jurisdiction to hear non-constitutional challenges to the United States Secretary of Homeland Security's decision to waive certain environmental requirements to facilitate construction of a border wall on the United States and Mexico border.[58]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a preliminary injunction in *Make The Road New York v. McAleenan*, blocking a Trump administration rule that would have expanded expedited removal (\"fast-track\" deportations) without immigration court hearings for undocumented immigrants.[59] She found that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because its decision was arbitrary and capricious and the agency did not seek public comment before issuing the rule.[60] In a 2–1 ruling in 2020, the D.C. Circuit reversed the entry of the preliminary injunction, ruling that the IIRIRA (by committing the matter to the executive branch's \"sole and unreviewable discretion\") precluded APA review of the decision.[61]\n\n\nIn 2019, Jackson issued a ruling in *Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Representatives v. McGahn*, in which the House Committee on the Judiciary sued former White House Counsel Don McGahn to compel him to comply with the subpoena to appear at an impeachment inquiry hearing on issues of alleged obstruction of justice by the Trump administration. McGahn declined to comply with the subpoena after President Donald Trump, relying on a legal theory of executive testimonial immunity, ordered McGahn not to testify. In a lengthy opinion, Jackson ruled in favor of the House Committee and held that senior-level presidential aides \"who have been subpoenaed for testimony by an authorized committee of Congress must appear for testimony in response to that subpoena\" even if the president orders them not to do so.[62] Jackson rejected the administration's assertion of executive testimonial immunity by holding that \"with respect to senior-level presidential aides, absolute immunity from compelled congressional process simply does not exist\".[63] According to her, that conclusion was \"inescapable precisely because compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena is a legal construct, not a political one, and per the Constitution, no one is above the law.\"[63][64][65] Jackson's use of the phrase \"presidents are not kings\" gained popular attention in subsequent media reporting on the ruling.[66][67][68][69] Noting that she took four months to resolve the case, including writing a 120-page opinion, *The Washington Post* wrote: \"That slow pace contributed to helping Mr. Trump run out the clock on the congressional oversight effort before the 2020 election.\"[8] The ruling was appealed by the United States Department of Justice,[70] and the D.C. Circuit affirmed part of Jackson's decision in August 2020.[71] While the case remained pending, on June 4, 2021, McGahn testified behind closed doors under an agreement reached with the Biden administration.[72]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals (2021–2022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson with Justice Stephen BreyerOn March 30, 2021, President Biden announced his intention to nominate Jackson as a United States circuit judge for the District of Columbia Circuit.[73] On April 19, 2021, her nomination was sent to the Senate. Biden nominated Jackson to the seat vacated by Judge Merrick Garland, who had stepped down to become U.S. Attorney General.[74] The American Bar Association appraised Jackson as \"well qualified with no recusals or abstentions\".[75]\n\n\nOn April 28, 2021, a hearing on her nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[76] During her confirmation hearing, Jackson was questioned about several of her rulings against the Trump administration.[77] On May 20, Jackson's nomination was reported out of committee by a 13–9 vote.[78] On June 8, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer filed cloture on her nomination. On June 10, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 52–46 vote.[79] On June 14, her nomination was confirmed by a 53–44 vote. Republican senators Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham, and Lisa Murkowski joined all 50 Democrats in voting to confirm Jackson.[80] She received her judicial commission on June 17, 2021.[81] Her service as a circuit judge ended on June 29, 2022, the day before she was sworn in as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.[27]\n\n\nIn her first written opinion for the court of appeals, Jackson, joined by the rest of the panel, invalidated a 2020 rule by the Federal Labor Relations Authority that had restricted the bargaining power of federal-sector labor unions.[82]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ketanji Brown Jackson Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Jackson delivers remarks on her nomination in the Grand Foyer of the White House. (February 25, 2022)\n![](image)Justice Breyer administering the Judicial Oath to Jackson (June 30, 2022)\nIn early 2016, Obama administration officials vetted Jackson as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States to fill the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.[83][84][85] Jackson was one of five candidates interviewed as a potential nominee.[86]\n\n\nIn early 2022, news outlets speculated that Biden would nominate Jackson to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill the seat vacated by Justice Breyer.[87][88][89][90] Biden pledged during the 2020 United States presidential election campaign to appoint a Black woman to the court should a vacancy occur.[87] Jackson's appointment to the D.C. Circuit, considered the second-most influential federal court, was viewed as preparation for a potential promotion to the Supreme Court.[91]\n\n\nJackson's potential nomination to the Supreme Court was supported by civil rights and liberal advocacy organizations.[19] Her potential nomination was opposed by Republican Party leaders and senators.[92][93][94] *The Washington Post* wrote that Jackson's experience as a public defender \"has endeared her to the more liberal base of the Democratic Party\".[95] While her supporters have touted her history as a public defender as an asset, during her 2021 confirmation hearing, Republicans tried to cast it as a liability.[32]\n\n\nOn February 25, 2022, Biden announced that Jackson was his nominee to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court.[96] Her nomination was sent to the Senate on February 28.[97] Her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee was held on March 21.[98] After the Judiciary Committee deadlocked on her nomination by an 11–11 vote, the Senate discharged the committee from further consideration of her nomination by a 53–47 vote.[99][100][101][102] The next day, the Senate proceeded to the consideration of her nomination by a 53–47 vote,[103] and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer then filed cloture on her nomination.[104] On April 7, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 53–47 vote.[105][106] Later that day, she was confirmed by the same margin.[107] Republicans Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, and Susan Collins joined all Democrats in confirming Jackson to the Supreme Court.[108] She received her judicial commission as an associate justice on April 8.[27] She was sworn in and became an associate justice at noon on June 30, 2022, when Breyer's retirement went into effect.[109][110][111][112]\n\n\n\n## U. S. Supreme Court (2022–present)[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court released its final merit opinions on the morning of June 30, 2022. At noon, Breyer officially retired and Jackson was sworn in, becoming the first Black woman[13][11] and the first former federal public defender to serve on the Supreme Court.[113][114][115][116]\n\n\nOn July 21, Jackson voted on her first Supreme Court case, joining the dissent in a 5–4 decision refusing to block a district court ruling that prevented the Biden administration from setting new enforcement priorities for immigrants entering the U.S. or living in the country illegally.[117] She participated in her first oral argument as an associate justice on October 3, in *Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency*.[118] On November 7 she wrote her first opinion, a two-page dissent from a denial of review in the case of a death row inmate in *Chinn v. Shoop*; the opinion was joined by Justice Sotomayor.[119]\n\n\nTwo contributors to *SCOTUSBlog* noted that, since joining the Court at the beginning of the 2022 term, Jackson was the most active participant in oral arguments, speaking an average of 1,350 words per argument, while the eight other justices each spoke on average fewer than 1,000.[120] On February 28, 2023, Jackson authored her first majority opinion for a unanimous court in *Delaware v. Pennsylvania*, which involved how unclaimed money from MoneyGrams are distributed among individual states.[121]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2022, Jackson was assigned as the circuit justice for the First Circuit.[122]\n\n\n\n### Labor disputes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, Jackson wrote the sole dissenting opinion in Glacier Northwest, Inc. v. Teamsters, concerning the power of employers to sue labor unions regarding the destruction of employer property following a strike. She wrote that the majority's decision failed \"Congress's intent with respect to the Board's primary role in adjudicating labor disputes\" and ran the risk of potential \"erosion of the right to strike\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Judicial philosophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Jackson at the James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner on February 24, 2020\nJackson says she does not have a particular judicial philosophy;[124] instead, she says she has a perspective on legal analysis or a \"judicial methodology\".[125][126] Though she has not embraced the label, Jackson has expressed that she sees value in originalism, saying the \"Constitution is fixed in its meaning\", and has explicitly criticized living constitutionalism.[126]\n\n\nIn January 2022, *The New York Times* reported that Jackson had \"not yet written a body of appeals court opinions expressing a legal philosophy\" because she had joined the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the summer of 2021. However, *The Times* said, Jackson's earlier rulings \"comported with those of a liberal-leaning judge\", including her opinions blocking various Trump administration actions.[8] Additionally, a review of over 500 of her judicial opinions indicated that she would likely be as liberal as Breyer, the justice she replaced.[127]\n\n\nAccording to Sahil Kapur, writing for NBC News, \"Jackson fits well with the Democratic Party and the progressive movement's agenda\" due to her relative youth, background as a public defender, and history of labor-friendly rulings.[128]\n\n\n*Politico* reported that \"Jackson is popular with liberal legal activists looking to replace Breyer with a justice willing to engage in ideological combat with the court's conservatives.\"[129]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Jackson married surgeon Patrick Graves Jackson, whom she met at Harvard College.[130] He is a descendant of Continental Congress delegate Jonathan Jackson[131] and is related to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.[132] The couple have two daughters.[133][134][135] Jackson is a non-denominational Protestant.[136] In a 2017 speech, she said, \"I am fairly certain that if you traced my family lineage back past my grandparents—who were raised in Georgia, by the way—you would find that my ancestors were slaves on both sides.\"[137] Jackson's paternal ancestry can be traced to Houston County, Georgia,[138] while her maternal ancestry can be traced to Calhoun County, Georgia.[139] Through her marriage, Jackson is related to former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.[140]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nJackson is a member of the Judicial Conference Committee on Defender Services as well as Harvard University's Board of Overseers and the Council of the American Law Institute.[141] She also serves on the board of Georgetown Day School[142] and the U.S. Supreme Court Fellows Commission.[143]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2011, she served on the advisory board of Montrose Christian School, a Baptist school.[144] Jackson has served as a judge in several mock trials with the Shakespeare Theatre Company[145][146][147] and for the Historical Society of the District of Columbia's Mock Court Program.[148] In 2018, she presided over a mock trial hosted by Drexel University's Thomas R. Kline School of Law \"to determine if Vice President Aaron Burr was guilty of murdering\" Alexander Hamilton.[149]\n\n\nIn 2017, Jackson presented at the University of Georgia School of Law's 35th Edith House Lecture.[150] In 2018, she was a panelist at the National Constitution Center's town hall on Alexander Hamilton's legacy.[151] In 2020, Jackson gave the Martin Luther King Jr. Day lecture at the University of Michigan Law School[152] and was honored at the University of Chicago Law School's third annual Judge James B. Parsons Legacy Dinner, hosted by the school's Black Law Students Association.[153] In 2022, she received the Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award, presented by Awards Council members Justice Amy Coney Barrett and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.[154][155]\n\n\nJackson became an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority in 2023.[156]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n* Recent Case (1995). \"Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) – Scope of Liability after Reves v.
