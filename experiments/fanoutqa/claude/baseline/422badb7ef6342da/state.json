It is given in honor of a film director who has exhibited outstanding directing while working in the film industry.\nThe award is traditionally presented by the previous year's Best Director winner.\n\n\nThe 1st Academy Awards ceremony was held in 1929 with the award being split into \"Dramatic\" and \"Comedy\" categories; Frank Borzage and Lewis Milestone won for *7th Heaven* and *Two Arabian Knights*, respectively.[1] However, these categories were merged for all subsequent ceremonies.[2] Nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the directors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the academy.[3][4][5]\n\n\nFor the first eleven years of the Academy Awards, directors were allowed to be nominated for multiple films in the same year. However, after the nomination of Michael Curtiz for two films, *Angels with Dirty Faces* and *Four Daughters*, at the 11th Academy Awards, the rules were revised so that an individual could only be nominated for one film at each ceremony.[6] That rule has since been amended, although the only director who has received multiple nominations in the same year was Steven Soderbergh for *Erin Brockovich* and *Traffic* in 2000, winning the award for the latter. The Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 89 films that won Best Picture and were also nominated for Best Director, 68 won the award.[7][8]\n\n\nSince its inception, the award has been given to 74 directors or directing teams. As of the 2023 ceremony, American filmmaking duo Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert are the most recent winner in this category for their work on *Everything Everywhere All at Once* and the third duo to win after Robert Wise & Jerome Robbins (*West Side Story*) and the Coen brothers (*No Country for Old Men*).\n\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nIn the following table, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release in Los Angeles County, California; the ceremonies are always held the following year.[9] For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned twelve months from August 1 to July 31.[10] For the 6th ceremony held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932, to December 31, 1933.[10] Since the 7th ceremony held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Frank Borzage won twice: \"Dramatic director\" at the first ceremony, for *7th Heaven* (1927); & later, *Bad Girl* (1931).\n![](image)Lewis Milestone won twice: \"Comedy director\" at the first ceremony, for *Two Arabian Knights* (1927); & later, *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930).\n![](image)Frank Lloyd won twice, for *The Divine Lady* (1929) & *Cavalcade* (1933).\n![](image)Frank Capra won thrice, for *It Happened One Night* (1934), *Mr. Deeds Goes to Town* (1936), & *You Can't Take It with You* (1938).\n![](image)John Ford won a record four times, for: *The Informer* (1935), *The Grapes of Wrath* (1940), *How Green Was My Valley* (1941), & *The Quiet Man* (1952).\n![](image)Leo McCarey won twice, for *The Awful Truth* (1937) & *Going My Way* (1944).\n![](image)Victor Fleming won for *Gone with the Wind* (1939).\n![](image)William Wyler, with a record twelve nominations, won thrice, for: *Mrs. Miniver* (1942), *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946), & *Ben-Hur* (1959).\n![](image)Michael Curtiz won for *Casablanca* (1942).\n![](image)Billy Wilder (*right*, with Gloria Swanson) won twice, for *The Lost Weekend* (1945) & *The Apartment* (1960).\n![](image)Elia Kazan won twice, for *Gentleman's Agreement* (1947) & *On the Waterfront* (1954).\n![](image)John Huston won for *The Treasure of the Sierra Madre* (1948).\n![](image)Joseph L.

However, the Academy subsequently decided to remove Chaplin's name from the competitive award categories and instead to confer upon him a Special Award \"for acting, writing, directing and producing *The Circus*\". Chilton, Martin (May 16, 2016). \"The first Oscars: what happened in 1929\". *The Daily Telegraph*. Archived from the original on May 19, 2016. Retrieved February 25, 2021.\n2. **^** The 2nd Academy Awards is unique in being the only occasion where there were no official nominees. Subsequent research by AMPAS has resulted in a list of unofficial or *de facto* nominees, based on records of which films were evaluated by the judges.\n3. **^** Michael Curtiz was not on the original ballot of nominees. However, after the year prior with Bette Davis's omission for *Of Human Bondage*, the resulting furor led to a write-in campaign determined to secure her a nomination. Thus, the Academy relaxed their rules and allowed her performance to be amongst the competition. They permitted this once more, prompting further submissions: Curtiz; Paul Muni for *Black Fury*; and several other categories, including Hal Mohr for *A Midsummer Night's Dream*. Ultimately, Mohr became the only person to win an Oscar as a result of this process. The Academy discontinued this option from the next ceremony forward to prevent any recurrence.\n4. **^** The eligibility period for the 93rd ceremony was extended through to February 28, 2021, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* BAFTA Award for Best Direction\n* Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Director\n* Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing \u2013 Feature Film\n* Golden Globe Award for Best Director\n* Independent Spirit Award for Best Director\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Dirks, Tim. \"1927\u201328 Academy Awards Winners\".
