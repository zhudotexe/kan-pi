It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the European world.\n\n\nThe Labrador is friendly, energetic, and playful.[2] It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is widely kept as a companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.[3]\n\n\nIn the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews, the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,[4] imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gun dogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland fishing dogs was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury, who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the Labrador Retriever breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. The offspring are the ancestors of all modern Labradors.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buccleuch Avon, whelped in 1885\nThe Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European settlers in Newfoundland were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorset. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger Newfoundland and the Lesser Newfoundland, with Charles St. John even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel Peter Hawker describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an English Pointer, more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs, and short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland.[6] Hawker distinguishes the Newfoundland from both the \"proper Labrador\" and St. John's breed of these dogs[6][7] in the fifth edition of his book *Instructions to Young Sportsmen*, published in 1846.[7]\n\n\nBy 1870 the name Labrador Retriever had become common in England.[8] The liver (now usually called chocolate) Labrador emerged in the late 1800s, with liver-coloured pups documented at the Buccleuch kennels in 1892;[9] the first yellow Labrador on record was born in 1899 (Ben of Hyde, kennels of Major C.J. Radclyffe).[10] The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1903.[11] The first American Kennel Club (AKC) registration was in 1917.[12]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The head is broad with a pronounced stop.\n![](image)Black\n![](image)Chocolate\nThere is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard.[2] Significant differences between UK and U.S. standards are noted.\n\n\n\n* **Size**: Labradors are a medium-large breed. They should be as long from the withers to the base of the tail as they are from the floor to the withers. The AKC standard includes an ideal weight for dogs of 25\u201336\u00a0kg (55\u201380\u00a0lb) and for bitches as 25\u201332\u00a0kg (55\u201370\u00a0lb).[2] The guidelines for height vary between the AKC, which gives 55 to 62 centimetres (21.5 to 24.5\u00a0in) for dogs and 55 to 60 centimetres (21.5 to 23.5\u00a0in) for bitches,[2] The Kennel Club which advises that dogs should be 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22.5\u00a0in) with bitches between 55 and 56 centimetres (21.5 and 22\u00a0in),[13] and the FCI which quotes a range of 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22.5\u00a0in) for dogs with bitches ideal at 54 to 56 centimetres (21.5 to 22\u00a0in).[14]\n* **Coat**: The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to the water in the winter. That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.[15]\n* **Head**: The head should be broad with slightly pronounced eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. The lining around the eyes should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and be set slightly above the eyes.\n* **Jaws**: The jaws should be strong and powerful. The muzzle should be of medium length and should not be too tapered. The jaws should hang slightly and curve gracefully back.\n* **Body**: The body should have a powerful and muscular build.\n\n\nThe tail and coat are designated \"distinctive [or distinguishing] features\" of the Labrador by both the Kennel Club and AKC.[2][13] The AKC adds that the \"true Labrador Retriever temperament is as much a hallmark of the breed as the 'otter' tail.\"[2]\n\n\n\n### Colour[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Labrador Retriever coat colour genetics\n\n![three Labrador retrievers: Yellow, black, and chocolate](image)The three colour varieties, from front to back: Yellow, black, and chocolate\nLabradors are registered in three colours: Solid *black*, *yellow* (anything from creamy white to fox-red), and *chocolate* (medium to dark brown; originally called \"liver\").[16]\n\n\nPuppies of all colours can occur in the same litter. Coat colour is determined primarily by three genes, called *MC1R*, *Agouti*, and *CBD103*. If a dog carries wild type alleles at all three loci, the dog will have a yellow coat. If a dog has a loss-of-function mutation at MC1R, it will also have a yellow coat, regardless of the genotypes at the other two loci. Dogs carrying wild-type alleles for MC1R and Agouti, together with the black allele of CBD103, will have a black coat.[17][a]\n\n\nAccording to a 2011 study, 13 out of 245\u00a0Labradors studied were heterozygous for the M264V mutation responsible for the melanistic mask, and one was homozygous. Within this breed, the trait cannot be determined simply by appearance.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, and the rims of the eyes.\n### Show and field lines[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Head and muzzle appearance: field (left), and show (right), showing the shorter muzzle length, more solid appearance head, and \"pronounced\" stop of the latter\nAs a result of specialised breeding, there are significant differences between field and trial-bred and show-bred lines of Labradors. In the United States, the former are sometimes mistakenly referred to as \"American\" and the latter as \"English\", in fact, both field and show types are bred in both countries and all Labrador Retrievers are descended from British lines.[19]\n\n\n\n## Use[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Retrieving shot game, a common wood pigeon\nLabrador Retrievers have proven to have a high success rate at becoming guide dogs. A study published in 2006, tested the suitability of four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) as guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and the Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Crossbreeds had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.[20][21]\n\n\nThe Labrador Retriever is a gun dog bred to retrieve on land and water.[22] As a dog specially bred for water retrieving, the labrador has developed various traits for this job. For retrieving the Labrador Retriever has a  soft mouth, a trait that allows it to carry game and waterfowl without damaging it.[23] And for swimming, the Labrador is aided by fully webbed paws, an otter-like tail, and a waterproof coat.[24]\n\n\nThe high intelligence, initiative and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who was trained to, if need be, put his human who uses a wheelchair in the recovery position, cover him with a blanket, and activate an emergency phone.[25] A number of Labradors have also been taught to assist their owner in removing money and credit cards from ATMs with prior training.[26]\n\n\nThe breed is used in water rescue/lifesaving. It continues in that role today, along with the Leonberger, Newfoundland and Golden Retriever dogs; they are used at the Italian School of Canine Lifeguard.[27]\n\n\n\n### In war[edit]\n\n\nLabradors have been used as war dogs. During the Vietnam War they were used as scout dogs to track down dead or wounded soldiers or enemy positions.[28]:\u200a278\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nA Labrador may be expected to live for 10 to 12 years.[1]:\u200a256\n\n\nIt is a healthy breed with relatively few major problems. Notable issues related to health and well-being include inherited disorders and obesity (most are missing all or parts of the appetite-regulating POMC gene).\n\n\nA Royal Veterinary College study, and one conducted by The University of Sydney, have concluded that chocolate-coloured Labradors have a shorter average life expectancy than other colours of Labrador (by about 10%) and are more likely to suffer some health problems.[29]\n\n\nLabradors are somewhat prone to hip and elbow dysplasia,[30] especially in larger dogs.[31] Eye diseases may include progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy[30] and retinal dysplasia.[32] They can suffer from exercise induced collapse, which causes hyperthermia, weakness, collapse, and disorientation after short bouts of exercise,[33] or from obesity, which in some cases may be partly due to the absence of part or all of the proopiomelanocortin gene.[34][35]\n\n\n\n## Demography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of most popular dog breeds\n\nThe Labrador is an exceptionally popular dog. As of 2006, it was widely considered the most popular breed in the world.[36] And it is the most popular dog by ownership in Canada, New Zealand[37] and the United Kingdom.[38] In 2006 both the United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over twice as many registered Labradors as the next most popular breed.[39][40] If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3\u20135\u00a0times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the German shepherd dog and Golden retriever.[39][40]\n\n\nThey are the most popular breed of assistance dog in the United States, Australia, and many other countries,[41] as well as being widely used by police and other official bodies for their detection and working abilities. Approximately 60\u201370% of all guide dogs in the United States are Labradors.\n\n\nSeven out of the thirteen *\"outstanding gundogs\"* of the Australian National Kennel Council's 2000\u20132005 appointees to its 'hall of fame' are Labradors.[42]\n\n\n\n## Famous Labradors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Labradors\n\n![](image)Endal wearing his PDSA Gold Medal\nNotable labradors within various categories include:\n\n\n\n### Assistance dogs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Assistance dog\n\n* Endal, a service dog[43] in Britain. Among other distinctions, \"the most decorated dog in the world\" (including \"Dog of the Millennium\" and the PDSA's Gold Medal for Animal Gallantry and Devotion to Duty), the first dog to ride on the London Eye and the first dog known to work a 'chip and pin' ATM card. By Endal's death in March 2009, he and his owner/handler Allen Parton had been filmed almost 350 times by crews from several countries, and a film of a year in Endal's life was in production.\n\n\n* Sully, served with former US President George H. W. Bush during the last six months of his life; noted for his role during the president's funeral. A form of Parkinson's disease confined the former president to a wheelchair or motorised scooter in the final years of his life. Among the services that Sully was able to perform for Bush were retrieving dropped items, opening and closing doors, pushing an emergency button and supporting him when standing.[44]\n\n\n### Police, military, rescue and detection dogs[edit]\n\n\n* Frida (12 April 2009 \u2013 15 November 2022)[45] was a yellow Labrador Retriever who worked as a search and rescue dog for the Mexican Navy (SEMAR). She was deployed to help the rescue efforts in the aftermath of natural disasters.\n* Zanjeer (\"Chain\", or \"Shackles\"), a detection dog who detected arms and ammunition used in the 1993 Mumbai (Bombay) serial explosions. During his service, he helped recover 57 country-made bombs, 175\u00a0petrol bombs, 11\u00a0military-grade armaments, 242\u00a0grenades and 600\u00a0detonators. His biggest contribution to the police force and the city was the detection of 3,329\u00a0kg of RDX. He also helped detect 18 Type 56 rifles and five 9\u00a0mm pistols.\n* Lucky and Flo, twin Black Labrador counterfeit-detection dogs who became famous in 2007 for \"sniffing out nearly 2\u00a0million counterfeit DVDs\" on a 6\u00a0month secondment to Malaysia in 2007.[46]\n\n\nFollowing the multimillion-dollar, 6\u00a0arrest Malaysian detection, they became the first dogs to be awarded Malaysia's \"outstanding service award\"[47]\nand software pirates were stated to have put a \u00a330,000 contract out for their lives.[48][49]\n\n\n\n* Sarbi, an Australian special forces explosives detection dog that spent almost 14 months missing in action (MIA) in Afghanistan before being recovered safe and well in 2009.[50][51]\n* Jake, an American black Labrador who served as a search and rescue dog following the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina.[52]\n* Salty and Roselle, awarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict. They led their blind owners down more than 70\u00a0flights of stairs to escape from the damaged World Trade Center on 11\u00a0September 2001[53]\n* Sadie, awarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict. She detected explosive devices, which were subsequently disarmed, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, in November\u00a02005; she served with the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment[54]\n* Sasha, awarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict. Located 15\u00a0improvised explosive devices, mortars, mines, and weapons while serving in Afghanistan, with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps. In July\u00a02008 Sasha and her handler were killed in a Taliban ambush by a rocket-propelled grenade.[55][56]\n\n\n### Pets[edit]\n\n\n* Former President of the United States Bill Clinton's Labradors Buddy and Seamus.[57]\n* Russian President Vladimir Putin's Labrador 'Konni'.[58]\n* Marley, \"The World's Worst Dog\", featured in journalist John Grogan's autobiographical book *Marley & Me*, adapted into a 2008 comedy drama film of the same name.\n* Global superstar Celine Dion's labradors Charlie and Bear. They were represented in numerous magazines with the singer and her family, becoming pets celebrities in their own names.

Dogs carrying wild-type alleles for all three genes have a yellow coat resulting from Agouti antagonism of Mc1r signaling in melanocytes (yellow Great Dane, top). Dogs carrying a loss-of-function mutation at Mc1r have a yellow coat, regardless of their genotype at Agouti or CBD103 (yellow Labrador retriever, middle). Dogs carrying wild-type alleles for Mc1r and Agouti, together with the dominant black allele of CBD103 (KB) have a black coat resulting from the interaction between a \u03b2-defensin and Mc1r (black Curly Coated Retriever, bottom).\" \u2014 Candille, Kaelin, *et al.* (2007)[17]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nDennis-Bryan, Kim (2020) [2012]. *The Complete Dog Breed Book* (2nd\u00a0ed.).

These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

It appeared in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century, apparently the result of cross-breeding of Toy Bulldogs imported from England and local Parisian ratters.[4]\n\n\nIt is commonly kept as a pet, and is among the most frequently registered dogs in a number of countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the nineteenth century bulldogs were bred in the United Kingdom for purposes other than traditional blood sports such as bull-baiting, which were banned in 1835.[5]:\u200a5 By the middle of the century there were miniature bulldogs, often weighing some 7\u201311\u00a0kg (15\u201324\u00a0lb), though some weighed considerably less.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\nAt the same time, lace workers from Nottingham who were displaced by the Industrial Revolution began to settle in Normandy, France.[6]:\u200a58 They brought a variety of dogs with them, including Toy Bulldogs.[7] The dogs became popular in France and a trade in imported small Bulldogs was created, with breeders in England sending over Bulldogs that they considered to be too small, or with faults such as ears that stood up. By 1860, there were few Toy Bulldogs left in England, such was their popularity in France, and due to the exploits of specialist dog exporters.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\nThe small Bulldog type gradually became thought of as a breed, and received a name, the Bouledogue Francais.[5]:\u200a6 This Francization of the English name is also a contraction of the words *boule* ('ball') and *dogue* ('mastiff'). The dogs were highly fashionable and were sought after by society ladies and Parisian prostitutes alike, as well as creatives such as artists, writers, and fashion designers.[5]:\u200a6 The artists Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec are thought to have French Bulldogs in their paintings.[8] However, records were not kept of the breed's development as it diverged further away from its original Bulldog roots. As it changed, terrier stock had been brought in to develop traits such as the breed's long straight ears.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\n\n### Depictions in nineteenth-century paintings[edit]\n\n\n* ![Toulouse-Lautrec: Bouboule, Bull-dog de madame Palmyre, \u00e0 la souris, 1897](image)\n\nToulouse-Lautrec: *Bouboule, Bull-dog de madame Palmyre, \u00e0 la souris*, 1897\n* ![A l'\u00e9curie, cheval et chien, Edgar Degas, about 1861](image)\n\n*A l'\u00e9curie, cheval et chien*, Edgar Degas, about 1861\n* ![Toulouse-Lautrec](image)\n\nToulouse-Lautrec\n* ![Toulouse-Lautrec](image)\n\nToulouse-Lautrec\n\n\n### Breed clubs and modern recognition[edit]\n\n\nBulldogs were very popular in the past, especially in Western Europe. One of its ancestors was the English bulldog. Americans had been importing French Bulldogs for a while, but it was not until 1885 when they were brought over in order to set up an American-based breeding program. They were mostly owned by society ladies, who first displayed them at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1896.[9] They arrived again in the following year with even more entries, where the judging of the breed would go on to have future ramifications. The judge in question at the dog show, George Raper, only chose winners with \"rose ears\"\u2014ears that folded at the tip, as with the standard for Bulldogs.[10] The ladies formed the French Bull Dog Club of America and created the breed standard which stated for the first time that the \"erect bat ear\" was the correct type.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\nIn the early 20th century, the breed remained in vogue for high society, with dogs changing hands for up to $3,000 and being owned by members of influential families such as the Rockefellers and the J. P. Morgans. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed quickly after the breed club was formed, and by 1906 the French Bulldog was the fifth most popular dog breed in America.[5]:\u200a8 In 2013, the American Kennel Club (AKC) ranked the French Bulldog as the 10th most popular breed in the United States, enjoying a sharp rise in popularity from 54th place a decade before, in 2003.[11] By 2014, they had moved up to become the ninth most popular AKC registered dog breed in the US and by the 2017 they were the fourth most popular.[12]\n\n\nThis new Bulldog breed arrived for the first time in England in 1893, with English Bulldog breeders in an uproar as the French imports did not meet the new breed standards in place by this time, and they wanted to prevent the English stock from crossbreeding with the French. The Kennel Club initially recognized them as a subset of the existing Bulldog breed rather than an entirely new breed.[5]:\u200a6 Some English breeders in this period bred the French Bulldogs in order to resurrect the Toy Bulldog.[6]:\u200a58 On 10 July 1902, at the house of Frederick W. Cousens, a meeting was held to set up a breed club in order to seek individual recognition for the French breed.[5]:\u200a7 The adopted breed standard was the same one which was already in use in America, France, Germany and Austria.[6]:\u200a58 Despite opposition from Miniature Bulldog (the new breed name for the Toy Bulldog) and Bulldog breeders,[6]:\u200a59 in 1905, the Kennel Club changed its policy on the breed and recognized them separate from the English variety, initially as the Bouledogue Francais, then later in 1912 with the name changed to the French Bulldog.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\nIt is commonly kept as a pet: in 2020 it was the second-most registered dog in the United Kingdom,[13] and the fourth-most in the United States.[12] They were rated the third-most popular dog in Australia in 2017.[14] In 2019, in the United Kingdom, the French Bulldog had 375 export pedigrees[15] and a total of 33,661 registered dogs.[16] By comparison, the Labrador Retriever had over 36,700 dogs and the Cocker Spaniel fewer than 22,000.\n\n\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, the French Bulldog has overtaken the Labrador as the most popular breed of dog. Before 2023, Labradors had held the top spot for 31 years.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Historic photographs[edit]\n\n\n* ![1890](image)\n\n1890\n* ![1901, Maurice in New York City](image)\n\n1901, Maurice in New York City\n* ![1908, Anna Sacher](image)\n\n1908, Anna Sacher\n* ![1911, Ch.

The fawn colors can be any light through red.[18] The most common colors are brindle, then fawn, with pieds being less common than the other colors.[20] The breed clubs do not recognize any other colors or patterns,[18] because some colors come linked with genetic health problems not usually found in the breed. These include blue coloration, which is linked with a form of alopecia (hair loss or baldness), sometimes known as \"blue dog alopecia\".[21] Even dogs that are not blue can develop \"blue dog alopecia\" or canine follicular dysplasia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* ![Brindle](image)\n\nBrindle\n* ![Pied](image)\n\nPied\n* ![Cream](image)\n\nCream\n* ![Fawn](image)\n\nFawn\n* ![Black](image)\n\nBlack\n* ![Gray](image)\n\nGray\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\nThe French Bulldog, like many other companion dog breeds, requires close contact with humans. If left alone for more than a few hours, it may experience separation anxiety.[22]\n\n\nFrench Bulldogs are often kept as companions.[7] The breed is patient and affectionate with their owners, and can live with other breeds. French Bulldogs are agreeable dogs, and are human-oriented, and this makes them easier to train, though they do have tendencies to be stubborn.[7]\n\n\nThey are ranked 58th in Stanley Coren's *The Intelligence of Dogs*.[23] There are certain exceptions to this average level of canine intelligence; a French Bulldog named Princess Jacqueline which died in 1934 was claimed to be able to speak 20 words, in appropriate situations.[24]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Closeup of the French Bulldog's brachycephaly face\n![](image)French Bulldog at rest, panting\nAs a consequence of selective breeding, French Bulldogs are disproportionately affected by health related problems.[25]\n\n\n\n### Brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome[edit]\n\n\nThe skull malformation brachycephaly was increased by breeding selection which led to the occurrence of the brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome. Therefore many French Bulldogs often pant, sticking out their tongue even at slight efforts like walking.[26] The brachycephalic syndrome causes them to have multiple side effects, as in difficulty breathing (which includes snoring, loud breathing).[27] It happens because they have narrow nostril openings, a long soft palate, and fairly narrow tracheas.[27] This issue can lead to death in French Bulldogs if they are not undergoing proper treatment.[27]\n\n\nIn order to treat these dogs and create a smoother airway to the lungs, a procedure must be done that takes out a portion of their soft palate.[27] The results of the procedure show a minimum of 60% better airway passage to the lungs.[27]\n\n\nA study of the deaths of 30563 dogs of different breeds in the United Kingdom in 2016\u20132020 found the French Bulldog to have a life expectancy at birth of 4.93\u00a0years, the lowest by a large margin of all breeds in the study, which found an average for all dogs of 11.23\u00a0years. [28]:\u200a1 This same study indicates that the low life expectancy for French Bulldogs is possibly influenced by the increasing number of French Bulldogs present in the UK, increasing from 2,771 KC registered individuals in 2011 to 39,266 individuals in 2020, skewing the general population to be very young on average and biasing the data. [28]:\u200a1 Analysis of data from Japan suggested that its life expectancy there is considerably higher, at 10.2\u00a0years.[28]:\u200a6\n\n\nIn 2013, a UK Medical Study reviewed the health of 2228 French Bulldogs under veterinary care in the UK.[29] The study found that 1612 (72.4%) of these French Bulldog had at least one recorded health issue:[29] \"The most common disorders recorded were ear infections (14.0%), diarrhea (7.5%) and conjunctivitis (3.2%). Skin problems were the most commonly reported group of disorders (17.9%). This study of over two thousand French Bulldogs provides a framework to identify the most important health priorities in French Bulldogs in the UK and can assist with reforms to improve health and welfare within the breed.\"[29]\n\n\n\n### Temperature regulation-related issues[edit]\n\n\nAs they are a brachycephalic breed, French Bulldogs are banned by several commercial airlines due to the numbers that have died while in the air.[30] This is because dogs with snub noses find it difficult to breathe when they are hot and stressed. The temperature in a cargo space in an aircraft can rise as high as 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) when waiting on the runway.[31]\n\n\n\n### Birth and reproduction[edit]\n\n\nFrench Bulldogs sometimes require artificial insemination and, frequently, Caesarean section to give birth, with over 80% of litters delivered this way.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Back and spine[edit]\n\n\nFrench Bulldogs are prone to having congenital hemivertebrae (also called \"butterfly vertebrae\"),[34][35] which will show on an X-ray.[36]\n\n\nIn October 2010, the UK French Bulldog Health Scheme was launched.[27] The scheme consists of three levels: the first level, Bronze, designates a basic veterinary check which covers all the Kennel Club Breed Watch points of concern for the breed. The next level, Silver, requires a DNA test for hereditary cataracts, a simple cardiology test, and patella grading. The final level, Gold, requires a hip score and a spine evaluation. The European and UK French Bulldog fanciers and Kennel Clubs are moving away from the screw, cork-screw or 'tight' tail (which is an inbreed spinal defect), and returning to the short drop tail which the breed originally had.[37] The UK breed standard requires that the tail be \"undocked, set low, thick at root, tapering quickly towards tip, preferably straight, and long enough to cover anus\" and \"never curling over back nor carried gaily\".[38]\nThe French Bulldog may develop skin fold dermatitis.[39]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to French Bulldog.\n\n1. **^** FCI breeds nomenclature: Bouledogue Fran\u00e7ais (101).
