Kellogg's produces cereal (outside North America) and convenience foods, including crackers and toaster pastries, and markets their products by several well-known brands including the Kellogg's brand itself, Rice Krispies Treats, Pringles, Eggo, and Cheez-It, along with cereal internationally such as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Frosties and Coco Pops.\n\n\nKellogg's products are manufactured and marketed in over 180 countries.[3] Kellogg's largest factory is at Trafford Park in Trafford, Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, which is also the location of its UK headquarters.[4] Other corporate office locations outside of Battle Creek include Chicago, Dublin (European Headquarters), Shanghai, and Querétaro City.[5] Kellogg's held a Royal Warrant from Queen Elizabeth II until her death in 2022.[6]\n\n\nKellogg's was split into two companies on October 2, 2023, with WK Kellogg Co owning the North American cereal division, and the existing company being rebranded to **Kellanova**, owning brands such as Pop-Tarts and Pringles alongside the international cereal division. Kellogg's itself would become a brand name of both companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Will Keith Kellogg\n\n![](image)First Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Co. corn flakes package (1906), later to become the Kellogg Food Company in 1908\nIn 1876, John Harvey Kellogg became the superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium (originally the Western Health Reform Institute founded by Ellen White) and his brother, W. K. Kellogg, worked as the bookkeeper. This is where corn flakes were created and led to the eventual formation of the Kellogg Company.\n\n\nFor years, W. K. Kellogg assisted his brother in research to improve the vegetarian diet of the Battle Creek Sanitarium's patients, especially in the search for wheat-based granola. The Kelloggs are best known for the invention of the famous breakfast cereal corn flakes. The development of the flaked cereal in 1894 has been variously described by those involved: Ella Eaton Kellogg, John Harvey Kellogg, his younger brother Will Keith Kellogg, and other family members. There is considerable disagreement over who was involved in the discovery, and the role that they played.[7] It is generally agreed that upon being called out one night, John Kellogg left a batch of wheat-berry dough behind. Rather than throwing it out the following day, he sent it through the rollers and was surprised to obtain delicate flakes, which could then be baked.[7]\n\n\nW. K. Kellogg persuaded his brother to serve the food in a flake form. Soon the flaked wheat was being packaged to meet hundreds of guest mail-order requests after they left the Sanitarium. However, Dr. John Harvey forbade his brother Will from distributing cereal beyond his consumers. As a result, the brothers fell out, and W. K. launched the **Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company** on February 19, 1906.[8][9] On July 4, 1907, a fire destroyed the main factory building. W.K. Kellogg had the new plant in full operation six months after the fire.[10]\n\n\nConvincing his brother to relinquish rights to the product, Will's company produced and marketed the hugely successful Kellogg's Toasted Corn Flakes and was renamed the **Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company** in 1909, taking on the current name of the **Kellogg Company** in 1922.[8]\n\n\nBy 1909, Will's company produced 120,000 cases of Corn Flakes daily. John, who resented his brother's success, filed suit against Will's company in 1906 for the right to use the family name. The resulting legal battle, which included a trial that lasted an entire month, ended in December 1920 when the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in Will's favor.[11]\n\n\nIn 1931, the Kellogg Company announced that most of its factories would shift towards 30-hour work weeks from the usual 40. W.K. Kellogg stated that he did this so that an additional shift of workers would be employed to support people through the depression era. This practice remained until World War II and continued briefly after the war, although some departments and factories remained locked into 30-hour work weeks until 1980.[12]\n\n\nIn 1964, Kellogg's introduced its first non-cereal product. A pastry which can be heated in a toaster called Pop-Tarts.[13]\n\n\nFrom 1969 to 1970, the slogan “Kellogg's puts more into your day” was used on Sunday morning TV shows. From 1969 to 1977, Kellogg's acquired various small businesses, including Salada Tea, Fearn International, Mrs. Smith's Pies, Eggo, and Pure Packed Foods;[14] however, it was later criticized for not diversifying further like General Mills and Quaker Oats were. After underspending its competition in marketing and product development, Kellogg's US market share hit a low of 36.7% in 1983. A prominent Wall Street analyst called it \"a fine company that's past its prime\" and the cereal market was being regarded as \"mature\". Such comments stimulated Kellogg chairman William E. LaMothe to improve, which primarily involved approaching the demographic of 80 million baby boomers rather than marketing children-oriented cereals. In emphasizing cereal's convenience and nutritional value, Kellogg's helped persuade U.S. consumers aged 25 to 49 to eat 26% more cereal than people of that age ate five years prior. The U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market, worth $3.7 billion at retail in 1983, totaled $5.4 billion by 1988 and had expanded three times as fast as the average grocery category. Kellogg's also introduced new products, including Crispix, Raisin Squares, and Nutri-Grain Biscuits, and reached out internationally with Just Right aimed at Australians and Genmai Flakes for Japan. During this time, the company maintained success over its top competitors: General Mills, which largely marketed children's cereals, and Post, which had difficulty in the adult cereal market.[15]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kellogg's acquired the Keebler Company for $3.87 billion.[16] Over the years, it has also gone on to acquire Morningstar Farms and Kashi divisions or subsidiaries. Kellogg's also owns the Bear Naked, Natural Touch, Cheez-It, Murray, Austin cookies and crackers, Famous Amos, Gardenburger (acquired 2007), and Plantation brands. Presently, Kellogg's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation.[17]\n\n\nIn 2012, Kellogg's became the world's second-largest snack food company (after PepsiCo) by acquiring the potato crisps brand Pringles from Procter & Gamble for $2.7 billion in a cash deal.[18]\n\n\nIn 2017, Kellogg's acquired Chicago-based food company Rxbar for $654 million.[19] Earlier that year, Kellogg's also opened new corporate office space in Chicago's Merchandise Mart for its global growth and IT departments.[20] In the UK, Kellogg's also released the W. K. Kellogg brand of organic, vegan and plant-based cereals (such as granolas, organic wholegrain wheat, and \"super grains\") with no added sugars.[21]\n\n\nIn 2018, Kellogg's decided to cease their operations in Venezuela due to the economic crisis the country is facing.[22] Their factories were taken by the Venezuelan state under the Nicolás Maduro administration. In mid-2019, Venezuelan Kellogg's cereal boxes began portraying the Venezuelan flag and a motto from Maduro: \"Together, everything is possible\" (Spanish: *Juntos todo es posible*) alongside Kellogg's logo and mascots were sold all over the country. Kellogg's considers it as an illicit use, and the company stated they would take legal action.[23]\n\n\nOn April 1, 2019, it was announced that Kellogg's was selling Famous Amos, Murray's, Keebler, Mother's, and Little Brownie Bakers (one of the producers of the cookies for the Girl Scouts of the USA) to Ferrero SpA for $1.4 billion.[24][25][26] On July 29, 2019, that sale was completed.[27] Kellogg's kept the Keebler cracker line and replaced the Keebler name on their crackers with the Kellogg's name.\n\n\nIn June 2019, Kellogg's announced their next-generation *Kellogg's® Better Days* global commitment, focusing on hunger, children, and farmers, with specific targets to reach by 2030.[28]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Kellogg's partnered with GLAAD by \"launching a new limited edition \"All Together Cereal\" and donating $50,000 to support GLAAD's anti-bullying and LGBTQ advocacy efforts\". The All Together cereal combined six mini cereal boxes into one package to bring attention to anti-bullying.[29]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Kellogg's decided to work with suppliers to phase out the use of glyphosate by 2025, which some farmers have used as a drying agent for wheat and oats supplied to Kellogg's.[30]\n\n\nIn October 2021, workers at all of Kellogg's cereal-producing plants in the United States went on a strike conducted by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union over disagreements over the terms of a new labor contract.[31] On December 3, 2021, a tentative deal was struck to end the worker strike,[32] but the union members overwhelmingly rejected the tentative agreement[33] and Kellogg's management announced they would seek to replace all 1,400 striking workers.[34] On December 21, 2021, about 1,400 Kellogg workers approved a collective bargaining agreement, ending the strike, which had lasted 77 days.[35][36][37]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2022, Kellogg's announced that the company would spin off three cereal, snacks, and plant-based food divisions.[38][39] The North American cereal and plant-based food spin-off companies will keep Battle Creek as their headquarters and the new snack and international cereal company will be based in Chicago.[40] The successor company, known as Global Snacking Co. temporarily, represents 80 percent or $11.4 billion of Kellogg's sales. 60 percent of Global Snacking's business was snacks, and nearly half of the company's business was in the United States. The cereal business, temporarily called North America Cereal Co., would be the second-largest American cereal company and the largest in Canada and the Caribbean, with 5 of the top 11 brands and $2.4 billion in annual sales. Plant-based foods, representing $340 million in annual sales, would be called \"Plant Co.\" and could even be sold.[41] In January 2023, Kellogg's shelved its plans to spin off its plant food business and would retain it as part of Global Snacking Co.[42] On March 15, 2023, Kellogg's announced that North America Cereal Co. branch will be named WK Kellogg Co and Global Snacking Co. branch will be called Kellanova. The ticker symbol \"K\" will be used by Kellanova on the NYSE.[43] The split was completed on October 2, 2023.[44][45] The WK Kellogg Co has the NYSE stock symbol \"KLG\".[46]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2017, Kellogg's reported earnings of US$1.269 billion, with an annual revenue of US$12.932 billion, a decline of 0.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Kellogg's market capitalization was valued at over US$22.1 billion in November 2018.[47]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein mil. US$\n | Net incomein mil. US$\n | Total Assetsin mil.

Foremost among these is the design of the Kellogg's logo by Ferris Crane under the art direction of famed type guru Y. Ames. Another was the well-remembered jingle \"K E double-L, O double-good, Kellogg's best to you!\".\n\n\nWith the rising popularity of patent medicine in early 20th century advertising, The Kellogg Company of Canada published a book named *A New Way of Living* that showed readers \"how to achieve a new way of living; how to preserve vitality; how to maintain enthusiasm and energy; how to get the most out of life because of a physical ability to enjoy it\". It touted the All-Bran cereal as the secret to leading \"normal\" lives free of constipation.[82]\n\n\nKellogg's was a major sponsor throughout the run of the hit CBS panel show *What's My Line?*[83] It and its associated products Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies were also major sponsors for the PBS Kids children's animated series *Dragon Tales*.[84]\n\n\nKellogg's is a sponsor of USA Gymnastics and produced the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics, a 36-city tour held in 2016 after the Olympic games and featured performances by recent medal-winning gymnasts from the United States.[85]\n\n\nKellogg's is currently the title sponsor of three college football bowl games. First, it was announced in 2019 that Kellogg's would become the new title sponsor of the Sun Bowl game, with the game being branded as the \"Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl\".[86] This was followed in 2020 by the company using its Cheez-It brand to sponsor of the game now known as the Pop-Tarts Bowl.[87] In 2022, Kellogg's added the Citrus Bowl to its bowl sponsorships, with the game branded as the \"Cheez-It Citrus Bowl\".[88]\n\n\n\n### Premiums and prizes[edit]\n\n\nW.K. Kellogg was the first to introduce prizes in boxes of cereal. The marketing strategy that he established has produced thousands of different cereal box prizes that have been distributed by the tens of billions.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Children's premiums[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1909, Kellogg's Corn Flakes had the first cereal premium with *The Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Book.* The book was originally available as a prize that was given to the customer in the store with the purchase of two packages of the cereal.[90] But in 1909, Kellogg's changed the book giveaway to a premium mail-in offer for the cost of a dime. Over 2.5 million copies of the book were distributed in different editions over a period of 23 years.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Cereal box prizes[edit]\n\n\nIn 1945, Kellogg's inserted a prize in the form of pin-back buttons into each box of Pep cereal. Pep pins have included U.S. Army squadrons as well as characters from newspaper comics and were available through 1947. There were five series of comic characters and 18 different buttons in each set, with a total of 90 in the collection.[89] Other manufacturers of major brands of cereal, including General Mills, Malt-O-Meal, Nestlé, Post Foods, and Quaker Oats, followed suit and inserted prizes into boxes of cereal to promote sales and brand loyalty.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nLicensed brands have been omitted since the corresponding mascots would be obvious (for example, Spider-Man is the mascot for Spider-Man Spidey-Berry).\n\n\n\n* Cocoa Hoots cereal: Newton the Owl\n* Cocoa Krispies cereal (Known as Choco Krispis in Latin America, Choco Krispies in Germany, Austria, Spain, and Switzerland, Chocos in India, and Coco Pops in Australia, the UK, and Europe): Jose (monkey), Coco (monkey), Melvin (elephant), Snagglepuss (Hanna-Barbera character), Ogg (caveman), Tusk (elephant), and Snap, Crackle and Pop (who were also, and remain as of February 2014, the Rice Krispies mascots; see below)\n* Corn Flakes cereal: Cornelius (rooster)\n* Frosted Flakes (known as Frosties outside the US/Canada, Zucaritas in Latin America and Sucrilhos in Brazil) cereal: Tony the Tiger\n* Froot Loops cereal: Toucan Sam\n* Honey Smacks (US)/Smacks (other markets) cereal: Dig 'Em Frog\n* Raisin Bran cereal: Sunny the Sun\n* Rice Krispies (known as Rice Bubbles in Australia and New Zealand) cereal: Snap, Crackle and Pop\n* Ricicles (UK Only) cereal: Captain Rik\n* Apple Jacks cereal: CinnaMon and Bad Apple\n* Honey Loops cereal: Loopy (bumblebee), Pops (honey bee)\n* Keebler cookies and crackers: Ernie and the Elves\n\n### Motorsports[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's made its first foray into auto racing between 1991 and 1992 when the company sponsored the #41 Chevrolets fielded by Larry Hedrick Motorsports in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series and driven by Phil Parsons, Dave Marcis, Greg Sacks, Hut Stricklin, and Richard Petty, but they gained greater prominence for their sponsorship of two-time Winston Cup Champion Terry Labonte from 1993 to 2006, the last 12 years of that as the sponsor for Hendrick Motorsports' No.5 car. Kellogg's sponsored the No.5 car for Labonte, Kyle Busch, Casey Mears, and Mark Martin until 2010, and it then served as an associate sponsor for Carl Edwards' #99 car for Roush Fenway Racing.\n\n\nKellogg's placed Dale Earnhardt on Kellogg's Corn Flakes boxes for 1993 six-time Winston Cup champion and 1994 seven-time Winston Cup champion, as well as Jeff Gordon on the Mini Wheats box for the 1993 Rookie of the Year, 1995 Brickyard 400 inaugural race, 1997 Champion, and 1998 three-time champion, and a special three-pack racing box set with Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte, and Dale Jarrett in 1996.\n\n\n\n### Merchandising[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's has used some merchandising for their products. Kellogg's once released *Mission Nutrition*, a PC game that came free with special packs of cereal. It played in a similar fashion as *Donkey Kong Country*; users could play as Tony the Tiger, Coco the Monkey, or Snap, Crackle, and Pop. Kellogg's has also released \"Talking\" games. The two current versions are Talking Tony and Talking Sam. In these games, a microphone is used to play games and create voice commands for their computers. In Talking Tony, Tony the Tiger, one of Kellogg's most famous mascots, would be the main and only character in the game. In Talking Sam, Toucan Sam, another famous mascot, would be in the game, instead. Some [toy cars] have the Kellogg's logo on them, and occasionally their mascots.\n\n\nThere was also a Talking Snap Crackle and Pop software.\n\n\n\n### Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's frequently partners with the Olympic Games to feature American athletes from the Olympic Games on the packages of their cereal brands.[92] In 2017, the company announced its marketing campaign for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games featuring American athletes Nathan Chen, Kelly Clark, Meghan Duggan and Mike Schultz.[93]\n\n\n\n## Misleading claims[edit]\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\n> \n> We expect more from a great American company than making dubious claims—not once, but twice—that its cereals improve children's health...\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Jon Leibowitz, Chairman of the F.T.C.[94]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, Kellogg's was found to be making unsubstantiated and misleading claims in advertising their cereal products by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).[94][95][96]\n\n\nKellogg's responded by stating \"We stand behind the validity of our product claims and research, so we agreed to an order that covers those claims. We believe that the revisions to the existing consent agreement satisfied any remaining concerns.\"[96]\n\n\nThe FTC had previously found fault with Kellogg's claims that Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal improved kids' attentiveness by nearly 20%.[97]\n\n\nThe Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus has also suggested that the language on Kellogg Pop-Tarts packages saying the pastries are \"Made with Real Fruit\" should be taken off the products.[98] In July 2012, the UK banned a \"Special K\" advertisement due to its citing caloric values that did not take into account the caloric value of milk consumed with the cereal.[99] In 2016 an ad telling UK consumers that Special K is “full of goodness” and “nutritious” was banned.[100]\n\n\n\n### Questionable nutritional value[edit]\n\n\nSome of Kellogg's marketing has been questioned in the press, prompted by an increase in consumer awareness of the mismatch between the marketing messages and the products themselves.[101]\n\n\nFood bloggers are also questioning the marketing methods used by cereal manufacturing companies such as Kellogg's, due to their high sugar content and use of ingredients such as high-fructose corn syrup.[102]\n\n\n\n### 2021 Pop-Tarts lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nA class-action lawsuit was filed against Kellogg's in October 2021 claiming they are not putting enough strawberries in their strawberry flavored Pop-Tarts, and seeking $5 million in damages.[103] In April 2022, the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge.[104]\n\n\nAnother lawsuit was filed against Kellog's in 2021, with the plaintiff claiming that Kellogg's defrauded customers regarding the contents of its Frosted Chocolate Fudge Pop-Tarts. The plaintiff stated she would not have purchased the Pop-Tarts had she known they did not contain milk, milkfat, or butter. In June 2022, a US district judge dismissed the lawsuit, stating that a reasonable consumer would not expect those ingredients.[105]\n\n\n\n## Recalls[edit]\n\n\n### 2010 cereal recall[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, the company voluntarily began to recall about 28 million boxes of Apple Jacks, Corn Pops, Froot Loops and Honey Smacks because of an unusual smell and flavor from the packages' liners that could make people ill. Kellogg's said about 20 people complained about the cereals, including five who reported nausea and vomiting. Consumers reported the cereal smelled or tasted waxy or like metal or soap. Company spokeswoman J. Adaire Putnam said some described it as tasting stale. However, no serious health problems had been reported.[106]\n\n\nThe suspected chemical that caused the illnesses was 2-methylnaphthalene, used in the cereal packaging process. Little is known about 2-methylnaphthalene's impact on human health as the Food and Drug Administration has no scientific data on its impact on humans, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also does not have health and safety data. This is despite the EPA having sought information on it from the chemical industry for 16 years. 2-Methylnaphthalene is a component of crude oil and is \"structurally related to naphthalene, an ingredient in mothballs and toilet-deodorant blocks\" that the EPA considers a possible human carcinogen.[107][108]\n\n\n*Kellogg's* offered consumers refunds in the meantime.[109] Only products with the letters \"KN\" following the use-by date were included in the recall.[110] The products were distributed throughout the US and began arriving in stores in late March 2010. Products in Canada were not affected.[111]\n\n\n\n### 2012 cereal recall[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's issued a voluntary recall of some of its \"Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size Original\" and \"Mini-Wheats Unfrosted Bite Size\" products due to the possibility of flexible metal mesh fragments in the food. The affected products varied in size from single-serving bowls to large 70-ounce cartons. Use-by dates printed on the recalled packages ranged from April 1, 2013, to September 21, 2013, and were accompanied by the letters KB, AP or FK.[112]\n\n\n\n## Human rights violations and strikes[edit]\n\n\n### Human right violations of palm oil in 2016[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Amnesty International in 2016, Kellogg's palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14-year-old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from chemicals such as Paraquat.[113][114] Kellogg's alleged not being aware of the child abuses due to traceability; Amnesty's human rights director replied that \"Using mealy-mouthed excuses about 'traceability' is a total cop-out.\"[115]\n\n\n\n### 2021 strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Kellogg's strike\n\nIn October 2021, over a thousand employees at four Kelloggs manufacturing plants in the United States went on strike for better working conditions and higher wages. Two months into the strikes, Kelloggs fired all the striking workers and posted their jobs in December after negotiations with the BCTGM union failed. During the talks, Kelloggs had threatened to move jobs to Mexico if the union did not agree to Kelloggs' proposal.[116] Kelloggs also filed a lawsuit against the union.[117] As a result, several calls for a boycott went viral.[118][119]\n\n\n\n## Political involvement[edit]\n\n\n### Genetically modified foods labelling[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's donated around US$2 million opposing California Proposition 37, a 2012 ballot initiative that, if enacted, would have required compulsory labeling of genetically engineered food products.[120] In March 2016, though, they vowed to label all of their products with genetically modified organisms as such by 2020.[121]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2014, Kellogg's called on the President to support the Paris Agreement on climate change.[122] In 2016, Kellogg Company urged President-elect Donald Trump to \"continue the Paris Climate Agreement\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Voter ID laws[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's has donated to notable groups opposing voter-ID laws, such as the Applied Research Center (now RaceForward).[124] The company also decided to remove their advertisements from the Breitbart News website.[125] Breitbart News in turn called for a boycott of Kellogg's products.[126]\n\n\n\n### Education grant[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2012, Kellogg's gave the Calhoun School a $250,000 grant for a \"three-part youth-based project on issues of white privilege and institutionalized racism\".[127]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Trafford Park factory in Greater Manchester, England—Kellogg's European base since 1938.[4] The factory produces more Corn Flakes than any other Kellogg's factory in the world.[128]\n* Australia:\n\t+ Pagewood[129]\n\t+ Charmhaven (snack and cereal plant closed in 2014.)[130]\n* Belgium: Zaventem & Mechelen plant\n* Brazil: São Paulo\n* Colombia: Bogotá\n* Canada:\n\t+ Mississauga, Ontario – Canadian head office\n\t+ Anjou, Quebec – Eastern Canada sales office\n\t+ Calgary, Alberta – Western Canada sales office\n\t+ London, Ontario – manufacturers and distributes cereals (including Corn Flakes) in Canada.

Kellogg's produces cereal (outside North America) and convenience foods, including crackers and toaster pastries, and markets their products by several well-known brands including the Kellogg's brand itself, Rice Krispies Treats, Pringles, Eggo, and Cheez-It, along with cereal internationally such as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies, Frosties and Coco Pops.\n\n\nKellogg's products are manufactured and marketed in over 180 countries.[3] Kellogg's largest factory is at Trafford Park in Trafford, Greater Manchester, United Kingdom, which is also the location of its UK headquarters.[4] Other corporate office locations outside of Battle Creek include Chicago, Dublin (European Headquarters), Shanghai, and Querétaro City.[5] Kellogg's held a Royal Warrant from Queen Elizabeth II until her death in 2022.[6]\n\n\nKellogg's was split into two companies on October 2, 2023, with WK Kellogg Co owning the North American cereal division, and the existing company being rebranded to **Kellanova**, owning brands such as Pop-Tarts and Pringles alongside the international cereal division. Kellogg's itself would become a brand name of both companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Will Keith Kellogg\n\n![](image)First Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Co. corn flakes package (1906), later to become the Kellogg Food Company in 1908\nIn 1876, John Harvey Kellogg became the superintendent of the Battle Creek Sanitarium (originally the Western Health Reform Institute founded by Ellen White) and his brother, W. K. Kellogg, worked as the bookkeeper. This is where corn flakes were created and led to the eventual formation of the Kellogg Company.\n\n\nFor years, W. K. Kellogg assisted his brother in research to improve the vegetarian diet of the Battle Creek Sanitarium's patients, especially in the search for wheat-based granola. The Kelloggs are best known for the invention of the famous breakfast cereal corn flakes. The development of the flaked cereal in 1894 has been variously described by those involved: Ella Eaton Kellogg, John Harvey Kellogg, his younger brother Will Keith Kellogg, and other family members. There is considerable disagreement over who was involved in the discovery, and the role that they played.[7] It is generally agreed that upon being called out one night, John Kellogg left a batch of wheat-berry dough behind. Rather than throwing it out the following day, he sent it through the rollers and was surprised to obtain delicate flakes, which could then be baked.[7]\n\n\nW. K. Kellogg persuaded his brother to serve the food in a flake form. Soon the flaked wheat was being packaged to meet hundreds of guest mail-order requests after they left the Sanitarium. However, Dr. John Harvey forbade his brother Will from distributing cereal beyond his consumers. As a result, the brothers fell out, and W. K. launched the **Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company** on February 19, 1906.[8][9] On July 4, 1907, a fire destroyed the main factory building. W.K. Kellogg had the new plant in full operation six months after the fire.[10]\n\n\nConvincing his brother to relinquish rights to the product, Will's company produced and marketed the hugely successful Kellogg's Toasted Corn Flakes and was renamed the **Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company** in 1909, taking on the current name of the **Kellogg Company** in 1922.[8]\n\n\nBy 1909, Will's company produced 120,000 cases of Corn Flakes daily. John, who resented his brother's success, filed suit against Will's company in 1906 for the right to use the family name. The resulting legal battle, which included a trial that lasted an entire month, ended in December 1920 when the Michigan Supreme Court ruled in Will's favor.[11]\n\n\nIn 1931, the Kellogg Company announced that most of its factories would shift towards 30-hour work weeks from the usual 40. W.K. Kellogg stated that he did this so that an additional shift of workers would be employed to support people through the depression era. This practice remained until World War II and continued briefly after the war, although some departments and factories remained locked into 30-hour work weeks until 1980.[12]\n\n\nIn 1964, Kellogg's introduced its first non-cereal product. A pastry which can be heated in a toaster called Pop-Tarts.[13]\n\n\nFrom 1969 to 1970, the slogan “Kellogg's puts more into your day” was used on Sunday morning TV shows. From 1969 to 1977, Kellogg's acquired various small businesses, including Salada Tea, Fearn International, Mrs. Smith's Pies, Eggo, and Pure Packed Foods;[14] however, it was later criticized for not diversifying further like General Mills and Quaker Oats were. After underspending its competition in marketing and product development, Kellogg's US market share hit a low of 36.7% in 1983. A prominent Wall Street analyst called it \"a fine company that's past its prime\" and the cereal market was being regarded as \"mature\". Such comments stimulated Kellogg chairman William E. LaMothe to improve, which primarily involved approaching the demographic of 80 million baby boomers rather than marketing children-oriented cereals. In emphasizing cereal's convenience and nutritional value, Kellogg's helped persuade U.S. consumers aged 25 to 49 to eat 26% more cereal than people of that age ate five years prior. The U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market, worth $3.7 billion at retail in 1983, totaled $5.4 billion by 1988 and had expanded three times as fast as the average grocery category. Kellogg's also introduced new products, including Crispix, Raisin Squares, and Nutri-Grain Biscuits, and reached out internationally with Just Right aimed at Australians and Genmai Flakes for Japan. During this time, the company maintained success over its top competitors: General Mills, which largely marketed children's cereals, and Post, which had difficulty in the adult cereal market.[15]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kellogg's acquired the Keebler Company for $3.87 billion.[16] Over the years, it has also gone on to acquire Morningstar Farms and Kashi divisions or subsidiaries. Kellogg's also owns the Bear Naked, Natural Touch, Cheez-It, Murray, Austin cookies and crackers, Famous Amos, Gardenburger (acquired 2007), and Plantation brands. Presently, Kellogg's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation.[17]\n\n\nIn 2012, Kellogg's became the world's second-largest snack food company (after PepsiCo) by acquiring the potato crisps brand Pringles from Procter & Gamble for $2.7 billion in a cash deal.[18]\n\n\nIn 2017, Kellogg's acquired Chicago-based food company Rxbar for $654 million.[19] Earlier that year, Kellogg's also opened new corporate office space in Chicago's Merchandise Mart for its global growth and IT departments.[20] In the UK, Kellogg's also released the W. K. Kellogg brand of organic, vegan and plant-based cereals (such as granolas, organic wholegrain wheat, and \"super grains\") with no added sugars.[21]\n\n\nIn 2018, Kellogg's decided to cease their operations in Venezuela due to the economic crisis the country is facing.[22] Their factories were taken by the Venezuelan state under the Nicolás Maduro administration. In mid-2019, Venezuelan Kellogg's cereal boxes began portraying the Venezuelan flag and a motto from Maduro: \"Together, everything is possible\" (Spanish: *Juntos todo es posible*) alongside Kellogg's logo and mascots were sold all over the country. Kellogg's considers it as an illicit use, and the company stated they would take legal action.[23]\n\n\nOn April 1, 2019, it was announced that Kellogg's was selling Famous Amos, Murray's, Keebler, Mother's, and Little Brownie Bakers (one of the producers of the cookies for the Girl Scouts of the USA) to Ferrero SpA for $1.4 billion.[24][25][26] On July 29, 2019, that sale was completed.[27] Kellogg's kept the Keebler cracker line and replaced the Keebler name on their crackers with the Kellogg's name.\n\n\nIn June 2019, Kellogg's announced their next-generation *Kellogg's® Better Days* global commitment, focusing on hunger, children, and farmers, with specific targets to reach by 2030.[28]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Kellogg's partnered with GLAAD by \"launching a new limited edition \"All Together Cereal\" and donating $50,000 to support GLAAD's anti-bullying and LGBTQ advocacy efforts\". The All Together cereal combined six mini cereal boxes into one package to bring attention to anti-bullying.[29]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Kellogg's decided to work with suppliers to phase out the use of glyphosate by 2025, which some farmers have used as a drying agent for wheat and oats supplied to Kellogg's.[30]\n\n\nIn October 2021, workers at all of Kellogg's cereal-producing plants in the United States went on a strike conducted by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union over disagreements over the terms of a new labor contract.[31] On December 3, 2021, a tentative deal was struck to end the worker strike,[32] but the union members overwhelmingly rejected the tentative agreement[33] and Kellogg's management announced they would seek to replace all 1,400 striking workers.[34] On December 21, 2021, about 1,400 Kellogg workers approved a collective bargaining agreement, ending the strike, which had lasted 77 days.[35][36][37]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2022, Kellogg's announced that the company would spin off three cereal, snacks, and plant-based food divisions.[38][39] The North American cereal and plant-based food spin-off companies will keep Battle Creek as their headquarters and the new snack and international cereal company will be based in Chicago.[40] The successor company, known as Global Snacking Co. temporarily, represents 80 percent or $11.4 billion of Kellogg's sales. 60 percent of Global Snacking's business was snacks, and nearly half of the company's business was in the United States. The cereal business, temporarily called North America Cereal Co., would be the second-largest American cereal company and the largest in Canada and the Caribbean, with 5 of the top 11 brands and $2.4 billion in annual sales. Plant-based foods, representing $340 million in annual sales, would be called \"Plant Co.\" and could even be sold.[41] In January 2023, Kellogg's shelved its plans to spin off its plant food business and would retain it as part of Global Snacking Co.[42] On March 15, 2023, Kellogg's announced that North America Cereal Co. branch will be named WK Kellogg Co and Global Snacking Co. branch will be called Kellanova. The ticker symbol \"K\" will be used by Kellanova on the NYSE.[43] The split was completed on October 2, 2023.[44][45] The WK Kellogg Co has the NYSE stock symbol \"KLG\".[46]\n\n\n\n## Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2017, Kellogg's reported earnings of US$1.269 billion, with an annual revenue of US$12.932 billion, a decline of 0.7% over the previous fiscal cycle. Kellogg's market capitalization was valued at over US$22.1 billion in November 2018.[47]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenuein mil. US$\n | Net incomein mil. US$\n | Total Assetsin mil.

Foremost among these is the design of the Kellogg's logo by Ferris Crane under the art direction of famed type guru Y. Ames. Another was the well-remembered jingle \"K E double-L, O double-good, Kellogg's best to you!\".\n\n\nWith the rising popularity of patent medicine in early 20th century advertising, The Kellogg Company of Canada published a book named *A New Way of Living* that showed readers \"how to achieve a new way of living; how to preserve vitality; how to maintain enthusiasm and energy; how to get the most out of life because of a physical ability to enjoy it\". It touted the All-Bran cereal as the secret to leading \"normal\" lives free of constipation.[82]\n\n\nKellogg's was a major sponsor throughout the run of the hit CBS panel show *What's My Line?*[83] It and its associated products Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies were also major sponsors for the PBS Kids children's animated series *Dragon Tales*.[84]\n\n\nKellogg's is a sponsor of USA Gymnastics and produced the Kellogg's Tour of Gymnastics, a 36-city tour held in 2016 after the Olympic games and featured performances by recent medal-winning gymnasts from the United States.[85]\n\n\nKellogg's is currently the title sponsor of three college football bowl games. First, it was announced in 2019 that Kellogg's would become the new title sponsor of the Sun Bowl game, with the game being branded as the \"Tony the Tiger Sun Bowl\".[86] This was followed in 2020 by the company using its Cheez-It brand to sponsor of the game now known as the Pop-Tarts Bowl.[87] In 2022, Kellogg's added the Citrus Bowl to its bowl sponsorships, with the game branded as the \"Cheez-It Citrus Bowl\".[88]\n\n\n\n### Premiums and prizes[edit]\n\n\nW.K. Kellogg was the first to introduce prizes in boxes of cereal. The marketing strategy that he established has produced thousands of different cereal box prizes that have been distributed by the tens of billions.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Children's premiums[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1909, Kellogg's Corn Flakes had the first cereal premium with *The Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Book.* The book was originally available as a prize that was given to the customer in the store with the purchase of two packages of the cereal.[90] But in 1909, Kellogg's changed the book giveaway to a premium mail-in offer for the cost of a dime. Over 2.5 million copies of the book were distributed in different editions over a period of 23 years.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Cereal box prizes[edit]\n\n\nIn 1945, Kellogg's inserted a prize in the form of pin-back buttons into each box of Pep cereal. Pep pins have included U.S. Army squadrons as well as characters from newspaper comics and were available through 1947. There were five series of comic characters and 18 different buttons in each set, with a total of 90 in the collection.[89] Other manufacturers of major brands of cereal, including General Mills, Malt-O-Meal, Nestlé, Post Foods, and Quaker Oats, followed suit and inserted prizes into boxes of cereal to promote sales and brand loyalty.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nLicensed brands have been omitted since the corresponding mascots would be obvious (for example, Spider-Man is the mascot for Spider-Man Spidey-Berry).\n\n\n\n* Cocoa Hoots cereal: Newton the Owl\n* Cocoa Krispies cereal (Known as Choco Krispis in Latin America, Choco Krispies in Germany, Austria, Spain, and Switzerland, Chocos in India, and Coco Pops in Australia, the UK, and Europe): Jose (monkey), Coco (monkey), Melvin (elephant), Snagglepuss (Hanna-Barbera character), Ogg (caveman), Tusk (elephant), and Snap, Crackle and Pop (who were also, and remain as of February 2014, the Rice Krispies mascots; see below)\n* Corn Flakes cereal: Cornelius (rooster)\n* Frosted Flakes (known as Frosties outside the US/Canada, Zucaritas in Latin America and Sucrilhos in Brazil) cereal: Tony the Tiger\n* Froot Loops cereal: Toucan Sam\n* Honey Smacks (US)/Smacks (other markets) cereal: Dig 'Em Frog\n* Raisin Bran cereal: Sunny the Sun\n* Rice Krispies (known as Rice Bubbles in Australia and New Zealand) cereal: Snap, Crackle and Pop\n* Ricicles (UK Only) cereal: Captain Rik\n* Apple Jacks cereal: CinnaMon and Bad Apple\n* Honey Loops cereal: Loopy (bumblebee), Pops (honey bee)\n* Keebler cookies and crackers: Ernie and the Elves\n\n### Motorsports[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's made its first foray into auto racing between 1991 and 1992 when the company sponsored the #41 Chevrolets fielded by Larry Hedrick Motorsports in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series and driven by Phil Parsons, Dave Marcis, Greg Sacks, Hut Stricklin, and Richard Petty, but they gained greater prominence for their sponsorship of two-time Winston Cup Champion Terry Labonte from 1993 to 2006, the last 12 years of that as the sponsor for Hendrick Motorsports' No.5 car. Kellogg's sponsored the No.5 car for Labonte, Kyle Busch, Casey Mears, and Mark Martin until 2010, and it then served as an associate sponsor for Carl Edwards' #99 car for Roush Fenway Racing.\n\n\nKellogg's placed Dale Earnhardt on Kellogg's Corn Flakes boxes for 1993 six-time Winston Cup champion and 1994 seven-time Winston Cup champion, as well as Jeff Gordon on the Mini Wheats box for the 1993 Rookie of the Year, 1995 Brickyard 400 inaugural race, 1997 Champion, and 1998 three-time champion, and a special three-pack racing box set with Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, Terry Labonte, and Dale Jarrett in 1996.\n\n\n\n### Merchandising[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's has used some merchandising for their products. Kellogg's once released *Mission Nutrition*, a PC game that came free with special packs of cereal. It played in a similar fashion as *Donkey Kong Country*; users could play as Tony the Tiger, Coco the Monkey, or Snap, Crackle, and Pop. Kellogg's has also released \"Talking\" games. The two current versions are Talking Tony and Talking Sam. In these games, a microphone is used to play games and create voice commands for their computers. In Talking Tony, Tony the Tiger, one of Kellogg's most famous mascots, would be the main and only character in the game. In Talking Sam, Toucan Sam, another famous mascot, would be in the game, instead. Some [toy cars] have the Kellogg's logo on them, and occasionally their mascots.\n\n\nThere was also a Talking Snap Crackle and Pop software.\n\n\n\n### Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's frequently partners with the Olympic Games to feature American athletes from the Olympic Games on the packages of their cereal brands.[92] In 2017, the company announced its marketing campaign for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games featuring American athletes Nathan Chen, Kelly Clark, Meghan Duggan and Mike Schultz.[93]\n\n\n\n## Misleading claims[edit]\n\n\n### Advertising[edit]\n\n\n> \n> We expect more from a great American company than making dubious claims—not once, but twice—that its cereals improve children's health...\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Jon Leibowitz, Chairman of the F.T.C.[94]\n\nOn June 3, 2010, Kellogg's was found to be making unsubstantiated and misleading claims in advertising their cereal products by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).[94][95][96]\n\n\nKellogg's responded by stating \"We stand behind the validity of our product claims and research, so we agreed to an order that covers those claims. We believe that the revisions to the existing consent agreement satisfied any remaining concerns.\"[96]\n\n\nThe FTC had previously found fault with Kellogg's claims that Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal improved kids' attentiveness by nearly 20%.[97]\n\n\nThe Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus has also suggested that the language on Kellogg Pop-Tarts packages saying the pastries are \"Made with Real Fruit\" should be taken off the products.[98] In July 2012, the UK banned a \"Special K\" advertisement due to its citing caloric values that did not take into account the caloric value of milk consumed with the cereal.[99] In 2016 an ad telling UK consumers that Special K is “full of goodness” and “nutritious” was banned.[100]\n\n\n\n### Questionable nutritional value[edit]\n\n\nSome of Kellogg's marketing has been questioned in the press, prompted by an increase in consumer awareness of the mismatch between the marketing messages and the products themselves.[101]\n\n\nFood bloggers are also questioning the marketing methods used by cereal manufacturing companies such as Kellogg's, due to their high sugar content and use of ingredients such as high-fructose corn syrup.[102]\n\n\n\n### 2021 Pop-Tarts lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nA class-action lawsuit was filed against Kellogg's in October 2021 claiming they are not putting enough strawberries in their strawberry flavored Pop-Tarts, and seeking $5 million in damages.[103] In April 2022, the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge.[104]\n\n\nAnother lawsuit was filed against Kellog's in 2021, with the plaintiff claiming that Kellogg's defrauded customers regarding the contents of its Frosted Chocolate Fudge Pop-Tarts. The plaintiff stated she would not have purchased the Pop-Tarts had she known they did not contain milk, milkfat, or butter. In June 2022, a US district judge dismissed the lawsuit, stating that a reasonable consumer would not expect those ingredients.[105]\n\n\n\n## Recalls[edit]\n\n\n### 2010 cereal recall[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, the company voluntarily began to recall about 28 million boxes of Apple Jacks, Corn Pops, Froot Loops and Honey Smacks because of an unusual smell and flavor from the packages' liners that could make people ill. Kellogg's said about 20 people complained about the cereals, including five who reported nausea and vomiting. Consumers reported the cereal smelled or tasted waxy or like metal or soap. Company spokeswoman J. Adaire Putnam said some described it as tasting stale. However, no serious health problems had been reported.[106]\n\n\nThe suspected chemical that caused the illnesses was 2-methylnaphthalene, used in the cereal packaging process. Little is known about 2-methylnaphthalene's impact on human health as the Food and Drug Administration has no scientific data on its impact on humans, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also does not have health and safety data. This is despite the EPA having sought information on it from the chemical industry for 16 years. 2-Methylnaphthalene is a component of crude oil and is \"structurally related to naphthalene, an ingredient in mothballs and toilet-deodorant blocks\" that the EPA considers a possible human carcinogen.[107][108]\n\n\n*Kellogg's* offered consumers refunds in the meantime.[109] Only products with the letters \"KN\" following the use-by date were included in the recall.[110] The products were distributed throughout the US and began arriving in stores in late March 2010. Products in Canada were not affected.[111]\n\n\n\n### 2012 cereal recall[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's issued a voluntary recall of some of its \"Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size Original\" and \"Mini-Wheats Unfrosted Bite Size\" products due to the possibility of flexible metal mesh fragments in the food. The affected products varied in size from single-serving bowls to large 70-ounce cartons. Use-by dates printed on the recalled packages ranged from April 1, 2013, to September 21, 2013, and were accompanied by the letters KB, AP or FK.[112]\n\n\n\n## Human rights violations and strikes[edit]\n\n\n### Human right violations of palm oil in 2016[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Amnesty International in 2016, Kellogg's palm oil provider Wilmar International profited from 8 to 14-year-old child labor and forced labor. Some workers were extorted, threatened or not paid for work. Some workers suffered severe injuries from chemicals such as Paraquat.[113][114] Kellogg's alleged not being aware of the child abuses due to traceability; Amnesty's human rights director replied that \"Using mealy-mouthed excuses about 'traceability' is a total cop-out.\"[115]\n\n\n\n### 2021 strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Kellogg's strike\n\nIn October 2021, over a thousand employees at four Kelloggs manufacturing plants in the United States went on strike for better working conditions and higher wages. Two months into the strikes, Kelloggs fired all the striking workers and posted their jobs in December after negotiations with the BCTGM union failed. During the talks, Kelloggs had threatened to move jobs to Mexico if the union did not agree to Kelloggs' proposal.[116] Kelloggs also filed a lawsuit against the union.[117] As a result, several calls for a boycott went viral.[118][119]\n\n\n\n## Political involvement[edit]\n\n\n### Genetically modified foods labelling[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's donated around US$2 million opposing California Proposition 37, a 2012 ballot initiative that, if enacted, would have required compulsory labeling of genetically engineered food products.[120] In March 2016, though, they vowed to label all of their products with genetically modified organisms as such by 2020.[121]\n\n\n\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2014, Kellogg's called on the President to support the Paris Agreement on climate change.[122] In 2016, Kellogg Company urged President-elect Donald Trump to \"continue the Paris Climate Agreement\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Voter ID laws[edit]\n\n\nKellogg's has donated to notable groups opposing voter-ID laws, such as the Applied Research Center (now RaceForward).[124] The company also decided to remove their advertisements from the Breitbart News website.[125] Breitbart News in turn called for a boycott of Kellogg's products.[126]\n\n\n\n### Education grant[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2012, Kellogg's gave the Calhoun School a $250,000 grant for a \"three-part youth-based project on issues of white privilege and institutionalized racism\".[127]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Trafford Park factory in Greater Manchester, England—Kellogg's European base since 1938.[4] The factory produces more Corn Flakes than any other Kellogg's factory in the world.[128]\n* Australia:\n\t+ Pagewood[129]\n\t+ Charmhaven (snack and cereal plant closed in 2014.)[130]\n* Belgium: Zaventem & Mechelen plant\n* Brazil: São Paulo\n* Colombia: Bogotá\n* Canada:\n\t+ Mississauga, Ontario – Canadian head office\n\t+ Anjou, Quebec – Eastern Canada sales office\n\t+ Calgary, Alberta – Western Canada sales office\n\t+ London, Ontario – manufacturers and distributes cereals (including Corn Flakes) in Canada.

Founded on the banks of the Mississippi River at Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis, the company originally gained fame for being a large flour miller. Today, the company markets many well-known North American brands, including Gold Medal flour, Annie's Homegrown, Lärabar, Cascadian Farm, Betty Crocker, Yoplait, Nature Valley, Totino's, Pillsbury, Old El Paso, Häagen-Dazs, as well as breakfast cereals under the General Mills name, including Cheerios, Chex, Lucky Charms, Trix, Cocoa Puffs and Count Chocula and the other monster cereals.[3]\n\n\nIt is headquartered in Golden Valley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement, late 1880s\n### Washburn-Crosby Company[edit]\n\n\nThe company can trace its history to the **Minneapolis Milling Company**, incorporated in 1856.[4] The company was founded by Illinois Congressman Robert Smith, who leased power rights to flour mills operating along the west side of Saint Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Cadwallader C. Washburn acquired the company shortly after its founding and hired his brother William D. Washburn to assist in the company's development. In 1866 the Washburns got into the business themselves, building the Washburn \"B\" Mill at the falls. At the time, the building was considered to be so large and output so vast that it could not possibly sustain itself. However, the company succeeded, and in 1874 he built the even bigger Washburn \"A\" Mill.\n\n\nIn 1877, the mill entered a partnership with John Crosby to form the **Washburn-Crosby Company**, producing winter wheat Flour. That same year Washburn sent William Hood Dunwoody to England to open the market for spring wheat.[5] Dunwoody was successful and became a silent partner.\n\n\nIn 1878, the \"A\" mill was destroyed in a flour dust explosion along with five nearby buildings, an event known as the Great Mill Disaster. The ensuing fire led to the death of 18 workers.[6] Construction of a new mill began immediately. Not only was the new mill safer but it also was able to produce a higher quality flour after the old grinding stones were replaced with automatic steel rollers, the first ever used.\n\n\nIn 1880, Washburn-Crosby flour brands won gold, silver and bronze medals at the Millers' International Exhibition in Cincinnati, causing them to launch the Gold Medal flour brand.[7]\n\n\nIn 1924, the company acquired a failing Twin Cities radio station, WLAG, renaming it WCCO (from Washburn-Crosby Company).\n\n\n\n### Founding as General Mills[edit]\n\n\n**General Mills** itself was created on June 20, 1928,[8] when Washburn-Crosby President James Ford Bell merged Washburn-Crosby with three other mills.[9] In the same year, General Mills acquired the Wichita Mill and Elevator Company of the industrialist Frank Kell of Wichita Falls, Texas. With the sale, Kell acquired cash plus stock in the corporation.[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Postcard image of the Gold Medal Flour factory in Minneapolis c. 1900\nShares of the new company's stock were first sold on the New York Stock Exchange on November 30, 1928, at $65 per share. The newly merged company paid a dividend in 1928 and has continued the dividend uninterrupted ever since – one of only a few companies to pay a dividend every year since its founding.[8]\n\n\n\n### Engineering milestones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Mills's corporate campus in Golden Valley, Minnesota\nIn the 1930s, General Mills engineer, Thomas R. James, created the puffing gun, which inflated or distorted cereal pieces into puffed-up shapes. This new technology was used in 1937 to create Kix cereal and in 1941 to create Cheerioats (known today as Cheerios).\nIn 1939, General Mills engineer Helmer Anderson created the Anderson sealer. This new device allowed for bags of flour to be sealed with glue instead of just being tied with a string.\nIn 1956, General Mills created the tear-strip for easily opening packages.\n\n\n\n### Aeronautical Research Division and Electronics Division[edit]\n\n\nIn 1946, General Mills established their Aeronautical Research Division with chief engineer Otto C. Winzen. This division developed high altitude balloons in conjunction with the United States Navy Office of Naval Research (ONR), such as the Skyhook balloon.[11]\n\n\nIn 1956, hundreds of General Mills balloons carrying reconnaissance equipment were launched by the United States government under Project Genetrix to surveil Eastern bloc countries, in particular their nuclear capabilities.[12][13]\n\n\nThe aeronautical work of General Mills done around the time of the Second World War was continued by Raven Industries.[14]\n\n\nThe General Mills Electronics division developed the DSV *Alvin* submersible, which is notable for being used in investigating the wreck of *Titanic* among other deep-sea exploration missions.[15]\n\n\n\n### Merchandising and television[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1929, General Mills products contained box top coupons, known as Betty Crocker coupons, with varying point values, which were redeemable for discounts on a variety of housewares products featured in the widely distributed Betty Crocker catalog. The coupons and the catalog were discontinued by the company in 2006.\n\n\nGeneral Mills became the sponsor of the popular radio show *The Lone Ranger* in 1941. The show was then brought to television, and, after 20 years, their sponsorship came to an end in 1961.\n\n\n\n![](image)Former site of General Mills today on the Mississippi River at Minneapolis\nBeginning in 1959, General Mills sponsored the *Rocky and His Friends* television series, later known as *The Bullwinkle Show*. Until 1968, Rocky and Bullwinkle were featured in a variety of advertisements for General Mills. General Mills was also a sponsor of the Saturday-morning cartoons from the Total Television productions studio, including Tennessee Tuxedo.[16] The company also was a sponsor of the ABC western series *The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp*, starring Hugh O'Brian. The company, along with its subsidiary The Program Exchange, backed DiC Entertainment in syndicating the *Dennis the Menace* animated series based on the comic strip of the same name created by Hank Ketcham in 1986. From 1997 until May 31, 2004, General Mills sponsored and syndicated the first 82 episodes of the original *Sailor Moon* English dub (the remaining 17 of 82 episodes premiered on Cartoon Network's programming block Toonami in 1998).\n\n\n\n### Diversification: toys and restaurants[edit]\n\n\nThe first venture General Mills took into the toy industry was in 1965. The company bought Rainbow Crafts, which was the manufacturer of Play-Doh. General Mills's purchase of the company was significant because it brought production costs down and tripled the revenue.\n\n\nIn 1967, General Mills bought the Kenner toy company.\n\n\nGeneral Mills came out with their \"monster cereals\" in the 1970s. The cereals are now produced and sold seasonally around Halloween.[17]\n\n\nIn 1970, General Mills acquired a five-unit restaurant company called Red Lobster and expanded it nationwide. Soon, a division of General Mills titled General Mills Restaurants developed to take charge of the Red Lobster chain. In 1980, General Mills acquired the California-based Good Earth health food restaurant chain.[18] The company eventually converted the restaurants into other chain restaurants they were operating, such as Red Lobster.[19][20] In 1982, General Mills Restaurants founded a new Italian-themed restaurant chain called Olive Garden. Another themed restaurant, China Coast, was added before the entire group was spun off to General Mills shareholders in 1995 as Darden Restaurants.\n\n\nDuring the same decade, General Mills ventured further, starting the General Mills Specialty Retail Group. They acquired two clothing and apparel companies, Talbots and Eddie Bauer. The acquisition was short-lived. Talbots was purchased by a Japanese company, then known as JUSCO, and the Spiegel company purchased Bauer. Spiegel later declared bankruptcy, yet Bauer still remains, albeit in a smaller presence in the United States today.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Washburn \"A\" Mill, the producer of Gold Medal Flour, now the Minnesota Historical Society Mill City Museum\nFrom 1976 to 1985, General Mills went to court as the parent company of Parker Brothers, which held the rights on the brand name and gaming idea of the board game *Monopoly*, claiming that the so-called Anti-Monopoly game of an economics professor infringed their trademark. The dispute extended up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled against them, saying that while they have exclusive rights to the game *Monopoly*, they cannot prevent others from using the word \"monopoly\" in the name of a game.\n\n\nIn 1985, General Mills's toy division was separated from its parent as Kenner Parker Toys, Inc. There were many potential acquirers of the business but it was floated on the stock exchange with General Mills's shareholders getting equivalent shares in Kenner Parker. This was more tax efficient for General Mills.[21]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\nIn 1990, a joint venture with Nestlé S.A. called Cereal Partners was formed[22] which markets cereals (including many existing General Mills cereal brands) outside the US and Canada under the Nestlé name.\n\n\nIn 2001, the company purchased Pillsbury (sans Burger King) from Diageo, although it was officially described as a \"merger\".\n\n\nSince 2004, General Mills has been producing more products targeted to the growing ranks of health-conscious consumers. The company has chosen to switch its entire breakfast cereal line to whole grain. The company also started manufacturing their child-targeted cereals with less sugar.[23][24] General Mills has reduced the level of sugar in all cereals advertised to children to 11 grams per serving.[25]\n\n\nIn April 2011, General Mills announced that it will switch all 1 million eggs it uses each year to cage-free.[26]\n\n\nGeneral Mills was ranked #181 on the 2012 Fortune 500 list of America's largest corporations,[27] 161 in 2015 and was the third-largest food consumer products company in the United States.[28] During June 2012, the company's vice-president for diversity stated that General Mills opposes a Minnesota amendment banning gay marriage, stating that the company values \"inclusion\".[29] The company received positive feedback for its stand which might attract people to its global workforce.[30]\n\n\nThe company announced in September 2014 that it would acquire organic food producer Annie's Inc. for a fee of around $820 million, as part of its strategy to expand in the US natural foods market.[31] In October 2014, General Mills announced plans to cut 700 to 800 jobs, mostly in U.S., in corporate restructuring planned to be completed by the end of 2015.[32]\n\n\nIn 2015, citing climate change, General Mills promised to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent over 10 years.[33][34] In December 2016, the company announced it would be restructuring, splitting into four business groups based on global region, and cutting as many as 600 jobs.[35]\n\n\nIn February 2018, the company entered into the pet products industry, paying $8 billion to buy Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc.[36] As of 2018, the company ranked 182nd on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.[37]\n\n\nHaving launched its first regenerative agriculture pilot program in March 2019, the company has plans to improve soil health on 1 million acres of farmland by 2030 and has formed a partnership with Regrow Agriculture, a software and data analysis company that uses satellite imagery, weather data, and soil data to measure carbon sequestration in soil.[38][39]\n\n\nIn February 2020, General Mills was recognized by CDP as a global leader in corporate sustainability and received a place on the CDP \"A List\" for both climate change and water security.[40]\n\n\nOn May 15, 2021, General Mills announced that it was acquiring Tyson Foods's pet treat business, including True Chews, Nudges and Top Chews, for $1.2 billion.[41] The acquisition was completed on July 7, 2021.[42]\n\n\nIn April 2022, there were increasing news reports and complaints that the company's Lucky Charms cereal was somehow making individuals ill, with the most common complaints being gastrointestinal in nature, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The episodes have not yet resulted in a company- or FDA-initiated recall; an FDA spokesperson said they were investigating approximately 100 reports. These reports came as norovirus was circulating in some areas of the U.S. It is relatively rare for cereals, as opposed to other foods, to be contaminated by microbes, because they must be baked, although it is possible if conditions are unsanitary.[43][44]\n\n\nOn May 12, 2022, General Mills announced that it was acquiring TNT Crust, a supplier of frozen pizza crusts, from Peak Rock Capital.[45]\n\n\nOn May 25, 2022, General Mills announced that it was selling its Hamburger Helper and Suddenly Salad businesses to Eagle Family Foods Group for $610 million. The sale was completed on July 5, 2022.[46]\n\n\nOn November 9, 2023, General Mills acquired a pet supplement business, Fera Pets, Inc.[47]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n### Change to legal terms[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2014, the company announced that it had changed its legal terms on its website to introduce an arbitration clause requiring all disputes with General Mills to be resolved in small claims court or arbitration and not as a participant in a class action.[48][49] The change was made shortly after a judge's March 26, 2014, denial of a motion to dismiss a class action regarding the marketing of the company's Nature Valley brand products.[49] Users would be deemed to accept the terms by interacting with General Mills on its website in various ways, such as downloading coupons, subscribing to newsletters, or participating in Internet forums hosted on the website.[50][51] *The New York Times* stated that the agreement could be interpreted to additionally construe purchasing General Mills products at a grocery store or liking the company's Facebook page as assent to the terms;[48] General Mills disclaimed that interpretation, calling it a \"mischaracterization\".[51][52][53] The change in terms resulted in a massive backlash of protests via consumer groups and social media, and General Mills reverted the terms back to the original content after only a few days.[54]\n\n\n\n### Involvement in Israeli settlements[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of companies operating in West Bank settlements\n\nOn 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of companies doing business related in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights.[55] General Mills was listed on the database on account of the activities of its subsidiary General Mills Israel in Israeli settlements in these occupied territories,[56] which some have argued is illegal under international law.[57]\n\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\n### Breakfast cereals[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Mills's breakfast cereals include:\n\n\n\n* Basic 4\n* Boo-Berry\n* Cascadian Farm\n* Cheerios and its variants\n* Chex and its variants\n* Cinnamon Toast Crunch\n* Cocoa Puffs\n* Cookie Crisp\n* Count Chocula\n* Fiber One / Fibre One\n* Franken-Berry\n* French Toast Crunch[58]\n* Gold Flakes\n* Golden Grahams\n* Honey Nut Clusters\n* Kix\n* Lucky Charms\n* Morning Summit[59]\n* Nesquik\n* Oatmeal Crisp\n* Raisin Nut Bran\n* Reese's Puffs\n* Total\n* Trix\n* Wheaties\n\nSome brands are marketed outside the US and Canada by the Cereal Partners joint venture using the Nestlé brand.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Discontinued cereals[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Mills cereals no longer manufactured include:\n\n\n\n* Banana Wackies / Wackies (introduced 1965; discontinued 1968)[60]\n* Baron von Redberry and Sir Grapefellow (introduced 1972, discontinued 1975)[61]\n* Benefit (which contained psyllium, an Indian-grown grain used as a laxative and cholesterol-reducer)[62]\n* Body Buddies (introduced 1979; two flavors, Brown Sugar & Honey and Natural Fruit Flavor)[63]\n* Buc Wheats[63]\n* Buñuelitos (\"Sweetened corn puffs with cinnamon and a touch of honey...

Founded on the banks of the Mississippi River at Saint Anthony Falls in Minneapolis, the company originally gained fame for being a large flour miller. Today, the company markets many well-known North American brands, including Gold Medal flour, Annie's Homegrown, Lärabar, Cascadian Farm, Betty Crocker, Yoplait, Nature Valley, Totino's, Pillsbury, Old El Paso, Häagen-Dazs, as well as breakfast cereals under the General Mills name, including Cheerios, Chex, Lucky Charms, Trix, Cocoa Puffs and Count Chocula and the other monster cereals.[3]\n\n\nIt is headquartered in Golden Valley, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement, late 1880s\n### Washburn-Crosby Company[edit]\n\n\nThe company can trace its history to the **Minneapolis Milling Company**, incorporated in 1856.[4] The company was founded by Illinois Congressman Robert Smith, who leased power rights to flour mills operating along the west side of Saint Anthony Falls on the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Cadwallader C. Washburn acquired the company shortly after its founding and hired his brother William D. Washburn to assist in the company's development. In 1866 the Washburns got into the business themselves, building the Washburn \"B\" Mill at the falls. At the time, the building was considered to be so large and output so vast that it could not possibly sustain itself. However, the company succeeded, and in 1874 he built the even bigger Washburn \"A\" Mill.\n\n\nIn 1877, the mill entered a partnership with John Crosby to form the **Washburn-Crosby Company**, producing winter wheat Flour. That same year Washburn sent William Hood Dunwoody to England to open the market for spring wheat.[5] Dunwoody was successful and became a silent partner.\n\n\nIn 1878, the \"A\" mill was destroyed in a flour dust explosion along with five nearby buildings, an event known as the Great Mill Disaster. The ensuing fire led to the death of 18 workers.[6] Construction of a new mill began immediately. Not only was the new mill safer but it also was able to produce a higher quality flour after the old grinding stones were replaced with automatic steel rollers, the first ever used.\n\n\nIn 1880, Washburn-Crosby flour brands won gold, silver and bronze medals at the Millers' International Exhibition in Cincinnati, causing them to launch the Gold Medal flour brand.[7]\n\n\nIn 1924, the company acquired a failing Twin Cities radio station, WLAG, renaming it WCCO (from Washburn-Crosby Company).\n\n\n\n### Founding as General Mills[edit]\n\n\n**General Mills** itself was created on June 20, 1928,[8] when Washburn-Crosby President James Ford Bell merged Washburn-Crosby with three other mills.[9] In the same year, General Mills acquired the Wichita Mill and Elevator Company of the industrialist Frank Kell of Wichita Falls, Texas. With the sale, Kell acquired cash plus stock in the corporation.[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Postcard image of the Gold Medal Flour factory in Minneapolis c. 1900\nShares of the new company's stock were first sold on the New York Stock Exchange on November 30, 1928, at $65 per share. The newly merged company paid a dividend in 1928 and has continued the dividend uninterrupted ever since – one of only a few companies to pay a dividend every year since its founding.[8]\n\n\n\n### Engineering milestones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Mills's corporate campus in Golden Valley, Minnesota\nIn the 1930s, General Mills engineer, Thomas R. James, created the puffing gun, which inflated or distorted cereal pieces into puffed-up shapes. This new technology was used in 1937 to create Kix cereal and in 1941 to create Cheerioats (known today as Cheerios).\nIn 1939, General Mills engineer Helmer Anderson created the Anderson sealer. This new device allowed for bags of flour to be sealed with glue instead of just being tied with a string.\nIn 1956, General Mills created the tear-strip for easily opening packages.\n\n\n\n### Aeronautical Research Division and Electronics Division[edit]\n\n\nIn 1946, General Mills established their Aeronautical Research Division with chief engineer Otto C. Winzen. This division developed high altitude balloons in conjunction with the United States Navy Office of Naval Research (ONR), such as the Skyhook balloon.[11]\n\n\nIn 1956, hundreds of General Mills balloons carrying reconnaissance equipment were launched by the United States government under Project Genetrix to surveil Eastern bloc countries, in particular their nuclear capabilities.[12][13]\n\n\nThe aeronautical work of General Mills done around the time of the Second World War was continued by Raven Industries.[14]\n\n\nThe General Mills Electronics division developed the DSV *Alvin* submersible, which is notable for being used in investigating the wreck of *Titanic* among other deep-sea exploration missions.[15]\n\n\n\n### Merchandising and television[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1929, General Mills products contained box top coupons, known as Betty Crocker coupons, with varying point values, which were redeemable for discounts on a variety of housewares products featured in the widely distributed Betty Crocker catalog. The coupons and the catalog were discontinued by the company in 2006.\n\n\nGeneral Mills became the sponsor of the popular radio show *The Lone Ranger* in 1941. The show was then brought to television, and, after 20 years, their sponsorship came to an end in 1961.\n\n\n\n![](image)Former site of General Mills today on the Mississippi River at Minneapolis\nBeginning in 1959, General Mills sponsored the *Rocky and His Friends* television series, later known as *The Bullwinkle Show*. Until 1968, Rocky and Bullwinkle were featured in a variety of advertisements for General Mills. General Mills was also a sponsor of the Saturday-morning cartoons from the Total Television productions studio, including Tennessee Tuxedo.[16] The company also was a sponsor of the ABC western series *The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp*, starring Hugh O'Brian. The company, along with its subsidiary The Program Exchange, backed DiC Entertainment in syndicating the *Dennis the Menace* animated series based on the comic strip of the same name created by Hank Ketcham in 1986. From 1997 until May 31, 2004, General Mills sponsored and syndicated the first 82 episodes of the original *Sailor Moon* English dub (the remaining 17 of 82 episodes premiered on Cartoon Network's programming block Toonami in 1998).\n\n\n\n### Diversification: toys and restaurants[edit]\n\n\nThe first venture General Mills took into the toy industry was in 1965. The company bought Rainbow Crafts, which was the manufacturer of Play-Doh. General Mills's purchase of the company was significant because it brought production costs down and tripled the revenue.\n\n\nIn 1967, General Mills bought the Kenner toy company.\n\n\nGeneral Mills came out with their \"monster cereals\" in the 1970s. The cereals are now produced and sold seasonally around Halloween.[17]\n\n\nIn 1970, General Mills acquired a five-unit restaurant company called Red Lobster and expanded it nationwide. Soon, a division of General Mills titled General Mills Restaurants developed to take charge of the Red Lobster chain. In 1980, General Mills acquired the California-based Good Earth health food restaurant chain.[18] The company eventually converted the restaurants into other chain restaurants they were operating, such as Red Lobster.[19][20] In 1982, General Mills Restaurants founded a new Italian-themed restaurant chain called Olive Garden. Another themed restaurant, China Coast, was added before the entire group was spun off to General Mills shareholders in 1995 as Darden Restaurants.\n\n\nDuring the same decade, General Mills ventured further, starting the General Mills Specialty Retail Group. They acquired two clothing and apparel companies, Talbots and Eddie Bauer. The acquisition was short-lived. Talbots was purchased by a Japanese company, then known as JUSCO, and the Spiegel company purchased Bauer. Spiegel later declared bankruptcy, yet Bauer still remains, albeit in a smaller presence in the United States today.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Washburn \"A\" Mill, the producer of Gold Medal Flour, now the Minnesota Historical Society Mill City Museum\nFrom 1976 to 1985, General Mills went to court as the parent company of Parker Brothers, which held the rights on the brand name and gaming idea of the board game *Monopoly*, claiming that the so-called Anti-Monopoly game of an economics professor infringed their trademark. The dispute extended up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled against them, saying that while they have exclusive rights to the game *Monopoly*, they cannot prevent others from using the word \"monopoly\" in the name of a game.\n\n\nIn 1985, General Mills's toy division was separated from its parent as Kenner Parker Toys, Inc. There were many potential acquirers of the business but it was floated on the stock exchange with General Mills's shareholders getting equivalent shares in Kenner Parker. This was more tax efficient for General Mills.[21]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\nIn 1990, a joint venture with Nestlé S.A. called Cereal Partners was formed[22] which markets cereals (including many existing General Mills cereal brands) outside the US and Canada under the Nestlé name.\n\n\nIn 2001, the company purchased Pillsbury (sans Burger King) from Diageo, although it was officially described as a \"merger\".\n\n\nSince 2004, General Mills has been producing more products targeted to the growing ranks of health-conscious consumers. The company has chosen to switch its entire breakfast cereal line to whole grain. The company also started manufacturing their child-targeted cereals with less sugar.[23][24] General Mills has reduced the level of sugar in all cereals advertised to children to 11 grams per serving.[25]\n\n\nIn April 2011, General Mills announced that it will switch all 1 million eggs it uses each year to cage-free.[26]\n\n\nGeneral Mills was ranked #181 on the 2012 Fortune 500 list of America's largest corporations,[27] 161 in 2015 and was the third-largest food consumer products company in the United States.[28] During June 2012, the company's vice-president for diversity stated that General Mills opposes a Minnesota amendment banning gay marriage, stating that the company values \"inclusion\".[29] The company received positive feedback for its stand which might attract people to its global workforce.[30]\n\n\nThe company announced in September 2014 that it would acquire organic food producer Annie's Inc. for a fee of around $820 million, as part of its strategy to expand in the US natural foods market.[31] In October 2014, General Mills announced plans to cut 700 to 800 jobs, mostly in U.S., in corporate restructuring planned to be completed by the end of 2015.[32]\n\n\nIn 2015, citing climate change, General Mills promised to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 28 percent over 10 years.[33][34] In December 2016, the company announced it would be restructuring, splitting into four business groups based on global region, and cutting as many as 600 jobs.[35]\n\n\nIn February 2018, the company entered into the pet products industry, paying $8 billion to buy Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc.[36] As of 2018, the company ranked 182nd on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.[37]\n\n\nHaving launched its first regenerative agriculture pilot program in March 2019, the company has plans to improve soil health on 1 million acres of farmland by 2030 and has formed a partnership with Regrow Agriculture, a software and data analysis company that uses satellite imagery, weather data, and soil data to measure carbon sequestration in soil.[38][39]\n\n\nIn February 2020, General Mills was recognized by CDP as a global leader in corporate sustainability and received a place on the CDP \"A List\" for both climate change and water security.[40]\n\n\nOn May 15, 2021, General Mills announced that it was acquiring Tyson Foods's pet treat business, including True Chews, Nudges and Top Chews, for $1.2 billion.[41] The acquisition was completed on July 7, 2021.[42]\n\n\nIn April 2022, there were increasing news reports and complaints that the company's Lucky Charms cereal was somehow making individuals ill, with the most common complaints being gastrointestinal in nature, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The episodes have not yet resulted in a company- or FDA-initiated recall; an FDA spokesperson said they were investigating approximately 100 reports. These reports came as norovirus was circulating in some areas of the U.S. It is relatively rare for cereals, as opposed to other foods, to be contaminated by microbes, because they must be baked, although it is possible if conditions are unsanitary.[43][44]\n\n\nOn May 12, 2022, General Mills announced that it was acquiring TNT Crust, a supplier of frozen pizza crusts, from Peak Rock Capital.[45]\n\n\nOn May 25, 2022, General Mills announced that it was selling its Hamburger Helper and Suddenly Salad businesses to Eagle Family Foods Group for $610 million. The sale was completed on July 5, 2022.[46]\n\n\nOn November 9, 2023, General Mills acquired a pet supplement business, Fera Pets, Inc.[47]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\n### Change to legal terms[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2014, the company announced that it had changed its legal terms on its website to introduce an arbitration clause requiring all disputes with General Mills to be resolved in small claims court or arbitration and not as a participant in a class action.[48][49] The change was made shortly after a judge's March 26, 2014, denial of a motion to dismiss a class action regarding the marketing of the company's Nature Valley brand products.[49] Users would be deemed to accept the terms by interacting with General Mills on its website in various ways, such as downloading coupons, subscribing to newsletters, or participating in Internet forums hosted on the website.[50][51] *The New York Times* stated that the agreement could be interpreted to additionally construe purchasing General Mills products at a grocery store or liking the company's Facebook page as assent to the terms;[48] General Mills disclaimed that interpretation, calling it a \"mischaracterization\".[51][52][53] The change in terms resulted in a massive backlash of protests via consumer groups and social media, and General Mills reverted the terms back to the original content after only a few days.[54]\n\n\n\n### Involvement in Israeli settlements[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of companies operating in West Bank settlements\n\nOn 12 February 2020, the United Nations published a database of companies doing business related in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as in the occupied Golan Heights.[55] General Mills was listed on the database on account of the activities of its subsidiary General Mills Israel in Israeli settlements in these occupied territories,[56] which some have argued is illegal under international law.[57]\n\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\n### Breakfast cereals[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Mills's breakfast cereals include:\n\n\n\n* Basic 4\n* Boo-Berry\n* Cascadian Farm\n* Cheerios and its variants\n* Chex and its variants\n* Cinnamon Toast Crunch\n* Cocoa Puffs\n* Cookie Crisp\n* Count Chocula\n* Fiber One / Fibre One\n* Franken-Berry\n* French Toast Crunch[58]\n* Gold Flakes\n* Golden Grahams\n* Honey Nut Clusters\n* Kix\n* Lucky Charms\n* Morning Summit[59]\n* Nesquik\n* Oatmeal Crisp\n* Raisin Nut Bran\n* Reese's Puffs\n* Total\n* Trix\n* Wheaties\n\nSome brands are marketed outside the US and Canada by the Cereal Partners joint venture using the Nestlé brand.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Discontinued cereals[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Mills cereals no longer manufactured include:\n\n\n\n* Banana Wackies / Wackies (introduced 1965; discontinued 1968)[60]\n* Baron von Redberry and Sir Grapefellow (introduced 1972, discontinued 1975)[61]\n* Benefit (which contained psyllium, an Indian-grown grain used as a laxative and cholesterol-reducer)[62]\n* Body Buddies (introduced 1979; two flavors, Brown Sugar & Honey and Natural Fruit Flavor)[63]\n* Buc Wheats[63]\n* Buñuelitos (\"Sweetened corn puffs with cinnamon and a touch of honey...

W. Post, owns a large portfolio of cereal brands that include Bran Flakes, Honey Bunches of Oats, Golden Crisp, Grape-Nuts, Honeycomb, Oreo O's, Pebbles, and Waffle Crisp, among others. The company also produces several pet food brands, including Rachael Ray Nutrish, Kibbles 'n Bits, and 9Lives, and markets Peter Pan Peanut Butter.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)C.W. Post, founder\nC. W. Post established his company in Battle Creek, Michigan, having lived there since 1891, when he was a patient at a holistic sanitarium operated by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg.[1][2] Dr. Kellogg, with his brother W. K. Kellogg, had developed a dry corn flake cereal that was part of their patients’ diet. Post's first product, introduced in 1895, was not a cereal, however, but a roasted, cereal-based beverage, Postum. Having developed an aversion to coffee during his time in the sanitarium, Post positioned Postum as a healthy alternative. Its advertising slogan, which he coined himself, was, \"There's a Reason.\" Postum's main ingredients were naturally caffeine-free wheat grain, bran, and molasses. Initially, Postum had to be brewed like coffee, but in 1911, Post introduced a powdered, instant formulation. This version of the product was manufactured in Battle Creek until it was discontinued in 2007. As of January 2013, Eliza's Quest Food had succeeded in returning Postum to many grocery stores across the United States and Canada.\n\n\nIn 1897, Post introduced his first dry cereal, a crunchy blend of wheat and barley, which he called Grape Nuts. His first corn-flake product was introduced as \"Elijah's Manna\" in 1904. Owing to consumer resistance to the (inaccurate) biblical reference[3] that was so great that even Great Britain flatly refused to register the name as a trademark, it was renamed Post Toasties in 1907.[4]\n\n\nC. W. Post was an astute businessman who believed that advertising and aggressive marketing were the keys to a successful enterprise. Within 10 years of its incorporation, his Postum Cereal Company had more than $10 million in capital and was spending $400,000 a year on advertising, sums which were remarkable for the period.[5] Although he vigorously opposed labor unions, his employees were the highest-paid in his industry and working conditions at the Post factory were exemplary. He even developed a factory town in which he sold homes to his workers at favorable rates.\n\n\nPostum Cereal Company lost its founder in 1914. C.W. Post underwent an apparently successful appendectomy at the Mayo Clinic, but shortly after returning home to recuperate, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Post had for years suffered from bouts of illness and depression. While his death was without warning, his company was not left rudderless. His daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, had been raised in the business and was familiar with virtually every aspect of its operations.[6] She assumed control of the now $20-million Postum Company and managed its affairs for the next eight years. While she did not oversee major product innovations, she did have a good feel for business and for promoting talented managers. In addition, her second marriage, in 1920, was to Edward F. Hutton, the founder of a brokerage firm on Wall Street.\n\n\nGross revenues in 1921 were $17.75 million.[7] In 1922, Hutton took the newly incorporated Postum Cereal Company public by issuing 200,000 common shares. The 1920s was a period in which common stock was still considered highly speculative, and consequently the newly issued shares carried a dividend at the rate of $5.00 per year.\n\n\nRevenues in 1922 were essentially the same as in 1921, but in 1923, they were $22.25 million and a stock split, in the form of a 100% stock dividend, increased the authorized shares to 400,000. These shares also earned a $3.00 annual cash dividend, representing a 20% increase over the presplit rate. In 1925, with revenues now at $27.4 million, the stock was split once again and the dividend was increased to $4.00 per new share.\n\n\n\n### Major acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Commemorative placque at the Postum Cereal Company Factory, September 2014\nStarting in 1925, under the leadership of financier (and at one point, son in-law to the founder), E. F. Hutton as chairman and Colby M. Chester as president, Postum Cereal made the first of a series of corporate acquisitions which would within a few years transform it into the dominant U.S. packaged grocery products manufacturer.\n\n\nIt began late that year with the purchase of the Jell-O Company. Jell-O had been first produced in 1897 by Pearle Bixby Wait, a carpenter from the town of LeRoy in northern New York state. Mr. Wait's product was based upon a patent that had been issued to inventor and industrialist Peter Cooper in 1845, but which Cooper had never developed commercially. However, Wait was unsuccessful in marketing Jell-O, and in 1899, he sold the rights to it for $450 to a neighbor, Orator Francis Woodward, who had founded the Genesee Pure Food Company in 1897. Genesee became the Jell-O Company in 1923, the same year it began marketing D-Zerta, a sugar-free gelatin, and a powdered mixture for making ice cream in the kitchen.\n\n\nIn 1926, Postum Cereal acquired Igleheart Brothers, Inc (established in 1856), the makers of Swans Down cake flour, and followed this with the purchase of the Minute Tapioca Company. \"Tapioca Superlative\" had been invented in 1894 by a Boston woman, Susan Stavers, who made it from tapioca flakes that she ran through her coffee grinder. Later that year, she sold the rights to John Whitman, of Orange, Massachusetts, who changed its name to \"Minute Tapioca\". In 1908, he changed the name of his company to that of his product. The \"Minute\" brand would later become better known for a General Foods innovation introduced in 1949 known as Minute Rice, a brand of parboiled rice.\n\n\nAs a consequence of the Jell-O and Minute Tapioca acquisitions, Postum Cereal's revenues in 1926 jumped to $46.9 million. The number of shares stood at 1.375 million, including shares issued to acquire Jell-O and Minute Tapioca. The dividend was increased to $4.70 a year.\n\n\nThe acquisition spree continued in 1927 with the purchase of two similarly named confectionery companies, chocolate-maker Walter Baker (founded in 1765, making it the oldest component of the Postum constituent companies), and coconut-processor Franklin Baker, which had begun early in the 19th century as a flour broker, but whose confectionery products dated from 1895. This was followed by the purchase of Log Cabin Products, the maker of Log Cabin Syrup (first produced in 1887), and of Richard Hellmann, Inc (established in 1913), the producer of Blue Ribbon mayonnaise. And late in the year, Postum Cereal began selling its first coffee product, \"Sanka\", by obtaining US marketing rights from Dr Ludwig Roselius of Bremen, Germany. Roselius had developed the decaffeinated coffee in 1906 and began selling it in the US in 1923.[8]\n\n\nThree more acquisitions followed in 1928. The most important was that of the Cheek-Neel Coffee Company. Its product, Maxwell House, dating from 1892, was a well-known brand in what was still a fragmented US coffee market. Within a few years, however, it was to become the number one brand in America and would retain that position well into the 1980s. Also acquired during 1928 was the La France Manufacturing Company, a maker of starch and other laundry products (this being Postum's first venture into nonedibles), and the Calumet Baking Powder Company, the leading maker of this kitchen essential.\n\n\nFinancially, the year culminated on October 1 with the inclusion of Postum, Inc in the newly reformulated Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 common stocks.[9] By year-end, revenues stood at $101 million and the dividend on the five million authorized shares was $5.00 per year, a 25-fold increase since 1922.\n\n\n\n### Purchase of General Foods and renaming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Foods 1937 Specimen Stock Certificate\nBy far the most important acquisition of 1929 was of the frozen-food company owned by Clarence Birdseye,[10] called \"General Foods Company\". Birdseye (December 9, 1886 - October 7, 1956) was one of the most important entrepreneurs in the history of the food industry. Born in New York City, he became interested in the frozen preservation of food during the course of working as a fur trader in Labrador between 1912 and 1916. By 1923, he had developed a commercially viable process for quick-freezing foods using a belt mechanism, which he patented. In 1924, with backing from three investors, he formed the General Seafoods Company, in Gloucester, Massachusetts, to produce frozen haddock fillets packed in plain cardboard boxes.\n\n\nThe founder's daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, was first to become excited about the prospects for the frozen foods business. In 1926, she had put into port at Gloucester on her yacht, *Hussar (IV)*, and was served a luncheon meal which, she learned to her amazement, had been frozen six months before. Despite her enthusiasm, it took Post three years to convince Postum's management to acquire the company. Postum paid $10.75 million for a 51% interest and its partner, Goldman Sachs, paid $12.5 million for the other 49%.[11] Following this acquisition, Postum, Inc changed its name to General Foods Corporation. Goldman sold its share back to General Foods in 1932, apparently at a slight loss.\n\n\nShortly after the acquisition, General Foods began test-marketing an expanded line of frozen foods, but the company quickly realized that a packaging process alone would not be sufficient to market frozen products in stores. To be sold, the packages had to be kept frozen while on display, so Birdseye engineers began development of a freezer cabinet designed specifically to hold frozen foods. The cabinet, which first appeared in 1934, required a great deal of space and electricity, which were not readily available in most grocery stores of the period. For those stores which could accommodate them, the payback was immediate. Housewives quickly realized that keeping packages of frozen food in the icebox could mean fresher meals and fewer trips to the market.[12]\n\n\nThe company published a cook book in 1932, the *General Foods Cook Book*, dedicated \"To the American homemaker\". Five editions were published between 1932 and 1937. The book includes photographs (among which is \"General Foods offers over twenty famous products for your well-stocked pantry shelf\") and a subject index.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## After General Foods[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Ralcorp announced plans to spin off Post Foods into a separate company. About a quarter of Ralcorp's sales in 2010 were generated by its Post Foods unit.[14] The spinoff was completed with an IPO for Post Holdings, Inc. on February 7, 2012.[15]\n\n\nIn 2014, the company acquired Michael Foods.[16] The following year, Post Foods purchased MOM Brands (formerly Malt-O-Meal Co.) creating the third largest breakfast cereal company in the US. At this point, Post Foods rebranded as Post Consumer Brands, and is headquartered in Lakeville, Minnesota.\n\n\nIn July 2017, Post Holdings bought Weetabix Limited for £1.4 billion.[17] In 2019, the company began combining some of its MOM Brands and Weetabix cereal brands under the Three Sisters Cereal name.\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, Post Holdings announced that it was acquiring the Peter Pan peanut butter brand from Conagra Brands.[18] The transaction was completed on January 25, 2021.[19] With the acquisition of Peter Pan peanut butter on January 25, 2021, Post created a new group called Animated Brands,[20] with the Peter Pan brand being the founding member. Animated Brands is managed under Post Consumer Brands.\n\n\nOn June 1, 2021, Post announced it acquired the ready-to-eat (\"RTE\") cereal business of TreeHouse Foods.[21] The TreeHouse Foods RTE cereal business was added to Post Consumer Brands' broad portfolio of private label cereal products.\n\n\nIn February 2023, Post Holdings announced its acquisition of pet food brands like 9Lives, Kibbles ‘n Bits and Gravy Train. Such acquisition would enable Post's entry to the 'pet food category'. After the completion of this acquisition, Post intends to develop a new pet food category within Post Consumer Brands. [22][23][24]\n\n\n\n### Postum advertisements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Postum\n\nPostum, a coffee substitute made out of roasted grain, was created in 1895. It was popular through the early 20th century, particularly during World War II when coffee was rationed.\n\n\n\nDue to its decline in popularity, Post announced its discontinuation in 2007.[25][26][27] It was later revived by Eliza's Quest Food in 2013.[28]\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## Post Consumer Brands brands – present cereals and products[edit]\n\n\n* 100% Bran – currently only available in Canada\n* Airly Foods - Butter\n* Airly Foods - Cheddar\n* Airly Foods - Chocolate\n* Airly Foods - Cinnamon\n* Airly Foods - Salted Caramel\n* Airly Foods - Sea Salt\n* Bran Flakes\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Maple & Brown Sugar[29]\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Apples & Cinnamon\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Cinnamon Roll\n* Better Oats - Classic Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Classic Strawberries & Cream\n* Better Oats - Organic Maple and Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Organic Bare\n* Better Oats - Organic Old Fashioned Oats\n* Better Oats - Organic Steel Cut Oats\n* Better Oats - Organic Quick Oats\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Maple & Brown Sugar with Protein\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Original\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Apples & Cinnamon\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Blueberry Muffin\n* Chips Ahoy!\n* CoCo Wheats\n* Farina (food) Mills hot wheat cereal\n* Cocoa Pebbles\n* Fruity Pebbles\n* Marshmallow Fruity Pebbles\n* Fruity Pebbles Treats\n* Fruity Pebbles Crisps[30]\n* Cocoa Pebbles Crisps\n* Golden Crisp\n* Grape-Nuts\n* Grape-Nuts Flakes\n* Great Grains Banana Nut Crunch\n* Great Grains Blueberry Morning\n* Great Grains Cranberry Almond Crunch\n* Great Grains Crunchy Pecans\n* Great Grains Raisins, Dates & Pecans\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Honey Roasted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – with Almonds\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – with Real Strawberries\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Vanilla\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Pecan & Maple Brown Sugar\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Frosted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Whole Grain Honey Crunch\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Granola – Honey Roasted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Granola – French Vanilla\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Granola – Maple Pecan\n* Honey Maid S'mores\n* Honeycomb\n* Honeycomb Big Bites Original[31]\n* Honeycomb Big Bites Chocolate\n* Oh's\n* Oreo O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Maple & Brown Sugar Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolate Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Original Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Apple Zings\n* Malt-O-Meal - Berry Colossal Crunch\n* Malt-O-Meal - Berry Colossal Crunch with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolate Marshmallow Mateys\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolately Chip Cookie Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Churr-O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cinnamon Toasters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Coco Roos\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cocoa Dyno-Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cocoa Dyno-Bites with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cookies & Cream\n* Malt-O-Meal - Crispy Rice\n* Malt-O-Meal - Frosted Flakes\n* Malt-O-Meal - Frosted Mini Spooners\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Blasts\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Dyno-Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Dyno-Bites with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Golden Honey O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Golden Puffs\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Buzzers\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Graham Toasters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Nut Scooters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Marshmallow Mateys\n* Malt-O-Meal - Oat Blenders with Almonds\n* Malt-O-Meal - Oat Blenders with Honey\n* Malt-O-Meal - Peanut Butter Cups\n* Malt-O-Meal - Raisin Bran\n* Malt-O-Meal - S'mores\n* Malt-O-Meal - Strawberry Cream Mini Spooners\n* Malt-O-Meal - Tootie Fruities\n* Malt-O-Meal - Tootie Fruities with Marshmallows\n* Post Dunkin' cereal - Caramel Macchiato\n* Post Premier Protein cereal - Chocolate Almond\n* Post Premier Protein cereal - Mixed Berry Almond\n* Raisin Bran\n* Shredded Wheat (made by Nestlé and General Mills in the United Kingdom and Ireland)\n* Shredded Wheat – Original Spoon Size\n* Shredded Wheat – Original Big Biscuit\n* Shredded Wheat – Wheat'N Bran Spoon Size\n* Shreddies – currently only available in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany (made by Nestlé and General Mills in the United Kingdom and Ireland)\n* Waffle Crisp\n\n## Post Consumer Brands discontinued cereals[edit]\n\n\n* 40% Bran Flakes\n* Alpha-Bits\n* Beep Beep (with the Wile E.

Kellogg's Corn Flakes eventually overtook Post Toasties in popularity and the latter brand is today only a minor player in the dry-cereal market.\n5. **^** See *International Directory of Company Histories*, Volume 2, pp 530-32, published by St. James Press, 1990, for details relating to the company during this period.\n6. **^** Biographical details of Post's life may be found in *American National Biography*, Volume 7, p. 732.\n7. **^** Financial details for the company during this period may be found in the annual issues of ’’Moody’s Manual of Investments American and Foreign Industrial Securities’’, published by Moody’s Investor Services.\n8. **^** \"Sanka\" is a contraction of the French words, *sans caféine*.

General Foods purchased Roselius's American company outright in 1932 and the original German company, Sanka HAG, AG, in 1979.\n9. **^** \"djindexes.com\" (PDF).

W. Post, owns a large portfolio of cereal brands that include Bran Flakes, Honey Bunches of Oats, Golden Crisp, Grape-Nuts, Honeycomb, Oreo O's, Pebbles, and Waffle Crisp, among others. The company also produces several pet food brands, including Rachael Ray Nutrish, Kibbles 'n Bits, and 9Lives, and markets Peter Pan Peanut Butter.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)C.W. Post, founder\nC. W. Post established his company in Battle Creek, Michigan, having lived there since 1891, when he was a patient at a holistic sanitarium operated by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg.[1][2] Dr. Kellogg, with his brother W. K. Kellogg, had developed a dry corn flake cereal that was part of their patients’ diet. Post's first product, introduced in 1895, was not a cereal, however, but a roasted, cereal-based beverage, Postum. Having developed an aversion to coffee during his time in the sanitarium, Post positioned Postum as a healthy alternative. Its advertising slogan, which he coined himself, was, \"There's a Reason.\" Postum's main ingredients were naturally caffeine-free wheat grain, bran, and molasses. Initially, Postum had to be brewed like coffee, but in 1911, Post introduced a powdered, instant formulation. This version of the product was manufactured in Battle Creek until it was discontinued in 2007. As of January 2013, Eliza's Quest Food had succeeded in returning Postum to many grocery stores across the United States and Canada.\n\n\nIn 1897, Post introduced his first dry cereal, a crunchy blend of wheat and barley, which he called Grape Nuts. His first corn-flake product was introduced as \"Elijah's Manna\" in 1904. Owing to consumer resistance to the (inaccurate) biblical reference[3] that was so great that even Great Britain flatly refused to register the name as a trademark, it was renamed Post Toasties in 1907.[4]\n\n\nC. W. Post was an astute businessman who believed that advertising and aggressive marketing were the keys to a successful enterprise. Within 10 years of its incorporation, his Postum Cereal Company had more than $10 million in capital and was spending $400,000 a year on advertising, sums which were remarkable for the period.[5] Although he vigorously opposed labor unions, his employees were the highest-paid in his industry and working conditions at the Post factory were exemplary. He even developed a factory town in which he sold homes to his workers at favorable rates.\n\n\nPostum Cereal Company lost its founder in 1914. C.W. Post underwent an apparently successful appendectomy at the Mayo Clinic, but shortly after returning home to recuperate, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Post had for years suffered from bouts of illness and depression. While his death was without warning, his company was not left rudderless. His daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, had been raised in the business and was familiar with virtually every aspect of its operations.[6] She assumed control of the now $20-million Postum Company and managed its affairs for the next eight years. While she did not oversee major product innovations, she did have a good feel for business and for promoting talented managers. In addition, her second marriage, in 1920, was to Edward F. Hutton, the founder of a brokerage firm on Wall Street.\n\n\nGross revenues in 1921 were $17.75 million.[7] In 1922, Hutton took the newly incorporated Postum Cereal Company public by issuing 200,000 common shares. The 1920s was a period in which common stock was still considered highly speculative, and consequently the newly issued shares carried a dividend at the rate of $5.00 per year.\n\n\nRevenues in 1922 were essentially the same as in 1921, but in 1923, they were $22.25 million and a stock split, in the form of a 100% stock dividend, increased the authorized shares to 400,000. These shares also earned a $3.00 annual cash dividend, representing a 20% increase over the presplit rate. In 1925, with revenues now at $27.4 million, the stock was split once again and the dividend was increased to $4.00 per new share.\n\n\n\n### Major acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Commemorative placque at the Postum Cereal Company Factory, September 2014\nStarting in 1925, under the leadership of financier (and at one point, son in-law to the founder), E. F. Hutton as chairman and Colby M. Chester as president, Postum Cereal made the first of a series of corporate acquisitions which would within a few years transform it into the dominant U.S. packaged grocery products manufacturer.\n\n\nIt began late that year with the purchase of the Jell-O Company. Jell-O had been first produced in 1897 by Pearle Bixby Wait, a carpenter from the town of LeRoy in northern New York state. Mr. Wait's product was based upon a patent that had been issued to inventor and industrialist Peter Cooper in 1845, but which Cooper had never developed commercially. However, Wait was unsuccessful in marketing Jell-O, and in 1899, he sold the rights to it for $450 to a neighbor, Orator Francis Woodward, who had founded the Genesee Pure Food Company in 1897. Genesee became the Jell-O Company in 1923, the same year it began marketing D-Zerta, a sugar-free gelatin, and a powdered mixture for making ice cream in the kitchen.\n\n\nIn 1926, Postum Cereal acquired Igleheart Brothers, Inc (established in 1856), the makers of Swans Down cake flour, and followed this with the purchase of the Minute Tapioca Company. \"Tapioca Superlative\" had been invented in 1894 by a Boston woman, Susan Stavers, who made it from tapioca flakes that she ran through her coffee grinder. Later that year, she sold the rights to John Whitman, of Orange, Massachusetts, who changed its name to \"Minute Tapioca\". In 1908, he changed the name of his company to that of his product. The \"Minute\" brand would later become better known for a General Foods innovation introduced in 1949 known as Minute Rice, a brand of parboiled rice.\n\n\nAs a consequence of the Jell-O and Minute Tapioca acquisitions, Postum Cereal's revenues in 1926 jumped to $46.9 million. The number of shares stood at 1.375 million, including shares issued to acquire Jell-O and Minute Tapioca. The dividend was increased to $4.70 a year.\n\n\nThe acquisition spree continued in 1927 with the purchase of two similarly named confectionery companies, chocolate-maker Walter Baker (founded in 1765, making it the oldest component of the Postum constituent companies), and coconut-processor Franklin Baker, which had begun early in the 19th century as a flour broker, but whose confectionery products dated from 1895. This was followed by the purchase of Log Cabin Products, the maker of Log Cabin Syrup (first produced in 1887), and of Richard Hellmann, Inc (established in 1913), the producer of Blue Ribbon mayonnaise. And late in the year, Postum Cereal began selling its first coffee product, \"Sanka\", by obtaining US marketing rights from Dr Ludwig Roselius of Bremen, Germany. Roselius had developed the decaffeinated coffee in 1906 and began selling it in the US in 1923.[8]\n\n\nThree more acquisitions followed in 1928. The most important was that of the Cheek-Neel Coffee Company. Its product, Maxwell House, dating from 1892, was a well-known brand in what was still a fragmented US coffee market. Within a few years, however, it was to become the number one brand in America and would retain that position well into the 1980s. Also acquired during 1928 was the La France Manufacturing Company, a maker of starch and other laundry products (this being Postum's first venture into nonedibles), and the Calumet Baking Powder Company, the leading maker of this kitchen essential.\n\n\nFinancially, the year culminated on October 1 with the inclusion of Postum, Inc in the newly reformulated Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 common stocks.[9] By year-end, revenues stood at $101 million and the dividend on the five million authorized shares was $5.00 per year, a 25-fold increase since 1922.\n\n\n\n### Purchase of General Foods and renaming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Foods 1937 Specimen Stock Certificate\nBy far the most important acquisition of 1929 was of the frozen-food company owned by Clarence Birdseye,[10] called \"General Foods Company\". Birdseye (December 9, 1886 - October 7, 1956) was one of the most important entrepreneurs in the history of the food industry. Born in New York City, he became interested in the frozen preservation of food during the course of working as a fur trader in Labrador between 1912 and 1916. By 1923, he had developed a commercially viable process for quick-freezing foods using a belt mechanism, which he patented. In 1924, with backing from three investors, he formed the General Seafoods Company, in Gloucester, Massachusetts, to produce frozen haddock fillets packed in plain cardboard boxes.\n\n\nThe founder's daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, was first to become excited about the prospects for the frozen foods business. In 1926, she had put into port at Gloucester on her yacht, *Hussar (IV)*, and was served a luncheon meal which, she learned to her amazement, had been frozen six months before. Despite her enthusiasm, it took Post three years to convince Postum's management to acquire the company. Postum paid $10.75 million for a 51% interest and its partner, Goldman Sachs, paid $12.5 million for the other 49%.[11] Following this acquisition, Postum, Inc changed its name to General Foods Corporation. Goldman sold its share back to General Foods in 1932, apparently at a slight loss.\n\n\nShortly after the acquisition, General Foods began test-marketing an expanded line of frozen foods, but the company quickly realized that a packaging process alone would not be sufficient to market frozen products in stores. To be sold, the packages had to be kept frozen while on display, so Birdseye engineers began development of a freezer cabinet designed specifically to hold frozen foods. The cabinet, which first appeared in 1934, required a great deal of space and electricity, which were not readily available in most grocery stores of the period. For those stores which could accommodate them, the payback was immediate. Housewives quickly realized that keeping packages of frozen food in the icebox could mean fresher meals and fewer trips to the market.[12]\n\n\nThe company published a cook book in 1932, the *General Foods Cook Book*, dedicated \"To the American homemaker\". Five editions were published between 1932 and 1937. The book includes photographs (among which is \"General Foods offers over twenty famous products for your well-stocked pantry shelf\") and a subject index.[13]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## After General Foods[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Ralcorp announced plans to spin off Post Foods into a separate company. About a quarter of Ralcorp's sales in 2010 were generated by its Post Foods unit.[14] The spinoff was completed with an IPO for Post Holdings, Inc. on February 7, 2012.[15]\n\n\nIn 2014, the company acquired Michael Foods.[16] The following year, Post Foods purchased MOM Brands (formerly Malt-O-Meal Co.) creating the third largest breakfast cereal company in the US. At this point, Post Foods rebranded as Post Consumer Brands, and is headquartered in Lakeville, Minnesota.\n\n\nIn July 2017, Post Holdings bought Weetabix Limited for £1.4 billion.[17] In 2019, the company began combining some of its MOM Brands and Weetabix cereal brands under the Three Sisters Cereal name.\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, Post Holdings announced that it was acquiring the Peter Pan peanut butter brand from Conagra Brands.[18] The transaction was completed on January 25, 2021.[19] With the acquisition of Peter Pan peanut butter on January 25, 2021, Post created a new group called Animated Brands,[20] with the Peter Pan brand being the founding member. Animated Brands is managed under Post Consumer Brands.\n\n\nOn June 1, 2021, Post announced it acquired the ready-to-eat (\"RTE\") cereal business of TreeHouse Foods.[21] The TreeHouse Foods RTE cereal business was added to Post Consumer Brands' broad portfolio of private label cereal products.\n\n\nIn February 2023, Post Holdings announced its acquisition of pet food brands like 9Lives, Kibbles ‘n Bits and Gravy Train. Such acquisition would enable Post's entry to the 'pet food category'. After the completion of this acquisition, Post intends to develop a new pet food category within Post Consumer Brands.

It was popular through the early 20th century, particularly during World War II when coffee was rationed.\n\n\n\nDue to its decline in popularity, Post announced its discontinuation in 2007.[25][26][27] It was later revived by Eliza's Quest Food in 2013.[28]\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## Post Consumer Brands brands – present cereals and products[edit]\n\n\n* 100% Bran – currently only available in Canada\n* Airly Foods - Butter\n* Airly Foods - Cheddar\n* Airly Foods - Chocolate\n* Airly Foods - Cinnamon\n* Airly Foods - Salted Caramel\n* Airly Foods - Sea Salt\n* Bran Flakes\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Maple & Brown Sugar[29]\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Apples & Cinnamon\n* Better Oats - 100 Calorie Cinnamon Roll\n* Better Oats - Classic Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Classic Strawberries & Cream\n* Better Oats - Organic Maple and Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Organic Bare\n* Better Oats - Organic Old Fashioned Oats\n* Better Oats - Organic Steel Cut Oats\n* Better Oats - Organic Quick Oats\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Maple & Brown Sugar with Protein\n* Better Oats - Steel Cut Original\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Maple & Brown Sugar\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Apples & Cinnamon\n* Better Oats - Thick & Hearty Blueberry Muffin\n* Chips Ahoy!\n* CoCo Wheats\n* Farina (food) Mills hot wheat cereal\n* Cocoa Pebbles\n* Fruity Pebbles\n* Marshmallow Fruity Pebbles\n* Fruity Pebbles Treats\n* Fruity Pebbles Crisps[30]\n* Cocoa Pebbles Crisps\n* Golden Crisp\n* Grape-Nuts\n* Grape-Nuts Flakes\n* Great Grains Banana Nut Crunch\n* Great Grains Blueberry Morning\n* Great Grains Cranberry Almond Crunch\n* Great Grains Crunchy Pecans\n* Great Grains Raisins, Dates & Pecans\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Honey Roasted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – with Almonds\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – with Real Strawberries\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Vanilla\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Pecan & Maple Brown Sugar\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Frosted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Whole Grain Honey Crunch\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Granola – Honey Roasted\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Granola – French Vanilla\n* Honey Bunches of Oats – Granola – Maple Pecan\n* Honey Maid S'mores\n* Honeycomb\n* Honeycomb Big Bites Original[31]\n* Honeycomb Big Bites Chocolate\n* Oh's\n* Oreo O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Maple & Brown Sugar Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolate Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Original Hot Wheat\n* Malt-O-Meal - Apple Zings\n* Malt-O-Meal - Berry Colossal Crunch\n* Malt-O-Meal - Berry Colossal Crunch with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolate Marshmallow Mateys\n* Malt-O-Meal - Chocolately Chip Cookie Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Churr-O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cinnamon Toasters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Coco Roos\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cocoa Dyno-Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cocoa Dyno-Bites with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Cookies & Cream\n* Malt-O-Meal - Crispy Rice\n* Malt-O-Meal - Frosted Flakes\n* Malt-O-Meal - Frosted Mini Spooners\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Blasts\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Dyno-Bites\n* Malt-O-Meal - Fruity Dyno-Bites with Marshmallows\n* Malt-O-Meal - Golden Honey O's\n* Malt-O-Meal - Golden Puffs\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Buzzers\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Graham Toasters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Honey Nut Scooters\n* Malt-O-Meal - Marshmallow Mateys\n* Malt-O-Meal - Oat Blenders with Almonds\n* Malt-O-Meal - Oat Blenders with Honey\n* Malt-O-Meal - Peanut Butter Cups\n* Malt-O-Meal - Raisin Bran\n* Malt-O-Meal - S'mores\n* Malt-O-Meal - Strawberry Cream Mini Spooners\n* Malt-O-Meal - Tootie Fruities\n* Malt-O-Meal - Tootie Fruities with Marshmallows\n* Post Dunkin' cereal - Caramel Macchiato\n* Post Premier Protein cereal - Chocolate Almond\n* Post Premier Protein cereal - Mixed Berry Almond\n* Raisin Bran\n* Shredded Wheat (made by Nestlé and General Mills in the United Kingdom and Ireland)\n* Shredded Wheat – Original Spoon Size\n* Shredded Wheat – Original Big Biscuit\n* Shredded Wheat – Wheat'N Bran Spoon Size\n* Shreddies – currently only available in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany (made by Nestlé and General Mills in the United Kingdom and Ireland)\n* Waffle Crisp\n\n## Post Consumer Brands discontinued cereals[edit]\n\n\n* 40% Bran Flakes\n* Alpha-Bits\n* Beep Beep (with the Wile E.

W. Post's career may be found in *American National Biography*, Vol. 7, pp. 725-7, published by Oxford University Press.\n3. **^** In I Kings 17:6, Elijah was described as having ravens feed him \"bread and meat,\" rather than manna, when in hiding from King Ahab. Exodus 16:31 describes manna as \"white [and having a similar flavor to] wafers--made with honey,\" but the Israelites found it a poor daily substitute for the diet of meats, fishes, cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic which they had enjoyed in Egypt.\n4. **^** The Kellogg brothers had been selling their corn flakes and other cereal products since 1897, but with only limited success. Post, who took the cereal business seriously, was equipped to market and advertise his products nationwide; so successfully, in fact, that W.K. Kellogg broke away from his brother and in 1907 founded his own company, the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company (renamed the Kellogg Company in 1922). Kellogg's Corn Flakes eventually overtook Post Toasties in popularity and the latter brand is today only a minor player in the dry-cereal market.\n5. **^** See *International Directory of Company Histories*, Volume 2, pp 530-32, published by St. James Press, 1990, for details relating to the company during this period.\n6. **^** Biographical details of Post's life may be found in *American National Biography*, Volume 7, p. 732.\n7. **^** Financial details for the company during this period may be found in the annual issues of ’’Moody’s Manual of Investments American and Foreign Industrial Securities’’, published by Moody’s Investor Services.\n8. **^** \"Sanka\" is a contraction of the French words, *sans caféine*. Roselius for many years had had little success in finding a viable decaffeination process. Legend has it that when a shipment of green coffee sank in Bremen harbor, the beans came out caffeine free. Ultimately, Roselius settled on a washing process under more sanitary conditions. General Foods purchased Roselius's American company outright in 1932 and the original German company, Sanka HAG, AG, in 1979.\n9. **^** \"djindexes.com\" (PDF).

In 1932, he established Birds Eye Frozen Foods, which by later in the decade was selling almost 100 different frozen products. It is not immediately clear how General Foods came to acquire the product name, but Birds Eye frozen vegetables were a major component of its business until the division was sold to Dean Foods in 1993.\n12. **^** The space and power requirements for the burgeoning frozen-food section was one factor which led to the rapid development of larger self-service supermarkets beginning in the late 1930s.\n13. **^** General Foods Consumer Service Department *General Foods Cook Book*.
