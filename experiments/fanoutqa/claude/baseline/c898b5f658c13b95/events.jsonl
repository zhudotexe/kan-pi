A predecessor, called the Lone Star Flag, was used in an 1836 independence movement;[2] the red star element from that flag appears in the Bear Flag of today.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Current flag\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The flag on display at the California State Capitol.\n### Law and protocol\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1911 statute stated:\n\n\n\n\n> The bear flag is hereby selected and adopted as the state flag of California. ... The said bear flag shall consist of a flag of a length equal to one and one-half the width thereof; the upper five-sixths of the width thereof to be a white field, and the lower sixth of the width thereof to be a red stripe; there shall appear in the white field in the upper left-hand corner a single red star, and at the bottom of the white field the words 'California Republic,' and in the center of the white field a California grizzly bear upon a grass plat, in the position of walking toward the left of the said field; said bear shall be dark brown in color and in length, equal to one-third of the length of said flag.\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1953, the design and specifications for the state flag were standardized in a bill signed by Governor Earl Warren and illustrated by Donald Graeme Kelley of Marin County, California.[4] The California state flag is often called the \"Bear Flag\" and in fact, the present statute adopting the flag, California Government Code § 420, states: \"The Bear Flag is the State Flag of California.\"\n\n\nPursuant to Section 439 of the California Government Code, the regulations and protocols for the proper display of the flag of California is controlled by the California Adjutant General:\n\n\n\n\n> The Adjutant General shall, by regulation, prescribe rules regarding the times, places, and the manner in which the State Flag may be displayed. He shall, periodically, compile the laws and regulations regarding the State Flag. Copies of the compilation shall be printed and made available to the public at cost by the Department of General Services.\n> \n> \n\n\nWhen the flag is displayed vertically, it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise such that the bear and star face upward and red stripe is on the left.[5]\n\n\nThe flag is also used as the state ensign.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Design\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![Metrics for the Flag of California](image)\n\nMetrics for the Flag of California\n* ![\"Monarch\" the bear](image)\n\n\"Monarch\" the bear\n* ![Finally accepted official rendering of the bear](image)\n\nFinally accepted official rendering of the bear\n\n\nThe first official version of the Bear Flag was adopted by the California State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Hiram Johnson in 1911 as the official state flag.[8]\n\n\nThe contemporary state flag is white with a wide red strip along the bottom. There is a red star in the upper left corner and a grizzly bear facing left (toward the hoist) in the center, walking on a patch of green grass. The size of the bear is 2/3 the size of the hoist width and has a ratio of 2 by 1. The grass plot has a ratio of 11 to 1.[1] The five-point star is taken from the California Lone Star Flag of 1836.[5] The hoist of the flag is two-thirds the fly.[9]\n\n\nThe bear on one 1911 version of the flag is claimed to have been modeled on the last California grizzly bear in captivity.[10] The bear, named \"Monarch\", was captured in 1889 by newspaper reporter Allan Kelly, at the behest of William Randolph Hearst.[11] The bear was subsequently moved to Woodwards Gardens in San Francisco, and then to the zoo at Golden Gate Park. After the bear's death in 1911, it was mounted and preserved at the Academy of Sciences at Golden Gate Park.[12]\n\n\nWhile the bear flag was adopted in 1911, until 1953 the image of the bear varied depending on the flag manufacturer, and was finally standardized based on an image of Monarch.[13] In 1953 the bear image was standardized based on an 1855 watercolor by Charles Christian Nahl.[14][15] The 1953 law includes an official black and white rendering of the bear as well as the plot of grass and brown tufts. This drawing and other specifications that define the flag's colors and dimensions are identified as \"54-J-03\".[16]\n\n\nThe Californian flag is one of two U.S. state flags to feature a bear, the other being that of Missouri.\n\n\nIn 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the flag of California 13th.[17]\n\n\n\n### Colors\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Vertical display\nThe 1953 legislation defined the exact shades of the California flag with a total of five colors (including the white field) relative to the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card of America (now called the Standard Color Reference of America).[16] It is one of only four US state flags that does not contain the color blue (the other three are Alabama, Maryland, and New Mexico).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Color\n | Cable no.[16] | Pantone[5] | Web color[18] | RGB values\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   White\n | 75001\n | Safe\n | `#FFFFFF` | (255,255,255)\n |\n|   Old Glory Red\n | 70180\n | 200\n | `#B71234` | (183,18,52)\n |\n|   Maple Sugar\n | 70129\n | 729C\n | `#BD8A5E` | (189,138,94)\n |\n|   Seal\n | 70108\n | 462C\n | `#584528` | (88,69,40)\n |\n|   Irish Green\n | 70168\n | 348\n | `#008542` | (0,133,66)\n |\n\n\n* Seal is used for the dark shading of the bear, the 12 darker tufts in the plot of grass, the border of the plot and the lettering \"CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC\".\n* Maple Sugar is the base color for the bear.\n* Old Glory Red is used for the star, the bear's tongue and the red stripe at the bottom of the flag.\n* Irish Green is used for the grass plot.\n* The bear's claws are also accented with white. The left front and rear paws have four white claws while the right rear claw displays three. The front right paw does not contain highlighting.\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### Lone Star of California\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)\nThe lone star of the 1836 California Lone Star Flag inspired the red star in the flag of the Bear Flag Revolt\n![](image)\nLast known California Lone Star flag, now held at the Gene Autry Western Museum in Los Angeles\n\nIn 1836, a coup led by Juan Alvarado declared Alta California's independence from Mexico. Declaring himself governor, Alvarado recruited U.S. frontiersmen, led by Isaac Graham, to support him. The rebels easily captured the capital Monterey, but were unable to convince southern leaders such as Juan Bandini and Carlos Antonio Carrillo to join the rebellion. Faced with a civil war, Alvarado and the other *Californios* negotiated a compromise with the central government wherein California's leaders accepted its status as a \"department\" under the \"Siete Leyes\" Mexican constitution of 1836, in return for more local control. Alvarado was appointed governor the next year.\n\n\nThe Lone Star Flag of California, associated with Alvarado's rebellion, contained a single red star on a white background.[5] One last original flag is archived at the Autry National Center.[19]\n\n\n\n### Original Bear Flag\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)\nThe original 1846 Bear Flag with its designer, Peter Storm, c. 1870\n![](image)\nBear Flag monument on the Sonoma Plaza\n\nThe original grizzly bear flag was created by Peter Storm. A version of this bear flag, designed by William L. Todd, was raised in Sonoma, California, in June 1846 on a date between the 14th and the 17th,[20] by the men who became known as the \"Bear Flaggers\", including William B. Ide.[21] The exact creation date is at least somewhat unclear. However, U.S. Naval Lieutenant John Missroon reported the flag's existence as of June 17, 1846.[22]\n\n\nWilliam L. Todd was a cousin of Mary Todd Lincoln.[23] According to the book *Flags Over California*, published by the California Military Department, the star on the flag recalled the 1836 California Lone Star Flag. Todd, in an 1878 letter to the *Los Angeles Express*, states that the star was drawn using blackberry juice and in recognition of the California Lone Star Flag. The bear was designed to be a symbol of strength and unyielding resistance.[5]\n\n\nAccording to the Sonoma State Historic Park, the construction of the flag was described as such:\n\n\n\n\n> At a company meeting it was determined that we should raise a flag and that it should be a bear en passant [a heraldry term signifying that the bear is walking toward the viewer's left], with one star. One of the ladies at the garrison gave us a piece of brown domestic, and Mrs. Captain John Sears gave us some strips of red flannel about 4 inches wide. The domestic was new, but the flannel was said to have been part of a petticoat worn by Mrs. Sears across the mountains...I took a pen, and with ink drew the outline of the bear and star upon the white cloth. Linseed oil and Venetian red were found in the garrison, and I painted the bear and star...Underneath the bear and star were printed with a pen the words 'California Republic' in Roman letters. In painting the words I first lined out the letters with a pen, leaving out the letter 'i' and putting 'c' where 'i' should have been, and afterwards the 'i' over the 'c'. It was made with ink, and we had nothing to remove the marks.[24]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe original Bear Flag and the republic it symbolized had a brief career, from about June 14 until July 9.[25] On July 7, 1846, Commodore John Drake Sloat of the United States Navy's Pacific Squadron first raised the 28-star American flag at Monterey, the capital of Alta California, and claimed the territory for the United States.[25]\n\n\nTwo days later, on July 9, 1846, Navy Lieutenant Joseph Warren Revere arrived in Sonoma and hauled down the Bear Flag, running up in its place the Stars and Stripes. The Bear Flag was given to young John E. Montgomery (son of Commander John B. Montgomery of USS *Portsmouth*), who would later write in a letter to his mother \"Cuffy came down growling\"—\"Cuffy\" being his nickname for the bear on the flag.\n\n\nThe Bear Flag given to young Montgomery returned with USS *Portsmouth* to the east coast of the U.S. in 1848, but in 1855 was returned to California.[26] The flag was given to California's two senators, John B. Weller and William M. Gwin. This flag was donated to the Society of California Pioneers on September 8, 1855, and was preserved at the Society's Pioneer Halls in San Francisco until it was destroyed on April 18, 1906, in the fires that followed the great San Francisco earthquake.[26] Today, a replica hangs on display in the *Sonoma Barracks*, or El Presidio de Sonoma. There is also a statue in the plaza at Sonoma, California, commemorating the raising of the flag, the Bear Flag Monument.\n\n\n\n### The Civil War period\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the secession crisis and the early part of the American Civil War in 1861, California was divided between supporters of the union and supporters of southern secession. In the months leading up to the war some opposed to the government in Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County showed support for secession by flying variants of the Bear Flag instead of the Stars and Stripes.[27]: 194–195\n\n\nDuring the war, Union soldiers protected the West against secessionists who ran up Confederate flags in many places, including above the California statehouse in Sacramento, then disappearing before they could be caught.[27] On July 4, 1861, during U.S. Independence Day celebrations in Sacramento, Democrat and veteran Maj. J. P. Gillis celebrated the independence of the United States from Great Britain and the secession of the Confederacy by unfurling a flag based on the first Confederate flag, the Stars and Bars, but containing seventeen stars rather than the Confederate banner's seven, and marching down the street to the cheers of pro-slavery individuals.[28] This was the only known Confederate flag captured in California during the Civil War. Unionist Jack Biderman denounced Gillis, tore the flag from his hands, and taunted secessionists to try to take the flag back. No one tried. Because Gillis' flag was seized by Jack Biderman, it is referred to either as the \"Biderman Flag\" or the \"Gillis Flag.\"[29]\n\n\n\n## Flag of the governor\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The flag of the governor of California\nSee also: Flags of governors of the U.S. states\n\nThe flag of the governor of California consists of the seal of California centered on a field of azure.

A predecessor, called the Lone Star Flag, was used in an 1836 independence movement;[2] the red star element from that flag appears in the Bear Flag of today.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Current flag\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The flag on display at the California State Capitol.\n### Law and protocol\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1911 statute stated:\n\n\n\n\n> The bear flag is hereby selected and adopted as the state flag of California. ... The said bear flag shall consist of a flag of a length equal to one and one-half the width thereof; the upper five-sixths of the width thereof to be a white field, and the lower sixth of the width thereof to be a red stripe; there shall appear in the white field in the upper left-hand corner a single red star, and at the bottom of the white field the words 'California Republic,' and in the center of the white field a California grizzly bear upon a grass plat, in the position of walking toward the left of the said field; said bear shall be dark brown in color and in length, equal to one-third of the length of said flag.\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1953, the design and specifications for the state flag were standardized in a bill signed by Governor Earl Warren and illustrated by Donald Graeme Kelley of Marin County, California.[4] The California state flag is often called the \"Bear Flag\" and in fact, the present statute adopting the flag, California Government Code § 420, states: \"The Bear Flag is the State Flag of California.\"\n\n\nPursuant to Section 439 of the California Government Code, the regulations and protocols for the proper display of the flag of California is controlled by the California Adjutant General:\n\n\n\n\n> The Adjutant General shall, by regulation, prescribe rules regarding the times, places, and the manner in which the State Flag may be displayed. He shall, periodically, compile the laws and regulations regarding the State Flag. Copies of the compilation shall be printed and made available to the public at cost by the Department of General Services.\n> \n> \n\n\nWhen the flag is displayed vertically, it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise such that the bear and star face upward and red stripe is on the left.[5]\n\n\nThe flag is also used as the state ensign.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Design\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![Metrics for the Flag of California](image)\n\nMetrics for the Flag of California\n* ![\"Monarch\" the bear](image)\n\n\"Monarch\" the bear\n* ![Finally accepted official rendering of the bear](image)\n\nFinally accepted official rendering of the bear\n\n\nThe first official version of the Bear Flag was adopted by the California State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Hiram Johnson in 1911 as the official state flag.[8]\n\n\nThe contemporary state flag is white with a wide red strip along the bottom. There is a red star in the upper left corner and a grizzly bear facing left (toward the hoist) in the center, walking on a patch of green grass. The size of the bear is 2/3 the size of the hoist width and has a ratio of 2 by 1. The grass plot has a ratio of 11 to 1.[1] The five-point star is taken from the California Lone Star Flag of 1836.[5] The hoist of the flag is two-thirds the fly.[9]\n\n\nThe bear on one 1911 version of the flag is claimed to have been modeled on the last California grizzly bear in captivity.[10] The bear, named \"Monarch\", was captured in 1889 by newspaper reporter Allan Kelly, at the behest of William Randolph Hearst.[11] The bear was subsequently moved to Woodwards Gardens in San Francisco, and then to the zoo at Golden Gate Park. After the bear's death in 1911, it was mounted and preserved at the Academy of Sciences at Golden Gate Park.[12]\n\n\nWhile the bear flag was adopted in 1911, until 1953 the image of the bear varied depending on the flag manufacturer, and was finally standardized based on an image of Monarch.[13] In 1953 the bear image was standardized based on an 1855 watercolor by Charles Christian Nahl.[14][15] The 1953 law includes an official black and white rendering of the bear as well as the plot of grass and brown tufts. This drawing and other specifications that define the flag's colors and dimensions are identified as \"54-J-03\".[16]\n\n\nThe Californian flag is one of two U.S. state flags to feature a bear, the other being that of Missouri.\n\n\nIn 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags and ranked the flag of California 13th.[17]\n\n\n\n### Colors\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Vertical display\nThe 1953 legislation defined the exact shades of the California flag with a total of five colors (including the white field) relative to the 9th edition of the Standard Color Card of America (now called the Standard Color Reference of America).[16] It is one of only four US state flags that does not contain the color blue (the other three are Alabama, Maryland, and New Mexico).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Color\n | Cable no.[16] | Pantone[5] | Web color[18] | RGB values\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|   White\n | 75001\n | Safe\n | `#FFFFFF` | (255,255,255)\n |\n|   Old Glory Red\n | 70180\n | 200\n | `#B71234` | (183,18,52)\n |\n|   Maple Sugar\n | 70129\n | 729C\n | `#BD8A5E` | (189,138,94)\n |\n|   Seal\n | 70108\n | 462C\n | `#584528` | (88,69,40)\n |\n|   Irish Green\n | 70168\n | 348\n | `#008542` | (0,133,66)\n |\n\n\n* Seal is used for the dark shading of the bear, the 12 darker tufts in the plot of grass, the border of the plot and the lettering \"CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC\".\n* Maple Sugar is the base color for the bear.\n* Old Glory Red is used for the star, the bear's tongue and the red stripe at the bottom of the flag.\n* Irish Green is used for the grass plot.\n* The bear's claws are also accented with white. The left front and rear paws have four white claws while the right rear claw displays three. The front right paw does not contain highlighting.\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### Lone Star of California\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)\nThe lone star of the 1836 California Lone Star Flag inspired the red star in the flag of the Bear Flag Revolt\n![](image)\nLast known California Lone Star flag, now held at the Gene Autry Western Museum in Los Angeles\n\nIn 1836, a coup led by Juan Alvarado declared Alta California's independence from Mexico. Declaring himself governor, Alvarado recruited U.S. frontiersmen, led by Isaac Graham, to support him. The rebels easily captured the capital Monterey, but were unable to convince southern leaders such as Juan Bandini and Carlos Antonio Carrillo to join the rebellion. Faced with a civil war, Alvarado and the other *Californios* negotiated a compromise with the central government wherein California's leaders accepted its status as a \"department\" under the \"Siete Leyes\" Mexican constitution of 1836, in return for more local control. Alvarado was appointed governor the next year.\n\n\nThe Lone Star Flag of California, associated with Alvarado's rebellion, contained a single red star on a white background.[5] One last original flag is archived at the Autry National Center.[19]\n\n\n\n### Original Bear Flag\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)\nThe original 1846 Bear Flag with its designer, Peter Storm, c. 1870\n![](image)\nBear Flag monument on the Sonoma Plaza\n\nThe original grizzly bear flag was created by Peter Storm. A version of this bear flag, designed by William L. Todd, was raised in Sonoma, California, in June 1846 on a date between the 14th and the 17th,[20] by the men who became known as the \"Bear Flaggers\", including William B. Ide.[21] The exact creation date is at least somewhat unclear. However, U.S. Naval Lieutenant John Missroon reported the flag's existence as of June 17, 1846.[22]\n\n\nWilliam L. Todd was a cousin of Mary Todd Lincoln.[23] According to the book *Flags Over California*, published by the California Military Department, the star on the flag recalled the 1836 California Lone Star Flag. Todd, in an 1878 letter to the *Los Angeles Express*, states that the star was drawn using blackberry juice and in recognition of the California Lone Star Flag. The bear was designed to be a symbol of strength and unyielding resistance.[5]\n\n\nAccording to the Sonoma State Historic Park, the construction of the flag was described as such:\n\n\n\n\n> At a company meeting it was determined that we should raise a flag and that it should be a bear en passant [a heraldry term signifying that the bear is walking toward the viewer's left], with one star. One of the ladies at the garrison gave us a piece of brown domestic, and Mrs. Captain John Sears gave us some strips of red flannel about 4 inches wide. The domestic was new, but the flannel was said to have been part of a petticoat worn by Mrs. Sears across the mountains...I took a pen, and with ink drew the outline of the bear and star upon the white cloth. Linseed oil and Venetian red were found in the garrison, and I painted the bear and star...Underneath the bear and star were printed with a pen the words 'California Republic' in Roman letters. In painting the words I first lined out the letters with a pen, leaving out the letter 'i' and putting 'c' where 'i' should have been, and afterwards the 'i' over the 'c'. It was made with ink, and we had nothing to remove the marks.[24]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe original Bear Flag and the republic it symbolized had a brief career, from about June 14 until July 9.[25] On July 7, 1846, Commodore John Drake Sloat of the United States Navy's Pacific Squadron first raised the 28-star American flag at Monterey, the capital of Alta California, and claimed the territory for the United States.[25]\n\n\nTwo days later, on July 9, 1846, Navy Lieutenant Joseph Warren Revere arrived in Sonoma and hauled down the Bear Flag, running up in its place the Stars and Stripes. The Bear Flag was given to young John E. Montgomery (son of Commander John B. Montgomery of USS *Portsmouth*), who would later write in a letter to his mother \"Cuffy came down growling\"—\"Cuffy\" being his nickname for the bear on the flag.\n\n\nThe Bear Flag given to young Montgomery returned with USS *Portsmouth* to the east coast of the U.S. in 1848, but in 1855 was returned to California.[26] The flag was given to California's two senators, John B. Weller and William M. Gwin. This flag was donated to the Society of California Pioneers on September 8, 1855, and was preserved at the Society's Pioneer Halls in San Francisco until it was destroyed on April 18, 1906, in the fires that followed the great San Francisco earthquake.[26] Today, a replica hangs on display in the *Sonoma Barracks*, or El Presidio de Sonoma. There is also a statue in the plaza at Sonoma, California, commemorating the raising of the flag, the Bear Flag Monument.\n\n\n\n### The Civil War period\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the secession crisis and the early part of the American Civil War in 1861, California was divided between supporters of the union and supporters of southern secession. In the months leading up to the war some opposed to the government in Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County showed support for secession by flying variants of the Bear Flag instead of the Stars and Stripes.[27]: 194–195\n\n\nDuring the war, Union soldiers protected the West against secessionists who ran up Confederate flags in many places, including above the California statehouse in Sacramento, then disappearing before they could be caught.[27] On July 4, 1861, during U.S. Independence Day celebrations in Sacramento, Democrat and veteran Maj. J. P. Gillis celebrated the independence of the United States from Great Britain and the secession of the Confederacy by unfurling a flag based on the first Confederate flag, the Stars and Bars, but containing seventeen stars rather than the Confederate banner's seven, and marching down the street to the cheers of pro-slavery individuals.[28] This was the only known Confederate flag captured in California during the Civil War. Unionist Jack Biderman denounced Gillis, tore the flag from his hands, and taunted secessionists to try to take the flag back. No one tried. Because Gillis' flag was seized by Jack Biderman, it is referred to either as the \"Biderman Flag\" or the \"Gillis Flag.\"[29]\n\n\n\n## Flag of the governor\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The flag of the governor of California\nSee also: Flags of governors of the U.S. states\n\nThe flag of the governor of California consists of the seal of California centered on a field of azure.

B. Oliver. She began her flag project in 1908 as part of her volunteer activities with the Daughters of the American Revolution when she was appointed chairperson of the Daughters of the American Revolution committee to research and design Missouri's flag. Oliver researched state flags extensively. She wrote each state's secretary of state for information about how their state's flags had been designed and officially adopted. Her original design incorporated Missouri's coat of arms and was rendered as a painted paper flag by her friend Mary Kochitzky.[4]\n\n\nThe flag was brought to the Missouri State Capitol in 1908 and bills to adopt the flag as the official flag of Missouri were introduced by Senator Arthur L. Oliver, her nephew, in 1909 and 1911. Both bills failed to pass in the House. A competing flag design, by G. H. Holcomb and referred to as the \"Holcomb flag\", was opposed due to its resemblance to the flag of the United States and its lack of Missouri symbolism.[1] Oliver's original paper flag was destroyed when the Missouri State Capitol burned in 1911. With Mrs. S. D. MacFarland, Oliver sewed a second flag out of silk. Her design was adopted on March 22, 1913, when governor Elliot Woolfolk Major signed the Oliver Flag Bill.[5] The flag design remains unchanged to this day. The silk flag was kept by Marie Oliver until 1961 when her son Allen gave it to the state of Missouri. The flag was displayed until it began to deteriorate and was put into storage. In 1988, Secretary of State Roy D. Blunt issued a challenge to elementary students to raise money to restore the flag. The campaign was successful and the restored flag has been displayed in the James C. Kirkpatrick State Information Center in Jefferson City ever since.[4]\n\n\nThe Oliver-Leming House, also known as the Home of the Missouri State Flag, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Holcomb flag proposal ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image)\n\n## Design\n\n[edit]\n\nThe flag is a tricolor consisting of three horizontal stripes of red, white and blue which resembles the flag of the Netherlands. These represent valor, purity, vigilance, and justice. The colors also reflect the state's historic status as part of French Louisiana. In the center white stripe is the seal of Missouri, circled by a blue band containing 24 stars, symbolizing Missouri's admission as the 24th U.S. state.[1] The seal itself also contains 24 stars, and incorporates the Great Seal of the United States, which contains a further 13 stars, bringing the flag's grand total to 61 stars. The seal further includes the state motto, *Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto*, which translates from Latin as \"The health (welfare, good, salvation, felicity) of the people should be the supreme law.\" The flag is described in Section 010.020 of Missouri's Revised Statutes. There are no known examples of mass-produced Missouri state flags in compliance with the RSMo due to the 7:12 proportions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIt is one of two U.S. state flags to feature a bear, the other being that of California. It is also one of ten U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wyoming.\n\n\nIn 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial and Canadian provincial flags. The Missouri flag ranked in the bottom 25, 48th out of the 72.[7]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![](image)Heraldry portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of flags by design\n* List of Missouri state symbols\n* List of U.S. state, district, and territorial insignia\n* Flag of Kansas City\n* Flag of St. Louis\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** There are a total of 61 stars on the flag, including the 37 on the state seal: 24 stars in the cloud above the helmet, and 13 stars in the included Great Seal of the United States.\n2. **^** On this date, Missouri Brig.

The Missouri flag ranked in the bottom 25, 48th out of the 72.[7]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![](image)Heraldry portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of flags by design\n* List of Missouri state symbols\n* List of U.S. state, district, and territorial insignia\n* Flag of Kansas City\n* Flag of St. Louis\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** There are a total of 61 stars on the flag, including the 37 on the state seal: 24 stars in the cloud above the helmet, and 13 stars in the included Great Seal of the United States.\n2. **^** On this date, Missouri Brig.

The winning design was created by Randall Gray, a map maker for Clackamas County. In his design, Gray emphasized the beaver found on the current flag's reverse. The star represents Oregon's place in the Union while the green represents the natural wilderness and forests of Oregon.[4] After the contest had started with votes being cast, there were requests for the *Oregonian* to add an 11th option, \"NONE OF THE ABOVE\", meaning, keep the current state flag as it is. In the final tally of votes, \"NONE\" received the most votes.\n\n\n\n#### Finalists\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![Flag A (designed by Gerald H. Black)](image)\n\nFlag A (designed by Gerald H.

In the canton the flag shall bear a representation of the beaver, in gold, facing the hoist. On the fly the flag shall bear a vertical stripe in navy blue, and a white star shall be centered at the vertical halfway point of the stripe. The obverse and reverse of the flag shall be mirror images of each other.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Description\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The flags of the United States and Oregon in Portland, Oregon\nThe flag field is navy blue with all lettering and symbols in gold, representing the state colors of Oregon.[7][8] On the obverse, the legend *STATE OF OREGON* is written above an escutcheon, which also appears in the Oregon state seal. The shield is surrounded by 33 stars, representing Oregon's admission to the Union as the 33rd state. Below the shield is written *1859*, the year in which Oregon became a state.[7]\n\n\nOregon's flag is the last remaining state flag in the U.S. in which the obverse and reverse sides have different designs.[2] Paraguay[9] is the only country that still has a two-sided flag. Two-sided flags were previously more common, but have been reduced due to increased costs of manufacturing a flag with two different designs.[2] On the reverse of the flag is a depiction, also in gold, of a beaver, the state animal of Oregon.[7]\n\n\nFor dress or parade use, the flag may feature a gold fringe. For standard use, no fringe is required.[7] The ratio of the flag's width to its length is 3:5.[10]\n\n\nIt is one of ten U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wyoming.\n\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![flag](image)Oregon portal\n\n\n* Seal of Oregon\n* List of Oregon state symbols\n* Flags whose reverse differs from the obverse\n* Flag of Portland, Oregon\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Oregon/stateFLAG.html Statesymbolsusa.org\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Geography\". *Merriam-Webster*.

Two-sided flags were previously more common, but have been reduced due to increased costs of manufacturing a flag with two different designs.[2] On the reverse of the flag is a depiction, also in gold, of a beaver, the state animal of Oregon.[7]\n\n\nFor dress or parade use, the flag may feature a gold fringe. For standard use, no fringe is required.[7] The ratio of the flag's width to its length is 3:5.[10]\n\n\nIt is one of ten U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wyoming.\n\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![flag](image)Oregon portal\n\n\n* Seal of Oregon\n* List of Oregon state symbols\n* Flags whose reverse differs from the obverse\n* Flag of Portland, Oregon\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Oregon/stateFLAG.html Statesymbolsusa.org\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Geography\". *Merriam-Webster*.
