You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis is a list of the **fastest animals** in the world, by types of animal.\n\n\n\n\n## Fastest organism[edit]\n\n\nThe peregrine falcon is the fastest bird, and the fastest member of the animal kingdom, with a diving speed of over 300\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph).[1] The fastest land animal is the cheetah. Among the fastest animals in the sea is the black marlin, with uncertain and conflicting reports of recorded speeds.[2][3]\n\n\nWhen drawing comparisons between different classes of animals, an alternative unit is sometimes used for organisms: *body length per second*. On this basis the 'fastest' organism on earth, relative to its body length, is the Southern Californian mite, *Paratarsotomus macropalpis*, which has a speed of 322\u00a0body lengths per second.[4] The equivalent speed for a human, running as fast as this mite, would be 1,300\u00a0mph (2,092\u00a0km/h),[5] or approximately Mach 1.7. The speed of the *P. macropalpis* is far in excess of the previous record holder, the Australian tiger beetle *Cicindela eburneola*, which is the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, with a recorded speed of 1.86 metres per second (6.7\u00a0km/h; 4.2\u00a0mph), or 171\u00a0body lengths per second.[6] The cheetah, the fastest land mammal, scores at only 16\u00a0body lengths per second,[4] while Anna's hummingbird has the highest known length-specific velocity attained by any vertebrate.\n\n\n\n\n\n**List of animals by speed**\n| Rank\n | Animal\n | Maximum speed\n | Class\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Peregrine falcon | 389\u00a0km/h (242\u00a0mph)108\u00a0m/s (354\u00a0ft/s)[1][7] | Flight-diving\n | The peregrine falcon is the fastest aerial animal, fastest animal in flight, fastest bird, and the overall fastest member of the animal kingdom. The peregrine achieves its highest velocity not in horizontal level flight, but during its characteristic hunting stoop (vertical flight). While stooping, the peregrine falcon soars to a great height, then dives steeply at speeds of over 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph).[1]Assuming the maximum size at 58\u00a0cm, its relative speed clocks at 186 body lengths per second during its hunting swoop, the equivalent of a human running at 170\u00a0m/s (560\u00a0ft/s).\n |\n| 2\n | Golden eagle | 240\u2013320\u00a0km/h (150\u2013200\u00a0mph)67\u201389\u00a0m/s (220\u2013293\u00a0ft/s)[8] | Flight-diving\n | Assuming the maximum size at 1.02 m, its relative speed clocks at 66\u201387 body lengths per second, the equivalent of a human running at 60\u201380\u00a0m/s (197\u2013262\u00a0ft/s).\n |\n| 3\n | White-throated needletail swift | 169\u00a0km/h (105\u00a0mph)[9][10][11] | Flight\n |  |\n| 4\n | Eurasian hobby | 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph)[12] | Flight\n | Can sometimes outfly the swift.\n |\n| 5\n | Mexican free-tailed bat | 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph)[13] | Flight\n | It has been claimed to have the fastest horizontal speed (as opposed to stoop diving speed) of any animal.\n |\n| 6\n | Frigatebird | 153\u00a0km/h (95\u00a0mph)\n | Flight\n | The frigatebird's high speed is helped by its having the largest wing-area-to-body-weight ratio of any bird.\n |\n| 7\n | Rock dove (pigeon)\n | 148.9\u00a0km/h (92.5\u00a0mph)[14] | Flight\n | Pigeons have been clocked flying 92.5\u00a0mph (148.9\u00a0km/h) average speed on a 400-mile (640\u00a0km) race.\n |\n| 8\n | Spur-winged goose | 142\u00a0km/h (88\u00a0mph)[15] | Flight\n |  |\n| 9\n | Gyrfalcon | 128\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph)[*citation needed*] | Flight\n |  |\n| 10\n | Grey-headed albatross | 127\u00a0km/h (79\u00a0mph)[16][17][note 1] | Flight\n |  |\n| 11\n | Cheetah | 109.4\u2013120.7\u00a0km/h (68.0\u201375.0\u00a0mph)[a] | Land\n | Fastest land-animal, fastest feline, the cheetah can accelerate from 0 to 96.6\u00a0km/h (60.0\u00a0mph) in under three seconds, though endurance is limited.[18] |\n| 12\n | Sailfish | 109.19\u00a0km/h (67.85\u00a0mph)[*citation needed*] | Flight-swimming\n |  |\n| 13\n | Anna's hummingbird | 98.27\u00a0km/h (61.06\u00a0mph)[24] | Flight\n |  |\n| 14\n | Swordfish | 97\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph)[*citation needed*] | Swimming\n |  |\n| 15\n | Ostrich | 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph)[25] | Land\n |  |\n| 16\n | Pronghorn | 88.5\u00a0km/h (55.0\u00a0mph)[b] | Land\n |  |\n| 17\n | Springbok | 88\u00a0km/h (55\u00a0mph)[30][31] | Land\n |  |\n| 18\n | Quarter Horse | 88.5\u00a0km/h (55.0\u00a0mph)\n | Land\n | The American\u00a0Quarter Horse, or\u00a0Quarter Horse, is an American breed of\u00a0horse\u00a0that excels at sprinting short distances.

It can fly at 43\u00a0km/h (27\u00a0mph).\n |\n| *Paratarsotomus macropalpis* | 22\u00a0cm/s (8.7\u00a0in/s)0.8\u00a0km/h (0.50\u00a0mph)\n | 0.7\u00a0mm long mite endemic to Southern California, tracked running up to 322 body lengths per second, equivalent to a human running at around 2,092\u00a0km/h (1,300\u00a0mph). Because of this feat, it is ranked the fastest animal on the planet relative to its body size. It can also achieve this speed across a concrete surface at a temperature of 60\u00a0\u00b0C (140\u00a0\u00b0F), which is lethal to many animals.[5][37] |\n\n\n## Fish[edit]\n\n\nDue to physical constraints, fish may be incapable of exceeding swim speeds of 36\u00a0km/h (22\u00a0mph).[2][3] The larger reported figures below are therefore highly questionable:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Animal\n | Maximum recorded speed\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Black marlin | 132\u00a0km/h (82\u00a0mph)[*citation needed*][*dubious \u2013 discuss*] | A hooked black marlin has been recorded stripping line off a fishing reel at 120 feet per second (82\u00a0mph; 132\u00a0km/h).\n |\n| Sailfish | 109.19\u00a0km/h (67.85\u00a0mph)[*citation needed*][*dubious \u2013 discuss*] | In a series of tests carried out in a fishing cam at Long Key, Florida, United States, sailfish swam and leapt 91 meters (300 feet) in 3 seconds, equivalent to a speed of 109\u00a0km/h (68\u00a0mph), although this speed includes leaps out of the water, which do not strictly qualify as swimming speed.\n |\n| Swordfish | 97\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph)[*citation needed*][*dubious \u2013 discuss*] | The 60\u00a0mph (97\u00a0km/h) figure listed for the swordfish is based on a corrupted version of calculations made by Sir James Gray to estimate the impact speed necessary for a hypothetical 600-pound (270\u00a0kg) swordfish to embed its sword 3 feet in the timbers of ships, as has been known to occur; the figure seems to have entered the literature without question as though someone had actually timed a swordfish at that speed.\n |\n| Yellowfin tuna | 76\u00a0km/h (47\u00a0mph)[38][*dubious \u2013 discuss*] | Many tuna species are capable of swimming at fast speeds colloquially cited at around 80\u00a0km/h (50\u00a0mph). The tails of tuna move fast enough to cause cavitation, which slows them down as vapour accumulates.[3] Tuna have bony fins without nerve endings, which prevents the fish from feeling the pain of cavitation but does not fully protect them from the implosive damage.\n |\n| Shortfin mako shark | 72\u00a0km/h (45\u00a0mph)[*citation needed*][*dubious \u2013 discuss*] | Underwater and unimpeded by a fishing line, the Shortfin Mako has been reliably clocked at 31 miles (50 kilometres) per hour, and there is a claim that one individual of this species achieved a burst speed of 46 miles (74 kilometres) per hour. But it is extremely difficult to get a fish in the wild to swim in a straight line over a measured course. Laboratory measurements of numerous kinds of fishes \u2014 representing a wide range of body sizes \u2014 swimming against an artificial current have revealed a surprisingly uniform maximum burst speed of about 10 times the body length per second. Thus, for an average-sized, 6.5-foot (2-metre) Shortfin, its theoretical maximum speed might be something on the order of 45 miles (72 kilometres) per hour. Yet some estimates of the top-speed of a Shortfin Mako are considerably higher.\n |\n\n\n## Amphibians[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Animal\n | Maximum recorded speed\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Nauta salamander | 24.14\u00a0km/h (15.00\u00a0mph) | Also known as the Andean Salamander, it is the fastest amphibian recorded.[39][40] |\n\n\n## Reptiles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Animal\n | Maximum recorded speed\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Perentie | 40.23\u00a0km/h (25.00\u00a0mph) | Generally considered the fastest recorded reptile\n |\n| Green Iguana | 35.41\u00a0km/h (22.00\u00a0mph)[41] | Green Iguanas are large arboreal lizards capable of running at high speed on the ground.\n |\n| Leatherback sea turtle | 35.28\u00a0km/h (21.92\u00a0mph)[42] | Leatherback turtles have the most hydrodynamic body design of any sea turtle, with a large, teardrop-shaped body.\n |\n| Costa Rican spiny-tailed iguana | 34.6\u00a0km/h (21.5\u00a0mph)[43] | Often cited as the world's fastest lizard in older sources.\n |\n| Six-lined racerunner | 28.97\u00a0km/h (18.00\u00a0mph)\n | A small lizard found throughout the Southern United States and Mexico.\n |\n| Black mamba | 22.53\u00a0km/h (14.00\u00a0mph)[44] |  |\n| Komodo dragon | 20.92\u00a0km/h (13.00\u00a0mph)[45] | Komodo dragons can run briefly up to 13\u00a0mph (21\u00a0km/h) but prefer to hunt by stealth.[45] |\n\n\n## Birds[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of birds by flight speed\n\n\n\n| Animal\n | Maximum recorded speed\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Peregrine falcon | 389\u00a0km/h (242\u00a0mph)[1][7] | The peregrine falcon is the fastest bird, and the fastest member of the animal kingdom.
