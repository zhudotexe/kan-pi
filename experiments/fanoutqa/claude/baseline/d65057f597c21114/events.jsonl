It is unrelated to Taiwanese Sign Language and is known in the Republic of China as *Wénfǎ Shǒuyǔ* (simplified Chinese: 文法手语; traditional Chinese: 文法手語; lit. 'grammatical sign language').[2][*dubious – discuss*]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first references to sign language (simplified Chinese: 手语; traditional Chinese: 手語; pinyin: *shǒuyǔ*; lit. 'hand language') in Chinese literature date from the Tang dynasty, documenting a sign for 'mirror'.[3] In the Song Dynasty, Su Dongpo describes a community that employed a form of sign language.[3] Later in the Ming Dynasty, there is a portrayal of signing in a play entitled *Zen Master Yu Has a Dream of Cui Village* (also translated *A Dream of Master Jade in Green Village*) (simplified Chinese: 玉禅师翠乡一梦; traditional Chinese: 玉禪師翠鄉一夢; pinyin: *Yù Chánshī Cuìxiāng Yī Mèng*) by Xu Wei.[3]\n\n\nThe first Deaf school in China, the Chefoo (Pinyin: *Zhīfú*, 芝罘, an alternative name of Yantai) School for the Deaf, was established in 1887 by the Presbyterian missionary Annetta Thompson Mills. From the School, a sign language based on an oralist approach to deaf education was developed, coming out of the Milan Conference of 1880.[4] Another school for the deaf was established in Shanghai in 1897 by a French Catholic organization. Chinese Sign Language was grown out of these two bases.[5]\n\n\nSchools, workshops and farms for the Deaf in diverse locations are the main ways that CSL has been able to spread in China so well. Other deaf people who are not connected to these gathering places tend to use sets of gestures developed in their own homes, known as home sign.\n\n\nThe Chinese National Association of the Deaf was created by deaf people mostly from the United States in 1992.[6] The main reason for the creation of the organization was to raise the quality of living for the deaf, which was behind the quality of living standards provided for other disabled persons.[*citation needed*] Their main goals are to improve the welfare of the deaf, encourage education about the Deaf and Chinese Sign Language, and promote the needs of the Deaf community in China.\n\n\n\n## Classification\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are two main dialects of Chinese Sign Language: Southern CSL (centered on Shanghai and influenced by French Sign Language) and Northern CSL (coming out of the Chefoo School of Deaf and influenced by American Sign Language (ASL)).[5] Northern CSL has the greater influence from Chinese, with for example character puns[*clarification needed*]. Hong Kong Sign Language derives from the southern dialect, but by now is a separate language.[7] The Shanghai dialect is found in Malaysia and Taiwan, but Chinese Sign Language is unrelated to Taiwanese Sign Language (which is part of the Japanese family), Malaysian Sign Language (of the French family), or to Tibetan Sign Language (isolate).\n\n\nCSL shares morphology for forming negative clauses with British Sign Language; it may be that this is due to historical contact with the British in Shanghai.[7] A feature of both CSL and British Sign Language is the use in many related signs of the thumb for a positive meaning and of the pinkie for a negative meaning, such as DON'T KNOW.\n\n\n\n## Structure\n\n[edit]\n\nLike most other sign languages, Chinese Sign Language is mostly conveyed through shapes and motions joined with facial expressions. CSL has at its disposal an alphabetic spelling system similar to pinyin. This was officially adopted in December 1963 as the 'Chinese Fingerspelling Scheme' (simplified Chinese: 汉语手指字母方案; traditional Chinese: 漢語手指字母方案; pinyin: *Hànyǔ Shǒuzhǐ Zìmǔ Fāng'àn*).[8][9] It is a one-handed manual alphabet, most similar to languages in the Francosign family such as the French and American manual alphabets. A key feature of the fingerspelling is the treatment of pinyin ZH, CH, SH and NG as single fingerspelling signs, rather than sequences of two letter signs, as would be expected from the pinyin; this reflects the phonemic status of these oral sounds in Standard Chinese phonology.[9]\n\n\nThe Chinese culture and language heavily influence signs in CSL. For example, there is no generic word for \"brother\" in CSL, only two distinct signs, one for \"older brother\" and one for \"younger brother\". This parallels Chinese, which also specifies \"older brother\" or \"younger brother\" rather than simply \"brother\". Similarly, the sign for \"eat\" incorporates a pictorial representation for chopsticks instead of using the hand as in ASL.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Chinese Sign at *Ethnologue* (25th ed., 2022) ![Closed access icon](image)\n2. **^** Tai, James; Tsay, Jane (2015). *Sign Languages of the World: A Comparative Handbook*.

It is unrelated to Taiwanese Sign Language and is known in the Republic of China as *Wénfǎ Shǒuyǔ* (simplified Chinese: 文法手语; traditional Chinese: 文法手語; lit. 'grammatical sign language').[2][*dubious – discuss*]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first references to sign language (simplified Chinese: 手语; traditional Chinese: 手語; pinyin: *shǒuyǔ*; lit. 'hand language') in Chinese literature date from the Tang dynasty, documenting a sign for 'mirror'.[3] In the Song Dynasty, Su Dongpo describes a community that employed a form of sign language.[3] Later in the Ming Dynasty, there is a portrayal of signing in a play entitled *Zen Master Yu Has a Dream of Cui Village* (also translated *A Dream of Master Jade in Green Village*) (simplified Chinese: 玉禅师翠乡一梦; traditional Chinese: 玉禪師翠鄉一夢; pinyin: *Yù Chánshī Cuìxiāng Yī Mèng*) by Xu Wei.[3]\n\n\nThe first Deaf school in China, the Chefoo (Pinyin: *Zhīfú*, 芝罘, an alternative name of Yantai) School for the Deaf, was established in 1887 by the Presbyterian missionary Annetta Thompson Mills. From the School, a sign language based on an oralist approach to deaf education was developed, coming out of the Milan Conference of 1880.[4] Another school for the deaf was established in Shanghai in 1897 by a French Catholic organization. Chinese Sign Language was grown out of these two bases.[5]\n\n\nSchools, workshops and farms for the Deaf in diverse locations are the main ways that CSL has been able to spread in China so well. Other deaf people who are not connected to these gathering places tend to use sets of gestures developed in their own homes, known as home sign.\n\n\nThe Chinese National Association of the Deaf was created by deaf people mostly from the United States in 1992.[6] The main reason for the creation of the organization was to raise the quality of living for the deaf, which was behind the quality of living standards provided for other disabled persons.[*citation needed*] Their main goals are to improve the welfare of the deaf, encourage education about the Deaf and Chinese Sign Language, and promote the needs of the Deaf community in China.\n\n\n\n## Classification\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are two main dialects of Chinese Sign Language: Southern CSL (centered on Shanghai and influenced by French Sign Language) and Northern CSL (coming out of the Chefoo School of Deaf and influenced by American Sign Language (ASL)).[5] Northern CSL has the greater influence from Chinese, with for example character puns[*clarification needed*]. Hong Kong Sign Language derives from the southern dialect, but by now is a separate language.[7] The Shanghai dialect is found in Malaysia and Taiwan, but Chinese Sign Language is unrelated to Taiwanese Sign Language (which is part of the Japanese family), Malaysian Sign Language (of the French family), or to Tibetan Sign Language (isolate).\n\n\nCSL shares morphology for forming negative clauses with British Sign Language; it may be that this is due to historical contact with the British in Shanghai.[7] A feature of both CSL and British Sign Language is the use in many related signs of the thumb for a positive meaning and of the pinkie for a negative meaning, such as DON'T KNOW.\n\n\n\n## Structure\n\n[edit]\n\nLike most other sign languages, Chinese Sign Language is mostly conveyed through shapes and motions joined with facial expressions. CSL has at its disposal an alphabetic spelling system similar to pinyin. This was officially adopted in December 1963 as the 'Chinese Fingerspelling Scheme' (simplified Chinese: 汉语手指字母方案; traditional Chinese: 漢語手指字母方案; pinyin: *Hànyǔ Shǒuzhǐ Zìmǔ Fāng'àn*).[8][9] It is a one-handed manual alphabet, most similar to languages in the Francosign family such as the French and American manual alphabets. A key feature of the fingerspelling is the treatment of pinyin ZH, CH, SH and NG as single fingerspelling signs, rather than sequences of two letter signs, as would be expected from the pinyin; this reflects the phonemic status of these oral sounds in Standard Chinese phonology.[9]\n\n\nThe Chinese culture and language heavily influence signs in CSL. For example, there is no generic word for \"brother\" in CSL, only two distinct signs, one for \"older brother\" and one for \"younger brother\". This parallels Chinese, which also specifies \"older brother\" or \"younger brother\" rather than simply \"brother\". Similarly, the sign for \"eat\" incorporates a pictorial representation for chopsticks instead of using the hand as in ASL.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Chinese Sign at *Ethnologue* (25th ed., 2022) ![Closed access icon](image)\n2. **^** Tai, James; Tsay, Jane (2015). *Sign Languages of the World: A Comparative Handbook*.

Although there are not many reliable statistics, it is estimated that there are over 100,000 speakers, 20-30% of whom use it as a second language.\n\n\nFrom a strictly linguistic point of view, Spanish Sign Language refers to a sign language variety employed in an extensive central-interior area of the Iberian Peninsula, having Madrid as a cultural and linguistic epicenter, with other varieties used in regions such as Asturias, Aragon, Murcia, parts of western Andalusia and near the Province of Burgos.[2]\n\n\nMutual intelligibility with the rest of the sign languages used in Spain is generally high due to a highly shared lexicon. However, Catalan Sign Language, Valencian Sign Language as well as the Spanish Sign Language dialects used in eastern Andalusia, Canary Islands, Galicia and Basque Country are the most distinctive lexically (between 10 and 30% difference in the use of nouns, depending on the case). Only the Catalan and Valencian Sign Languages share less than 75% of their vocabulary with the rest of the Spanish dialects, which makes them particularly marked, distinct dialects or even languages separate from Spanish Sign Language, depending on the methods used to determine language versus dialect. Some linguists consider both these and the Spanish Sign language three variants of a polymorphic sign language.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Signed Spanish\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Spanish Sign Language at *Ethnologue* (25th ed., 2022) ![Closed access icon](image)\n2. **^** «Un estudio lingüístico: Variación de las lenguas de signos en España», Steven Parkhurst y Dianne Parkhurst. *Revista Española de Lingüística de Lengua de Signos* (RELLS), Madrid 2001.

Although there are not many reliable statistics, it is estimated that there are over 100,000 speakers, 20-30% of whom use it as a second language.\n\n\nFrom a strictly linguistic point of view, Spanish Sign Language refers to a sign language variety employed in an extensive central-interior area of the Iberian Peninsula, having Madrid as a cultural and linguistic epicenter, with other varieties used in regions such as Asturias, Aragon, Murcia, parts of western Andalusia and near the Province of Burgos.[2]\n\n\nMutual intelligibility with the rest of the sign languages used in Spain is generally high due to a highly shared lexicon. However, Catalan Sign Language, Valencian Sign Language as well as the Spanish Sign Language dialects used in eastern Andalusia, Canary Islands, Galicia and Basque Country are the most distinctive lexically (between 10 and 30% difference in the use of nouns, depending on the case). Only the Catalan and Valencian Sign Languages share less than 75% of their vocabulary with the rest of the Spanish dialects, which makes them particularly marked, distinct dialects or even languages separate from Spanish Sign Language, depending on the methods used to determine language versus dialect. Some linguists consider both these and the Spanish Sign language three variants of a polymorphic sign language.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Signed Spanish\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Spanish Sign Language at *Ethnologue* (25th ed., 2022) ![Closed access icon](image)\n2. **^** «Un estudio lingüístico: Variación de las lenguas de signos en España», Steven Parkhurst y Dianne Parkhurst. *Revista Española de Lingüística de Lengua de Signos* (RELLS), Madrid 2001.

Others recognize some varieties as separate languages. The ISO standard currently distinguishes:\n\n\n\n* Indian Sign Language (ins),\n* Pakistan Sign Language (pks),\n* West Bengal Sign Language (Kolkata Sign Language) (wbs), and\n* Nepalese Sign Language (nsp).[4]\n\n\n\n## Status of sign language\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The Deaf communities of the Indian subcontinent are still struggling for IPSL to gain the status of sign language as a minority language. Though sign language is used by many deaf people in the subcontinent, it is not used officially in schools for teaching purposes.\n\n\n\n### India\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2005, the National Curricular Framework (NCF) gave some degree of legitimacy to sign language education, by hinting that sign languages may qualify as an optional third language choice for hearing students. NCERT in March 2006 published a chapter on sign language in a class III textbook, emphasising the fact that it is a language like any other and is \"yet another mode of communication.\" The aim was to create healthy attitudes towards the disabled.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nStrenuous efforts have been made by Deaf communities, NGO's, researchers and other organisations working for people with hearing disabilities , including the All India Federation of Deaf (AIFD), National association of the Deaf (NAD) in the direction of encouraging ISL. Until 2001, no formal classes for teaching ISL were conducted in India. During this period, Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Hearing and the Handicapped (AYJNIHH), Mumbai, established an ISL cell. It started a course called \"Diploma in India Sign Language Interpreter Course\". The curriculum designed for the course aims to develop professional communication in Sign language and ability to interpret professionally. It also focused on the basic understanding of the Deaf community and Deaf culture. Later, the course was offered in the regional centers, in Hyderabad, Bhuvaneshwar, Kolkata and Delhi.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBesides AYJNIHH, organisations like the Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore and several other organisations offer ISL classes. Many NGOs all over the India use ISL to teach English and various academic and vocational courses. These NGOs include ISHARA (Mumbai), Deaf Way Foundation (Delhi), the Noida Deaf Society and Leadership Education Empowerment of the Deaf (LEED) (Pune), Speaking Hands Institute for the Deaf (Punjab), etc. (Randhawa, 2014). The associations like the Association of Sign Language Interpreters (ASLI) and the Indian Sign Language Interpreters Association (ISLIA) were established in 2006 and 2008 respectively for the professional development of Interpreters in India. Two schools have been established in India which follow bilingual approach to teach deaf students. The schools are the Bajaj Institute of Learning (BIL) in Dehradun and Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore. Apart from the establishment of organisations working for Deaf people there has been a spurt in research on sign language in India. Recent research developments include the studies by research scholars of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and the University of Delhi including Wallang, 2007; Sinha, 2003,2008/2013; Hidam, 2010; Kulsheshtra, 2013. There is also work on problems and awareness of IPSL and typology of IPSL verbs (Morgan 2009,2010). Apart from these there have been continued works by scholars on linguistic aspects of IPSL as well as on varieties of IPSL (Bhattacharya and Hidam 2010, Aboh, Pfau, and Zeshan 2005, Zeshan and Panda 2011, Panda 2011, Panda 2012). Steps taken by the Government of India to promote sign language include the establishment of the ISLRTC. However, currently the autonomy of the Research centre is a contentious issue, which is yet to be resolved.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Pakistan\n\n[edit]\n\nPakistan has a deaf population of 0.24 million, which is approximately 7.4% of the overall disabled population in the country.[7]\n\n\n\n## Varieties\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are many varieties of sign language in the region, including many pockets of home sign and local sign languages, such as Ghandruk Sign Language, Jhankot Sign Language, and Jumla Sign Language in Nepal, and Alipur Sign Language in India, which appear to be language isolates. There are also various Sri Lankan sign languages which may not even be related to each other. However, the urban varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal (Nepalese Sign Language), and Bangladesh are clearly related (although, for Nepalese Sign Language at least, it is not clear whether the relation is genetic, or perhaps rather one of borrowing compounded by extensive incorporation of a shared South Asian gestural base). There is disagreement whether these related varieties should be considered separate languages.\n\n\n\n* Woodward (1992a) researched the vocabulary of the sign language varieties in Karachi (Sindh, Pakistan), Delhi (NCT, India), Bombay (Maharashtra, India), Bangalore (Karnataka, India) and Calcutta (West Bengal, India). He found cognacy rates of 62–71% between the Karachi vocabulary on the one hand and the four Indian vocabularies on the other, and concluded that 'sign language varieties in India and Pakistan are distinct but closely related language varieties belonging to the same language family'.[8]\n* Woodward (1993) expanded on his 1992 research by comparing the results from India and Pakistan with new data from Nepal, tentatively concluding that the sign language varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal and probably also Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are so closely related that they may, in fact, constitute a single sign language.[9]\n* Zeshan (2000), based on her own research in Karachi and New Delhi concluding that their grammar was identical and there were only small differences in vocabulary, proposed that the Indian and Pakistani varieties constitute a single language, introduced the term 'Indo-Pakistani Sign Language' and emphatically rejected the notion of separate Indian and Pakistani sign languages.[3]\n* The ISO 639-3 standard categorises these varieties as three separate sign languages in India and Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. *Ethnologue* (2016), which follows the ISO standard, acknowledges the relatedness of these varieties as well as the controversy over whether they are one language or many.[10] They identify the following variety within India: Bangalore-Chennai-Hyderabad Sign Language, Mumbai-Delhi Sign Language and Kolkata Sign Language.\n\n\n* Johnson and Johnson (2016)[11] argue that the varieties used in Kolkata and Bangladesh are distinct from that used in Delhi, and probably also from each other.\n\n\nWhile the sign system in IPSL appears to be largely indigenous, elements in IPSL are derived from British Sign Language. For example, most IPSL signers nowadays use fingerspelling based on British Sign Language fingerspelling, with only isolated groups using an indigenous devanagari-based fingerspelling system (for example, Deaf students and graduates of the school for the deaf in Vadodara/Baroda, Gujarat). In addition, more recently contact with foreign Deaf has resulted in rather extensive borrowing from International Signs and (either directly or via International Signs) from American Sign Language. A small number of the Deaf in and around Bengaluru are often said to use American Sign Language (owing to a longstanding ASL deaf school there); however it is probably more correct to say that they use a lexicon based largely on ASL (or Signed English), while incorporating also a not inconsequential IPSL element. Furthermore, regardless of the individual signs used, the grammar used is clearly IPSL and not ASL.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Delhi Association for the Deaf is reportedly working with Jawaharlal Nehru University to identify a standard sign language for India.[12]\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### Early history\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough discussion of sign languages and the lives of deaf people is extremely rare in the history of South Asian literature, there are a few references to deaf people and gestural communication in texts dating from antiquity.[13] Symbolic hand gestures known as mudras have been employed in religious contexts in Hinduism, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism for many centuries, although Buddhism have often excluded deaf people from participation in a ritual or religious membership.[14] In addition, classical Indian dance and theatre often employs stylised hand gestures with particular meanings.[15]\n\n\nAn early reference to gestures used by deaf people for communication appears in a 12th-century Islamic legal commentary, the Hidayah. In the influential text, deaf (or \"dumb\") people have legal standing in areas such as bequests, marriage, divorce and financial transactions, if they communicate habitually with intelligible signs.[16]\n\n\nEarly in the 20th century, a high incidence of deafness was observed among communities of the Naga hills. As has happened elsewhere in such circumstances (see, for example, Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language), a village sign language had emerged and was used by both deaf and hearing members of the community. Ethnologist and political officer John Henry Hutton wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> As one might expect ... of men without the art of writing, the language of signs has reached a high state of development... To judge how highly developed is this power of communicating by signs, etc., it is necessary only to experience a Naga interpreter's translation of a story or a request told to him in sign language by a dumb man. ... Indeed the writer has known a dumb man make a long and detailed complaint of an assault in which nothing was missing except proper names, and even these were eventually identified by means of the dumb man's description of his assailants' dress and personal appearance.[17]\n> \n> \n\n\n(See Naga Sign Language.)\nHowever, it is unlikely that any of these sign systems are related to modern IPSL, and deaf people were largely treated as social outcasts throughout South Asian history.\n\n\n\n### Residential deaf schools\n\n[edit]\n\nDocumented deaf education began with welfare services, mission schools and orphanages from the 1830s, and \"initially worked with locally-devised gestural or signed communication, sometimes with simultaneous speech.\"[18] Later in the 19th century, residential deaf schools were established, and they tended (increasingly) to adopt an oralist approach over the use of sign language in the classroom. These schools included The Bombay Institution for Deaf-Mutes, which was founded by Bishop Leo Meurin in the 1880s,[19] and schools in Madras[20] and Calcutta[21] which opened in the 1890s. Other residential schools soon followed, such as the \"School for Deaf and Dumb Boys\" at Mysore, founded in 1902,[22] a school in Dehiwala in what is now Sri Lanka, founded in 1913,[23] and \"The Ida Rieu School for blind, deaf, dumb and other defective children\", founded in 1923 in Karachi, in what is now Pakistan.[24]\n\n\nWhile a few students who were unable to learn via the oralist method were taught with signs, many students preferred to communicate with each other via sign language, sometimes to the frustration of their teachers. The first study of the sign language of these children, which is almost certainly related to modern IPSL, was in 1928 by British teacher H. C. Banerjee. She visited three residential schools for deaf children, at Dacca, Barisal and Calcutta, observing that \"in all these schools the teachers have discouraged the growth of the sign language, which in spite of this official disapproval, has grown and flourished.\"[25] She compared sign vocabularies at the different schools and described the signs in words in an appendix.\n\n\nA rare case of a public event conducted in sign language was reported by a mission in Palayamkottai in 1906: \"Our services for the Deaf are chiefly in the sign language, in which all can join alike, whether learning Tamil, as those do who belong to the Madras Presidency, or English, which is taught to those coming from other parts.\"[26]\n\n\n\n## Grammar\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite the common assumption that Indo-Pakistani Sign Language is the manual representation of spoken English or Hindi, it is in fact unrelated to either language and has its own grammar. Zeshan (2014) discusses three aspects of IPSL: its lexicon, syntax and spatial grammar. Some distinct features of IPSL that differ from other sign languages include:\n\n\n1) Number Signs: The numbers from zero to nine are formed in IPSL by holding up a hand with the appropriate handshape for each number. From one to five the corresponding number of extended fingers forms the numeral sign, whereas for zero and the numbers from six to nine special handshapes are used that derive from written numbers. Ten may either be expressed by two 5-hands or by ‘1+0’. (Zeshan, 2000)\n\n\n2) Family Relationship: The signs for family relationship are preceded by the sign for ‘male/man’ and ‘female/woman’.\n\n\n\ni)\nMAN\nSIBLING\nMAN SIBLING\n\nbrother\n\nii)\nWOMAN\nSIBLING\nWOMAN SIBLING\n\nsister\n\n3) Sign families: Several signs belong to same family if they share one or more parameters including handshapes, place of articulation and movement.\n\n\nE.g.: \n\n\n\n\n```\n   i)PASS and FAIL – The handshape for the sign is same but they move in opposite direction.\n   \n   ii)MONEY, PAY and RICH – They have same handshape but different place of articulation and movement pattern.\n  \n   iii)THINK, KNOW and UNDERSTAND – The place of articulation is head which is same for all signs.\n\n```\n\n4) The IPSL consists of various non-manual gestures including mouth pattern, mouth gesture, facial expression, body posture, head position and eye gaze (Zeshan, 2001)\n\n\n5) There is no temporal inflection in IPSL. The past, present and future is depicted by using signs for before, then, and after.\n\n\n6) The question words like WHAT, WHERE, WHICH, HOW etc. are placed at the end of interrogative sentences.\n\n\n\ni)\nBANK\n\nbank\nWHERE\n\nWH\nBANK WHERE\n\nbank WH\n\nWhere is the bank?\n\nii)\nSICK\n\nsick\nWHO\n\nWH\nSICK WHO\n\nsick WH\n\nWho is sick?\n\n7) The use of space is a crucial feature of IPSL.\n\n\n\n\n> Sentences are always predicate final, and all of the signs from the open lexical classes can function as predicates. Ellipsis is extensive, and one-word sentences are common. There is a strong preference for sentences with only one lexical argument. Constituent order does not play any role in the marking of grammatical relations. These are coded exclusively by spatial mechanisms (e.g., directional signs) or inferred from the context. Temporal expressions usually come first in the sentence, and if there is a functional particle, it always follows the predicate (e.g., YESTERDAY FATHER DIE COMPLETIVE – \"(My) father died yesterday\").[27]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nIndo-Pakistani Sign Language has appeared in numerous Indian films such as:\n\n\n\n* Koshish, 1972 film about a deaf couple.\n* Mozhi, 2007 film about the love story of a deaf and mute girl.\n* Khamoshi: The Musical, a 1996 film about a deaf couple with a daughter who becomes a musician.\n* Black, a 2005 film about a blind and deaf girl based in part on the life of Helen Keller.\n\n\n## Computational Resources\n\n[edit]\n\nThere has been some significant amount of research on Sign language recognition, but with much less focus for Indo sign language. Due to the political divide, Indian and Pakistani sign languages are generally perceived different, hence leading to fragmented research. There have been a few initiatives that gather open resources for Indian[28] and Pakistani SLs.[29]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Vasishta, M., J. C. Woodward, and K. L.

Natural sign languages are not related to the spoken language used in the same region. For example, French Sign Language originated in France, but is not related to French. Conversely, ASL and BSL both originated in English-speaking countries but are not related to each other; ASL however is related to French Sign Language.\n**^b** Denotes the number (if known) of languages within the family.

Others recognize some varieties as separate languages. The ISO standard currently distinguishes:\n\n\n\n* Indian Sign Language (ins),\n* Pakistan Sign Language (pks),\n* West Bengal Sign Language (Kolkata Sign Language) (wbs), and\n* Nepalese Sign Language (nsp).[4]\n\n\n\n## Status of sign language\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The Deaf communities of the Indian subcontinent are still struggling for IPSL to gain the status of sign language as a minority language. Though sign language is used by many deaf people in the subcontinent, it is not used officially in schools for teaching purposes.\n\n\n\n### India\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2005, the National Curricular Framework (NCF) gave some degree of legitimacy to sign language education, by hinting that sign languages may qualify as an optional third language choice for hearing students. NCERT in March 2006 published a chapter on sign language in a class III textbook, emphasising the fact that it is a language like any other and is \"yet another mode of communication.\" The aim was to create healthy attitudes towards the disabled.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nStrenuous efforts have been made by Deaf communities, NGO's, researchers and other organisations working for people with hearing disabilities , including the All India Federation of Deaf (AIFD), National association of the Deaf (NAD) in the direction of encouraging ISL. Until 2001, no formal classes for teaching ISL were conducted in India. During this period, Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Hearing and the Handicapped (AYJNIHH), Mumbai, established an ISL cell. It started a course called \"Diploma in India Sign Language Interpreter Course\". The curriculum designed for the course aims to develop professional communication in Sign language and ability to interpret professionally. It also focused on the basic understanding of the Deaf community and Deaf culture. Later, the course was offered in the regional centers, in Hyderabad, Bhuvaneshwar, Kolkata and Delhi.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBesides AYJNIHH, organisations like the Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore and several other organisations offer ISL classes. Many NGOs all over the India use ISL to teach English and various academic and vocational courses. These NGOs include ISHARA (Mumbai), Deaf Way Foundation (Delhi), the Noida Deaf Society and Leadership Education Empowerment of the Deaf (LEED) (Pune), Speaking Hands Institute for the Deaf (Punjab), etc. (Randhawa, 2014). The associations like the Association of Sign Language Interpreters (ASLI) and the Indian Sign Language Interpreters Association (ISLIA) were established in 2006 and 2008 respectively for the professional development of Interpreters in India. Two schools have been established in India which follow bilingual approach to teach deaf students. The schools are the Bajaj Institute of Learning (BIL) in Dehradun and Mook Badhir Sangathan in Indore. Apart from the establishment of organisations working for Deaf people there has been a spurt in research on sign language in India. Recent research developments include the studies by research scholars of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and the University of Delhi including Wallang, 2007; Sinha, 2003,2008/2013; Hidam, 2010; Kulsheshtra, 2013. There is also work on problems and awareness of IPSL and typology of IPSL verbs (Morgan 2009,2010). Apart from these there have been continued works by scholars on linguistic aspects of IPSL as well as on varieties of IPSL (Bhattacharya and Hidam 2010, Aboh, Pfau, and Zeshan 2005, Zeshan and Panda 2011, Panda 2011, Panda 2012). Steps taken by the Government of India to promote sign language include the establishment of the ISLRTC. However, currently the autonomy of the Research centre is a contentious issue, which is yet to be resolved.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Pakistan\n\n[edit]\n\nPakistan has a deaf population of 0.24 million, which is approximately 7.4% of the overall disabled population in the country.[7]\n\n\n\n## Varieties\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are many varieties of sign language in the region, including many pockets of home sign and local sign languages, such as Ghandruk Sign Language, Jhankot Sign Language, and Jumla Sign Language in Nepal, and Alipur Sign Language in India, which appear to be language isolates. There are also various Sri Lankan sign languages which may not even be related to each other. However, the urban varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal (Nepalese Sign Language), and Bangladesh are clearly related (although, for Nepalese Sign Language at least, it is not clear whether the relation is genetic, or perhaps rather one of borrowing compounded by extensive incorporation of a shared South Asian gestural base). There is disagreement whether these related varieties should be considered separate languages.\n\n\n\n* Woodward (1992a) researched the vocabulary of the sign language varieties in Karachi (Sindh, Pakistan), Delhi (NCT, India), Bombay (Maharashtra, India), Bangalore (Karnataka, India) and Calcutta (West Bengal, India). He found cognacy rates of 62–71% between the Karachi vocabulary on the one hand and the four Indian vocabularies on the other, and concluded that 'sign language varieties in India and Pakistan are distinct but closely related language varieties belonging to the same language family'.[8]\n* Woodward (1993) expanded on his 1992 research by comparing the results from India and Pakistan with new data from Nepal, tentatively concluding that the sign language varieties of India, Pakistan, Nepal and probably also Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are so closely related that they may, in fact, constitute a single sign language.[9]\n* Zeshan (2000), based on her own research in Karachi and New Delhi concluding that their grammar was identical and there were only small differences in vocabulary, proposed that the Indian and Pakistani varieties constitute a single language, introduced the term 'Indo-Pakistani Sign Language' and emphatically rejected the notion of separate Indian and Pakistani sign languages.[3]\n* The ISO 639-3 standard categorises these varieties as three separate sign languages in India and Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal. *Ethnologue* (2016), which follows the ISO standard, acknowledges the relatedness of these varieties as well as the controversy over whether they are one language or many.[10] They identify the following variety within India: Bangalore-Chennai-Hyderabad Sign Language, Mumbai-Delhi Sign Language and Kolkata Sign Language.\n\n\n* Johnson and Johnson (2016)[11] argue that the varieties used in Kolkata and Bangladesh are distinct from that used in Delhi, and probably also from each other.\n\n\nWhile the sign system in IPSL appears to be largely indigenous, elements in IPSL are derived from British Sign Language. For example, most IPSL signers nowadays use fingerspelling based on British Sign Language fingerspelling, with only isolated groups using an indigenous devanagari-based fingerspelling system (for example, Deaf students and graduates of the school for the deaf in Vadodara/Baroda, Gujarat). In addition, more recently contact with foreign Deaf has resulted in rather extensive borrowing from International Signs and (either directly or via International Signs) from American Sign Language. A small number of the Deaf in and around Bengaluru are often said to use American Sign Language (owing to a longstanding ASL deaf school there); however it is probably more correct to say that they use a lexicon based largely on ASL (or Signed English), while incorporating also a not inconsequential IPSL element. Furthermore, regardless of the individual signs used, the grammar used is clearly IPSL and not ASL.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Delhi Association for the Deaf is reportedly working with Jawaharlal Nehru University to identify a standard sign language for India.[12]\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### Early history\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough discussion of sign languages and the lives of deaf people is extremely rare in the history of South Asian literature, there are a few references to deaf people and gestural communication in texts dating from antiquity.[13] Symbolic hand gestures known as mudras have been employed in religious contexts in Hinduism, Buddhism and Zoroastrianism for many centuries, although Buddhism have often excluded deaf people from participation in a ritual or religious membership.[14] In addition, classical Indian dance and theatre often employs stylised hand gestures with particular meanings.[15]\n\n\nAn early reference to gestures used by deaf people for communication appears in a 12th-century Islamic legal commentary, the Hidayah. In the influential text, deaf (or \"dumb\") people have legal standing in areas such as bequests, marriage, divorce and financial transactions, if they communicate habitually with intelligible signs.[16]\n\n\nEarly in the 20th century, a high incidence of deafness was observed among communities of the Naga hills. As has happened elsewhere in such circumstances (see, for example, Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language), a village sign language had emerged and was used by both deaf and hearing members of the community. Ethnologist and political officer John Henry Hutton wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> As one might expect ... of men without the art of writing, the language of signs has reached a high state of development... To judge how highly developed is this power of communicating by signs, etc., it is necessary only to experience a Naga interpreter's translation of a story or a request told to him in sign language by a dumb man. ... Indeed the writer has known a dumb man make a long and detailed complaint of an assault in which nothing was missing except proper names, and even these were eventually identified by means of the dumb man's description of his assailants' dress and personal appearance.[17]\n> \n> \n\n\n(See Naga Sign Language.)\nHowever, it is unlikely that any of these sign systems are related to modern IPSL, and deaf people were largely treated as social outcasts throughout South Asian history.\n\n\n\n### Residential deaf schools\n\n[edit]\n\nDocumented deaf education began with welfare services, mission schools and orphanages from the 1830s, and \"initially worked with locally-devised gestural or signed communication, sometimes with simultaneous speech.\"[18] Later in the 19th century, residential deaf schools were established, and they tended (increasingly) to adopt an oralist approach over the use of sign language in the classroom. These schools included The Bombay Institution for Deaf-Mutes, which was founded by Bishop Leo Meurin in the 1880s,[19] and schools in Madras[20] and Calcutta[21] which opened in the 1890s. Other residential schools soon followed, such as the \"School for Deaf and Dumb Boys\" at Mysore, founded in 1902,[22] a school in Dehiwala in what is now Sri Lanka, founded in 1913,[23] and \"The Ida Rieu School for blind, deaf, dumb and other defective children\", founded in 1923 in Karachi, in what is now Pakistan.[24]\n\n\nWhile a few students who were unable to learn via the oralist method were taught with signs, many students preferred to communicate with each other via sign language, sometimes to the frustration of their teachers. The first study of the sign language of these children, which is almost certainly related to modern IPSL, was in 1928 by British teacher H. C. Banerjee. She visited three residential schools for deaf children, at Dacca, Barisal and Calcutta, observing that \"in all these schools the teachers have discouraged the growth of the sign language, which in spite of this official disapproval, has grown and flourished.\"[25] She compared sign vocabularies at the different schools and described the signs in words in an appendix.\n\n\nA rare case of a public event conducted in sign language was reported by a mission in Palayamkottai in 1906: \"Our services for the Deaf are chiefly in the sign language, in which all can join alike, whether learning Tamil, as those do who belong to the Madras Presidency, or English, which is taught to those coming from other parts.\"[26]\n\n\n\n## Grammar\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite the common assumption that Indo-Pakistani Sign Language is the manual representation of spoken English or Hindi, it is in fact unrelated to either language and has its own grammar. Zeshan (2014) discusses three aspects of IPSL: its lexicon, syntax and spatial grammar. Some distinct features of IPSL that differ from other sign languages include:\n\n\n1) Number Signs: The numbers from zero to nine are formed in IPSL by holding up a hand with the appropriate handshape for each number. From one to five the corresponding number of extended fingers forms the numeral sign, whereas for zero and the numbers from six to nine special handshapes are used that derive from written numbers. Ten may either be expressed by two 5-hands or by ‘1+0’. (Zeshan, 2000)\n\n\n2) Family Relationship: The signs for family relationship are preceded by the sign for ‘male/man’ and ‘female/woman’.\n\n\n\ni)\nMAN\nSIBLING\nMAN SIBLING\n\nbrother\n\nii)\nWOMAN\nSIBLING\nWOMAN SIBLING\n\nsister\n\n3) Sign families: Several signs belong to same family if they share one or more parameters including handshapes, place of articulation and movement.\n\n\nE.g.: \n\n\n\n\n```\n   i)PASS and FAIL – The handshape for the sign is same but they move in opposite direction.\n   \n   ii)MONEY, PAY and RICH – They have same handshape but different place of articulation and movement pattern.\n  \n   iii)THINK, KNOW and UNDERSTAND – The place of articulation is head which is same for all signs.\n\n```\n\n4) The IPSL consists of various non-manual gestures including mouth pattern, mouth gesture, facial expression, body posture, head position and eye gaze (Zeshan, 2001)\n\n\n5) There is no temporal inflection in IPSL. The past, present and future is depicted by using signs for before, then, and after.\n\n\n6) The question words like WHAT, WHERE, WHICH, HOW etc. are placed at the end of interrogative sentences.\n\n\n\ni)\nBANK\n\nbank\nWHERE\n\nWH\nBANK WHERE\n\nbank WH\n\nWhere is the bank?\n\nii)\nSICK\n\nsick\nWHO\n\nWH\nSICK WHO\n\nsick WH\n\nWho is sick?\n\n7) The use of space is a crucial feature of IPSL.\n\n\n\n\n> Sentences are always predicate final, and all of the signs from the open lexical classes can function as predicates. Ellipsis is extensive, and one-word sentences are common. There is a strong preference for sentences with only one lexical argument. Constituent order does not play any role in the marking of grammatical relations. These are coded exclusively by spatial mechanisms (e.g., directional signs) or inferred from the context. Temporal expressions usually come first in the sentence, and if there is a functional particle, it always follows the predicate (e.g., YESTERDAY FATHER DIE COMPLETIVE – \"(My) father died yesterday\").[27]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nIndo-Pakistani Sign Language has appeared in numerous Indian films such as:\n\n\n\n* Koshish, 1972 film about a deaf couple.\n* Mozhi, 2007 film about the love story of a deaf and mute girl.\n* Khamoshi: The Musical, a 1996 film about a deaf couple with a daughter who becomes a musician.\n* Black, a 2005 film about a blind and deaf girl based in part on the life of Helen Keller.\n\n\n## Computational Resources\n\n[edit]\n\nThere has been some significant amount of research on Sign language recognition, but with much less focus for Indo sign language. Due to the political divide, Indian and Pakistani sign languages are generally perceived different, hence leading to fragmented research. There have been a few initiatives that gather open resources for Indian[28] and Pakistani SLs.[29]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Vasishta, M., J. C. Woodward, and K. L.

ASL is a complete and organized visual language that is expressed by employing both manual and nonmanual features.[5] Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology.\n\n\nASL originated in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has been propagated widely by schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken. Reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults and other hearing individuals.\n\n\nASL signs have a number of phonemic components, such as movement of the face, the torso, and the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime although iconicity plays a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object language. However, there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.\n\n\n\n\n## Classification[edit]\n\n\nTravis Dougherty explains and demonstrates the ASL alphabet. Voice-over interpretation by Gilbert G. Lensbower.\nASL emerged as a language in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded by Thomas Gallaudet in 1817,[6]: 7 which brought together Old French Sign Language, various village sign languages, and home sign systems. ASL was created in that situation by language contact.[7]: 11[a] ASL was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them.[6]: 7\n\n\nThe influence of French Sign Language (LSF) on ASL is readily apparent; for example, it has been found that about 58% of signs in modern ASL are cognate to Old French Sign Language signs.[6]: 7[7]: 14 However, that is far less than the standard 80% measure used to determine whether related languages are actually dialects.[7]: 14 That suggests that nascent ASL was highly affected by the other signing systems brought by the ASD students although the school's original director, Laurent Clerc, taught in LSF.[6]: 7[7]: 14 In fact, Clerc reported that he often learned the students' signs rather than conveying LSF:[7]: 14\n\n\n\n\n> I see, however, and I say it with regret, that any efforts that we have made or may still be making, to do better than, we have inadvertently fallen somewhat back of Abbé de l'Épée. Some of us have learned and still learn signs from uneducated pupils, instead of learning them from well instructed and experienced teachers.\n> \n> — Clerc, 1852, from Woodward 1978:336\n> \n\n\nIt has been proposed that ASL is a creole in which LSF is the superstrate language and the native village sign languages are substrate languages.[8]: 493 However, more recent research has shown that modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages.[8]: 501 ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but it is also possible that it was never a creole-type language.[8]: 501 There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination, such as the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. That might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology.[8]: 502 Additionally, Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.[8]: 497\n\n\nAlthough the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as a common oral and written language, ASL is not mutually intelligible with either British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan.[9]: 68 All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but that alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension.[9]: 68 It has been found that a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family.[9]: 69 However, that does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that the resemblance is caused by the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general as well as contact with English.[9]: 70\n\n\nAmerican Sign Language is growing in popularity in many states. Many high school and university students desire to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was usually not considered a creditable foreign language elective. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture, and they interact very differently when they talk. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are communicating. They also have their own sentence structure, which sets the language apart.[10]\n\n\nAmerican Sign Language is now being accepted by many colleges as a language eligible for foreign language course credit;[11] many states are making it mandatory to accept it as such.[12] In some states however, this is only true with regard to high school coursework.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![signing man sitting in the foreground, with a speaker standing at a podium in the background](image)A sign language interpreter at a presentation\nPrior to the birth of ASL, sign language had been used by various communities in the United States.[6]: 5 In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad hoc home sign, which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation.[6]: 5 As early as 1541 at first contact by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, there were reports that the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains widely spoke a sign language to communicate across vast national and linguistic lines.[13]: 80\n\n\nIn the 19th century, a \"triangle\" of village sign languages developed in New England: one in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts; one in Henniker, New Hampshire, and one in Sandy River Valley, Maine.[14] Martha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL), which was particularly important for the history of ASL, was used mainly in Chilmark, Massachusetts.[6]: 5–6 Due to intermarriage in the original community of English settlers of the 1690s, and the recessive nature of genetic deafness, Chilmark had a high 4% rate of genetic deafness.[6]: 5–6 MVSL was used even by hearing residents whenever a deaf person was present,[6]: 5–6 and also in some situations where spoken language would be ineffective or inappropriate, such as during church sermons or between boats at sea.[15]\n\n\nASL is thought to have originated in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.[6]: 4 Originally known as *The American Asylum, At Hartford, For The Education And Instruction Of The Deaf And Dumb*, the school was founded by the Yale graduate and divinity student Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet.[16][17] Gallaudet, inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young deaf girl Alice Cogswell, traveled to Europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from European institutions.[16] Ultimately, Gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the French Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, and convinced Laurent Clerc, an assistant to the school's founder Charles-Michel de l'Épée, to accompany him back to the United States.[16][b] Upon his return, Gallaudet founded the ASD on April 15, 1817.[16]\n\n\nThe largest group of students during the first seven decades of the school were from Martha's Vineyard, and they brought MVSL with them.[7]: 10 There were also 44 students from around Henniker, New Hampshire, and 27 from the Sandy River valley in Maine, each of which had their own village sign language.[7]: 11[c] Other students brought knowledge of their own home signs.[7]: 11 Laurent Clerc, the first teacher at ASD, taught using French Sign Language (LSF), which itself had developed in the Parisian school for the deaf established in 1755.[6]: 7 From that situation of language contact, a new language emerged, now known as ASL.[6]: 7\n\n\n\n![man standing on a stage in the foreground addressing a seated crowd](image)American Sign Language Convention of March 2008 in Austin, Texas\nMore schools for the deaf were founded after ASD, and knowledge of ASL spread to those schools.[6]: 7 In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL.[6]: 8 Societies such as the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country.[7]: 13 All of that contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.[7]: 14[7]: 12\n\n\nWhile oralism, an approach to educating deaf students focusing on oral language, had previously been used in American schools, the Milan Congress made it dominant and effectively banned the use of sign languages at schools in the United States and Europe. However, the efforts of Deaf advocates and educators, more lenient enforcement of the Congress's mandate, and the use of ASL in religious education and proselytism ensured greater use and documentation compared to European sign languages, albeit more influenced by fingerspelled loanwords and borrowed idioms from English as students were societally pressured to achieve fluency in spoken language.[20] Nevertheless, oralism remained the predominant method of deaf education up to the 1950s.[21] Linguists did not consider sign language to be true \"language\" but as something inferior.[21] Recognition of the legitimacy of ASL was achieved by William Stokoe, a linguist who arrived at Gallaudet University in 1955 when that was still the dominant assumption.[21] Aided by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, Stokoe argued for manualism, the use of sign language in deaf education.[21][22] Stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication, and even devised a transcription system for ASL.[21] In doing so, Stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics.[21] In the 1960s, ASL was sometimes referred to as \"Ameslan\", but that term is now considered obsolete.[23]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nCounting the number of ASL signers is difficult because ASL users have never been counted by the American census.[24]: 1[d] The ultimate source for current estimates of the number of ASL users in the United States is a report for the National Census of the Deaf Population (NCDP) by Schein and Delk (1974).[24]: 17 Based on a 1972 survey of the NCDP, Schein and Delk provided estimates consistent with a signing population between 250,000 and 500,000.[24]: 26 The survey did not distinguish between ASL and other forms of signing; in fact, the name \"ASL\" was not yet in widespread use.[24]: 18\n\n\nIncorrect figures are sometimes cited for the population of ASL users in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics.[24]: 20 Demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use ASL in the home.[24]: 21 That accounts for currently-cited estimations that are greater than 500,000; such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15,000,000.[24]: 1, 21 A 100,000-person lower bound has been cited for ASL users; the source of that figure is unclear, but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness, which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.[24]: 22\n\n\nASL is sometimes incorrectly cited as the third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States.[24]: 15, 22 Those figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population \"requiring an interpreter in court\".[24]: 15, 22 Although that would make ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English, it does not imply that it is the fourth-most-spoken language in the United States since speakers of other languages may also speak English.[24]: 21–22\n\n\n\n## Geographic distribution[edit]\n\n\nASL is used throughout Anglo-America.[7]: 12 That contrasts with Europe, where a variety of sign languages are used within the same continent.[7]: 12 The unique situation of ASL seems to have been caused by the proliferation of ASL through schools influenced by the American School for the Deaf, wherein ASL originated, and the rise of community organizations for the Deaf.[7]: 12–14\n\n\nThroughout West Africa, ASL-based sign languages are signed by educated Deaf adults.[25]: 410 Such languages, imported by boarding schools, are often considered by associations to be the official sign languages of their countries and are named accordingly, such as Nigerian Sign Language, Ghanaian Sign Language.[25]: 410 Such signing systems are found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo.[25]: 406 Due to lack of data, it is still an open question how similar those sign languages are to the variety of ASL used in America.[25]: 411\n\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned West African countries, ASL is reported to be used as a first language in Barbados, Bolivia, Cambodia[26] (alongside Cambodian Sign Language), the Central African Republic, Chad, China (Hong Kong), the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Jamaica, Kenya, Madagascar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Zimbabwe.[1] ASL is also used as a lingua franca throughout the deaf world, widely learned as a second language.[1]\n\n\n\n## Regional variation[edit]\n\n\n### Sign production[edit]\n\n\nSign production can often vary according to location. Signers from the South tend to sign with more flow and ease. Native signers from New York have been reported as signing comparatively quicker and sharper. Sign production of native Californian signers has also been reported as being fast. Research on that phenomenon often concludes that the fast-paced production for signers from the coasts could be due to the fast-paced nature of living in large metropolitan areas. That conclusion also supports how the ease with which Southern sign could be caused by the easygoing environment of the South in comparison to that of the coasts.[27]\n\n\nSign production can also vary depending on age and native language. For example, sign production of letters may vary in older signers. Slight differences in finger spelling production can be a signal of age. Additionally, signers who learned American Sign Language as a second language vary in production. For Deaf signers who learned a different sign language before learning American Sign Language, qualities of their native language may show in their ASL production. Some examples of that varied production include fingerspelling towards the body, instead of away from it, and signing certain movement from bottom to top, instead of top to bottom. Hearing people who learn American Sign Language also have noticeable differences in signing production. The most notable production difference of hearing people learning American Sign Language is their rhythm and arm posture.[28]\n\n\n\n### Sign variants[edit]\n\n\nMost popularly, there are variants of the signs for English words such as \"birthday\", \"pizza\", \"Halloween\", \"early\", and \"soon\", just a sample of the most commonly recognized signs with variants based on regional change. The sign for \"school\" is commonly varied between black and white signers; the variants used by black signers are sometimes called Black American Sign Language.[29] Social variation is also found between citation forms and forms used by Deaf gay men for words such as \"pain\" and \"protest\".[30]\n\n\n\n### History and implications[edit]\n\n\nThe prevalence of residential Deaf schools can account for much of the regional variance of signs and sign productions across the United States. Deaf schools often serve students of the state in which the school resides. That limited access to signers from other regions, combined with the residential quality of Deaf Schools promoted specific use of certain sign variants. Native signers did not have much access to signers from other regions during the beginning years of their education. It is hypothesized that because of that seclusion, certain variants of a sign prevailed over others due to the choice of variant used by the student of the school/signers in the community.\n\n\nHowever, American Sign Language does not appear to be vastly varied in comparison to other signed languages. That is because when Deaf education was beginning in the United States, many educators flocked to the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut, whose central location for the first generation of educators in Deaf education to learn American Sign Language allows ASL to be more standardized than its variant.[29]\n\n\n\n## Varieties[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Varieties of American Sign Language\n\nVariants of ABOUT in Canadian ASL\nAbout – General sign (Canadian ASL)[31]\nAbout – Atlantic Variation (Canadian ASL)[31]\nAbout – Ontario Variation (Canadian ASL)[31]\n\nVarieties of ASL are found throughout the world. There is little difficulty in comprehension among the varieties of the United States and Canada.[1]\n\n\n\n\n> Just as there are accents in speech, there are regional accents in sign. People from the South sign slower than people in the North—even people from northern and southern Indiana have different styles.\n> \n> — Walker, Lou Ann (1987). *A Loss for Words: The Story of Deafness in a Family*.

For example, an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.[32]\n\n\nThere is also a distinct variety of ASL used by the Black Deaf community.[1] Black ASL evolved as a result of racially segregated schools in some states, which included the residential schools for the deaf.[33]: 4 Black ASL differs from standard ASL in vocabulary, phonology, and some grammatical structure.[1][33]: 4 While African American English (AAE) is generally viewed as more innovating than standard English, Black ASL is more conservative than standard ASL, preserving older forms of many signs.[33]: 4 Black sign language speakers use more two-handed signs than in mainstream ASL, are less likely to show assimilatory lowering of signs produced on the forehead (e.g. KNOW) and use a wider signing space.[33]: 4 Modern Black ASL borrows a number of idioms from AAE; for instance, the AAE idiom \"I feel you\" is calqued into Black ASL.[33]: 10\n\n\nASL is used internationally as a lingua franca, and a number of closely related sign languages derived from ASL are used in many different countries.[1] Even so, there have been varying degrees of divergence from standard ASL in those imported ASL varieties. Bolivian Sign Language is reported to be a dialect of ASL, no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects.[34] On the other hand, it is also known that some imported ASL varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages. For example, Malaysian Sign Language, which has ASL origins, is no longer mutually comprehensible with ASL and must be considered its own language.[35] For some imported ASL varieties, such as those used in West Africa, it is still an open question how similar they are to American ASL.[25]: 411\n\n\nWhen communicating with hearing English speakers, ASL-speakers often use what is commonly called Pidgin Signed English (PSE) or 'contact signing', a blend of English structure with ASL vocabulary.[1][36] Various types of PSE exist, ranging from highly English-influenced PSE (practically relexified English) to PSE which is quite close to ASL lexically and grammatically, but may alter some subtle features of ASL grammar.[36] Fingerspelling may be used more often in PSE than it is normally used in ASL.[37] There have been some constructed sign languages, known as Manually Coded English (MCE), which match English grammar exactly and simply replace spoken words with signs; those systems are not considered to be varieties of ASL.[1][36]\n\n\nTactile ASL (TASL) is a variety of ASL used throughout the United States by and with the deaf-blind.[1] It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome.[1] It results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often grow up in the Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL.[38] TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of nonmanual signing.[1]\n\n\nASL changes over time and from generation to generation. The sign for telephone has changed as the shape of phones and the manner of holding them have changed.[39] The development of telephones with screens has also changed ASL, encouraging the use of signs that can be seen on small screens.[39]\n\n\n\n## Stigma[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, the White House published a response to a petition that gained over 37,000 signatures to *officially recognize American Sign Language as a community language and a language of instruction in schools*. The response is titled \"there shouldn't be any stigma about American Sign Language\" and addressed that ASL is a vital language for the Deaf and hard of hearing. Stigmas associated with sign languages and the use of sign for educating children often lead to the absence of sign during periods in children's lives when they can access languages most effectively.[40] Scholars such as Beth S. Benedict advocate not only for bilingualism (using ASL and English training) but also for early childhood intervention for children who are deaf. York University psychologist Ellen Bialystok has also campaigned for bilingualism, arguing that those who are bilingual acquire cognitive skills that may help to prevent dementia later in life.[41]\n\n\nMost children born to deaf parents are hearing.[42]: 192 Known as CODAs (\"Children Of Deaf Adults\"), they are often more culturally Deaf than deaf children, most of whom are born to hearing parents.[42]: 192 Unlike many deaf children, CODAs acquire ASL as well as Deaf cultural values and behaviors from birth.[42]: 192 Such bilingual hearing children may be mistakenly labeled as being \"slow learners\" or as having \"language difficulties\" because of preferential attitudes towards spoken language.[42]: 195\n\n\n\n## Writing systems[edit]\n\n\n![text written in Stokoe notation](image)The ASL phrase \"American Sign Language\", written in Stokoe notation\nAlthough there is no well-established writing system for ASL,[43] written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language seems to be that of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825.[44]: 153 However, written sign language remained marginal among the public.[44]: 154 In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text.[45] Stokoe used that system for his 1965 *A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles*.[46]\n\n\n\n![text written in Sutton SignWriting](image)The ASL phrase \"American Sign Language\", written in Sutton SignWriting\nSignWriting, proposed in 1974 by Valerie Sutton,[44]: 154 is the first writing system to gain use among the public and the first writing system for sign languages to be included in the Unicode Standard.[47] SignWriting consists of more than 5000 distinct iconic graphs/glyphs.[44]: 154 Currently, it is in use in many schools for the Deaf, particularly in Brazil, and has been used in International Sign forums with speakers and researchers in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Tunisia, and the United States. Sutton SignWriting has both a printed and an electronically produced form so that persons can use the system anywhere that oral languages are written (personal letters, newspapers, and media, academic research). The systematic examination of the International Sign Writing Alphabet (ISWA) as an equivalent usage structure to the International Phonetic Alphabet for spoken languages has been proposed.[48] According to some researchers, SignWriting is not a phonemic orthography and does not have a one-to-one map from phonological forms to written forms.[44]: 163 That assertion has been disputed, and the process for each country to look at the ISWA and create a phonemic/morphemic assignment of features of each sign language was proposed by researchers Msc. Roberto Cesar Reis da Costa and Madson Barreto in a thesis forum on June 23, 2014.[49] The SignWriting community has an open project on Wikimedia Labs to support the various Wikimedia projects on Wikimedia Incubator[50] and elsewhere involving SignWriting. The ASL Wikipedia request was marked as eligible in 2008[51] and the test ASL Wikipedia has 50 articles written in ASL using SignWriting.\n\n\nThe most widely used transcription system among academics is HamNoSys, developed at the University of Hamburg.[44]: 155 Based on Stokoe Notation, HamNoSys was expanded to about 200 graphs in order to allow transcription of any sign language.[44]: 155 Phonological features are usually indicated with single symbols, though the group of features that make up a handshape is indicated collectively with a symbol.[44]: 155\n\n\nSeveral additional candidates for written ASL have appeared over the years, including SignFont, ASL-phabet, and Si5s.\n\n\n\n![](image)Comparison of ASL writing systems: Sutton SignWriting, Si5s, Stokoe notation, SignFont, and ASLphabet\nFor English-speaking audiences, ASL is often glossed using English words. Such glosses are typically all-capitalized and are arranged in ASL order. For example, the ASL sentence *DOG NOW CHASE>IX=3 CAT*, meaning \"the dog is chasing the cat\", uses NOW to mark ASL progressive aspect and shows ASL verbal inflection for the third person (*>IX=3*). However, glossing is not used to write the language for speakers of ASL.[43]\n\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American Sign Language phonology\n\nDistinctive features in ASL\n![ASL sign for the number 2](image)\nPhonemic handshape /2/  \n[+ closed thumb][6]: 12\n![ASL sign for the number 3](image)\nPhonemic handshape /3/  \n[− closed thumb][6]: 12\n\nEach sign in ASL is composed of a number of distinctive components, generally referred to as parameters. A sign may use one hand or both. All signs can be described using the five parameters involved in signed languages, which are handshape, movement, palm orientation, location and nonmanual markers.[6]: 10 Just as phonemes of sound distinguish meaning in spoken languages, those parameters are the phonemes that distinguish meaning in signed languages like ASL.[52] Changing any one of them may change the meaning of a sign, as illustrated by the ASL signs THINK and DISAPPOINTED:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nTHINK[6]: 10\n| Handshape\n | Closed fist with index finger extended\n |\n| Orientation\n | Facing signer's body\n |\n| Location\n | Tip of finger in contact with forehead\n |\n| Movement\n | Unidirectional single contacting movement\n |\n\n | \n\nDISAPPOINTED[6]: 10\n| Handshape\n | (as for THINK)\n |\n| Orientation\n | (as for THINK)\n |\n| Location\n | Tip of finger in contact with chin\n |\n| Movement\n | (as for THINK)\n |\n\n |\n\n\nThere are also meaningful nonmanual signals in ASL,[6]: 49 which may include movement of the eyebrows, the cheeks, the nose, the head, the torso, and the eyes.[6]: 49\n\n\nWilliam Stokoe proposed that such components are analogous to the phonemes of spoken languages.[44]: 601:15[e] There has also been a proposal that they are analogous to classes like place and manner of articulation.[44]: 601:15 As in spoken languages, those phonological units can be split into distinctive features.[6]: 12 For instance, the handshapes /2/ and /3/ are distinguished by the presence or absence of the feature [± closed thumb], as illustrated to the right.[6]: 12 ASL has processes of allophony and phonotactic restrictions.[6]: 12, 19 There is ongoing research into whether ASL has an analog of syllables in spoken language.[6]: 1\n\n\n\n## Grammar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American Sign Language grammar\n\n![two men and a woman signing](image)Two men and a woman signing\n### Morphology[edit]\n\n\nASL has a rich system of verbal inflection, which involves both grammatical aspect: how the action of verbs flows in time—and agreement marking.[6]: 27–28 Aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb; for example, continuous aspect is marked by incorporating rhythmic, circular movement, while punctual aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so that it has a stationary hand position.[6]: 27–28 Verbs may agree with both the subject and the object, and are marked for number and reciprocity.[6]: 28 Reciprocity is indicated by using two one-handed signs; for example, the sign SHOOT, made with an L-shaped handshape with inward movement of the thumb, inflects to SHOOT[reciprocal], articulated by having two L-shaped hands \"shooting\" at each other.[6]: 29\n\n\nASL has a productive system of classifiers, which are used to classify objects and their movement in space.[6]: 26 For example, a rabbit running downhill would use a classifier consisting of a bent V classifier handshape with a downhill-directed path; if the rabbit is hopping, the path is executed with a bouncy manner.[6]: 26 In general, classifiers are composed of a \"classifier handshape\" bound to a \"movement root\".[6]: 26 The classifier handshape represents the object as a whole, incorporating such attributes as surface, depth, and shape, and is usually very iconic.[53] The movement root consists of a path, a direction and a manner.[6]: 26\n\n\nIn linguistics, there are two primary ways of changing the form of a word: derivation and inflection. Derivation involves creating new words by adding something to an existing word, while inflection involves changing the form of a word to convey grammatical information without altering its fundamental meaning or category.\n\n\nFor example, adding the suffix \"-ship\" to the noun \"friend\" creates the new word \"friendship\", which has a different meaning than the original word. Inflection, on the other hand, involves modifying a word's form to indicate grammatical features such as tense, number, gender, person, case, and degree of comparison.\n\n\nIn American Sign Language (ASL), inflection is conveyed through facial expressions, body movements, and other non-manual markers. For instance, to indicate past tense in ASL, one might sign the present tense of a verb (such as \"walk\"), and then add a facial expression and head tilt to signify that the action occurred in the past (i.e., \"walked\").\n\n\nWhile inflection does not change the basic meaning or category of a word, it does provide additional information that helps us better understand how the word is being used in a sentence. This is similar to how subtitles in a movie provide additional information without altering the content of the film itself.\n\n\nAccording to the book Linguistics of American Sign Language, ASL signs have two main components: hold segments and movement segments. Hold segments consist of hand-shape, location, orientation, and non-manual features, while movement segments possess similar features.\n\n\nMorphology is the study of how languages form words by using smaller units to construct larger units. The smallest meaningful unit in a language is known as a \"morpheme\", with some morphemes able to stand alone as independent units (free morphemes), while others must occur with other morphemes (bound morphemes).\n\n\nFor example, the plural \"-s\" and third person \"-s\" in English are bound morphemes. In ASL, the 3 handshape in signs like THREE-WEEKS and THREE-MONTHS are also bound morphemes.\n\n\nAffixes, which are morphemes added to words to create new words or modify their meanings, are part of the derivational process. For example, in English, prefixes like \"re-\" and suffixes like \"-able\" are affixes. In ASL, affixation can be used to modify the sign for CHAIR to indicate different types of chairs. The inflectional process, on the other hand, adds grammatical information to existing units.\n\n\nBy studying morphemes and how they can be combined or modified, linguists gain insight into the underlying structure of language and the creative ways in which it can be used to express meaning. Understanding morphology is essential to understanding how languages are built and how new signs or words can be formed.\n\n\nFurthermore, understanding morphology has practical applications in language learning and teaching. For example, teaching students the basic morphological structures of a language can help them to better understand the language's grammar and syntax, and can also aid in their acquisition of new vocabulary.\n\n\nIn summary, morphology is an essential component of language and provides valuable insights into the structure and function of languages. By understanding the morphological processes involved in language formation, we can gain a deeper understanding of how languages work and how they can be effectively taught and learned.\n\n\n\n#### Fingerspelling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fingerspelling\n\n![chart of letters in the American manual alphabet, with Latin script equivalents](image)The American manual alphabet and numbers\nASL possesses a set of 26 signs known as the American manual alphabet, which can be used to spell out words from the English language.[54] Such signs make use of the 19 handshapes of ASL. For example, the signs for 'p' and 'k' use the same handshape but different orientations. A common misconception is that ASL consists only of fingerspelling; although such a method (Rochester Method) has been used, it is not ASL.[37]\n\n\nFingerspelling is a form of borrowing, a linguistic process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another.[37] In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent.[37] There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. *O-N* from English 'on', and *A-P-T* from English 'apartment'.[37] Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.[37]\n\n\n\n### Syntax[edit]\n\n\nASL is a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but various phenomena affect that basic word order.[55] Basic SVO sentences are signed without any pauses:[29]\n\n\n\nFATHER\nLOVE\nCHILD\nFATHER LOVE CHILD\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[29]\n\nHowever, other word orders may also occur since ASL allows the topic of a sentence to be moved to sentence-initial position, a phenomenon known as topicalization.[56] In object–subject–verb (OSV) sentences, the object is topicalized, marked by a forward head-tilt and a pause:[57]\n\n\n\nCHILDtopic,\nFATHER\nLOVE\nCHILDtopic, FATHER LOVE\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[57]\n\nBesides, word orders can be obtained through the phenomenon of subject copy in which the subject is repeated at the end of the sentence, accompanied by head nodding for clarification or emphasis:[29]\n\n\n\nFATHER\nLOVE\nCHILD\nFATHERcopy\nFATHER LOVE CHILD FATHERcopy\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[29]\n\nASL also allows null subject sentences whose subject is implied, rather than stated explicitly. Subjects can be copied even in a null subject sentence, and the subject is then omitted from its original position, yielding a verb–object–subject (VOS) construction:[57]\n\n\n\nLOVE\nCHILD\nFATHERcopy\nLOVE CHILD FATHERcopy\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[57]\n\nTopicalization, accompanied with a null subject and a subject copy, can produce yet another word order, object–verb–subject (OVS).\n\n\n\nCHILDtopic,\nLOVE\nFATHERcopy\nCHILDtopic, LOVE FATHERcopy\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[57]\n\nThose properties of ASL allow it a variety of word orders, leading many to question which is the true, underlying, \"basic\" order. There are several other proposals that attempt to account for the flexibility of word order in ASL. One proposal is that languages like ASL are best described with a topic–comment structure whose words are ordered by their importance in the sentence, rather than by their syntactic properties.[58] Another hypothesis is that ASL exhibits free word order, in which syntax is not encoded in word order but can be encoded by other means such as head nods, eyebrow movement, and body position.[55]\n\n\n\n## Iconicity[edit]\n\n\nCommon misconceptions are that signs are iconically self-explanatory, that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime.[59] In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent because they were originally arbitrary symbols, or their iconicity has been obscured over time.[59] Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way.[60] That may be because the medium of sign, three-dimensional space, naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.[59]\n\n\nIn the era of the influential linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary.[60] Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat them as marginal exceptions.[61] ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges that theory.[62]\n\n\nResearch on acquisition of pronouns in ASL has shown that children do not always take advantage of the iconic properties of signs when they interpret their meaning.[63] It has been found that when children acquire the pronoun \"you\", the iconicity of the point (at the child) is often confused, being treated more like a name.[64] That is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition. It has also been found that iconicity of signs does not affect immediate memory and recall; less iconic signs are remembered just as well as highly-iconic signs.[65]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* American Sign Language grammar\n* American Sign Language literature\n* Baby sign language\n* Bimodal bilingualism\n* Great ape language, of which ASL has been one attempted mode\n* Legal recognition of sign languages\n* Pointing\n* Sign name\n* ASL interpreting\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In particular, Martha's Vineyard Sign Language, Henniker Sign Language, and Sandy River Valley Sign Language were brought to the school by students. They, in turn, appear to have been influenced by early British Sign Language and did not involve input from indigenous Native American sign systems. See Padden (2010:11), Lane, Pillard & French (2000:17), and Johnson & Schembri (2007:68).\n2. **^** The Abbé Charles-Michel de l'Épée, founder of the Parisian school Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, was the first to acknowledge that sign language could be used to educate the deaf. An oft-repeated folk tale states that while visiting a parishioner, Épee met two deaf daughters conversing with each other using LSF. The mother explained that her daughters were being educated privately by means of pictures. Épée is said to have been inspired by those deaf children when he established the first educational institution for the deaf.[18]\n3. **^** Whereas deafness was genetically recessive on Martha's Vineyard, it was dominant in Henniker. On the one hand, this dominance likely aided the development of sign language in Henniker since families would be more likely to have the critical mass of deaf people necessary for the propagation of signing. On the other hand, in Martha's Vineyard the deaf were more likely to have more hearing relatives, which may have fostered a sense of shared identity that led to more inter-group communication than in Henniker.[19]\n4. **^** Although some surveys of smaller scope measure ASL use, such as the California Department of Education recording ASL use in the home when children begin school, ASL use in the general American population has not been directly measured. See Mitchell et al. (2006:1).\n5. **^** Stokoe himself termed them cheremes, but other linguists have referred to them as phonemes.

ASL is a complete and organized visual language that is expressed by employing both manual and nonmanual features.[5] Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology.\n\n\nASL originated in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has been propagated widely by schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken. Reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults and other hearing individuals.\n\n\nASL signs have a number of phonemic components, such as movement of the face, the torso, and the hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime although iconicity plays a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object language. However, there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.\n\n\n\n\n## Classification[edit]\n\n\nTravis Dougherty explains and demonstrates the ASL alphabet. Voice-over interpretation by Gilbert G. Lensbower.\nASL emerged as a language in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded by Thomas Gallaudet in 1817,[6]: 7 which brought together Old French Sign Language, various village sign languages, and home sign systems. ASL was created in that situation by language contact.[7]: 11[a] ASL was influenced by its forerunners but distinct from all of them.[6]: 7\n\n\nThe influence of French Sign Language (LSF) on ASL is readily apparent; for example, it has been found that about 58% of signs in modern ASL are cognate to Old French Sign Language signs.[6]: 7[7]: 14 However, that is far less than the standard 80% measure used to determine whether related languages are actually dialects.[7]: 14 That suggests that nascent ASL was highly affected by the other signing systems brought by the ASD students although the school's original director, Laurent Clerc, taught in LSF.[6]: 7[7]: 14 In fact, Clerc reported that he often learned the students' signs rather than conveying LSF:[7]: 14\n\n\n\n\n> I see, however, and I say it with regret, that any efforts that we have made or may still be making, to do better than, we have inadvertently fallen somewhat back of Abbé de l'Épée. Some of us have learned and still learn signs from uneducated pupils, instead of learning them from well instructed and experienced teachers.\n> \n> — Clerc, 1852, from Woodward 1978:336\n> \n\n\nIt has been proposed that ASL is a creole in which LSF is the superstrate language and the native village sign languages are substrate languages.[8]: 493 However, more recent research has shown that modern ASL does not share many of the structural features that characterize creole languages.[8]: 501 ASL may have begun as a creole and then undergone structural change over time, but it is also possible that it was never a creole-type language.[8]: 501 There are modality-specific reasons that sign languages tend towards agglutination, such as the ability to simultaneously convey information via the face, head, torso, and other body parts. That might override creole characteristics such as the tendency towards isolating morphology.[8]: 502 Additionally, Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet may have used an artificially constructed form of manually coded language in instruction rather than true LSF.[8]: 497\n\n\nAlthough the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as a common oral and written language, ASL is not mutually intelligible with either British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan.[9]: 68 All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but that alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension.[9]: 68 It has been found that a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family.[9]: 69 However, that does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that the resemblance is caused by the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general as well as contact with English.[9]: 70\n\n\nAmerican Sign Language is growing in popularity in many states. Many high school and university students desire to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was usually not considered a creditable foreign language elective. ASL users, however, have a very distinct culture, and they interact very differently when they talk. Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are communicating. They also have their own sentence structure, which sets the language apart.[10]\n\n\nAmerican Sign Language is now being accepted by many colleges as a language eligible for foreign language course credit;[11] many states are making it mandatory to accept it as such.[12] In some states however, this is only true with regard to high school coursework.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![signing man sitting in the foreground, with a speaker standing at a podium in the background](image)A sign language interpreter at a presentation\nPrior to the birth of ASL, sign language had been used by various communities in the United States.[6]: 5 In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed ad hoc home sign, which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation.[6]: 5 As early as 1541 at first contact by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, there were reports that the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains widely spoke a sign language to communicate across vast national and linguistic lines.[13]: 80\n\n\nIn the 19th century, a \"triangle\" of village sign languages developed in New England: one in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts; one in Henniker, New Hampshire, and one in Sandy River Valley, Maine.[14] Martha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL), which was particularly important for the history of ASL, was used mainly in Chilmark, Massachusetts.[6]: 5–6 Due to intermarriage in the original community of English settlers of the 1690s, and the recessive nature of genetic deafness, Chilmark had a high 4% rate of genetic deafness.[6]: 5–6 MVSL was used even by hearing residents whenever a deaf person was present,[6]: 5–6 and also in some situations where spoken language would be ineffective or inappropriate, such as during church sermons or between boats at sea.[15]\n\n\nASL is thought to have originated in the American School for the Deaf (ASD), founded in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817.[6]: 4 Originally known as *The American Asylum, At Hartford, For The Education And Instruction Of The Deaf And Dumb*, the school was founded by the Yale graduate and divinity student Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet.[16][17] Gallaudet, inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young deaf girl Alice Cogswell, traveled to Europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from European institutions.[16] Ultimately, Gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the French Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, and convinced Laurent Clerc, an assistant to the school's founder Charles-Michel de l'Épée, to accompany him back to the United States.[16][b] Upon his return, Gallaudet founded the ASD on April 15, 1817.[16]\n\n\nThe largest group of students during the first seven decades of the school were from Martha's Vineyard, and they brought MVSL with them.[7]: 10 There were also 44 students from around Henniker, New Hampshire, and 27 from the Sandy River valley in Maine, each of which had their own village sign language.[7]: 11[c] Other students brought knowledge of their own home signs.[7]: 11 Laurent Clerc, the first teacher at ASD, taught using French Sign Language (LSF), which itself had developed in the Parisian school for the deaf established in 1755.[6]: 7 From that situation of language contact, a new language emerged, now known as ASL.[6]: 7\n\n\n\n![man standing on a stage in the foreground addressing a seated crowd](image)American Sign Language Convention of March 2008 in Austin, Texas\nMore schools for the deaf were founded after ASD, and knowledge of ASL spread to those schools.[6]: 7 In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL.[6]: 8 Societies such as the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country.[7]: 13 All of that contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.[7]: 14[7]: 12\n\n\nWhile oralism, an approach to educating deaf students focusing on oral language, had previously been used in American schools, the Milan Congress made it dominant and effectively banned the use of sign languages at schools in the United States and Europe. However, the efforts of Deaf advocates and educators, more lenient enforcement of the Congress's mandate, and the use of ASL in religious education and proselytism ensured greater use and documentation compared to European sign languages, albeit more influenced by fingerspelled loanwords and borrowed idioms from English as students were societally pressured to achieve fluency in spoken language.[20] Nevertheless, oralism remained the predominant method of deaf education up to the 1950s.[21] Linguists did not consider sign language to be true \"language\" but as something inferior.[21] Recognition of the legitimacy of ASL was achieved by William Stokoe, a linguist who arrived at Gallaudet University in 1955 when that was still the dominant assumption.[21] Aided by the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, Stokoe argued for manualism, the use of sign language in deaf education.[21][22] Stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication, and even devised a transcription system for ASL.[21] In doing so, Stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics.[21] In the 1960s, ASL was sometimes referred to as \"Ameslan\", but that term is now considered obsolete.[23]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nCounting the number of ASL signers is difficult because ASL users have never been counted by the American census.[24]: 1[d] The ultimate source for current estimates of the number of ASL users in the United States is a report for the National Census of the Deaf Population (NCDP) by Schein and Delk (1974).[24]: 17 Based on a 1972 survey of the NCDP, Schein and Delk provided estimates consistent with a signing population between 250,000 and 500,000.[24]: 26 The survey did not distinguish between ASL and other forms of signing; in fact, the name \"ASL\" was not yet in widespread use.[24]: 18\n\n\nIncorrect figures are sometimes cited for the population of ASL users in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics.[24]: 20 Demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use since adults who become deaf late in life rarely use ASL in the home.[24]: 21 That accounts for currently-cited estimations that are greater than 500,000; such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15,000,000.[24]: 1, 21 A 100,000-person lower bound has been cited for ASL users; the source of that figure is unclear, but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness, which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.[24]: 22\n\n\nASL is sometimes incorrectly cited as the third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States.[24]: 15, 22 Those figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population \"requiring an interpreter in court\".[24]: 15, 22 Although that would make ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English, it does not imply that it is the fourth-most-spoken language in the United States since speakers of other languages may also speak English.[24]: 21–22\n\n\n\n## Geographic distribution[edit]\n\n\nASL is used throughout Anglo-America.[7]: 12 That contrasts with Europe, where a variety of sign languages are used within the same continent.[7]: 12 The unique situation of ASL seems to have been caused by the proliferation of ASL through schools influenced by the American School for the Deaf, wherein ASL originated, and the rise of community organizations for the Deaf.[7]: 12–14\n\n\nThroughout West Africa, ASL-based sign languages are signed by educated Deaf adults.[25]: 410 Such languages, imported by boarding schools, are often considered by associations to be the official sign languages of their countries and are named accordingly, such as Nigerian Sign Language, Ghanaian Sign Language.[25]: 410 Such signing systems are found in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Nigeria, and Togo.[25]: 406 Due to lack of data, it is still an open question how similar those sign languages are to the variety of ASL used in America.[25]: 411\n\n\nIn addition to the aforementioned West African countries, ASL is reported to be used as a first language in Barbados, Bolivia, Cambodia[26] (alongside Cambodian Sign Language), the Central African Republic, Chad, China (Hong Kong), the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Jamaica, Kenya, Madagascar, the Philippines, Singapore, and Zimbabwe.[1] ASL is also used as a lingua franca throughout the deaf world, widely learned as a second language.[1]\n\n\n\n## Regional variation[edit]\n\n\n### Sign production[edit]\n\n\nSign production can often vary according to location. Signers from the South tend to sign with more flow and ease. Native signers from New York have been reported as signing comparatively quicker and sharper. Sign production of native Californian signers has also been reported as being fast. Research on that phenomenon often concludes that the fast-paced production for signers from the coasts could be due to the fast-paced nature of living in large metropolitan areas. That conclusion also supports how the ease with which Southern sign could be caused by the easygoing environment of the South in comparison to that of the coasts.[27]\n\n\nSign production can also vary depending on age and native language. For example, sign production of letters may vary in older signers. Slight differences in finger spelling production can be a signal of age. Additionally, signers who learned American Sign Language as a second language vary in production. For Deaf signers who learned a different sign language before learning American Sign Language, qualities of their native language may show in their ASL production. Some examples of that varied production include fingerspelling towards the body, instead of away from it, and signing certain movement from bottom to top, instead of top to bottom. Hearing people who learn American Sign Language also have noticeable differences in signing production. The most notable production difference of hearing people learning American Sign Language is their rhythm and arm posture.[28]\n\n\n\n### Sign variants[edit]\n\n\nMost popularly, there are variants of the signs for English words such as \"birthday\", \"pizza\", \"Halloween\", \"early\", and \"soon\", just a sample of the most commonly recognized signs with variants based on regional change. The sign for \"school\" is commonly varied between black and white signers; the variants used by black signers are sometimes called Black American Sign Language.[29] Social variation is also found between citation forms and forms used by Deaf gay men for words such as \"pain\" and \"protest\".[30]\n\n\n\n### History and implications[edit]\n\n\nThe prevalence of residential Deaf schools can account for much of the regional variance of signs and sign productions across the United States. Deaf schools often serve students of the state in which the school resides. That limited access to signers from other regions, combined with the residential quality of Deaf Schools promoted specific use of certain sign variants. Native signers did not have much access to signers from other regions during the beginning years of their education. It is hypothesized that because of that seclusion, certain variants of a sign prevailed over others due to the choice of variant used by the student of the school/signers in the community.\n\n\nHowever, American Sign Language does not appear to be vastly varied in comparison to other signed languages. That is because when Deaf education was beginning in the United States, many educators flocked to the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut, whose central location for the first generation of educators in Deaf education to learn American Sign Language allows ASL to be more standardized than its variant.[29]\n\n\n\n## Varieties[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Varieties of American Sign Language\n\nVariants of ABOUT in Canadian ASL\nAbout – General sign (Canadian ASL)[31]\nAbout – Atlantic Variation (Canadian ASL)[31]\nAbout – Ontario Variation (Canadian ASL)[31]\n\nVarieties of ASL are found throughout the world. There is little difficulty in comprehension among the varieties of the United States and Canada.[1]\n\n\n\n\n> Just as there are accents in speech, there are regional accents in sign. People from the South sign slower than people in the North—even people from northern and southern Indiana have different styles.\n> \n> — Walker, Lou Ann (1987). *A Loss for Words: The Story of Deafness in a Family*. New York: HarperPerennial. p. 31. ISBN 978-0-06-091425-7.\n> \n\n\nMutual intelligibility among those ASL varieties is high, and the variation is primarily lexical.[1] For example, there are three different words for English *about* in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario).[31] Variation may also be phonological, meaning that the same sign may be signed in a different way depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.[32]\n\n\nThere is also a distinct variety of ASL used by the Black Deaf community.[1] Black ASL evolved as a result of racially segregated schools in some states, which included the residential schools for the deaf.[33]: 4 Black ASL differs from standard ASL in vocabulary, phonology, and some grammatical structure.[1][33]: 4 While African American English (AAE) is generally viewed as more innovating than standard English, Black ASL is more conservative than standard ASL, preserving older forms of many signs.[33]: 4 Black sign language speakers use more two-handed signs than in mainstream ASL, are less likely to show assimilatory lowering of signs produced on the forehead (e.g. KNOW) and use a wider signing space.[33]: 4 Modern Black ASL borrows a number of idioms from AAE; for instance, the AAE idiom \"I feel you\" is calqued into Black ASL.[33]: 10\n\n\nASL is used internationally as a lingua franca, and a number of closely related sign languages derived from ASL are used in many different countries.[1] Even so, there have been varying degrees of divergence from standard ASL in those imported ASL varieties. Bolivian Sign Language is reported to be a dialect of ASL, no more divergent than other acknowledged dialects.[34] On the other hand, it is also known that some imported ASL varieties have diverged to the extent of being separate languages. For example, Malaysian Sign Language, which has ASL origins, is no longer mutually comprehensible with ASL and must be considered its own language.[35] For some imported ASL varieties, such as those used in West Africa, it is still an open question how similar they are to American ASL.[25]: 411\n\n\nWhen communicating with hearing English speakers, ASL-speakers often use what is commonly called Pidgin Signed English (PSE) or 'contact signing', a blend of English structure with ASL vocabulary.[1][36] Various types of PSE exist, ranging from highly English-influenced PSE (practically relexified English) to PSE which is quite close to ASL lexically and grammatically, but may alter some subtle features of ASL grammar.[36] Fingerspelling may be used more often in PSE than it is normally used in ASL.[37] There have been some constructed sign languages, known as Manually Coded English (MCE), which match English grammar exactly and simply replace spoken words with signs; those systems are not considered to be varieties of ASL.[1][36]\n\n\nTactile ASL (TASL) is a variety of ASL used throughout the United States by and with the deaf-blind.[1] It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome.[1] It results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often grow up in the Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL.[38] TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate for the lack of nonmanual signing.[1]\n\n\nASL changes over time and from generation to generation. The sign for telephone has changed as the shape of phones and the manner of holding them have changed.[39] The development of telephones with screens has also changed ASL, encouraging the use of signs that can be seen on small screens.[39]\n\n\n\n## Stigma[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, the White House published a response to a petition that gained over 37,000 signatures to *officially recognize American Sign Language as a community language and a language of instruction in schools*. The response is titled \"there shouldn't be any stigma about American Sign Language\" and addressed that ASL is a vital language for the Deaf and hard of hearing. Stigmas associated with sign languages and the use of sign for educating children often lead to the absence of sign during periods in children's lives when they can access languages most effectively.[40] Scholars such as Beth S. Benedict advocate not only for bilingualism (using ASL and English training) but also for early childhood intervention for children who are deaf. York University psychologist Ellen Bialystok has also campaigned for bilingualism, arguing that those who are bilingual acquire cognitive skills that may help to prevent dementia later in life.[41]\n\n\nMost children born to deaf parents are hearing.[42]: 192 Known as CODAs (\"Children Of Deaf Adults\"), they are often more culturally Deaf than deaf children, most of whom are born to hearing parents.[42]: 192 Unlike many deaf children, CODAs acquire ASL as well as Deaf cultural values and behaviors from birth.[42]: 192 Such bilingual hearing children may be mistakenly labeled as being \"slow learners\" or as having \"language difficulties\" because of preferential attitudes towards spoken language.[42]: 195\n\n\n\n## Writing systems[edit]\n\n\n![text written in Stokoe notation](image)The ASL phrase \"American Sign Language\", written in Stokoe notation\nAlthough there is no well-established writing system for ASL,[43] written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language seems to be that of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825.[44]: 153 However, written sign language remained marginal among the public.[44]: 154 In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text.[45] Stokoe used that system for his 1965 *A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles*.[46]\n\n\n\n![text written in Sutton SignWriting](image)The ASL phrase \"American Sign Language\", written in Sutton SignWriting\nSignWriting, proposed in 1974 by Valerie Sutton,[44]: 154 is the first writing system to gain use among the public and the first writing system for sign languages to be included in the Unicode Standard.[47] SignWriting consists of more than 5000 distinct iconic graphs/glyphs.[44]: 154 Currently, it is in use in many schools for the Deaf, particularly in Brazil, and has been used in International Sign forums with speakers and researchers in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Tunisia, and the United States. Sutton SignWriting has both a printed and an electronically produced form so that persons can use the system anywhere that oral languages are written (personal letters, newspapers, and media, academic research). The systematic examination of the International Sign Writing Alphabet (ISWA) as an equivalent usage structure to the International Phonetic Alphabet for spoken languages has been proposed.[48] According to some researchers, SignWriting is not a phonemic orthography and does not have a one-to-one map from phonological forms to written forms.[44]: 163 That assertion has been disputed, and the process for each country to look at the ISWA and create a phonemic/morphemic assignment of features of each sign language was proposed by researchers Msc. Roberto Cesar Reis da Costa and Madson Barreto in a thesis forum on June 23, 2014.[49] The SignWriting community has an open project on Wikimedia Labs to support the various Wikimedia projects on Wikimedia Incubator[50] and elsewhere involving SignWriting. The ASL Wikipedia request was marked as eligible in 2008[51] and the test ASL Wikipedia has 50 articles written in ASL using SignWriting.\n\n\nThe most widely used transcription system among academics is HamNoSys, developed at the University of Hamburg.[44]: 155 Based on Stokoe Notation, HamNoSys was expanded to about 200 graphs in order to allow transcription of any sign language.[44]: 155 Phonological features are usually indicated with single symbols, though the group of features that make up a handshape is indicated collectively with a symbol.[44]: 155\n\n\nSeveral additional candidates for written ASL have appeared over the years, including SignFont, ASL-phabet, and Si5s.\n\n\n\n![](image)Comparison of ASL writing systems: Sutton SignWriting, Si5s, Stokoe notation, SignFont, and ASLphabet\nFor English-speaking audiences, ASL is often glossed using English words. Such glosses are typically all-capitalized and are arranged in ASL order. For example, the ASL sentence *DOG NOW CHASE>IX=3 CAT*, meaning \"the dog is chasing the cat\", uses NOW to mark ASL progressive aspect and shows ASL verbal inflection for the third person (*>IX=3*). However, glossing is not used to write the language for speakers of ASL.[43]\n\n\n\n## Phonology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American Sign Language phonology\n\nDistinctive features in ASL\n![ASL sign for the number 2](image)\nPhonemic handshape /2/  \n[+ closed thumb][6]: 12\n![ASL sign for the number 3](image)\nPhonemic handshape /3/  \n[− closed thumb][6]: 12\n\nEach sign in ASL is composed of a number of distinctive components, generally referred to as parameters. A sign may use one hand or both. All signs can be described using the five parameters involved in signed languages, which are handshape, movement, palm orientation, location and nonmanual markers.[6]: 10 Just as phonemes of sound distinguish meaning in spoken languages, those parameters are the phonemes that distinguish meaning in signed languages like ASL.[52] Changing any one of them may change the meaning of a sign, as illustrated by the ASL signs THINK and DISAPPOINTED:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\nTHINK[6]: 10\n| Handshape\n | Closed fist with index finger extended\n |\n| Orientation\n | Facing signer's body\n |\n| Location\n | Tip of finger in contact with forehead\n |\n| Movement\n | Unidirectional single contacting movement\n |\n\n | \n\nDISAPPOINTED[6]: 10\n| Handshape\n | (as for THINK)\n |\n| Orientation\n | (as for THINK)\n |\n| Location\n | Tip of finger in contact with chin\n |\n| Movement\n | (as for THINK)\n |\n\n |\n\n\nThere are also meaningful nonmanual signals in ASL,[6]: 49 which may include movement of the eyebrows, the cheeks, the nose, the head, the torso, and the eyes.[6]: 49\n\n\nWilliam Stokoe proposed that such components are analogous to the phonemes of spoken languages.[44]: 601:15[e] There has also been a proposal that they are analogous to classes like place and manner of articulation.[44]: 601:15 As in spoken languages, those phonological units can be split into distinctive features.[6]: 12 For instance, the handshapes /2/ and /3/ are distinguished by the presence or absence of the feature [± closed thumb], as illustrated to the right.[6]: 12 ASL has processes of allophony and phonotactic restrictions.[6]: 12, 19 There is ongoing research into whether ASL has an analog of syllables in spoken language.[6]: 1\n\n\n\n## Grammar[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American Sign Language grammar\n\n![two men and a woman signing](image)Two men and a woman signing\n### Morphology[edit]\n\n\nASL has a rich system of verbal inflection, which involves both grammatical aspect: how the action of verbs flows in time—and agreement marking.[6]: 27–28 Aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb; for example, continuous aspect is marked by incorporating rhythmic, circular movement, while punctual aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so that it has a stationary hand position.[6]: 27–28 Verbs may agree with both the subject and the object, and are marked for number and reciprocity.[6]: 28 Reciprocity is indicated by using two one-handed signs; for example, the sign SHOOT, made with an L-shaped handshape with inward movement of the thumb, inflects to SHOOT[reciprocal], articulated by having two L-shaped hands \"shooting\" at each other.[6]: 29\n\n\nASL has a productive system of classifiers, which are used to classify objects and their movement in space.[6]: 26 For example, a rabbit running downhill would use a classifier consisting of a bent V classifier handshape with a downhill-directed path; if the rabbit is hopping, the path is executed with a bouncy manner.[6]: 26 In general, classifiers are composed of a \"classifier handshape\" bound to a \"movement root\".[6]: 26 The classifier handshape represents the object as a whole, incorporating such attributes as surface, depth, and shape, and is usually very iconic.[53] The movement root consists of a path, a direction and a manner.[6]: 26\n\n\nIn linguistics, there are two primary ways of changing the form of a word: derivation and inflection. Derivation involves creating new words by adding something to an existing word, while inflection involves changing the form of a word to convey grammatical information without altering its fundamental meaning or category.\n\n\nFor example, adding the suffix \"-ship\" to the noun \"friend\" creates the new word \"friendship\", which has a different meaning than the original word. Inflection, on the other hand, involves modifying a word's form to indicate grammatical features such as tense, number, gender, person, case, and degree of comparison.\n\n\nIn American Sign Language (ASL), inflection is conveyed through facial expressions, body movements, and other non-manual markers. For instance, to indicate past tense in ASL, one might sign the present tense of a verb (such as \"walk\"), and then add a facial expression and head tilt to signify that the action occurred in the past (i.e., \"walked\").\n\n\nWhile inflection does not change the basic meaning or category of a word, it does provide additional information that helps us better understand how the word is being used in a sentence. This is similar to how subtitles in a movie provide additional information without altering the content of the film itself.\n\n\nAccording to the book Linguistics of American Sign Language, ASL signs have two main components: hold segments and movement segments. Hold segments consist of hand-shape, location, orientation, and non-manual features, while movement segments possess similar features.\n\n\nMorphology is the study of how languages form words by using smaller units to construct larger units. The smallest meaningful unit in a language is known as a \"morpheme\", with some morphemes able to stand alone as independent units (free morphemes), while others must occur with other morphemes (bound morphemes).\n\n\nFor example, the plural \"-s\" and third person \"-s\" in English are bound morphemes. In ASL, the 3 handshape in signs like THREE-WEEKS and THREE-MONTHS are also bound morphemes.\n\n\nAffixes, which are morphemes added to words to create new words or modify their meanings, are part of the derivational process. For example, in English, prefixes like \"re-\" and suffixes like \"-able\" are affixes. In ASL, affixation can be used to modify the sign for CHAIR to indicate different types of chairs. The inflectional process, on the other hand, adds grammatical information to existing units.\n\n\nBy studying morphemes and how they can be combined or modified, linguists gain insight into the underlying structure of language and the creative ways in which it can be used to express meaning. Understanding morphology is essential to understanding how languages are built and how new signs or words can be formed.\n\n\nFurthermore, understanding morphology has practical applications in language learning and teaching. For example, teaching students the basic morphological structures of a language can help them to better understand the language's grammar and syntax, and can also aid in their acquisition of new vocabulary.\n\n\nIn summary, morphology is an essential component of language and provides valuable insights into the structure and function of languages. By understanding the morphological processes involved in language formation, we can gain a deeper understanding of how languages work and how they can be effectively taught and learned.\n\n\n\n#### Fingerspelling[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fingerspelling\n\n![chart of letters in the American manual alphabet, with Latin script equivalents](image)The American manual alphabet and numbers\nASL possesses a set of 26 signs known as the American manual alphabet, which can be used to spell out words from the English language.[54] Such signs make use of the 19 handshapes of ASL. For example, the signs for 'p' and 'k' use the same handshape but different orientations. A common misconception is that ASL consists only of fingerspelling; although such a method (Rochester Method) has been used, it is not ASL.[37]\n\n\nFingerspelling is a form of borrowing, a linguistic process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another.[37] In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent.[37] There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. *O-N* from English 'on', and *A-P-T* from English 'apartment'.[37] Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.[37]\n\n\n\n### Syntax[edit]\n\n\nASL is a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but various phenomena affect that basic word order.[55] Basic SVO sentences are signed without any pauses:[29]\n\n\n\nFATHER\nLOVE\nCHILD\nFATHER LOVE CHILD\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[29]\n\nHowever, other word orders may also occur since ASL allows the topic of a sentence to be moved to sentence-initial position, a phenomenon known as topicalization.[56] In object–subject–verb (OSV) sentences, the object is topicalized, marked by a forward head-tilt and a pause:[57]\n\n\n\nCHILDtopic,\nFATHER\nLOVE\nCHILDtopic, FATHER LOVE\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[57]\n\nBesides, word orders can be obtained through the phenomenon of subject copy in which the subject is repeated at the end of the sentence, accompanied by head nodding for clarification or emphasis:[29]\n\n\n\nFATHER\nLOVE\nCHILD\nFATHERcopy\nFATHER LOVE CHILD FATHERcopy\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[29]\n\nASL also allows null subject sentences whose subject is implied, rather than stated explicitly. Subjects can be copied even in a null subject sentence, and the subject is then omitted from its original position, yielding a verb–object–subject (VOS) construction:[57]\n\n\n\nLOVE\nCHILD\nFATHERcopy\nLOVE CHILD FATHERcopy\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[57]\n\nTopicalization, accompanied with a null subject and a subject copy, can produce yet another word order, object–verb–subject (OVS).\n\n\n\nCHILDtopic,\nLOVE\nFATHERcopy\nCHILDtopic, LOVE FATHERcopy\n\n\"The father loves the child.\"[57]\n\nThose properties of ASL allow it a variety of word orders, leading many to question which is the true, underlying, \"basic\" order. There are several other proposals that attempt to account for the flexibility of word order in ASL. One proposal is that languages like ASL are best described with a topic–comment structure whose words are ordered by their importance in the sentence, rather than by their syntactic properties.[58] Another hypothesis is that ASL exhibits free word order, in which syntax is not encoded in word order but can be encoded by other means such as head nods, eyebrow movement, and body position.[55]\n\n\n\n## Iconicity[edit]\n\n\nCommon misconceptions are that signs are iconically self-explanatory, that they are a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime.[59] In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent because they were originally arbitrary symbols, or their iconicity has been obscured over time.[59] Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way.[60] That may be because the medium of sign, three-dimensional space, naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.[59]\n\n\nIn the era of the influential linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, it was assumed that the mapping between form and meaning in language must be completely arbitrary.[60] Although onomatopoeia is a clear exception, since words like 'choo-choo' bear clear resemblance to the sounds that they mimic, the Saussurean approach was to treat them as marginal exceptions.[61] ASL, with its significant inventory of iconic signs, directly challenges that theory.[62]\n\n\nResearch on acquisition of pronouns in ASL has shown that children do not always take advantage of the iconic properties of signs when they interpret their meaning.[63] It has been found that when children acquire the pronoun \"you\", the iconicity of the point (at the child) is often confused, being treated more like a name.[64] That is a similar finding to research in oral languages on pronoun acquisition. It has also been found that iconicity of signs does not affect immediate memory and recall; less iconic signs are remembered just as well as highly-iconic signs.[65]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* American Sign Language grammar\n* American Sign Language literature\n* Baby sign language\n* Bimodal bilingualism\n* Great ape language, of which ASL has been one attempted mode\n* Legal recognition of sign languages\n* Pointing\n* Sign name\n* ASL interpreting\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In particular, Martha's Vineyard Sign Language, Henniker Sign Language, and Sandy River Valley Sign Language were brought to the school by students. They, in turn, appear to have been influenced by early British Sign Language and did not involve input from indigenous Native American sign systems. See Padden (2010:11), Lane, Pillard & French (2000:17), and Johnson & Schembri (2007:68).\n2. **^** The Abbé Charles-Michel de l'Épée, founder of the Parisian school Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, was the first to acknowledge that sign language could be used to educate the deaf. An oft-repeated folk tale states that while visiting a parishioner, Épee met two deaf daughters conversing with each other using LSF. The mother explained that her daughters were being educated privately by means of pictures. Épée is said to have been inspired by those deaf children when he established the first educational institution for the deaf.[18]\n3. **^** Whereas deafness was genetically recessive on Martha's Vineyard, it was dominant in Henniker. On the one hand, this dominance likely aided the development of sign language in Henniker since families would be more likely to have the critical mass of deaf people necessary for the propagation of signing. On the other hand, in Martha's Vineyard the deaf were more likely to have more hearing relatives, which may have fostered a sense of shared identity that led to more inter-group communication than in Henniker.[19]\n4. **^** Although some surveys of smaller scope measure ASL use, such as the California Department of Education recording ASL use in the home when children begin school, ASL use in the general American population has not been directly measured. See Mitchell et al. (2006:1).\n5. **^** Stokoe himself termed them cheremes, but other linguists have referred to them as phonemes. See Bahan (1996:11).\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** American Sign Language at *Ethnologue* (25th ed., 2022) ![Closed access icon](image)\n2. **^** Province of Ontario (2007). \"Bill 213: An Act to recognize sign language as an official language in Ontario\".
