It was originally classified as the ninth planet but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\nSo technically only two current planets (Uranus and Neptune) were discovered after 1700, since Pluto is now classified as a dwarf planet. All the other planets in our solar system (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) were known since ancient times and were visible to the naked eye.\n\nThe discoveries of Uranus and Neptune represented major milestones in astronomy - Uranus was the first planet discovered using a telescope, while Neptune was the first planet discovered through mathematical prediction rather than direct observation. These discoveries helped validate Newton's theory of gravity and demonstrated the power of mathematical astronomy to predict the existence of previously unknown celestial objects.", "question": "Which planets in our solar system were discovered after 1700, and who discovered them?", "log_dir": "/mnt/nlpgpu-io1/data/andrz/redel/experiments/fanoutqa/claude/baseline/b3b15d0277166b1d"}

{"id": "05451952c20e474b", "answer": "Based on the research, here are the key inventors of these five important 20th-century inventions:\n\n1. Airplane: Orville and Wilbur Wright invented and flew the first successful powered, controlled aircraft. On December 17, 1903, they made their historic first flight in the Wright Flyer at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The Wright brothers developed the key principles of aircraft control and made the first sustained flights in a heavier-than-air powered aircraft.\n\n2. Internet: Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are considered the primary inventors of the Internet through their development of the TCP/IP protocol suite in the 1970s. While working at DARPA, they created the fundamental communication protocol of the Internet that allowed different computer networks to interconnect and communicate with each other. They are often called \"the fathers of the Internet\" for this groundbreaking work.\n\n3. Personal Computer: While many contributed to early personal computing, the IBM PC released in 1981 established the dominant standard for personal computers. The project was led by Don Estridge at IBM, though it built on earlier innovations. The first complete personal computer for consumers was arguably the Altair 8800 (1975) by Ed Roberts and MITS, which helped launch the personal computer revolution. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak's Apple II (1977) was also a landmark machine that helped establish the personal computer market.\n\n4. Mobile Phone: Martin Cooper of Motorola is credited with inventing the first handheld cellular phone and making the first mobile phone call in 1973. While working at Motorola, Cooper led the team that developed the Motorola DynaTAC, the first commercially available cellular phone, which was released in 1983. Cooper is often called \"the father of the cell phone\" for this achievement.\n\n5. Digital Camera: Steven Sasson invented the first portable digital camera while working at Kodak in 1975. His prototype was the first self-contained digital camera that could capture images electronically. While earlier digital imaging systems existed, Sasson's device was the first handheld digital camera, weighing 8 pounds and capturing black and white images at 0.01 megapixels. He received a patent for this invention in 1978, laying the groundwork for modern digital photography.\n\nThese", "question": "Identify the inventors of five key 20th-century inventions: the airplane, the internet, the personal computer, the mobile phone, and the digital camera.", "log_dir": "/mnt/nlpgpu-io1/data/andrz/redel/experiments/fanoutqa/claude/baseline/05451952c20e474b"}

{"id": "3e4646288bdb81ab", "answer": "Based on the information from the search results, I can tell you that since 1900, ALL earthquakes of magnitude 9.0 or greater have been megathrust earthquakes. These megathrust earthquakes occur at convergent plate boundaries and are the planet's most powerful earthquakes.\n\nFurthermore, the search results indicate that these megathrust earthquakes typically generate tsunamis. This is because these earthquakes occur at the bottom of oceanic trenches and can abruptly displace the sea floor over a large area. The tsunamis generated by these megathrust earthquakes are often more destructive than the earthquakes themselves, and can even cross ocean basins to cause destruction far from the original earthquake location (these are called teletsunamis).\n\nSo to directly answer your question: 100% of earthquakes with magnitude 9.0 or greater since 1900 have been megathrust earthquakes, and these are typically associated with tsunamis due to their location under the ocean floor and their mechanism of displacing large areas of the seafloor.\n\nSome notable examples mentioned in the text include:\n- The 1960 Valdivia earthquake (magnitude 9.5, largest recorded)\n- The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\n- The 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake (magnitude 9.1)\n- The 1964 Alaska earthquake (magnitude 9.2, largest in North America)", "question": "What percent of earthquakes with at least 9.0 magnitude were associated with tsunamis?", "log_dir": "/mnt/nlpgpu-io1/data/andrz/redel/experiments/fanoutqa/claude/baseline/3e4646288bdb81ab"}
