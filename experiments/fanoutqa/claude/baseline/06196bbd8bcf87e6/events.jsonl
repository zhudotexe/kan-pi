Throughout her career, Minaj's outspoken views, social media disputes and her fanbase have received significant media coverage.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\n### 1982–2003: Early life[edit]\n\n\nOnika Tanya Maraj was born on December 8, 1982,[12][13] in the Saint James district of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.[14][15] Her father was Robert Maraj (1956–2021),[16] a financial executive and part-time gospel singer of Dougla (Afro-Trinidadian mother and Indo-Trinidadian father) descent.[13] Her mother, Carol, is also a gospel singer with Afro-Trinidadian ancestry.[17] Carol worked in payroll and accounting departments during Minaj's youth.[18][19] Minaj's father was addicted to alcohol and crack cocaine[20] and had a violent temper, burning down their house in December 1987.[21] She has an older brother named Jelani,[22] a younger brother named Micaiah,[23] and a younger sister named Ming.[24]\n\n\nAs a child, Minaj and Jelani grew up with their grandmother in Saint James in a household with 11 cousins.[21] Carol was working numerous jobs in Saint James before getting her green card at the age of 24. She then moved to the Bronx in New York to attend Monroe College, leaving both Minaj and Jelani in Trinidad with their grandmother. Eventually, when Minaj was five, Carol got her first house, on 147th Street in South Jamaica, Queens and brought both Minaj and Jelani to live with her and their father.[21] Minaj recalled, \"I don't think I had a lot of discipline in my household. My mom motivated me, but it wasn't a strict household. I kind of wanted a strict household.\"[25] Minaj successfully auditioned for admission to Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, which focuses on visual and performing arts.[14] After graduation, Minaj wanted to become an actress, and she was cast in the Off-Broadway play *In Case You Forget* in 2001.[26]\n\n\nMinaj has revealed that she had an abortion as a teenager in her songs \"All Things Go\" and \"Autobiography\". She has said that although it has \"haunted\" her, she stands by her decision.[27] At the age of 19, as she struggled with her acting career, she worked as a waitress at a Red Lobster in the Bronx, but was fired for discourtesy to customers.[28] She said she was fired from \"at least 15 jobs\" for similar reasons.[29] Other jobs included customer service representative and office management on Wall Street. Minaj recalls buying a BMW as a 19-year-old with the money from waitressing.[30]\n\n\n\n### 2004–2009: Career beginnings and mixtapes[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Playtime Is Over (mixtape), Sucka Free, and Beam Me Up Scotty (mixtape)\n\nMinaj briefly signed with Brooklyn group Full Force, in which she rapped in a quartet called the Hoodstars composed of Lou$tar (son of \"Bowlegged Lou\"), Safaree Samuels (Scaff Beezy) and 7even Up.[31][32] In 2004, the group recorded the entrance song for WWE Diva Victoria, \"Don't Mess With\", which was featured on the compilation album *ThemeAddict: WWE The Music, Vol.6*. Minaj later left Full Force and uploaded songs on her Myspace profile, sending several of her songs to people in the music industry. Later, Fendi, CEO of Brooklyn label Dirty Money Entertainment, signed Minaj to his label in 2007 under a 180-day contract.[33] Originally adopting the stage name Nicki Maraj, she eventually changed it to Nicki Minaj stating that \"my real name is Maraj. Fendi flipped it when he met me because I had such a nasty flow!\"[34]\n\n\nMinaj released her first mixtape, *Playtime Is Over*, on July 5, 2007,[35] and her second, *Sucka Free*, on April 12, 2008.[36] She released her third mixtape, *Beam Me Up Scotty*, on April 18, 2009;[37] it received favorable coverage on BET and MTV.[38][39] At the time, she was managed by Debra Antney. One of its tracks, \"I Get Crazy\", reached number 20 on the U.S. *Billboard* Hot Rap Songs chart and number 37 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.[40] After Minaj was discovered by fellow rapper Lil Wayne,[41] she signed a recording contract with his Young Money Entertainment.[42] That November, she appeared with Gucci Mane and Trina on the remix of \"5 Star Bitch\" by Yo Gotti.[43]\n\n\nIn early February 2010, Minaj made her first two appearances on the U.S *Billboard* Hot 100 chart with her features on \"Knockout\" and \"Up Out My Face\" by Lil Wayne and Mariah Carey respectively.[44][45] Minaj also appeared on \"BedRock\" and \"Roger That\" on the compilation album, *We Are Young Money* (2009).[46][47] The singles peaked at numbers two and 56, respectively, in the U.S. Their parent album reached number nine on the U.S. *Billboard* 200, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[48][49] At Jay-Z's suggestion, Robin Thicke featured Minaj on his single \"Shakin' It 4 Daddy\".[50] Allison Stewart of *The Washington Post* stated that, during that time, she \"became the go-to girl for artists who wanted to add some skank to their tracks without sullying themselves in the process\".[51] Minaj became the first female solo artist to have seven singles simultaneously charting in the U.S.[52]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2011: Breakthrough with *Pink Friday*[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pink Friday\n![](image)Minaj performing in 2010\nOn March 29, 2010, Minaj released \"Massive Attack\" featuring Sean Garrett.[53] Intended as the lead single from her forthcoming debut album, *Pink Friday*, the song was dropped from the album due to poor commercial performance.[54][55] The next single, \"Your Love\", later became the album's lead single.[56] Released in June, it peaked at number 14 on the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100 and number one on the Rap Songs chart.[40] In September, Minaj released \"Check It Out\" featuring will.i.am and \"Right Thru Me\" as follow-up singles.[57][58][59]\n\n\nIn October, Minaj was featured on Kanye West's \"Monster\", a posse cut with Jay-Z and Rick Ross featuring vocals from Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. Her verse received widespread acclaim with many critics regarding it as the best verse on that song. *Complex* rated Minaj's \"Monster\" verse as the number-one best rap verse in the past five years,[60] while Sean Fennessey of *The Village Voice* stated that \"Monster\" was \"the track that announced Minaj's \"brilliance\" to most people.\"[61] Shortly after, she performed \"Monster\" with West and Jay-Z at Yankee Stadium, becoming the first ever female rapper to perform there. In November 2010, Minaj received her first Grammy Award nomination for her guest verse on Ludacris' song \"My Chick Bad\".[62]\n\n\n*Pink Friday* was released on November 19, 2010, debuting at number two and later reaching number one on the *Billboard* 200, with first-week sales of 375,000 copies.[63][64] It had the highest sales week for a female rap album this century and second highest sales week overall after Lauryn Hill's *The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill* (1998). Upon release, the album received generally positive reviews from critics.[65] The album was certified platinum in December, with it becoming the first album by a solo female rapper to go platinum in seven years.[66][67] \"Moment 4 Life\" featuring Drake was released as the fourth single from *Pink Friday* shortly after the album's release.[68] The song served as the third single off the album, released as a single on December 7, 2010. Minaj performed \"Right Thru Me\" and \"Moment 4 Life\" as the musical guest on the January 29, 2011, episode of *Saturday Night Live*.[69]\n\n\n\"Super Bass\", the album's fifth single, was released in April 2011.[70] It became a sleeper hit and commercially successful, ultimately peaking at number three in the U.S. and was eventually certified diamond in the U.S.[40][71] Super Bass was the highest charting solo single by a female rapper since Missy Elliott's \"Work It\" in 2002.

However, she eventually stated in a 2010 *Rolling Stone* interview, \"I think girls are sexy, but I'm not going to lie and say that I date girls.\"[74] She once again addressed her sexuality in 2020 on Doja Cat's \"Say So\" remix. The lyrics divided members of the LGBT community, with some accusing her of \"bisexual erasure\" while others voicing there is nothing wrong with originally identifying as bisexual, and then later identifying as straight.[75][76]\n\n\nMinaj was one of the opening acts on Britney Spears' 2011 Femme Fatale Tour.[77] She and Kesha appeared on the remix of Spears' \"Till the World Ends\", which peaked at number three in the U.S.[78] On August 7, 2011, Nicki experienced a wardrobe malfunction during a live performance on *Good Morning America* when she revealed her left nipple. Both ABC and Minaj apologized for the incident, with Minaj denying it was a publicity stunt.[79][80] Minaj continued to perform at high-profile events throughout 2011 with Donatella Versace inviting her to perform with Prince for the introduction of a Versace collection for H&M. She also performed \"Super Bass\" at the 2011 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.[81] In July 2011, her cousin Nicholas Telemaque was murdered near his home in Brooklyn, an incident she later references in her songs \"All Things Go\" and \"Champion\".[82] In December 2011, Minaj was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist and Best Rap Album for *Pink Friday*.[83] Also that year, she won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Hip-Hop Video for \"Super Bass\", marking her first VMA win.[84]\n\n\n\n### 2012–2013: *Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded* and *American Idol*[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded and Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded – The Re-Up\n![](image)Minaj performing in the Hammersmith Apollo during 2012\n\"Starships\" was released in February 2012 as the lead single from Minaj's forthcoming second album, *Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded*.[85] The song reached number five on the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100,[40] and went on to become the fifth best-selling single of 2012.[86] Her crossover into pop music was criticized by some, despite her commercial success.[87] Follow-up singles \"Beez in the Trap\" featuring 2 Chainz and \"Right by My Side\" featuring Chris Brown were released shortly after.[88][89]\n\n\n*Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded* was eventually released on April 2, 2012, two months later than initially planned.[90] It was preceded by the promotional singles \"Roman in Moscow\" and \"Stupid Hoe\".[91][92] The album debuted at number one on the *Billboard* 200, with first-week sales of 253,000 copies, and was certified two-times platinum by the RIAA in March 2016.[64][93] However, the mix of hip-hop songs and mainstream pop material received mixed reviews.[94] \"Pound the Alarm\" and \"Va Va Voom\" were later released as the final singles from the album.[95][96] Minaj along with fellow rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform the single, \"Give Me All Your Luvin\" during the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012.[97] Minaj was the first solo female rapper to perform at the Grammy Awards, performing \"Roman Holiday\" during the 2012 ceremony on February 12.[98] Her exorcism-themed performance was controversial, with the American Catholic League and its president criticizing her performance.[99][100][101]\n\n\nMinaj began her headlining Pink Friday Tour on May 16, 2012, which was followed by the Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour beginning October 14, 2012.[102][103] Although she was scheduled to headline the June 3 Hot 97 Summer Jam at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, at the request of Lil Wayne she canceled her appearance the day of the show after Peter Rosenberg of the station dismissed her single \"Starships\" as \"not real hip-hop\".[104] The following month, she voiced Steffie in the animated film *Ice Age: Continental Drift* (2012).[105] Minaj won awards for Best Female Video (for \"Starships\") at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards and Best Hip-Hop at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards.[106]\n\n\nAn expanded version of *Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded*, subtitled *The Re-Up*, was released on November 19, 2012, with seven new songs.[107] That month, she was the subject of a three-part E! documentary titled *Nicki Minaj: My Truth*.[108] In September, Minaj joined the judges' panel for the twelfth season of *American Idol* with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban, and Randy Jackson.[109] Throughout the show there were disagreements between Carey and Minaj, with both of them leaving the series at the end of the season.[110][111][112][113]\n\n\n\n### 2014–2017: *The Pinkprint* and acting ventures[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: The Pinkprint\n\nMinaj's first live-action theatrical film *The Other Woman* was filmed in spring 2013 and premiered on April 25, 2014.[114] In late 2014, Minaj separated from her longtime boyfriend Safaree Samuels, whom she had dated since 2003.[b] According to Minaj, he had proposed to her, but she declined.[115] Several tracks on her forthcoming third album, *The Pinkprint*, are believed to have been heavily inspired by the end of their relationship.

Petty had been convicted of attempted rape in New York and had served nearly four years in prison for it.[199][200][201] For this new charge, he was sentenced to one year of house arrest and a fine of $55,000 USD in 2022.[202]\n\n\n\n### 2020–2021: *Beam Me Up Scotty* re-release, and lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Beam Me Up Scotty (mixtape)\n\nIn January 2020, Minaj was featured on \"Nice to Meet Ya\" by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor.[203][204] In February, she released a standalone song called \"Yikes\" as a promotional single.[205][206] By the end of that month, Minaj appeared as a guest judge on the twelfth season's premiere of the reality television show *RuPaul's Drag Race*.[207][208] In May, fellow rapper Doja Cat announced a collaboration with Minaj on two remixes of her song \"Say So\". The remix later debuted at number one on the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100, becoming both Minaj and Doja Cat's first single to reach number one in the U.S. It became the all-female collaboration that had reached number one in the U.S. since \"Fancy\" by Australian rapper Iggy Azalea featuring English singer Charli XCX did it in 2014.[209] It marked the first time that a song by two female rappers reached the top, for which Guinness World Records later gave them an award.[210][211] A month later, she released a collaboration with 6ix9ine called \"Trollz\", which debuted at number one in the U.S. becoming her second number one single.[212] This made her the first female rapper to debut at number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100 since Lauryn Hill did so in 1998 with \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\".[213]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Minaj announced via Instagram that she was expecting her first child.[214] She gave birth to a son on September 30, whom she refers to publicly as \"Papa Bear\".

Polevich was arraigned and charged with two felonies, which were leaving scene of incident involving death of a person and tampering with or suppressing physical evidence.[227] Three months later, she commented on her father's death in a letter, saying, \"[...] it has been the most devastating loss of my life. I find myself wanting to call him all the time, more so now that he's gone. [...] May his soul rest in paradise. He was very loved & will be very missed.\"[228]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Minaj released a reissue of her mixtape *Beam Me Up Scotty* (2009), including new songs previously unavailable on streaming services. The reissue debuted at number two on the U.S. *Billboard* 200, which gave it the highest debut for a female rap mixtape in the U.S.[229][230] A song from the reissue, titled \"Seeing Green\" featuring fellow *Young Money* rappers Drake and Lil Wayne reached number twelve in the U.S. In July, Minaj collaborated with fellow rapper Bia on the remix of her song *Whole Lotta Money*. In August, her husband's victim (named Jennifer Hough) filed a lawsuit against Minaj and her husband Kenneth Petty for alleged harassment and intimidation. She later gave an interview about the accusations on the daytime talk show *The Real*.[199][231] While Minaj has not publicly commented on the lawsuit, she addressed the accusations in a case filing.[232] Hough later voluntarily dropped the case against Minaj, with her lawyers claiming \"jurisdictional issues\" and telling a judge that it was going to be refiled in California.[233][234] Minaj's lawyer countered their claims, saying that the refiling was a \"frivolous gambit to avoid sanctions\" and that \"their claims received an aggressive response.\"[234]\n\n\nIn September, Minaj collaborated with English singer-songwriter Elton John's fifth collaboration album *The Lockdown Sessions* (2021). She appeared on the song \"Always Love You\" with John and rapper Young Thug.[235] Later that month, she split with her previous manager Irving Azoff and is now being managed by Wassim Slaiby, also known by his management company SALXCO, who is best known for managing The Weeknd and Doja Cat.[236] English singer Jesy Nelson released her solo debut, called \"Boyz\", which Minaj features on.

No disrespect to New York rappers, but I don't want people to hear me and know exactly where I'm from.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Minaj on her rapping style in a *Billboard* interview[29]\n\nMinaj is known for her animated rapping style and \"unique\" flow.[306] Her rapping is distinctive for its speed and the use of alter egos and accents, primarily British cockney.[307][308] She often both sings and raps in her songs, and has made use of metaphors, punch lines, and word play. The alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, \"[Minaj] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill vocal delivery. She kind of reminds me of a female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions.\"[309]\n\n\nJon Caramanica of *The New York Times* called Minaj \"a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones.\"[308] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: \"What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention.\"[310] Robby Seabrook III of XXL included Minaj in list of \"most unique flows from rappers over the last five years\", saying that she \"has solidified her spot as a leader of the pack for her animated flows, inspiring many other women in hip-hop to play with their vocals. She goes from campy to bellicose, excited to eccentric, oftentimes all on one song.\"[311]\n\n\nNoted as a rap artist, she also occasionally lends herself to electronic music genres (especially electropop).[312] *Pink Friday* marked her exploration of the genres, spawning electro songs including the pop-laden \"Super Bass\".[313][314] Also combining rap with synthesizer music, Minaj's second album, *Pink Friday Roman Reloaded*, had a number of electro-hop and electro pop songs: \"HOV Lane\", \"Whip It\", \"Automatic\", \"Come on a Cone\", \"Young Forever\", \"Fire Burns\",[315] \"Roman Holiday\",[316] \"The Boys\" and \"Beez in the Trap\";[317] while \"Starships\" is a eurodance song.[318]\n\n\nHer verse on Kanye West's \"Monster\" was critically acclaimed and contributed greatly to her popularity; many critics said she had the best verse in the song.[319][320] West claimed at one point he considered deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:\n\n\n\n\n> It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of 'Monster' because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on *Dark Fantasy* and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse'. So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment…[321] \n> \n> \n\n\nTara Colley of *The Conversation* described Minaj as a \"pre-eminent female rapper\" and that she has \"consistently straddled the distinct personas of gangsta boss and sexy pop siren without truly committing to either\" and that \"her chameleonic ability\" matches \"some of rap's most verbose, witty, filthy and pop-friendly\" stars such as Eminem and Lil Wayne.[322] Zoe Johnson of *XXL*, stated that in recent years Minaj's \"beat selection has moved to refined production full of grit and hip-hop flare in recent years\".[323]\n\n\n\n### Alter egos[edit]\n\n\n\"Roman Zolanski\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Roman Polanski.\n\nWith her parents frequently fighting during her childhood, Minaj lived through characters she created as a means of escape. She recalled that \"fantasy was my reality\" and her first identity was Cookie, who became Harajuku Barbie and (later) Nicki Minaj.[324] In November 2010, Minaj assumed the alter ego Nicki Teresa, wearing a colorful headdress and calling herself \"healer to her fans\" during a visit to the Garden of Dreams Foundation at Fuse Studios in New York.[325] She introduced another alter ego, Rosa (pronounced with an exaggerated *R*), to commemorate her December 2010 appearance on *Lopez Tonight*.[326]\n\n\nOne of Minaj's most well-known alter-egos is \"a demon inside her\" named Roman Zolanski (named after film director Roman Polanski with modified surname), Minaj's \"twin brother\", whose character she assumes when she is angry.[327] Roman has been compared to Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, and on \"Roman's Revenge\" Minaj and Eminem collaborate as their alter egos.[328] On her next album, she said that there would be a lot of Roman: \"And if you're not familiar with Roman, then you will be familiar with him very soon. He's the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot.\"[329] Roman has a mother, Martha Zolanski,[330] who appeared on \"Roman's Revenge\" with a British accent[331] and singing on \"Roman Holiday\" for the first time.[332][333] Martha appeared in the \"Moment 4 Life\" video as Minaj's apparent fairy godmother.[327]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAccording to Minaj, rappers Jay-Z (left), Foxy Brown (center) and Lil Wayne (right) are her three biggest influences.\n\nMinaj cites Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown, and Jay-Z as major influences: \"I can't even imagine my career, my creative spirit without Wayne [...] I feel like I'm still intertwined with him creatively\". Minaj has called Lil Wayne her mentor and credited him with discovering her.[334][335] On Foxy Brown and Jay-Z, Minaj said: \"I really loved [Foxy] as a female rapper. I was really interested in her mind and her aura [and] I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me and my friends in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in our conversations all the time.\"[336]\n\n\nShe said, further: \"I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life\" adding that Foxy Brown was \"the most influential female rapper\" for her.[337] Minaj said in a *T Magazine* interview in 2017: \"Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown... [...] Those are the three I keep in my head when I'm writing because they've influenced me so much, [...] I feel like I'm a part of all of them.\"[338]\n\n\nJada Pinkett Smith is one of Minaj's role models in her acting career.[339] Minaj was inspired by R&B singer Monica, singing \"Why I Love You So Much\" at every talent show she entered. While performing in Atlanta as part of her Pink Friday Tour, she called Monica one of her all-time greatest musical influences. Lauryn Hill is also one of Minaj's major influences, with Minaj quoting her lyrics in a high school yearbook.[340][341] Minaj has also cited Beyoncé,[342][343] Marilyn Monroe,[344] Madonna,[345] Enya,[346] Eminem,[347] Kanye West, Trina, Drake,[348] Lil' Kim,[349][350][351] Lisa Left Eye Lopes,[352] Janet Jackson,[353] Grace Jones,[354][355] Remy Ma and Missy Elliott as influences.[356]\n\n\nShe called Betsey Johnson a fashion inspiration: \"[Betsey] is a free spirit. When I met her the other day, I felt like I knew her for my whole life. She's so warm and considerate and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [I was] bowing down to her; she's dope!\"[357] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: \"When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, you have to get your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me.\"[358]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n![An Afro-American woman in a blonde wig and bright teal eyeshadow wears a shirt constructed of variously colored cotton balls](image)Early in her career, Minaj often wore colorful costumes, cosmetics, and wigs.\n*Billboard* listed Minaj the fourth-most-active musician on social media on its March 2011 Social 50 chart.[359] Minaj is also the most followed rapper on Instagram with over 200 million followers, the first to surpass that number, as well as one of the most followed female musicians on the social media platform.[360][361] On Twitter, she is one of the most followed rappers, with over 27 million followers on the app, as of July 2023.[362][363] She joined *American Idol* as a judge in 2013.[364][365] BET has named Minaj as a \"gay icon\".[366] Minaj was a vocal proponent of streams counting towards an artist's RIAA certifications. The organization later announced in 2016 that it would be modernizing the certification process for albums, including on-demand audio and video streams, as reported by *Yahoo! News*.[367][368]\n\n\nMinaj has been called as a \"fashion icon\" by *Allure*, *Time*, *XXL* and has been called a \"camp style icon\" by Refinery29.[369][370][371][372] She has cited Alexander McQueen, Gianni Versace, and Christian Louboutin as her favorite designers.[373] *The Huffington Post* described her style as \"risk-taking\" and \"far-out\", with \"bold sartorial choices\";[374] Minaj has been included on the annual *Maxim* Hot 100 list several times.[375][376] In 2014, Minaj underwent a reinvention in her image sporting a \"natural\" and \"softer\" look, wearing fewer wigs and less colourful costumes.[377] She stated that she \"went so far to the other side that there's only one place to go from there. You can either continue doing costumes or you can just say, \"Hey guess what? This will shock them even more. Doing nothing will shock them even more\"\".[377][378]\n\n\nHer physique, notably her buttocks, has attracted significant attention from the media.[379][380] Early in her career, she made autographing breasts part of her movement to empower women.[381] In 2010, she said that although she originally felt obligated to mimic the provocative behavior of the \"female rappers of [her] day\", she intended to subdue her sexuality because she \"[wants] people—especially young girls—to know that in life, nothing is going to be based on sex appeal. You've got to have something else to go with that.\"[382][383]\n\n\nMinaj talked about feminism in an interview with *Vogue* in 2015, saying \"There are things that I do that feminists don't like, and there are things that I do that they do like. I don't label myself. I just say the truth about what I feel. I feel like women can do anything that they put their minds to.\"[384] In 2018, an interview with *Elle*, in which she discussed sex workers, her own sex appeal, and sexuality in music and on social media, attracted criticism.[385][386] In *The New York Times Magazine*, music critic Vanessa Grigoriadis said that Minaj \"has become expert at modelling the ways that women can wield power in the industry.

She became an intricate lyricist. She became a thoughtful singer. She became a risky performer. She invented new personae. More than any other rapper in the mainstream, she pushed hard against expectations ... with no one around to compare herself to, or for others to compare her to, she became her own watermark.\"[450]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2014, *NPR*'s Erik Nielson said that Minaj's \"success over the last decade has stood as an exception to the unwritten rule that women rappers no longer have a place among elite artists\".[451] *Nylon* writer, Demicia Inman, also credited Minaj for her influence which \"stands as one of the most successful rappers of the millennium\", also going on to say that Minaj \"battled misogyny and industry bias against black women to carve her own identity and sound\" thus impacting her career. *Complex* also commented that, \"From her bold outfits to her multi-colored wigs, Minaj oozed confidence that inspired others who were watching closely...

Often referred to as the \"Queen of Rap\", she is known for her musical versatility, animated flow in her rapping, alter egos, and influence in popular music. She first gained recognition after releasing three mixtapes between 2007 and 2009. \n\n\nMinaj's debut album, *Pink Friday* (2010), topped the US *Billboard* 200 chart; its single \"Super Bass\" reached number three on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart and was certified diamond by the RIAA. Follow-up album *Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded* (2012) explored dance-pop and debuted atop the *Billboard* 200, with its lead single \"Starships\" peaking in the top five of charts internationally. Her third album, *The Pinkprint* (2014), explored personal topics and marked a return to her hip hop roots. Its lead single \"Anaconda\" peaked at number two on the Hot 100 and became the first music video by a solo female rapper to reach one billion views on YouTube. Minaj released her fourth album *Queen* in 2018, which spawned the US top ten single \"Chun-Li\". In 2019, her collaboration with Karol G, \"Tusa\", became the longest-running number-one single on the Argentina Hot 100 chart. Minaj has been featured on various songs and achieved her first two Hot 100 number-one singles in 2020 with the collaborations \"Say So\" (with Doja Cat) and \"Trollz\" (with 6ix9ine). In 2022, she achieved her first solo number-one with \"Super Freaky Girl\", the lead single from her upcoming fifth studio album *Pink Friday 2* (2023).[6]\n\n\nMinaj is one of the best-selling music artists, with more than 100 million records sold worldwide.[7] *Billboard* ranked her as the top selling female rapper of the 2010s and one of the greatest rappers of all time.[8][9] She has twenty-three top 10 singles in the US, the most for any female rapper, with six of those being solo songs. Her various accolades include eight American Music Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards (including the 2022 Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award), twelve BET Awards, four *Billboard* Music Awards, a Brit Award, three Guinness World Records and twelve Grammy nominations. Outside of music, her film and television career has included voice roles in the animated films *Ice Age: Continental Drift* (2012) and *The Angry Birds Movie 2* (2019), supporting roles in the films *The Other Woman* (2014) and *Barbershop: The Next Cut* (2016) and being an *American Idol* judge. In 2016, *Time* included her on their annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. Throughout her career, Minaj's outspoken views, social media disputes and her fanbase have received significant media coverage.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\n### 1982–2003: Early life[edit]\n\n\nOnika Tanya Maraj was born on December 8, 1982,[12][13] in the Saint James district of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago.[14][15] Her father was Robert Maraj (1956–2021),[16] a financial executive and part-time gospel singer of Dougla (Afro-Trinidadian mother and Indo-Trinidadian father) descent.[13] Her mother, Carol, is also a gospel singer with Afro-Trinidadian ancestry.[17] Carol worked in payroll and accounting departments during Minaj's youth.[18][19] Minaj's father was addicted to alcohol and crack cocaine[20] and had a violent temper, burning down their house in December 1987.[21] She has an older brother named Jelani,[22] a younger brother named Micaiah,[23] and a younger sister named Ming.[24]\n\n\nAs a child, Minaj and Jelani grew up with their grandmother in Saint James in a household with 11 cousins.[21] Carol was working numerous jobs in Saint James before getting her green card at the age of 24. She then moved to the Bronx in New York to attend Monroe College, leaving both Minaj and Jelani in Trinidad with their grandmother. Eventually, when Minaj was five, Carol got her first house, on 147th Street in South Jamaica, Queens and brought both Minaj and Jelani to live with her and their father.[21] Minaj recalled, \"I don't think I had a lot of discipline in my household. My mom motivated me, but it wasn't a strict household. I kind of wanted a strict household.\"[25] Minaj successfully auditioned for admission to Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, which focuses on visual and performing arts.[14] After graduation, Minaj wanted to become an actress, and she was cast in the Off-Broadway play *In Case You Forget* in 2001.[26]\n\n\nMinaj has revealed that she had an abortion as a teenager in her songs \"All Things Go\" and \"Autobiography\". She has said that although it has \"haunted\" her, she stands by her decision.[27] At the age of 19, as she struggled with her acting career, she worked as a waitress at a Red Lobster in the Bronx, but was fired for discourtesy to customers.[28] She said she was fired from \"at least 15 jobs\" for similar reasons.[29] Other jobs included customer service representative and office management on Wall Street. Minaj recalls buying a BMW as a 19-year-old with the money from waitressing.[30]\n\n\n\n### 2004–2009: Career beginnings and mixtapes[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Playtime Is Over (mixtape), Sucka Free, and Beam Me Up Scotty (mixtape)\n\nMinaj briefly signed with Brooklyn group Full Force, in which she rapped in a quartet called the Hoodstars composed of Lou$tar (son of \"Bowlegged Lou\"), Safaree Samuels (Scaff Beezy) and 7even Up.[31][32] In 2004, the group recorded the entrance song for WWE Diva Victoria, \"Don't Mess With\", which was featured on the compilation album *ThemeAddict: WWE The Music, Vol.6*. Minaj later left Full Force and uploaded songs on her Myspace profile, sending several of her songs to people in the music industry.

It became the first solo song by a female rapper to debut at number one in the U.S. in 22 years, after fellow rapper Lauryn Hill's song \"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" also debuted at number one in 1998.[274] In August 2022, Minaj released a compilation album called *Queen Radio: Volume 1* with one new track, \"Likkle Miss (Remix)\" with Skeng.[275] In September 2022, Minaj released a remix of \"Super Freaky Girl\" called \"Queen Mix\", which features 5 other female rappers: JT, BIA, Katie Got Bandz, Akbar V, and Maliibu Miitch.[276]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Yung Bleu released his single \"Love in the Way\" featuring Minaj with video released on September 19.[277] In October 2022, Minaj and Skeng released a remix of \"Likkle Miss\" called \"THE FINE NINE REMIX\" featuring Spice, Destra Garcia, Patrice Roberts, Lady Leshurr, Pamputtae, Dovey Magnum, Lisa Mercedez, and London Hill.[278] In October 2022, rapper YoungBoy Never Broke Again released a collaboration with Minaj titled \"I Admit\".[279] In November 2022, Minaj collaborated with Lebanese singer Myriam Fares and Colombian singer Maluma on \"Tukoh Taka\" which was the official FIFA Fan Festival anthem.[280]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2023, Minaj released \"Red Ruby da Sleeze\" as a promotional single from her upcoming album. Her first solo single since \"Super Freaky Girl\" (2022), the song's music video was filmed during the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival.[281][282] The song samples Lumidee's 2003 single \"Never Leave You (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh)\".[283] It debuted and peaked at number thirteen on the *Billboard* Hot 100 while hitting number one on the U.S. Digital Song Sales and Hot Rap Songs charts.[284] On March 5, Minaj appeared as a surprise performer during Lil Wayne's set at the 2023 Rolling Loud California festival.[285] In April 2023, Minaj featured on \"WTF,\" the lead single from YoungBoy Never Broke Again's third studio album, *Don't Try This At Home*.[286] She teamed up with Ice Spice on the remix to the latter's song \"Princess Diana\", released on April 14, 2023—the first ever release on Minaj's record label, Heavy On It.[287][288] The remix became the first collaboration between two women to top the Hot Rap Songs chart, and made Minaj the woman with the most number-ones on the chart (10). It peaked at number four on the Hot 100 and atop Digital Song Sales chart.[289] Minaj's next collaboration was German singer Kim Petras's \"Alone\", released on April 21. It samples \"Better Off Alone\" (1999) by Alice Deejay.[290] The single reached the top-40 in the United Kingdom.[291] In May, she featured on \"Pound Town 2\", the remix to St. Louis rapper Sexyy Red and Tay Keith's single, \"Pound Town\".[292] It reached the summit of the Digital Songs chart.[293]\n\n\nOn June 5, 2023, Minaj announced via Twitter that her fifth studio album would be released on October 20, 2023.[294] On June 30, she announced the album's title, *Pink Friday 2*, via her social media, and that the release date was rescheduled to November 17.[295] The album was ultimately pushed back to December 8, 2023.[296] The rapper assured fans that the record will be \"well worth the wait\", and followed up by a concert tour in 2024.[297]\n\n\nAlso in June, she and Ice Spice released their second collaboration, \"Barbie World\" with europop band Aqua, off the *Barbie* film soundtrack. The song samples Aqua's 1997 single, \"Barbie Girl\". Peaking at number seven on the Hot 100 and atop Digital Song Sales, it extended her record as the female rapper with the most US top-tens (23) and number-ones on the latter chart (16).[298] Minaj made guest appearances on Young Thug and Lil Uzi Vert's albums, *Business Is Business* and *Pink Tape*, on the tracks: \"Money\" with the late Juice Wrld,[299] and the US top-20 \"Endless Fashion\".[300][301] \"Last Time I Saw You\" was released on September 1 as the second single from *Pink Friday 2*. It made Minaj the act with the most number-ones (25) on the R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales, surpassing Drake; and extended her record as the woman with the most top-tens (43) on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.[302][302] With the 2023 MTV Europe Music Awards, she became the first black artist and female rapper to win Best US Act in the award show's history.[303] In support of *Pink Friday 2*, Minaj will embark on the Pink Friday 2 World Tour in early 2024.[304]\n\n\nIn March 2024, Minaj will headline day one of Rolling Loud California 2024 in Inglewood.[305]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Musical style[edit]\n\n\n> \n> When I started rapping, people were trying to make me like the typical New York rapper, but I'm not that. No disrespect to New York rappers, but I don't want people to hear me and know exactly where I'm from.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Minaj on her rapping style in a *Billboard* interview[29]\n\nMinaj is known for her animated rapping style and \"unique\" flow.[306] Her rapping is distinctive for its speed and the use of alter egos and accents, primarily British cockney.[307][308] She often both sings and raps in her songs, and has made use of metaphors, punch lines, and word play. The alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, \"[Minaj] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill vocal delivery. She kind of reminds me of a female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions.\"[309]\n\n\nJon Caramanica of *The New York Times* called Minaj \"a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones.\"[308] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: \"What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap that anyone could hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention.\"[310] Robby Seabrook III of XXL included Minaj in list of \"most unique flows from rappers over the last five years\", saying that she \"has solidified her spot as a leader of the pack for her animated flows, inspiring many other women in hip-hop to play with their vocals. She goes from campy to bellicose, excited to eccentric, oftentimes all on one song.\"[311]\n\n\nNoted as a rap artist, she also occasionally lends herself to electronic music genres (especially electropop).[312] *Pink Friday* marked her exploration of the genres, spawning electro songs including the pop-laden \"Super Bass\".[313][314] Also combining rap with synthesizer music, Minaj's second album, *Pink Friday Roman Reloaded*, had a number of electro-hop and electro pop songs: \"HOV Lane\", \"Whip It\", \"Automatic\", \"Come on a Cone\", \"Young Forever\", \"Fire Burns\",[315] \"Roman Holiday\",[316] \"The Boys\" and \"Beez in the Trap\";[317] while \"Starships\" is a eurodance song.[318]\n\n\nHer verse on Kanye West's \"Monster\" was critically acclaimed and contributed greatly to her popularity; many critics said she had the best verse in the song.[319][320] West claimed at one point he considered deleting her verse from the track, because he was worried it would outshine his own work:\n\n\n\n\n> It was like that moment when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of 'Monster' because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip Hop album of all time or arguably top ten albums of all time. And I would do all that work, eight months of work on *Dark Fantasy* and people to this day would say to me 'My favorite thing was Nicki Minaj's verse'. So if I let my ego get the best of me instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform to be all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment…[321] \n> \n> \n\n\nTara Colley of *The Conversation* described Minaj as a \"pre-eminent female rapper\" and that she has \"consistently straddled the distinct personas of gangsta boss and sexy pop siren without truly committing to either\" and that \"her chameleonic ability\" matches \"some of rap's most verbose, witty, filthy and pop-friendly\" stars such as Eminem and Lil Wayne.[322] Zoe Johnson of *XXL*, stated that in recent years Minaj's \"beat selection has moved to refined production full of grit and hip-hop flare in recent years\".[323]\n\n\n\n### Alter egos[edit]\n\n\n\"Roman Zolanski\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Roman Polanski.\n\nWith her parents frequently fighting during her childhood, Minaj lived through characters she created as a means of escape. She recalled that \"fantasy was my reality\" and her first identity was Cookie, who became Harajuku Barbie and (later) Nicki Minaj.[324] In November 2010, Minaj assumed the alter ego Nicki Teresa, wearing a colorful headdress and calling herself \"healer to her fans\" during a visit to the Garden of Dreams Foundation at Fuse Studios in New York.[325] She introduced another alter ego, Rosa (pronounced with an exaggerated *R*), to commemorate her December 2010 appearance on *Lopez Tonight*.[326]\n\n\nOne of Minaj's most well-known alter-egos is \"a demon inside her\" named Roman Zolanski (named after film director Roman Polanski with modified surname), Minaj's \"twin brother\", whose character she assumes when she is angry.[327] Roman has been compared to Eminem's alter ego Slim Shady, and on \"Roman's Revenge\" Minaj and Eminem collaborate as their alter egos.[328] On her next album, she said that there would be a lot of Roman: \"And if you're not familiar with Roman, then you will be familiar with him very soon. He's the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay and he'll be on there a lot.\"[329] Roman has a mother, Martha Zolanski,[330] who appeared on \"Roman's Revenge\" with a British accent[331] and singing on \"Roman Holiday\" for the first time.[332][333] Martha appeared in the \"Moment 4 Life\" video as Minaj's apparent fairy godmother.[327]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAccording to Minaj, rappers Jay-Z (left), Foxy Brown (center) and Lil Wayne (right) are her three biggest influences.\n\nMinaj cites Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown, and Jay-Z as major influences: \"I can't even imagine my career, my creative spirit without Wayne [...] I feel like I'm still intertwined with him creatively\". Minaj has called Lil Wayne her mentor and credited him with discovering her.[334][335] On Foxy Brown and Jay-Z, Minaj said: \"I really loved [Foxy] as a female rapper. I was really interested in her mind and her aura [and] I was really, really into Jay-Z. Me and my friends in high school, we were reciting all of the Jay lyrics. His words were our words in our conversations all the time.\"[336]\n\n\nShe said, further: \"I never really told Foxy how much she has influenced me and how much she changed my life\" adding that Foxy Brown was \"the most influential female rapper\" for her.[337] Minaj said in a *T Magazine* interview in 2017: \"Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Foxy Brown... [...] Those are the three I keep in my head when I'm writing because they've influenced me so much, [...] I feel like I'm a part of all of them.\"[338]\n\n\nJada Pinkett Smith is one of Minaj's role models in her acting career.[339] Minaj was inspired by R&B singer Monica, singing \"Why I Love You So Much\" at every talent show she entered. While performing in Atlanta as part of her Pink Friday Tour, she called Monica one of her all-time greatest musical influences. Lauryn Hill is also one of Minaj's major influences, with Minaj quoting her lyrics in a high school yearbook.[340][341] Minaj has also cited Beyoncé,[342][343] Marilyn Monroe,[344] Madonna,[345] Enya,[346] Eminem,[347] Kanye West, Trina, Drake,[348] Lil' Kim,[349][350][351] Lisa Left Eye Lopes,[352] Janet Jackson,[353] Grace Jones,[354][355] Remy Ma and Missy Elliott as influences.[356]\n\n\nShe called Betsey Johnson a fashion inspiration: \"[Betsey] is a free spirit. When I met her the other day, I felt like I knew her for my whole life. She's so warm and considerate and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [I was] bowing down to her; she's dope!\"[357] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: \"When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, you have to get your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me.\"[358]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n![An Afro-American woman in a blonde wig and bright teal eyeshadow wears a shirt constructed of variously colored cotton balls](image)Early in her career, Minaj often wore colorful costumes, cosmetics, and wigs.\n*Billboard* listed Minaj the fourth-most-active musician on social media on its March 2011 Social 50 chart.[359] Minaj is also the most followed rapper on Instagram with over 200 million followers, the first to surpass that number, as well as one of the most followed female musicians on the social media platform.[360][361] On Twitter, she is one of the most followed rappers, with over 27 million followers on the app, as of July 2023.[362][363] She joined *American Idol* as a judge in 2013.[364][365] BET has named Minaj as a \"gay icon\".[366] Minaj was a vocal proponent of streams counting towards an artist's RIAA certifications. The organization later announced in 2016 that it would be modernizing the certification process for albums, including on-demand audio and video streams, as reported by *Yahoo! News*.[367][368]\n\n\nMinaj has been called as a \"fashion icon\" by *Allure*, *Time*, *XXL* and has been called a \"camp style icon\" by Refinery29.[369][370][371][372] She has cited Alexander McQueen, Gianni Versace, and Christian Louboutin as her favorite designers.[373] *The Huffington Post* described her style as \"risk-taking\" and \"far-out\", with \"bold sartorial choices\";[374] Minaj has been included on the annual *Maxim* Hot 100 list several times.[375][376] In 2014, Minaj underwent a reinvention in her image sporting a \"natural\" and \"softer\" look, wearing fewer wigs and less colourful costumes.[377] She stated that she \"went so far to the other side that there's only one place to go from there. You can either continue doing costumes or you can just say, \"Hey guess what? This will shock them even more. Doing nothing will shock them even more\"\".[377][378]\n\n\nHer physique, notably her buttocks, has attracted significant attention from the media.[379][380] Early in her career, she made autographing breasts part of her movement to empower women.[381] In 2010, she said that although she originally felt obligated to mimic the provocative behavior of the \"female rappers of [her] day\", she intended to subdue her sexuality because she \"[wants] people—especially young girls—to know that in life, nothing is going to be based on sex appeal. You've got to have something else to go with that.\"[382][383]\n\n\nMinaj talked about feminism in an interview with *Vogue* in 2015, saying \"There are things that I do that feminists don't like, and there are things that I do that they do like. I don't label myself. I just say the truth about what I feel. I feel like women can do anything that they put their minds to.\"[384] In 2018, an interview with *Elle*, in which she discussed sex workers, her own sex appeal, and sexuality in music and on social media, attracted criticism.[385][386] In *The New York Times Magazine*, music critic Vanessa Grigoriadis said that Minaj \"has become expert at modelling the ways that women can wield power in the industry. But she has also drawn attention to the ways in which power can be embodied by a woman standing up for herself and speaking her own mind.\"[387]\n\n\nThe cover art and music video for her 2014 single, \"Anaconda\", attracted significant media attention upon release.[388] The music video was viewed 19.6 million times in its first 24 hours of release.[389] *The Guardian* called the video \"racy\" but noted that she \"doesn't shy from ruffling her audience's feathers\",[390] while others praised Minaj for \"owning her sexuality\",[391] examining her work through a feminist perspective.[388][392][393][394] Another writer for *The Guardian* said, of the \"Anaconda\" video, Minaj turns \"the classic song into a conversation, and [refuses] to let the camera objectify her lap dance by keeping it zoomed out, at a distance.\"[395]\n\n\nMinaj's fanbase, known as the \"Barbz\", have been reported as often being militant towards Minaj's critics, including incidents reportedly involving cyberbullying and death threats.[396][397][398][399]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Katy Perry (left) and Minaj perform for service members during the 2010 VH1 Divas Salute the Troops concert.\nIn 2010, Minaj performed a cover of \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\", alongside singer Katy Perry, for service members during the 2010 VH1 Divas Salute the Troops concert.[400][401] The two would later collaborate in 2017 on \"Swish Swish\". In 2011, Mattel created a Barbie doll with Minaj's likeness to auction for Project Angel Food, a charity that provides food for people afflicted with HIV and AIDS.[402] In 2012, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Minaj donated $15,000 to the Food Bank For New York City and held a turkey drive at her alma mater, PS 45.[403]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Minaj offered via Twitter to pay college tuition fees and student loans for 30 of her fans. She appeared to grant their requests, ranging from $500 to school supplies to $6,000 for tuition, promising to respond to more requests in a month or two.[404] She also announced that she would launch an official charity for student loans and tuition payments in the near future.[405] In the same month, Minaj revealed on Instagram that she has been donating money to a village in India for a few years via her pastor, Lydia Sloley. These donations helped the village get a computer center, a tailoring institute, a reading program, and two water wells. \"This is the kind of thing that makes me feel the most proud\", she said about the new additions to the village.[406]\n\n\nIn August 2017, after Hurricane Harvey hit the city of Houston, Texas, Minaj answered a social media challenge by comedian and actor Kevin Hart and donated $25,000 to the Red Cross, saying she was \"praying for everyone there\".[407][408] On September 4, 2018, Minaj appeared as a guest and performed several songs on *The Ellen DeGeneres Show*.[409] Throughout the episode, Minaj and Degeneres, with the participation of Walmart, gave out over $150,000 in donations to fans.[410][173]\n\n\nIn 2019, Minaj pulled out of headlining a concert in Saudi Arabia following online backlash from activists, after women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was detained and arrested for speaking out against the Saudi regime. Minaj was praised by Thor Halvorssen of The Human Rights Foundation, who criticized her initial plan to perform in a letter, and released a statement saying, \"After careful reflection ... I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression.\"[411][412]\n\n\nIn 2020, Minaj donated $25,000 to the St. Jude's Home for Girls school after visiting the school in her native country of Trinidad. In a speech, Minaj encouraged the girls to push through hard obstacles, even referencing her own experience with domestic violence: \"I've experienced being in a home with domestic violence. I've experienced, you know, being at a very difficult crossroads in my life as a teenager. And sometimes as a teenager when things happen, you feel like there's no up from there.\"[413] In the same year, following the release of Minaj and 6ix9ine's collaboration, \"Trollz\", Minaj announced that a portion of the proceeds from the song, along with profits from all merchandise, will go towards the Bail Project amid the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd.[414]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nVarious media outlets, such as *Billboard*, *Time*, *NME*, *Rolling Stone*, *NBC News* and *Cosmopolitan*, have referred to Minaj as the \"Queen of Rap\" and *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, *NPR*, and *The Los Angeles Times* have referred to her as the \"Queen of Hip Hop\".[415][416] Several media outlets, including *The New York Times*, *Evening Standard*, and *Nylon*, have also called her one of the most influential rappers.[417] Minaj was ranked as the seventh greatest rapper of all time on *Billboard* and *Vibe*'s list of the 50 greatest rappers (2023).[9]\n\n\nIn 2012, Jon Caramanica of *The New York Times* called Minaj \"the most influential female rapper of all time\", and in 2015 Vanessa Grigoriadis from its magazine called her \"the world's biggest female rap superstar\".[308][387] In *Evening Standard*, Jochan Embley called her one of the most influential rap artists of all time, saying that \"Everything she does is bold, fearless and distinct – whether that be her eye-popping stage attire or her expertly delivered lyrics, which stare gender and race dead in the eye.\"[418] Zoe Johnson from *XXL* called her \"one of the most versatile MCs\" and that she has \"made millions off upbeat pop hits and traditional hip-hop sounds that cater to both her femininity and her assertive side\".[323]\n\n\nFor *NPR Music*, Sowmya Krishnamurthy noted that Minaj has portrayed \"the quirky, life-size Barbie, glamorous vixen and girl-next-door\", arguing that she \"changed the landscape for artists in hip-hop for the past decade\" with said alter egos.[419] In 2017, Patrik Sandberg of *Dazed* argued that Minaj has \"surpassed every other female hip hop artist to become the most successful in history\" in 2017.[420] In 2020, Nick Soulsby of PopMatters called her the \"best female rapper and the best rapper of the past ten years – no gender preposition required.\"[421] *Glamour* included Minaj in their list of 104 women who defined 2010s pop culture.[422]\n\n\n\nIn *XXL*, Madeline Roth commented that Minaj \"has helped birth a new generation of rappers that mimic her style\".[323] She has influenced several artists, including Tinashe,[423] Cher Lloyd,[424] Cupcakke,[425] Billie Eilish,[426] Lil Nas X,[427] Ms Banks,[428] Asian Doll,[429] Doja Cat,[430] Megan Thee Stallion,[431] Latto,[432] Shenseea,[433] BIA,[434] Lakeyah,[435] Luísa Sonza,[436] Coi Leray,[437] Maliibu Miitch,[438] City Girls,[439] Baby Tate,[440] Ice Spice,[441] Rico Nasty,[442] Flo Milli,[443] Ivorian Doll,[444] Angel Haze,[445] Rubi Rose, and Saweetie.[446] *Billboard* credited her for bringing female rap back to the mainstream in the US.[447] With over 140 features, the magazine has called Minaj a \"rap and pop icon\" adding that \"she's been one of popular music's most reliable guest performers, notching dozens of chart hits as a supporting presence on other artists' singles.\"[448] Minaj has been credited by *Complex* for being able to \"take a simple song and turn it into a smash hit just because she's featured on it.\"[449] In 2012, Caramanica in *The New York Times* said that:\n\n\n> Minaj \"became a nimble, evocative rapper. She became an intricate lyricist. She became a thoughtful singer. She became a risky performer. She invented new personae. More than any other rapper in the mainstream, she pushed hard against expectations ... with no one around to compare herself to, or for others to compare her to, she became her own watermark.\"[450]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 2014, *NPR*'s Erik Nielson said that Minaj's \"success over the last decade has stood as an exception to the unwritten rule that women rappers no longer have a place among elite artists\".[451] *Nylon* writer, Demicia Inman, also credited Minaj for her influence which \"stands as one of the most successful rappers of the millennium\", also going on to say that Minaj \"battled misogyny and industry bias against black women to carve her own identity and sound\" thus impacting her career. *Complex* also commented that, \"From her bold outfits to her multi-colored wigs, Minaj oozed confidence that inspired others who were watching closely... [she] doesn't need anything but her art to speak for itself\".[452][453]\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Nicki Minaj\n\nMinaj is the recipient of numerous accolades, including nine American Music Awards, twelve BET Awards, eight BET Hip Hop Awards, four *Billboard* Music Awards, eight MTV Video Music Awards, ten MTV Europe Music Awards, four People's Choice Awards, one Soul Train Music Award, and four Teen Choice Awards.
