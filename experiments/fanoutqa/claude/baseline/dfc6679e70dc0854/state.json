according to Alfred Nobel's will of 1895, are awarded to \"those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to Mankind.\" Additionally, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was established by Sveriges Riksbank in 1968 and awarded to a \"person or persons in the field of economic sciences who have produced work of outstanding importance.\"\n\n\nAs of 2023, 65 Nobel Prizes and the Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences have been awarded to 64 women.[1][3] Unique Nobel Prize laureates include 894 men, 60 women, and 27 organizations.[4]\n\n\nThe distribution of Nobel prizes awarded to women is as follows:\n\n\n\n* nineteen women have won the Nobel Peace Prize (16.3% of 110 awarded);[5]\n* seventeen have won the Nobel Prize in Literature (14.28% of 119 awarded);[6]\n* thirteen have won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (5.6% of 230 awarded);[7]\n* eight have won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry (4.1% of 191 awarded);[8]\n* five have won the Nobel Prize in Physics (1.8% of 224 awarded);[9]\n* and three (Elinor Ostrom, Esther Duflo and Claudia Goldin) have won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2.17% of 92 awarded).[10]\n\n\nThe first woman to win a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 with her husband, Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel.[11][12] Curie is also the first person and the only woman to have won multiple Nobel Prizes; in 1911, she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Curie's daughter, Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie, won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1935, making the two the only mother\u2013daughter pair to have won Nobel Prizes.[11]\n\n\nThe most Nobel Prizes awarded to women in a single year was in 2009, when five women became laureates in four categories.\n\n\nThe most recent women to be awarded a Nobel Prize were Claudia Goldin in Economics, Narges Mohammadi for Peace, Anne L'Huillier in Physics and Katalin Karik\u00f3 in Physiology or Medicine (2023), Annie Ernaux in Literature and Carolyn R. Bertozzi for Chemistry (2022), Maria Ressa for Peace (2021), Louise Gl\u00fcck in Literature, Andrea M. Ghez in Physics, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna in Chemistry (2020), and Esther Duflo in Economics (2019).\n\n\n\n\n## Female laureates[edit]\n\n\n* Physiology or Medicine\n* Physics\n* Chemistry\n* Literature\n* Peace\n* Economic Sciences\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Physiology or Medicine** |\n| No.\n | Year\n | Laureate\n | Name\n | Born\n | Died\n | Rationale\n |\n| 1\n | 1947\n | ![](image) | Gerty Radnitz-Cori | 15 August 1896 Prague, ![](image)\u00a0Austria-Hungary | 26 October 1957 Glendale, Missouri, ![](image)\u00a0United States | \"\"for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen.\"[13](shared with Carl Ferdinand Cori and Bernardo Houssay) |\n| 2\n | 1977\n | ![](image) | Rosalyn Yalow | 19 July 1921 New York City, New York, ![](image)\u00a0United States | 30 May 2011 The Bronx, New York, ![](image)\u00a0United States | \"for the development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.\"[14](shared with Roger Guillemin and Andrew Schally) |\n| 3\n | 1983\n | ![](image) | Barbara McClintock | 16 June 1902 Hartford, Connecticut, ![](image)\u00a0United States | 2 September 1992 Huntington, New York, ![](image)\u00a0United States | \"for her discovery of mobile genetic elements.\"[15] |\n| 4\n | 1986\n | ![](image) | Rita Levi-Montalcini | 22 April 1909 Turin, ![](image)\u00a0Italy | 30 December 2012 Rome, ![](image)\u00a0Italy | \"for their discoveries of growth factors.\"[16](shared with Stanley Cohen) |\n| 5\n | 1988\n | ![](image) | Gertrude Belle Elion | 23 January 1918 New York City, New York, ![](image)\u00a0United States | 21 February 1999 Chapel Hill, North Carolina, ![](image)\u00a0United States | \"for their discoveries of important principles for drug treatment.\"[17](shared with James W.
