A member of the Democratic Party, she previously served on the Phoenix City Council from 2014 to 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGallego grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico.[2] Her parents are attorneys who moved to Albuquerque from Chicago after the 1979 Chicago blizzard.[3][4] She grew up with asthma, which made air quality important to her.[5]\n\n\nGallego graduated from Albuquerque Academy, where she served as student body vice president.[3] She earned a bachelor's degree in environmental science and public policy from Harvard College and a Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[3][6]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nGallego worked for the Arizona Democratic Party, the Arizona Office of Tourism,[5] as well as on economic development and strategic planning for the Salt River Project. On November 5, 2013, Gallego was elected to the Phoenix City Council for the 8th district; she was reelected in 2017. With Greg Stanton, the Mayor of Phoenix, running for the United States House of Representatives in the 2018 elections, Gallego announced she would run in a special election to succeed him.[7] She resigned from the city council effective August 7, 2018.[8]\n\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\nThe city of Phoenix has nonpartisan mayoral elections. In the 2018 special election, Kate Gallego and Daniel Valenzuela advanced to a runoff in November of 2018. They defeated Moses Sanchez and Nicholas Sarwark. Although the election was nonpartisan, both candidates were Democrats. Previously on the city council, they had voted similarly. Kate Gallego defeated Daniel Valenzuela in the special general runoff election for the mayor of Phoenix in 2019. She received 58.6% of votes.[9] She assumed office on March 21, 2019. Gallego became the first woman elected to the office in more than three decades. She is only the second female mayor in Phoenix history and one of the youngest big city mayors in the United States.[10] She was backed by progressives, labor unions, the *Arizona Republic* editorial board, and liberal advocacy organizations. Examples of these include Emily's List, Sierra Club, and the Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Kate Gallego ran for re-election. In November 2020, she was returned to office with the highest number of votes ever cast in a mayoral election. Merissa Hamilton, a Libertarian write in candidate, was Gallego's closest opponent. Hamilton received 26.29% of votes. Gallego won the election receiving 60.7% of the votes.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gallego tours GateWay Community College with Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh\n### Climate change[edit]\n\n\nDuring Gallego's tenure as mayor, Phoenix has taken steps to counter the urban heat island effects which are aggravated by climate change.[13] Increasing temperatures in the Phoenix area are projected to cost billions of dollars per year.[14] Among the steps being taken are the creation of \"cool corridors\" through the planting of desert-adapted trees, and the use of lighter-colored sidewalks and streets, particularly in areas with high pedestrian traffic and little shade. Where to plant the trees is determined in part based on \"tree equity.\" The city uses an interactive tool from the nonprofit American Forests that grades shade in neighborhoods based on satellite images.[13][14] Phoenix has also opened one of the first city heat mitigation offices in the United States. It will support climate mitigation in Phoenix and share strategies with individuals and cities worldwide.[15]\n\n\n\n### Policing[edit]\n\n\nThe police department of Phoenix recorded shooting 44 people in 2018, spurring a reassessment from the community on police accountability. In 2020, Gallego suggested a plan for a citizens review board that would balance the police department interests and community interests. City councilman Carlos Garcia, who ran on further police accountability, created a plan focused on empowering a citizens review board from input of the community and groups such as Puente Human Rights and Poder in Action. The city council passed Garcia's model for a review board when Gallego and vice mayor Betty Guardados switched their votes from Gallego's model to the Garcia model with a 5\u20134 vote.[16]\n\n\nA Department of Justice investigation was initiated in August 2021 looking into if the police used excessive force on protestors and sweeping of homeless people and their property. The investigation planned to look at current police practices and its handling of the disabled.[17][18]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nGallego supported legislation that legalized accessory dwelling units on lots that were previously strictly zoned for single-family housing.[19]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGallego is Jewish,[4] celebrating her bat mitzvah in Albuquerque.[3]\n\n\nWhile attending Harvard, Kate met Ruben Gallego at a charity auction following the September 11 attacks.[5] They moved to Phoenix in 2004,[2] and married in 2010. The couple announced their divorce in 2016, prior to the birth of their child, Michael.[20]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Phi Beta Kappa elects 92 seniors to Harvard chapter\". *The Harvard Gazette*.

Prior to his election, Nirenberg served as a member of the San Antonio City Council for District 8 for two terms.[2]\n\n\nIn 2013, Nirenberg was first elected in an upset victory to represent district 8 of the San Antonio City Council. Nirenberg was elected mayor in 2017, defeating incumbent Ivy Taylor, and was sworn in as the mayor of San Antonio on June 21, 2017.[3] He was narrowly re-elected in 2019 facing Greg Brockhouse, a city councilman critical of his policies. In the 2021 mayoral election, again, against Brockhouse, Nirenberg won with 61.89% of the vote. In the 2023 mayoral election, Nirenberg won his fourth and final election as mayor, with unofficial results of over 61% of the vote.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nNirenberg is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Poland and Russia) on his father's side and of mixed Filipino, Malay, Indian, and British heritage from his mother's side.[5] Nirenberg's mother and father met while the couple was serving with the Peace Corps in Malaysia.[6] His paternal grandparents immigrated to the United States before World War II, passing through Ellis Island. His Roman Catholic mother is half-Filipino and was born in Penang, Malaysia (then part of the colonial British protectorate of Malaya). His maternal grandmother was Anglo-Indian, born to a Scottish father and an Indian mother, while his maternal grandfather was a Tagalog-speaking Filipino musician with possible roots in Mindanao.[7] Nirenberg, who is Methodist, was raised in Austin, Texas.\n\n\nNirenberg attended Trinity University in San Antonio and graduated *summa cum laude* with a Bachelor of Arts in communication. He later attended the University of Pennsylvania, from which he earned his Master of Arts in communications.[8] After college, he was a program director for the Annenberg Public Policy Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania[9] and served as the General Manager of KRTU-FM, the radio station at Trinity University.[10]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n### 2013 San Antonio City Council, District 8 race[edit]\n\n\nIn his 2013 run for District 8 of the San Antonio City Council, Nirenberg was considered the underfunded candidate unlikely to be successful that was challenging a well-funded establishment candidate, Rolando Briones. Nirenberg had run a grassroots campaign that consisted primarily of volunteers, including college students and recent graduates. Nonetheless, Nirenberg was victorious winning nearly 55% of the votes cast in the runoff election.[11]\n\n\n\n### 2017 San Antonio mayoral race[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2017 San Antonio mayoral election\n\nOn December 10, 2016, Nirenberg became the leading challenger to Ivy Taylor for her position as mayor of San Antonio.[12] On May 6, 2017, the first round of voting was held, with no candidate reaching the required majority of 50% of the vote. Nirenberg and Taylor finished with the two highest vote totals and advanced to a runoff election held June 10, 2017. Although Nirenberg trailed Taylor in the first municipal election, he went on to defeat Taylor 54.59\u201345.41% in the runoff election.[13] In so doing, Nirenberg became the first person in twenty years to defeat an incumbent mayor of San Antonio who sought re-election.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### 2019 San Antonio mayoral race[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 San Antonio mayoral election\n\nNirenberg declared his candidacy for re-election to the office on January 29, 2019.[16] His main opponent was identified as Greg Brockhouse, a member of the San Antonio City Council who also took office in 2017 and frequently objected to Nirenberg's platform.[17] The election was scheduled for May 4, 2019, but since no majority was reached by any candidate, a runoff election was held on June 8.[18] In the runoff, Nirenberg was elected to a second term, defeating Brockhouse by a 51.11% to 48.89% final vote.[19]\n\n\n\n### 2021 San Antonio mayoral race[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 San Antonio mayoral election\n\nNirenberg declared his candidacy for re-election for a third term in office on January 22, 2021.[20] The election was held on May 1, 2021.[21] Due to the close runoff in 2019 between Nirenberg and Brockhouse, they were considered by political watchers to be the two front-runner candidates in the election.[22] Nirenberg won his third term as mayor with 61.89% of the vote, while Brockhouse received 31.26%.[23]\n\n\n\n### 2023 San Antonio mayoral race[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 San Antonio mayoral election\n\nNirenberg declared his candidacy for re-election for a fourth term in office on January 26, 2023.[24] Due to term limits if Nirenberg won, it would be his last term. Nirenberg faced minimal opposition and was expected to win re-election. On May 6, 2023, the election was held and Nirenberg was re-elected with an unofficial count of over 61% of the vote.[4]\n\n\n\n## Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nirenberg as a candidate for mayor, 2015.\n![](image)Nirenberg (second from left) with Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the 2023 United States Conference of Mayors\nAlthough Nirenberg identifies as an independent[25] and ran for office as a nonpartisan politician,[a] he has been described as ideologically progressive.[26][27][28][29]\n\n\nIn 2013, Nirenberg endorsed a city ordinance that bans discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. Taylor, then also a member of the city council, voted against the ordinance. Taylor also opposed the city's filing of a lawsuit against a then-new state law that defines a misdemeanor offense for municipal officials who refuse to cooperate with federal authorities seeking to halt illegal immigration. Signed by Governor Greg Abbott, the law targets the sanctuary city movement. Nirenberg, conversely, backed the lawsuit.[6]\nAs mayor-elect, Nirenberg called upon the city council to endorse the Paris climate accord even though U.S. President Donald Trump had announced plans to remove the United States from the agreement. The San Antonio City Council approved a resolution to sign the Paris climate accord one day after Nirenberg's election, and, in November 2017, the City Council approved the creation of a Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.[30][31][32] This would lead to San Antonio being one of 25 cities awarded the American Cities Climate Challenge grant in 2019 by Michael Bloomberg.[33]\n\n\nIn 2019, Nirenberg supported and defended the move to have a Chick-fil-A restaurant removed from the concessions contract at the San Antonio International Airport, citing a conflict with the company's opposition to LGBTQ rights and that the company's closure on Sunday, done on religious grounds, would hurt revenue.[34][35][36] The move faced controversy and national condemnation from conservatives.[37][38][39][40] Councilman Greg Brockhouse opposed this decision and called for a re-vote on the decision but it was defeated.[41][42] Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton later began an investigation on the actions of Nirenberg and the San Antonio City Council, claiming that the decision was in violation of existing Texas laws, the U.S. Constitution, and even San Antonio's own ethics code.[43] The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also opened an investigation on this action.[44][45] On June 10, 2019, Texas governor Greg Abbott signed into law Senate Bill 1978,[46] colloquially known as the \"Save Chick-fil-A Bill\", which forbids local governments from taking adverse steps against companies or individuals based on their religious beliefs.[47][48]\n\n\nOn March 18, 2020, Nirenberg issued an order for the temporary closure of all non-essential businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, making San Antonio the last major city in Texas to do so.[49][50] In 2021, Nirenberg criticized Texas Governor Greg Abbott's lifting of COVID-19 mandates and prohibition on local governments from being able to make their own, saying the governor was showing \"callous disregard for life.\"[51] The City of San Antonio, led by Nirenberg, and Bexar County sued Abbott in Bexar County court to temporarily block his executive order barring local mandates.[52] A Bexar County judge issued the restraining order on Abbott's executive order, reinstating Nirenberg's mask mandate; a ruling that he applauded.[53] The Supreme Court of Texas would later block Nirenberg's mask mandate.[54]\n\n\nUpon the completion of his fourth term, Nireberg is expected to be among the longest serving mayors of San Antonio,[55] and the longest since Mayor Henry Cisneros, who left office in 1989.[56]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nNirenberg married Erika Prosper in 2001.[57] Erika is the director of customer insights for H-E-B.[58] The couple has one son.[59][60]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the 50 largest cities in the United States\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In Texas, all municipal elections are officially nonpartisan\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ron Nirenberg\". *Ballotpedia*.

As mayor, he is the chief executive officer in the city of San Diego. A member of the Democratic Party, he is the first person of color[a] and the first openly gay person to serve as San Diego's mayor.\n\n\nGloria was first elected to public office representing District 3 of the San Diego City Council. He was president of the nine-member council from 2012 through 2014. In his role as council president, Gloria served as interim Mayor of San Diego from the August 2013 resignation of Mayor Bob Filner until the March 2014 inauguration of Mayor Kevin Faulconer.[3] Gloria was then elected to represent California's 78th State Assembly district, which encompasses much of San Diego. While in the Assembly, he served as House Majority Whip.[4] In December 2020 he became the 37th Mayor of San Diego.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nGloria and his family grew up in the Clairemont neighborhood of San Diego, where he attended Hawthorne Elementary School. In 1989, he was a finalist in then-San Diego mayor Maureen O'Connor's \"Mayor for a Day\" program.[6] His father was a Production Controller at General Atomics.[7] All four of his grandparents moved to the area because of their involvement with the military. Todd Gloria comes from a Filipino, Dutch, Puerto Rican, and Native American background.[8] He is a member of the Tlingit Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska. Gloria completed his college education at the University of San Diego, where he was the student body president.[9]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\nU.S. Congresswoman Susan Davis had been Gloria's political mentor since they met in 1993, when Gloria was a freshman in high school. Davis was the director of the Aaron Price Fellows Program, a leadership program for high school students that focused on civic education and cross-cultural understanding.[10] Mayor Gloria has spent the majority of his entire professional life serving the public.[1] He began his career at the County of San Diego\u2019s Health and Human Services Agency, and proceeded to join the office of Susan Davis as a community representative.[11] In 2002, Gloria became Davis's district director,[10] a position he held until his election to the City Council in 2008.[12] Gloria also served as a San Diego Housing Commissioner from 2005 until 2008. Openly gay, he is also a former chairman of the San Diego LGBT Community Center and was a resident panelist on San Diego's Prostitution Impact Panel.[13]\n\n\nIn 2012, he was elected as the President of the City Council. A year later, after Bob Filner resigned from office, he took office as the interim mayor.[9] During this time, he gained popularity and trust from his community by improving the layout of a revolutionary plan for the city\u2019s fight against climate change, strengthening the infrastructure and offered creative resolutions to the severe homelessness of San Diego.[14] Upon his success, he was then elected as a representative of the 78th District of the California State Assembly, and rose to the position of the Majority Whip. He established legislation addressing issues in San Diego such as housing and homelessness, gun violence, and global warming.[14] He was the vice chair of the California Legislative LGBT Caucus.[14]\n\n\n\n### San Diego City Council\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Elections\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: 2008 San Diego City Council election and 2012 San Diego City Council election\n\n![](image)Council Member Todd Gloria speaking to the San Diego Workforce Partnership.\nGloria ran for the District 3 seat on the San Diego City Council vacated by the termed-out Toni Atkins in the 2008 election. He received a plurality of votes in the June 2008 primary, leading to a November run-off election against fellow Democrat Stephen Whitburn, a former journalist, community activist, and ally of then-District 6 Councilmember Donna Frye.[12][13] Gloria defeated Whitburn with 54.3% of the vote.\n\n\nIn the 2012 election, Gloria ran for re-election unopposed and was re-elected in the June primary.[15] As of his second term, District 3 included the neighborhoods of Balboa Park, Bankers Hill/Park West, Downtown San Diego, Golden Hill, Hillcrest, Little Italy, Mission Hills, Normal Heights, North Park, Old Town, and University Heights.[16]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Gloria and San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer at a San Diego Comic-Con event in 2014\nGloria was chair of the city's Budget and Finance Committee from 2011 to 2016. Gloria represented San Diego on the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System Board and SANDAG, where he chaired the transportation committee.[17] As the Council member for District Three, he also took charge in the merger of multiple homelessness organizations in the city of San Diego. By doing so, Gloria aimed to unify San Diego's allocated resources in the fight to end homelessness in the city.In December 2012, at its first meeting after new members took office, Gloria was unanimously elected to serve as Council President, replacing retiring President Tony Young.[18]\n\n\nOn December 10, 2014, the city council voted 4\u20135 on a motion of whether to reappoint Gloria as council president for the new term, with Sherri Lightner joining the four council Republicans to defeat the measure. The council then voted 7\u20132 to appoint Lightner as council president, with Gloria and David Alvarez in opposition.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Interim Mayor\n\n[edit]\n\nUpon the resignation of Mayor Bob Filner on August 30, 2013,[20] Gloria became the interim mayor of San Diego, with limited powers.[21] This made San Diego the second largest city in the United States (after Houston) to have an openly gay mayor at that time.[22][23] He served until March 3, 2014, when mayor-elect Kevin Faulconer was sworn in. While serving as interim mayor, he remained the City Councilmember for District 3 and retained the title of City Council President; however, City Council President Pro Tem Sherri Lightner carried out the duties of the Council President.[24] Gloria was considered a possible candidate to replace Filner but chose not to run.[25]\n\n\nAs interim mayor, Gloria reversed several of Filner's actions. He ordered city police and zoning code officers to resume enforcement actions against medical marijuana,[26] re-hired lobbying firms in Sacramento and Washington that Filner had fired,[27] and ordered public records be made more quickly and easily available to citizens.[28]\n\n\nGloria's administration authored and released a draft of the San Diego Climate Action Plan.[29]\n\n\n\n### California State Assembly\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Gloria at Balboa Park's 100th anniversary, 2015.\nOn April 7, 2015, Gloria announced that he would run in 2016 for the California State Assembly 78th district seat held by Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins, who was termed out. Gloria was immediately endorsed by Atkins and by Sarah Boot, who had previously announced her own candidacy for Atkins's seat but withdrew upon Gloria's announcement.[30] While running for State Assembly, Gloria promoted the city's climate action plan.[31] On November 8, 2016, Gloria was easily elected over his relatively unknown Republican opponent with the second-highest margin of victory in San Diego County.[32] He was easily re-elected in 2018 with over 70 percent of the vote in both the primary and the general elections.\n\n\nShortly after assuming office in 2016, Gloria was chosen by Speaker Anthony Rendon to join Democratic leadership in the Assembly as Assistant Majority Whip.[33] In January 2018, he became Majority Whip.[34]\n\n\n\n### Mayor of San Diego\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Gloria (front left) meets with Vice President Kamala Harris (front right) in 2021\n#### Campaign\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2020 San Diego mayoral election\n\nGloria announced his candidacy for mayor of San Diego in 2020 on January 9, 2019. Gloria's campaign focused on issues such as the housing crisis, affordability, public transportation, and climate change.[35][36] Gloria was endorsed by several politicians including Governor Gavin Newsom, former Governor Jerry Brown, and San Diego City Attorney Mara Elliott.[37]\n\n\nOn August 20, 2019, Gloria won the San Diego County Democratic Party's endorsement vote, allowing the party to spend money on behalf of his campaign.[38] Gloria received 70% of the votes, exceeding the 60% required to win. Fellow democratic rivals Barbara Bry and Tasha Williamson won 14% and 3% of the votes respectively.[39][40]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Gloria was accused of collecting funds for his 2020 re-election campaign to the State Assembly before filing his intent to run with the state in violation of state law.[41][42] Gloria claimed this was a technical oversight and filed the relevant paperwork the next day.[43]\n\n\nWith the Mayor being a \"voter-nominated\" office in San Diego, Gloria and Bry advanced to the general election as the top two vote getters from the primary.[44] He was then elected mayor in the November 3 election, making him the first Native American and Filipino-American mayor elected in a US city of over a million people and the city's first mayor of color and the city's first openly gay mayor.[45][46] He was sworn in on December 10, 2020.[47]\n\n\n\n### Tenure\n\n[edit]\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\n\nTo revitalize the infrastructure of the city, Gloria proposed a budget for Fiscal Year 2023 called the \u201cReady to Rebuild\u201d proposal. At just under $5 billion dollars total, the budget increased the allocation of funds to street maintenance by $27.6 million, parks and recreation services by $4.3 million, and left $55.8 million dollars from the American Rescue Plan Act money given to the city for the next fiscal year.[48] From the budget initiatives, there are several projects underway to repair the infrastructure of the city that are part of the Capital Improvements Program (CIP). CIP functions as the plan to improve the capital and infrastructure of San Diego over several years.[49] These projects have focus areas that provide important services for San Diego residents such as fire stations, libraries, and parks.[50]\n\n\n**Public Safety**\n\n\nIn 2021, Gloria came up with a proposal to reform policing and public safety in San Diego. Many of the items were formed as responses to the citizens of San Diego. For one of the items, Gloria promised to adequately fund the Commission on Police Practices (CPP), which is an independent organization in charge of overseeing and investigating incidents involving the San Diego Police. There is also a clause in the proposal calling for San Diego police to refrain from using military grade weapons unless absolutely necessary.[51] However, some parts of this proposal are not in action yet such as the Commission on Police Practices not being active and no known unconscious and implicit bias trainings being implemented for officers.[52]\n\n\n**Homelessness and Housing**\n\n\nThroughout his duration as mayor, Gloria repeatedly called homelessness as one of his top priorities.[53][54] During Gloria's tenure, San Diego has created hundreds of beds for the homeless, but seen record levels of unsheltered people in its downtown, and record numbers of homeless deaths.[54]\n\n\nDuring his campaign, Gloria proposed the use of housing with wrap-around services, making emergency shelters only available for triage, and replacing temporary shelters with permanent housing for those in need.[55]\n\n\nIn 2021, Gloria proposed roughly $10 million dollars in investments aimed towards homelessness and housing in San Diego in his budget for the fiscal year.[56] The budget allocates funds for the creation of a new department called Homelessness Strategies and Solutions. A majority of the proposed investments will go to interim shelter beds. The proposal also invests $1 million into funding for the People Assisting the Homeless Coordinated Street Outreach Program, a program that provides housing and services to homelessness residents. Rapid-rehousing programs in the city will also benefit from the proposals funding of 100 additional households and rental assistance.[56]\n\n\nIn late June 2023, Todd Gloria signed the \"Unsafe Camping Ordinance\" following its passage by the San Diego City Council by a 5-4 vote.[57] The law prohibits tent encampments in all public spaces in San Diego if shelter beds are available, and imposes a complete ban on encampments in parks, canyons, near schools, near transit stations, and near homeless shelters.[57] Gloria defended the law, saying that \"there has to be consequences for illegal behavior in the city. Now we\u2019re saying you cannot occupy public spaces under certain circumstances\", and that the city had expanded its shelter programs.[58] He also stated he wanted to avoid the impression \"that it\u2019s easy to be homeless here and you can do drugs in my city\".[58] However, a spokesperson for the San Diego Housing Commission said that all of the city's shelters get filled by mid-day, and that most people referred to shelters by police and other authorities don't get placed, reporting that less than one-third of people referred to shelters in June 2023 were placed in one.[58] Some of the city's homeless population reported getting displaced by police when no shelters were available, and one police officer opined that they new law didn't help efforts and was \"all the same\".[58]\n\n\nDespite those efforts, the San Diego housing situation remains tense in 2023, with nearly 60% of homes in San Diego having a listing price exceeding $1 million. The city's median home price is $910,000, making it the fourth most expensive among the 30 largest cities in the U.S.[59][60] The average monthly rent in San Diego has risen to $3,175, placing it as the third-highest in the nation, only $7 less than that of San Francisco.[61]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history\n\n[edit]\n\n### San Diego City Council\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n2008 San Diego City Council District 3 election[62]\n| Primary election\n |\n| --- |\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Todd Gloria**  | **9,288**  | **40.64**  |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Stephen Whitburn**  | **6,543**  | **28.63**  |\n|  | Democratic | John Hartley\n | 4,018\n | 17.58\n |\n|  | Nonpartisan | Paul Broadway\n | 1,428\n | 6.25\n |\n|  | Nonpartisan | Robert E.
