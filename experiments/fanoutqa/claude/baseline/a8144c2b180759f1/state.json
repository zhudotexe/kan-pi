The ruling DPP nominated Vice President Lai Ching-te in March 2023, having already secured the party chairmanship by acclamation. New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) was selected to be the party\u2019s presidential nominee in May 2023. Despite previously saying he would support Hou\u2019s nomination, businessman Terry Gou declared his own independent bid in September 2023. The Taiwan People\u2019s Party (TPP) has nominated its leader, Ko Wen-je, the former Mayor of Taipei. \n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, leadership of the KMT and the TPP announced that they would field a single joint presidential ticket, with the parties' previously chosen nominees serving as presidential and vice-presidential candidates. The order was to be chosen based on opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[3] but the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on that date, leaving the fate of the proposed joint ticket in doubt.[4]\n\n\nDomestic issues, such as energy policy, national defense and economic development have featured as campaign issues in the election, coupled by foreign issues mostly concerning Taiwan\u2019s Cross-Strait relations with Mainland China, and relations with the United States.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of 14 November 2023, four presidential candidates have been nominated by a party or qualified as an independent, making the election the most contested since 2000. The winner of the 2024 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on 20 May 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tsai Ing-wen, the incumbent President of the Republic of China is ineligible to seek re-election after serving two consecutive terms.\nPresidential candidates and Vice Presidential running mates are elected on the same ticket, using first-past-the-post voting. This will be the eighth direct election of the president and vice president, the posts having previously been indirectly elected by the National Assembly until 1996.\n\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the constitution, the incumbent President, Tsai Ing-wen, who will finish her second full term, is ineligible for re-election. Under the Article 22 of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan People's Party (TPP) and New Power Party (NPP), which received more than five per cent of the total vote share in any of the latest general election (presidential or legislative), are eligible to contest the election. Registration with the Central Election Commission as the candidates for President and Vice President is filed by the way of political party recommendation where a letter of recommendation stamped with the political party's seal issued by the Ministry of the Interior shall be submitted together with the application. Under Article 23, independent candidates and smaller parties are also eligible to contest, registering as the candidates for President and Vice President by the way of joint signature shall, within five days after the public notice for election is issued, apply to the Central Election Commission for being the presenter recommended by way of joint signature, receive a list of joint signers and to receive 1.5 per cent of the total electors in the latest election of the members of the Legislative Yuan, and pay the deposit of NT$1,000,000.[7][*original research?*] For the 2024 presidential election, the number of signatures required for independent candidates is approximately 290,000.[8] The complete petition is to be submitted between 13 and 17 September 2023, and the signature collection period follows from 17 September to 2 November 2023.[9] Presidential candidacies are to be formally registered between 20 and 24 November 2023.[10]\n\n\n\n### Timetable[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Key Dates\n |\n| --- |\n| Date\n | Event\n |\n| 15 March 2023\n | The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) officially nominates Vice President Lai Ching-te as the party's presidential nominee.\n |\n| 8 May 2023\n | The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) officially nominates former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je as the party's presidential nominee.\n |\n| 17 May 2023\n | The Kuomintang Party (KMT) officially nominates New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih as the party's presidential nominee.\n |\n| 28 August 2023\n | Businessman Terry Gou declares his candidacy for the Presidency as an independent.\n |\n| 12 September-4 December 2023\n | Accepting applications for the election of the President and Vice President and registration of electors who return to the country to exercise their right to vote.\n |\n| 14 September 2023\n | Terry Gou selects actress Lai Pei-hsia as his running mate.\n |\n| 13 November 2023\n | Gou qualifies to run in the presidential election.\n |\n| 13 November 2023\n | The KMT and TPP agree to use polling to determine the formation of a joint-ticket.\n |\n| 14 November 2023\n | Announcement of the signature results of the presidential and vice presidential election.\n |\n| 13 January 2024\n | Voting will be held from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n |\n| 20 May 2024\n | The next President will be inaugurated on 20 May 2024.\n |\n\n\n## Nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Tsai resigned as DPP Chair in 2022, following the party\u2019s poor performance in the local elections of that year.[11] After Tsai\u2019s resignation, Vice President Lai Ching-te (also known as William Lai) was unanimously elected to succeed her as Chair of the DPP.[12] Lai was previously selected to be Tsai\u2019s running mate after she defeated him in the 2020 primary.[13] No primary was held, and Lai Ching-te, being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary, is the nominee of the Democratic Progressive Party.[14][15][16]\n\n\nIn November 2023, it was reported that Lai was considering selecting Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan\u2019s envoy to the United States, as his running mate.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Nominees[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Democratic Progressive ticket** |\n| Lai Ching-te | TBD |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) |  |\n| Vice President of the Republic of China(2020\u2013present) |  |\n\n\n### Kuomintang[edit]\n\n\nHou Yu-ih, the Mayor of New Taipei since 2018, was drafted by the Kuomintang on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency.[18] Hou faced opposition from Foxconn founder Terry Gou, who vowed to support him as the KMT\u2019s nominee.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Nominees[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Kuomintang ticket** |\n| Hou Yu-ih | TBD |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) |  |\n| Mayor of New Taipei(2018\u2013present) |  |\n\n\n### Taiwan People's Party[edit]\n\n\nKo Wen-je, being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary, is the nominee of the Taiwan People's Party.[20][21]\n\n\n\n#### Nominees[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Taiwan People's ticket** |\n| Ko Wen-je | TBD |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) |  |\n| Mayor of Taipei(2014\u20132022) |  |\n\n\n### Other parties and independents[edit]\n\n\nAll independent and minor party candidates need a minimum of 290,000 signatures to register with the Central Election Commision.[22]\n\n\n\n#### Terry Gou[edit]\n\n\nBillionaire businessman Terry Gou, who founded the global technology manufacturing company Foxconn in 1974, declared his own presidential run as an independent candidate on 28 August 2023.[23] This was despite previously stating he would support Kuomintang nominee Hou Yu-ih. The KMT described Gou\u2019s announcement as \u2018deeply regrettable\u2019.[24]\u00a0Lai Ching-te welcomed Gou\u2019s entrance into the race, saying he would be happy to take on the challenge.[25] Gou was the first of the mainstream candidates to announce his running mate; he selected actress Lai Pei-hsia\u00a0[zh] (otherwise known as Tammy Lai) as his running mate on 14 September.[26] Lai had previously played a fictional Taiwanese presidential candidate on a Chinese-language Netflix series, Wave Makers.[27] Gou\u2019s campaign was mired by allegations that it was buying signatures.[28] By November 2023, at least 20 separate investigations into fraudulent practices and signature forgeries were opened.[29] 7 people were arrested in what was described as a \u2018signature-buying scheme\u2019 a few weeks earlier.[30] Gou denied these allegations, and claimed that individuals who were buying signatures were acting on their own accord and were not part of his official campaign. Gou submitted his signatures on 1 November 2023.[31] On 13 November, over 900,000 of Gou\u2019s submitted signatures were validated by the election commission, qualifying him to run the presidential election.[32]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)**2024 Independent politician ticket** |\n| Terry Gou | Lai Pei-hsia |\n| ***for President*** | ***for Vice President*** |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Founder and CEO of Foxconn(1974\u20132019) | Writer, singer, actor\n |\n\n\n#### Withdrawn candidates[edit]\n\n\n* **Wang Chien-shien** (independent), President of Control Yuan (2008\u20132014)[33]\n* **Su Huan-chih** (Taiwan Renewal Party), Tainan County Magistrate (2001\u20132010)\n\n\n#### Disqualified candidates[edit]\n\n\nNine of ten third-party or independent presidential tickets did not meet the signature petition requirements set by the Central Election Commission, and were disqualified from the election. Only five presidential candidates and their running mates attempted to submit signatures.[34]\n\n\n\n* **Chen Mei-fei\u00a0[zh]** and Wu Chao-sheng (\u5deb\u8d85\u52dd) 256,773 signatures submitted, 2

submitted, 91 valid endorsements\n\n\n## Election campaign[edit]\n\n\nThroughout the election campaign, almost all polls have showed Vice President William Lai winning the election by a plurality (~32%), with the rest of the vote being split between the KMT and TPP.[35] Lai\u2019s lead increased in September 2023, when Terry Gou announced his own independent bid for the presidency.[36] In August 2023, amid campaiging, Lai Ching-te went to Paraguay for an official visit in his capacity as Vice President, with two stopovers in the United States.[37] Lai insisted he was not campaigning during the trips.[38] In late October, China opened an investigation into Foxconn, after Chinese tax authorities conducted an audit of the company\u2019s subsidies in the Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces.[39]\n\n\n\n### Possible KMT\u2013TPP joint ticket[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2023, talks of a possible joint ticket between the KMT and TPP began.[40] It was initially unclear if the KMT\u2019s Hou Yu-ih and the TPP\u2019s Ko Wen-je will join as a ticket, let alone who will be the nominee for president and vice president once a joint ticket was announced.[41] The DPP\u2019s Lai stated he would be able to take on the challenge of a joint ticket, and criticised the coalition plans, arguing the two parties do not share enough similarity in ideology.[42] In November, Ko said that deciding who would lead the ticket as the presidential nominee was the \u2018only hurdle\u2019 remaining in forming the ticket.[43] On 13 November, the KMT and TPP agreed to use polling to determine the composition of the joint presidential ticket.[44]\n\n\n\n## Opinion polling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nLocal regression of polls conducted since 2023\n\n\n\n| Pollster\n | Fieldwork date\n | Sample size\n

He has been the incumbent mayor of New Taipei since 25 December 2018.[2] Previously, he served as Director-General of the National Police Agency from 2006 to 2008 and as acting mayor of New Taipei City from October 2015 to January 2016. He is Kuomintang's official candidate for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential elections. He firstly joined the party during the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n\n\n\n## Law enforcement career[edit]\n\n\nUpon his graduation from the Central Police University, Hou was sent to the Taipei City Police Department. Hou obtained his first leadership role, as captain of the Taipei criminal police, in 1980.[3] In 1992, he became an inspector at the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), a division of the National Police Agency (NPA). Five years later, he led the rescue of the Alexander family.[4] In 1998 Hou was named second in command of the CIB. He was given the concurrent post of Taoyuan County police chief in 2001 and promoted within the NPA in 2003, becoming the leader of the CIB.[5] The next year, Hou was tasked with investigating the 3-19 shooting incident,[6] an assassination attempt on President Chen Shui-bian, a longtime friend.[7] He was named the director-general of the NPA in 2006, becoming the youngest leader of the police force at the time of his appointment.[8] During his tenure, the NPA was criticized for its inadequate response to the 2006 protests led by Shih Ming-teh.[9][10] Multiple Kuomintang politicians also wanted Hou to reopen the investigation on the 3-19 shooting incident. Arms dealer Tang Shou-yi, who had fled to Mainland China by August 2006, had recanted his confession, stating that it was coerced and therefore untrue.[11] Hou was named the president of Central Police University in 2008[12] and was replaced at the NPA by Wang Cho-chiun\u00a0[zh].[13]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nHou originally joined the Kuomintang in 1975, but allowed his membership to lapse during his law enforcement career.[14][15] Hou was recruited to join the Democratic Progressive Party in 2002.[16] Eric Chu asked Hou to serve as deputy mayor of New Taipei in 2010,[17] and Hou rejoined the Kuomintang in 2013.[15] Hou served as deputy mayor alongside Lee Shu-chuan and Hsu Chih-chien who left office on 25 February 2014 and 30 June 2014, respectively.[18][19][20] Later, Chen Shen-hsien was appointed to the deputy mayorship.[21] Hou was promoted from his previous position as deputy mayor on 20 October 2015, as Chu prepared for the 2016 presidential election.[22] Chu lost the election to Tsai Ing-wen, and resumed mayoral duties on 18 January 2016.[23]\n\n\nHou resigned from the deputy mayorship on 28 February 2018, stating that he would contest the Kuomintang mayoral primary.[24][25] On 6 April 2018, the KMT announced that Hou had won the primary.[26][27]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Kuomintang New Taipei City mayoral primary results[28] |\n| --- |\n| Candidates\n | Place\n | Results\n |\n| **Hou Yu-ih** | **Nominated** | **55.596%** |\n| Chou Hsi-wei | 2nd\n | 34.210%\n |\n| Ching Chieh-shou\n | 3rd\n | 10.194%\n |\n\n\n### 2018 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2018 New Taipei mayoralty election result\n\n\n| 2018 New Taipei City mayoral results[29][30] |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Su Tseng-chang | Template:DPP | 873,692\n | 42.85%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,165,130\n | 57.15%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | \u30003,264,128\n |\n| **Valid votes** | \u30002,038,822\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | \u300050,305\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | \u300062.46%\n |\n\n\n### 2022 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, 2022, Hou confirmed that he would run for a second term as mayor of New Taipei.[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2022 New Taipei City mayoral results\n |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Lin Chia-lung | Template:DPP | 693,976\n | 37.58%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,152,555\n | 62.42%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | \u30003,316,517\n |\n| **Valid votes** | \u30001,877,186\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | \u300030,655\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | \u300056.60%\n |\n\n\n### 2024 presidential elections[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the 2024 presidential election, Hou was considered the favorite for the Kuomintang presidential primary.[32] He was drafted by the Kuomintang on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency.[33][34]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, KMT and Taiwan People's Party leadership announced that they would field a single joint presidential ticket made up of Hou and TPP chairman Ko Wen-je. The order was to be determined by opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[35] but the parties were unable to reach an agreement on that date, leaving the possibility of a joint ticket in doubt.[36]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHou was born on 7 June 1957, in Puzi, Chiayi County, where his family owned a pork stall. As a child Hou aided the family business by catching and butchering wild pigs.[3]\n\n\nHou's firstborn son Hou Ni-wei died on 15 May 1992, in a tour bus fire,[37][38][39] which killed 23 people.[40] He and his wife Jen Mei-ling raised three daughters, Hou Yu-fan, Hou Ni-chia, and Hou Yu-chia.[41][42]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Out of office as Mayor of New Taipei since 24 September 2023 for being the Kuomintang candidate in the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election\n2. **^** \"\u5e02\u9577 \u4faf\u53cb\u5b9c\". *New Taipei City Government* (in Chinese).
