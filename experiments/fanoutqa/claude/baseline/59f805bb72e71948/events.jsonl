It was founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri in 857–859 and subsequently became one of the leading spiritual and educational centers of the Islamic Golden Age. It was incorporated into Morocco's modern state university system in 1963 and officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later.[1] The mosque building itself is also a significant complex of historical Moroccan and Islamic architecture that features elements from many different periods of Moroccan history.[5]\n\n\nScholars consider al-Qarawiyyin to have been effectively run as a madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] Many scholars distinguish this status from the status of \"university\", which they view as a distinctly European invention.[10][11] They date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation from a madrasa into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[1][2][3] Some sources, such as UNESCO and the *Guinness World Records*, have cited al-Qarawiyyin as the oldest university or oldest continually operating higher learning institution in the world.[12][13]\n\n\nEducation at the University of al-Qarawiyyin concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and *Maliki* Sharia, though lessons on non-Islamic subjects are also offered to students. Teaching is still delivered in the traditional methods.[14] The university is attended by students from all over Morocco and Muslim West Africa, with some also coming from further abroad. Women were first admitted to the institution in the 1940s.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe Arabic name of the university, جَامِعَةُ الْقَرَوِيِّينَ pronounced [ʒaːmiʕtu lqarawijiːn] means \"University of the People from Kairouan (القَيْرَوَان [alqajrawaːn])\". Factors such as the provenance of Fatima al-Fihriya's family in Tunisia,[16] the presence of the letter *Qāf* (ق) – a voiceless uvular plosive which has no equivalent in European languages – the ويّي ([awijiː]) triphthong in the university's name, and the French colonization of Morocco have resulted in a number of different orthographies for the romanization of the university's name, including *al-Qarawiyyin*, a standard anglicization; *Al Quaraouiyine*, following French orthography; and *Al-Karaouine*, another rendering using French orthography.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qarawiyyin Mosque on the skyline of central Fes el-Bali: the green-tiled roofs of the prayer hall and the minaret (white tower on the left) are visible.\n### Foundation of the mosque[edit]\n\n\nIn the 9th century, Fez was the capital of the Idrisid dynasty, considered to be the first Moroccan Islamic state.[17] According to one of the major early sources on this period, the *Rawd al-Qirtas* by Ibn Abi Zar, al-Qarawiyyin was founded as a mosque in 857 or 859 by Fatima al-Fihri, the daughter of a wealthy merchant named Mohammed al-Fihri.[18][4][19][6][20][5]: 9[21]: 40 The al-Fihri family had migrated from Kairouan (hence the name of the mosque), Tunisia to Fez in the early 9th century, joining a community of other migrants from Kairouan who had settled in a western district of the city. Fatima and her sister Mariam, both of whom were well educated, inherited a large amount of money from their father. Fatima vowed to spend her entire inheritance to build a mosque suitable for her community.[22]: 48–49 Similarly, her sister Mariam is also reputed to have founded al-Andalusiyyin Mosque the same year.[23][22]\n\n\nThis foundation narrative has been questioned by some modern historians who see the symmetry of two sisters founding the two most famous mosques of Fez as too convenient and likely originating from a legend.[22]: 48–49[24][21]: 42 Ibn Abi Zar is also judged by contemporary historians to be a relatively unreliable source.[24] One of the biggest challenges to this story is a foundation inscription that was rediscovered during renovations to the mosque in the 20th century, previously hidden under layers of plaster for centuries. This inscription, carved onto cedar wood panels and written in a Kufic script very similar to foundation inscriptions in 9th-century Tunisia, was found on a wall above the probable site of the mosque's original *mihrab* (prior to the building's later expansions). The inscription, recorded and deciphered by Gaston Deverdun, proclaims the foundation of \"this mosque\" (Arabic: \"هذا المسجد\") by Dawud ibn Idris (a son of Idris II who governed this region of Morocco at the time) in *Dhu al-Qadah* 263 AH (July–August of 877 CE).[14] Deverdun suggested the inscription may have come from another unidentified mosque and was moved here at a later period (probably 15th or 16th century) when the veneration of the Idrisids was resurgent in Fez, and such relics would have held enough religious significance to be reused in this way.[14] However, Chafik Benchekroun argued more recently that a more likely explanation is that this inscription is the original foundation inscription of al-Qarawiyyin itself and that it might have been covered up in the 12th century just before the Almohads' arrival in the city.[24] Based on this evidence and on the many doubts about Ibn Abi Zar's narrative, he argues that Fatima al-Fihri is quite possibly a legendary figure rather than a historical one.[24]\n\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSome scholars suggest that some teaching and instruction probably took place at al-Qarawiyyin Mosque from a very early period[25][22]: 453 or from its beginning.[26]: 287[1]: 71[27] Major mosques in the early Islamic period were typically multi-functional buildings where teaching and education took place alongside other religious and civic activities.[28][29] The al-Andalusiyyin Mosque, in the district across the river, may have also served a similar role up until at least the Marinid period, though it never equaled the Qarawiyyin's later prestige.[22]: 453 It is unclear at what time al-Qarawiyyin began to act more formally as an educational institution, partly because of the limited historical sources that pertain to its early period.[26][30][22] The most relevant major historical texts like the *Rawd al-Qirtas* by Ibn Abi Zar and the *Zahrat al-As* by Abu al-Hasan Ali al-Jazna'i do not provide any clear details on the history of teaching at the mosque,[22]: 453 though al-Jazna'i (who lived in the 14th century) mentions that teaching had taken place there before his time.[31]: 175 Otherwise, the earliest mentions of *halaqa* (circles) for learning and teaching may not have been until the 10th or the 12th century.[32][26] Historian Abdelhadi Tazi indicates the earliest clear evidence of teaching at al-Qarawiyyin in 1121.[25]: 112 Moroccan historian Mohammed Al-Manouni believes that the mosque acquired its function as a teaching institution during the reign of the Almoravids (1040–1147).[30] Historian Évariste Lévi-Provençal dates the beginning of teaching to the Marinid period (1244–1465).[33]\n\n\nIn the 10th century, the Idrisid dynasty fell from power and Fez was contested between the Fatimid and Córdoban Umayyad caliphates and their allies.[17] During this period, the Qarawiyyin Mosque progressively grew in prestige. At some point the *khutba* (Friday sermon) was transferred from the Shurafa Mosque of Idris II (today the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II) to the Qarawiyyin Mosque, granting it the status of Friday mosque (the community's main mosque). This transfer happened either in 919 or in 933, both dates that correspond to brief periods of Fatimid domination over the city, and suggests that the transfer may have occurred by Fatimid initiative.[5]: 12 The mosque and its learning institution continued to enjoy the respect of political elites, with the mosque itself being significantly expanded by the Almoravids and repeatedly embellished under subsequent dynasties.[5] Tradition was established that all the other mosques in Fez based the timing of their call to prayer (*adhan*) according to that of al-Qarawiyyin.[34]\n\n\n\n### Apogee during the Marinid period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Reconstruction of the 14th-century water clock from the *dar al-muwaqqit* of the Qarawiyyin Mosque (on display at the Istanbul Museum of the History of Science and Technology in Islam)\nMany scholars consider al-Qarawiyyin's high point as an intellectual and scholarly center to be in the 13th and 14th centuries, when the curriculum was at its broadest and its prestige had reached new heights after centuries of expansion and elite patronage.[1][34][30]: 141 Among the subjects taught around this period or shortly after were traditional religious subjects such as the Quran and *fiqh* (Islamic jurisprudence), and other sciences like grammar, rhetoric, logic, medicine, mathematics, astronomy and geography.[30][26][1][22]: 455 By contrast, some subjects like alchemy/chemistry were never officially taught as they were considered too unorthodox.[22]: 455\n\n![](image)The Al-Attarine Madrasa (founded in 1323), just north of the Qarawiyyin MosqueStarting in the late 13th century, and especially in the 14th century, the Marinid dynasty was responsible for constructing a number of formal madrasas in the areas around al-Qarawiyyin's main building. The first of these was the Saffarin Madrasa in 1271, followed by al-Attarine in 1323, and the Mesbahiya Madrasa in 1346.[35] A larger but much later madrasa, the Cherratine Madrasa, was also built nearby in 1670.[36] These madrasas taught their own courses and sometimes became well-known institutions, but they usually had narrower curricula or specializations.[34]: 141[37] One of their most important functions seems to have been to provide housing for students from other towns and cities – many of them poor – who needed a place to stay while studying at al-Qarawiyyin.[38]: 137[34]: 110[22]: 463 Thus, these buildings acted as complimentary or auxiliary institutions to al-Qarawiyyin itself, which remained the center of intellectual life in the city.\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin also compiled a large selection of manuscripts that were kept at a library founded by the Marinid sultan Abu Inan Faris in 1349.[5][39] The collection housed numerous works from the Maghreb, al-Andalus, and the Middle East.[40] Part of the collection was gathered decades earlier by Sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub (ruled 1258–1286), who persuaded Sancho IV of Castile to hand over a number of works from the libraries of Seville, Córdoba, Almeria, Granada, and Malaga in al-Andalus/Spain. Abu Yusuf initially housed these in the nearby Saffarin Madrasa (which he had recently built), but later moved them to al-Qarawiyyin.[40] Among the most precious manuscripts currently housed in the library are volumes from the *Al-Muwatta* of Malik written on gazelle parchment,[41] a copy of the *Sirat* by Ibn Ishaq,[41] a 9th-century Quran manuscript (also written on gazelle parchment),[34]: 148 a copy of the Quran given by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur in 1602,[41] a copy of Ibn Rushd's *Al-Bayan Wa-al-Tahsil wa-al-Tawjih* (a commentary on *Maliki* *fiqh*) dating from 1320,[42][34]: 143 and the original copy of Ibn Khaldun's book *Al-'Ibar* (including the *Muqaddimah*) gifted by the author in 1396.[41][37] Recently rediscovered in the library is an *ijazah* certificate, written on deer parchment, which some scholars claim to be the oldest surviving predecessor of a Medical Doctorate degree, issued to a man called Abdellah Ben Saleh Al Koutami in 1207 CE under the authority of three other doctors and in the presence of the chief *qadi* (judge) of the city and two other witnesses.[43][44] The library was managed by a *qayim* or conservator, who oversaw the maintenance of the collection.[34]: 143[40] By 1613 one conservator estimated the library's collection at 32,000 volumes.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)A document from the Qarawiyyin's library which is claimed by some scholars to be the world's oldest surviving medical degree, issued in 1207 CE\nStudents were male, but traditionally it has been said that \"facilities were at times provided for interested women to listen to the discourse while accommodated in a special gallery (*riwaq*) overlooking the scholars' circle\".[26] The 12th-century cartographer Mohammed al-Idrisi, whose maps aided European exploration during the Renaissance, is said to have lived in Fez for some time, suggesting that he may have worked or studied at al-Qarawiyyin. The institution has produced numerous scholars who have strongly influenced the intellectual and academic history of the Muslim world. Among them are Ibn Rushayd al-Sabti (d. 1321), Mohammed Ibn al-Hajj al-Abdari al-Fasi (d. 1336), Abu Imran al-Fasi (d. 1015) – a leading theorist of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, and Leo Africanus. Pioneer scholars such as Muhammad al-Idrissi (d.1166 AD), Ibn al-Arabi (1165–1240 AD), Ibn Khaldun (1332–1395 AD), Ibn al-Khatib (d. 1374), Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji (Alpetragius) (d. 1294), and Ali ibn Hirzihim (d. 1163) were all connected with al-Qarawiyyin as either students or lecturers.[41] Some Christian scholars visited al-Qarawiyyin, including Nicolas Cleynaerts (d. 1542)[45][34]: 252 and the Jacobus Golius (d. 1667).[41] The 19th-century orientalist Jousé Ponteleimon Krestovitich also claimed that Gerbert d'Aurillac (later Pope Sylvester II) studied at al-Qarawiyyin in the 10th century.[46][34]: 138 Although this claim about Gerbert is sometimes repeated by modern authors,[20][47] modern scholarship has not produced evidence to support this story.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Decline and reforms[edit]\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin underwent a general decline in later centuries along with Fez. The strength of its teaching stagnated and its curriculum decreased in range and scope, becoming focused on traditional Islamic sciences and Arabic linguistic studies. Even some traditional Islamic specializations like *tafsir* (Quranic exegesis) were progressively neglected or abandoned.[1][30] In 1788–89, the Alaouite sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah introduced reforms that regulated the institution's program, but also imposed stricter limits and excluded logic, philosophy, and the more radical Sufi texts from the curriculum.[26][30][50] Other subjects also disappeared over time, such as astronomy and medicine.[30] In 1845 Sultan Abd al-Rahman carried out further reforms, but it is unclear if this had any significant long-term effects.[1][30] Between 1830 and 1906 the number of faculty decreased from 425 to 266 (of which, among the latter, only 101 were still teaching).[1]: 71\n\n\nBy the 19th century, the mosque's library also suffered from decline and neglect.[30][40] A significant portion of its collection was lost over time, most likely due to lax supervision and to books that were not returned.[22]: 472 By the beginning of the 20th century, the collection had been reduced to around 1,600 manuscripts and 400 printed books, though many valuable historic items were retained.[30]\n\n\n\n### 20th century and transformation into state university[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qarawiyyin Mosque in 1916\nAt the time Morocco became a French protectorate in 1912, al-Qarawiyyin worsened as a religious center of learning from its medieval prime,[1] though it retained some significance as an educational venue for the sultan's administration.[1] The student body was rigidly divided along social strata: ethnicity (Arab or Berber), social status, personal wealth, and geographic background (rural or urban) determined the group membership of the students who were segregated by the teaching facility, as well as in their personal quarters.[1] The French administration implemented a number of structural reforms between 1914 and 1947, including the institution of calendars, appointment of teachers, salaries, schedules, general administration, and the replacement of the *ijazah* with the *shahada alamiyha,* but did not modernize the contents of teaching likewise which were still dominated by the traditional worldviews of the *ulama*.[1] At the same time, the student numbers at al-Qarawiyyin decreased to 300 in 1922 as the Moroccan elite sent their children to the newly founded Western-style colleges and institutes elsewhere in the country.[1] In 1931 and 1933, on the orders of Muhammad V, al-Qarawiyyin's teaching was reorganized into elementary, secondary, and higher education.[30][26][50]\n\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin also played a role in the Moroccan nationalist movement and in protests against the French colonial regime. Many Moroccan nationalists had received their education here and some of their informal political networks were established due to the shared educational background.[51]: 140, 146 In July 1930, al-Qarawiyyin strongly participated in the propagation of *Ya Latif*, a communal prayer recited in times of calamity, to raise awareness and opposition to the Berber Dahir decreed by the French authorities two months earlier.[52][51]: 143–144 In 1937 the mosque was one of the rallying points (along with the nearby R'cif mosque) for demonstrations in response to a violent crackdown on Moroccan protesters in Meknes, which ended with French troops being deployed across Fes el-Bali and at the mosques.[17]: 387–389[51]: 168\n\n![](image)The main entrance to the library and other southern annexes of the mosque today, off Place SeffarineIn 1947 al-Qarawiyyin was integrated into the state educational system,[7] and women were first admitted to study there during the 1940s.[15] In 1963, after Moroccan independence, al-Qarawiyyin was officially transformed by royal decree into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education.[1][53][2] Classes at the old mosque ceased and a new campus was established at a former French Army barracks.[1] While the dean took his seat at Fez, four faculties were founded in and outside the city: a faculty of Islamic law in Fez, a faculty of Arab studies in Marrakech, and two faculties of theology in Tétouan and near Agadir. Modern curricula and textbooks were introduced and the professional training of the teachers improved.[1][54] Following the reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" in 1965.[1]\n\n\nIn 1975, General Studies was transferred to the newly founded Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University; al-Qarawiyyin kept the Islamic and theological courses of studies.[*citation needed*] In 1973, Abdelhadi Tazi published a three-volume history of the establishment entitled جامع القرويين (*The al-Qarawiyyin Mosque*).[55]\n\n\nIn 1988, after a hiatus of almost three decades, the teaching of traditional Islamic education at al-Qarawiyyin was resumed by King Hassan II in what has been interpreted as a move to bolster conservative support for the monarchy.[1]\n\n\n\n## Education and curriculum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scholar at the Al-Qarawiyyin library\nEducation at al-Qarawiyyin University concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and Maliki law, though some lessons on other non-Islamic subjects such as French and English are also offered to students.[56][57] Teaching is delivered with students seated in a semi-circle around a sheikh, who prompts them to read sections of a particular text; asks them questions on particular points of grammar, law, or interpretation; and explains difficult points. Students from Morocco and Islamic West Africa attend al-Qarawiyyin, though some come from Muslim Central Asia. Spanish Muslim converts frequently attend the institution, largely attracted by the fact that the sheikhs of al-Qarawiyyin, and Islamic scholarship in Morocco in general, are heirs to the rich, religious, and scholarly heritage of Muslim al-Andalus.[56]\n\n\nMost students at al-Qarawiyyin range are between 13 and 30 years old, and study towards high school-level diplomas and university-level bachelor's degrees, although Muslims with a sufficiently high level of Arabic can attend lecture circles on an informal basis, given the traditional category of visitors \"in search of [religious and legal] knowledge\" (\"zuwwaar li'l-talab fii 'ilm\"). In addition to being Muslim, prospective students of al-Qarawiyyin are required to have fully memorized the Quran, as well as other shorter medieval Islamic texts on grammar and *Maliki* law, and to be proficient in classical Arabic.[56][58]\n\n\n\n## Architecture of the mosque[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Floor plan of the mosque and some of its annexes. (Based on an early 20th-century survey; since then the southern part of the complex, the library, has been modified.)Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque was founded in the 9th century, but its present form is the result of a long historical evolution over the course of more than 1,000 years. Successive dynasties expanded the mosque until it became the largest in Africa, with a capacity of 22,000 worshipers.[59] The present-day mosque covers an extensive area of about half a hectare.[34]: 136 Broadly speaking, it consists of a large hypostyle interior space for prayers (the prayer hall), a courtyard with fountains (the *sahn*), a minaret at the courtyard's western end, and a number of annexes around the mosque itself.\n\n\n### Historical evolution[edit]\n\n\n#### Early history (9th–10th centuries)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arches in the prayer hall of the mosque\nThe original mosque building was built in the 9th century. A major modern study of the mosque's structure, published by French archeologist and historian Henri Terrasse in 1968, determined that traces of the original mosque could be found in the layout of the current building.[5]: 10 This initial form of the mosque occupied a large space immediately to the south of the *sahn*, in what is now the prayer hall.[5][60]: 119 It had a rectangular floor plan measuring 36 by 32 meters, covering an area of 1520 square meters, and was composed of a prayer hall with four transverse aisles running roughly east–west, parallel to the southern *qibla* wall.[5][34]: 135 It probably also had a courtyard of relatively small size, and the first minaret, also of small size, reportedly stood on the location now occupied by the wooden *anaza* (at the central entrance to the prayer hall from the courtyard).[5] Water for the mosque was initially provided by a well dug within the mosque's precinct.[5]\n\n\nAs Fez grew and the mosque increased in prestige, the original building was insufficient for its religious and institutional needs.[5][34] During the 10th century, the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and the Fatimid Caliphate constantly fought for control over Fez and Morocco, seen as a buffer zone between the two.[17] Despite this uncertain period, the mosque received significant patronage and had its first expansions. The Zenata Berber emir Ahmed ibn Abi Said, one of the rulers of Fez during this period who was aligned with the Umayyads, wrote to the caliph Abd al-Rahman III in Córdoba for permission and funds to expand the mosque.[5] The caliph approved, and the work was carried out or completed in 956.[5] It expanded the mosque on three sides, encompassing the area of the present-day courtyard to the north and up to the current eastern and western boundaries of the building.[60] It also replaced the original minaret with a new, larger minaret still standing today. Its overall form, with a square shaft, was indicative of the subsequent development of Maghrebi and Andalusian minarets.[5][60]\n\n\nThe mosque was embellished when the Amirid ruler al-Muzaffar (son of al-Mansur) led a military expedition to Fez in 998. The embellishments included a new *minbar* and a dome topped by talismans in the shape of a rat, a serpent, and a scorpion.[5] Of these, only the dome itself, whose exterior is distinctively fluted or grooved, survives today, located above the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall. A similar dome, located across the courtyard over the northern entrance of the mosque (*Bab al-Ward* or \"Gate of the Rose\"), likely also dates from the same time.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Almoravid expansion (12th century)[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most significant expansions and renovations was carried out between 1135 and 1143 under the patronage of the Almoravid ruler Ali ibn Yusuf.[5] The prayer hall was extended by dismantling the existing southern wall and adding three more transverse aisles for a total of ten, while replicating the format of the existing arches of the mosque.[5][60] This expansion required the purchase and demolition of a number of neighboring houses and structures, including some that were apparently part of the nearby Jewish neighbourhood (before the Mellah of Fez).[5]\n\n\nThe new expansion of the mosque involved not only a new *mihrab* in the middle of the new southern wall, but also the reconstruction or embellishment of the prayer hall's central nave (the arches along its central axis, in a line perpendicular to the southern wall and to the other rows of arches) leading from the courtyard to the *mihrab*. This involved not only embellishing some of the arches with new forms but also adding a series of highly elaborate cupola ceilings composed in *muqarnas* (honeycomb or stalactite-like) sculpting and further decorated with intricate reliefs of arabesques and Kufic letters.[5][62] The craftsmen who worked on this expansion are mostly anonymous, except for two names that are carved on the bases of two of the cupolas: Ibrāhīm and Salāma ibn Mufarrij, who may have been of Andalusi origin.[62]: 76 Lastly, a new *minbar* in similar style and of similar artistic provenance as the *minbar* of the Koutoubia Mosque was completed and installed in 1144.[5] It is made of wood in an elaborate work of marquetry, and decorated with inlaid materials and intricately carved arabesque reliefs. Its style was emulated for later Moroccan minbars.[5][62]\n\n\nElsewhere, many of the mosque's main entrances were given doors made of wood overlaid with ornate bronze fittings, which today count among the oldest surviving bronze artworks in Moroccan architecture.[38][5] Another interesting element added to the mosque was a small secondary oratory, known as the *Jama' al-Gnaiz* (\"Funeral Mosque\" or \"Mosque of the Dead\"), which was separated from the main prayer hall and dedicated to providing funerary rites for the deceased before their burial.[5] The annex is also decorated with a *muqarnas* cupola and ornate archways and windows.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Almohad period (12th–13th centuries)[edit]\n\n\nLater dynasties continued to embellish the mosque or gift it with new furnishings, though no works as radical as the Almoravid expansion were undertaken again. The Almohads (later 12th century and 13th century) conquered Fez after a long siege in 1145–1146.[22][5] Historical sources (particularly the *Rawd al-Qirtas*) report a story claiming that the inhabitants of Fez, fearful that the \"puritan\" Almohads would resent the lavish decoration placed inside the mosque, used whitewash to cover up the most ornate decorations from Ibn Yusuf's expansion near the *mihrab.*[5]: 25–26 Terrasse suggests this operation may have actually been carried out a few years later by the Almohad authorities themselves.[5] The Almoravid ornamentation was only fully uncovered again during renovations in the early 20th century.[63][5] The plaster used to cover the Almoravid decoration seems to have been prepared too quickly and did not fully bond with the existing surface. This ended up making its removal easier during modern restorations and has helped to preserve much of the original Almoravid decoration now visible again today.[62]: 64\n\n\nUnder the reign of Muhammad al-Nasir (r. 1199–1213), the Almohads added and upgraded a number of elements in the mosque, some of which were nonetheless marked with strong decorative flourishes. The ablutions facilities in the courtyard were upgraded, a separate ablutions room was added to the north, and a new underground storage room was created.[5] They also replaced the mosque's grand chandelier with one made of bronze, which Terrasse described as \"the largest and most beautiful chandelier in the Islamic world,\" and which hangs in the central nave of the mosque today.[64][5][60][65] It was commissioned by Abu Muhammad 'Abd Allah ibn Musa, the *khatib* of the mosque during the years 1202 to 1219.[60]: 334 The chandelier has the shape of a 12-sided cupola surmounted by a large cone, around which are nine levels that hold candlesticks. It could originally hold 520 oil candles; the cost of providing the oil was so significant that it was only lit on special occasions, such as on the nights of Ramadan. The Marinid sultan Abu Ya'qub Yusuf (r. 1286–1307), upon seeing the cost, ordered that it only be lit for the last day of Ramadan. The visible surfaces of the chandelier are carved and pierced with intricate floral arabesque motifs as well as Kufic Arabic inscriptions. The chandelier is the oldest surviving chandelier in the western Islamic world, and it likely served as a model for the Marinid chandelier in the Great Mosque of Taza.[60]: 334\n\n\n\n#### Marinid period (13th–14th centuries)[edit]\n\n\nThe Marinids, who were responsible for building many of the madrasas around Fez, made various contributions to the mosque. In 1286 they restored and protected the 10th-century minaret, which had been made from deteriorating poor-quality stone with whitewash.[5] At its southern foot, they also built the *Dar al-Muwaqqit*, a chamber for the timekeeper (*muwaqqit*) of the mosque who was responsible for determining the precise times of prayer. The chamber was equipped with astrolabes and other scientific equipment of the era in order to aid in this task. Several water clocks were built for it in this period. The first two do not exist anymore, but are described by al-Jazna'i in the *Zahrat al-As*.[61] The first was commissioned by Abu Yusuf Ya'qub in the 13th century and designed by Muhammad ibn al-Habbak, a *faqih* and *muwaqqit*.[66][67] The second was built in 1317 or 1318 (717 AH), under the reign of Abu Sa'id, by a scholar named Abu Abdullah Muhammad al-Sanhaji. Its time divisions were engraved by Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn al-Saddina al-Qarsatuni. The clock was neglected then restored between 1346 and 1349 (747–749 AH) by a new *muwaqqit*, Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn al-'Arabi.[61][5]: 62[60]: 492 A third and final water clock, built on the orders of Sultan Abu Salim Ali II (ruled 1359–1361), is still partly preserved today.[60][68][69] It was designed by Abu Zayd Abd al-Rahman ibn Sulayman al-Laja'i and completed on November 20, 1361 (21 Muharram 763 AH), as recorded by an original inscription. It features a large astrolabe with a diameter of 71 cm, which is embedded into a wooden structure in the corner of the room, but its mechanism is no longer present.[61]\n\n* ![View of the Dar al-Muwaqqit, with its double-arched window overlooking the courtyard](image)\n\nView of the *Dar al-Muwaqqit*, with its double-arched window overlooking the courtyard\n* ![The astrolabe of the water clock device completed in 1361 by al-Laja'i](image)\n\nThe astrolabe of the water clock device completed in 1361 by al-Laja'i\n\nThe galleries around the *sahn* were also rebuilt or repaired in 1283 and 1296–97, while at the entrance from the courtyard to the prayer hall (leading to the central nave of the mihrab), a decorative wooden screen, called the *anaza,* was installed in 1289 and acted as a symbolic \"outdoor\" or \"summer\" mihrab for prayers in the courtyard.[5] The stucco decoration on the entrance arch itself, however, dates from much later.[61] At the central outer entrance to the courtyard from the north, the cupola ceiling over the entrance vestibule of the gate called *Bab al-Ward* (\"Gate of the Rose\") was redecorated with carved stucco in 1337.[5][61] The richly-sculpted archway on the inner side of the gate also dates from this time.[61]\n\n* ![Marinid decoration in the cupola over the vestibule of Bab al-Ward, the central northern gate of the mosque](image)\n\nMarinid decoration in the cupola over the vestibule of *Bab al-Ward*, the central northern gate of the mosque\n* ![Inner façade of Bab al-Ward, with Marinid-era stucco embellishment](image)\n\nInner façade of *Bab al-Ward*, with Marinid-era stucco embellishment\n* ![The wooden anaza at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall](image)\n\nThe wooden *anaza* at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall\n\nA number of ornate metal chandeliers hanging in the mosque's prayer hall date from the Marinid era. Three of them were made from church bells which Marinid craftsmen used as a base onto which they grafted ornate copper fittings. The largest of them, installed in the mosque in 1337, was a bell brought back from Gibraltar by the son of Sultan Abu al-Hasan, Abu Malik, after its reconquest from Spanish forces in 1333.[5]\n\n\nThe mosque's library was officially founded by Sultan Abu Inan in 1349 (750 AH), as dated by an inscription over its doorway.[5]: 64[20] This first Marinid library was located at the mosque's northeastern corner (as opposed to the library's current southern location).[20] In 1361, Sultan Abu Salim added a room to it, which was built above and over the adjacent street, and dedicated to readings of the Quran.[5]: 64\n\n\n\n#### Saadian and Alaouite period (16th-century to modern era)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the Saadian pavilions (late 16th and early 17th century) in the courtyard, featuring carved wood and stucco decoration\nThe Saadians embellished the mosque by adding two prominent pavilions to the western and eastern ends of the courtyard, each of which sheltered a new fountain. The Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur was responsible for building the first pavilion to the east in 1587–88, while the western pavilion was added by his grandson Abdallah al-Ghalib II in 1609.[70]: 100 The pavilions emulate the ones in the Court of Lions of the Alhambra palaces (in Granada, Spain).[5][70] Al-Mansur also built a new room for the library on the south side of the mosque (around the library's current location), which was connected to the mosque via a door in the *qibla* wall.[71][20]\n\n\nThe Alaouite dynasty, which has ruled Morocco from the 17th century onward, continued to perform minor additions and regular maintenance on the mosque. A ribbed cupola in the central nave, where the 1337 Marinid chandelier hangs, has been dated by Terrasse to the Alaouite period,[5] although Xavier Salmon has more recently argued that at least some elements of the dome seem to date from the Marinid era.[61] The stucco decoration of the central archway at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall (i.e. the arch inside which the Marinid-era *anaza* stands) also dates from the Alaouite period; an inscription at the top of the arch gives the year 1864–1865 (1281 AH).[61]\n\n\nThe present library building dates mainly from a major expansion and modification in the 20th century, particularly in the 1940s.[20][71]: 174 The new library expansion, which included a large new reading room, was inaugurated in 1949.[72]\n\n\n\n### Current structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Exterior[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nDoors of Bab al-Gna'iz today, with replicas of the original Almoravid bronze overlays\n![](image)\nFragments of the original bronze overlays of Bab al-Gna'iz, dating to the Almoravid period\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin's exterior does not generally present a monumental appearance and is integrated with the dense urban fabric around it. By one count there are 18 separate gates and entrances distributed around its perimeter.[34] The gates vary from small rectangular doorways to enormous horseshoe arches with huge doors preceded by wooden roofs covering the street in front of them.[5] While the doors are generally made of wood, some of the gates have extensive ornate bronze overlays crafted during the Almoravid period.[5] The most ornate and best-preserved examples include the doors of the principal northern gate, *Bab al-Ward* (which opens onto the courtyard), the western gate called *Bab Sbitriyyin*, and the southwestern gate *Bab al-Gna'iz*, which leads to the *Jama' al-Gna'iz*.[5][62] While the doors of *Bab al-Ward* preserve original pieces and were restored in 2005–2007, the doors of *Bab al-Gna'iz* and *Bab Sbitriyyin* are replicas made in the 1950s that replaced the originals, whose fragments are kept by the Dar Batha Museum.[60]: 56[a] The northwestern gates of the mosque, *Bab al-Shama'in* (or *Bab Chemaine*) and *Bab al-Maqsura*, also have heavy bronze fittings, including some ornate knockers that date from the Almoravid period.[5]\n\n\nAdjacent to *Bab al-Ward*, on its west side, is another doorway, *Bab al-Hafa* (\"Gate of the Barefooted\"). This gate dates to the Almohad era. It is distinguished by a small water channel that runs across the floor just inside it. The channel allowed worshipers entering the mosque to wash their feet on the way in, helping with initial ablutions.[36][5]\n\n\nNext to the mosque is a tower known as the *Borj Neffara* (برج النفارة, \"Tower of the Trumpeters\"), an observation tower that is sometimes confused as a minaret but was actually part of another *Dar al-Muwaqqit*.[73][38]: 150\n\n\n\n#### Prayer hall[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe central nave of the mosque, leading towards the *mihrab*, with some of the Almohad and Marinid chandeliers visible\n![](image)\nThe *mihrab* (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer)\n\nThe interior hypostyle prayer hall takes up most of the mosque's area. Like the interior of most traditional mosques in Moroccan architecture, it is a relatively austere space with mostly plain walls, wooden roofs, and rows upon rows of arches. The main area, south of the courtyard, is a vast space divided into ten transverse aisles by rows of arches running parallel to the southern wall.[5] The southern wall of this hall also marks the *qibla*. The central axis of the prayer hall, perpendicular to the *qibla* wall, is marked by a central nave running between two extra lines of arches along this axis, perpendicular to the other arches.[5] This nave leads towards the *mihrab:* a niche in the *qibla* wall which symbolizes the direction of prayer, and in front of which the imam usually leads prayers and delivers sermons. This overall layout (a hypostyle hall with a central nave emphasized against the others) is a familiar layout for North African mosques generally.[5][71]\n\n\nThe *mihrab*, which dates from the Almoravid (12th-century) expansion, is decorated with carved and painted stucco, as well as several windows of coloured glass. The *mihrab* niche itself is a small alcove which is covered by a small dome of *muqarnas* (stalactite or honeycomb-like sculpting).[62] On each side of the *mihrab*'s opening is a pair of engaged marble columns topped by deeply-carved capitals. These capitals are spolia from al-Andalus, dating from the time of the Caliphate of Córdoba, which were re-appropriated by the Almoravids for Ali Ibn Yusuf's expansion of the mosque.[62]: 60 On the mihrab's façade, the stucco ornamentation of the lower parts, immediately around the arch itself, was most likely redone in the 16th and/or early 19th centuries. The stucco decoration of the upper wall above this still dates from the Almoravid period. The Almoravid decoration prioritizes floral motifs, which contain more diversity than the later restorations below, over which bands of Kufic inscriptions have also been carved.[62]: 72–76\n\n\nThe central nave that runs along the axis of the *mihrab* is distinguished from the rest of the mosque by a number of architectural embellishments. The arches that run along it are of varying shapes, including both horseshoe arches and multi-lobed arches.[5] Instead of the plain timber ceilings, most sections of the nave are covered by a series of intricate *muqarnas* ceilings and cupolas, each slightly different from the other, as well as two \"ribbed\" dome cupolas (similar to the domes of the Great Mosque of Córdoba and Cristo de la Luz Mosque in Toledo) dating from the Almoravid and Alaouite periods.[5] The muqarnas vaults are made of plaster and are suspended from a hidden framework of wooden struts above them.[21]: 119–120 Many of the *muqarnas* compositions are further embellished with intricate reliefs of arabesques and Arabic inscriptions in both Kufic and cursive letters, highlighted with blue and red colours.[5][62][21]: 119–120 Additionally, there are several elaborately carved bronze chandeliers hanging in the nave which were gifted to the mosque during the Almohad and Marinid eras; at least three of which were made from bells (probably church bells) brought back from victories in Spain.[5][74]\n\n\nTo the right of the *mihrab* is the *minbar* of the mosque, which could also be stored in a small room behind a door in the *qibla* wall. The *minbar* is most likely of similar origins as the Almoravid *minbar* of the Koutoubia Mosque, made by a workshop in Córdoba not long after the latter and installed in al-Qarawiyyin Mosque in 1144 (at the end of the Almoravid works on the mosque).[5] It is another exceptional work of marquetry and woodcarving, decorated with geometric compositions, inlaid materials, and arabesque reliefs.[5][62]\n\n\nAside from the embellishments of the central nave, the rest of the mosque is architecturally uniform, but there are some minor irregularities in the floor plan. For example, the arches in the western half of the prayer hall are shorter than those in the eastern half, and some of the transverse aisles are slightly wider than others. These anomalies have not been fully explained but they appear to have been present since the early centuries of the mosque; they may be due to early reconstructions or alterations which have gone unrecorded in historical chronicles.[5]\n\n\n\n#### *Sahn*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The courtyard (*sahn*) of the Qarawiyyin Mosque, including the central fountain and one of the Saadian-era pavilions\nThe *sahn* is rectangular, surrounded by the prayer hall on three sides and by a gallery to the north. The floor is paved with typical Moroccan mosaic tiles (*zellij*) and at the center is a fountain.[71] From outside the mosque, the courtyard is accessed by the main northern gate, called *Bab al-Ward*, whose vestibule is covered by a Marinid-era white dome which is fluted on the outside and covered in painted and carved stucco on the inside.[5] Opposite this gate, situated on the mihrab axis, is the central entrance to the interior prayer hall, guarded by a carved and painted wooden screen called the *anaza* which also acted as a symbolic \"outdoor\" or \"summer\" mihrab for prayers taking place in the courtyard.[5] (These features are visible to visitors standing outside the gate.) Both this entrance to the prayer hall and the outer gate across from it have facades decorated with carved and painted stucco.[5]\n\n\nAt the western and eastern ends of the courtyard stand two ornate Saadian pavilions each sheltering another fountain. The pavilions have pyramidal domes and emulate the pavilions in the Court of the Lions in the Alhambra (Spain).[5] They are decorated with carved wood and stucco, mosaic-tiled walls, and marble columns.[70] Behind these pavilions are extensions of the main prayer hall divided into four naves by rows of arches.[5] The gallery and arched hall on the northeastern sides of the courtyard are a prayer space reserved for women.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Minaret[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nView of the minaret from the east\n![](image)\nView from the south, with the unusual vertically-elongated lobed window visible\n\nThe minaret was constructed in the 10th century under the sponsorship of the Umayyad caliph of Córdoba, Abd al-Rahman III.[75] It overlooks the courtyard from the west. Along with the contemporary minaret of the Mosque of the Andalusians, it is the oldest preserved minaret in Morocco.[60]: 126 It was constructed in local limestone of relatively poor quality and was covered in whitewash by the Marinids in the 13th century in order to protect it from deterioration. It has a square shaft and is topped by a dome, as well as a parapet from which the muezzin historically issued the call to prayer (*adhan*). The full structure is 26.75 meters tall.[5] One feature of the minaret is the lower window on its southern facade, which is shaped like a \"triple\" horseshoe arch, elongated vertically, which is unique to this structure.[60] On the minaret's southern side, just above the gallery of the courtyard, is the Dar al-Muwaqqit.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Funerary annex (*Jama' al-Gnaiz*)[edit]\n\n\nA number of annexes are attached around the mosque, serving various functions. The northwestern edge of the building is occupied by latrines.[5] Behind the southern *qibla* wall, to the west of the *mihrab* axis, is the *Jama' al-Gnaiz*, which served as a separate oratory reserved for funerary rites. This type of facility was not particularly common in the Islamic world but there are several examples in Fez, including at the Chrabliyine and Bab Guissa Mosques. It was kept separate from the main mosque to preserve the purity of the latter as a regular prayer space, which could be soiled by the presence of a dead body.[5][62] This oratory dates back to the Almoravid period and also features embellishments such as a *muqarnas* cupola and a number of ornate archways in varying forms.[5][62] Spoliated capitals from al-Andalus are also re-used here in the doorways leading from the prayer hall to the funerary annex and in the columns supporting the *muqarnas* cupola.[62]: 60\n\n\n\n#### Library[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nView into the modern reading room (قاعة المطالعة) of the Qarawiyyin library\n\nBehind the southern wall of the mosque and east of the *mihrab* axis is the historic library of the mosque and university.[5] It is sometimes cited as the world's oldest library that remains open.[34]: 147[76][77] The first purpose-built library structure was added to the mosque by the Marinid sultan Abu Inan Faris in 1349 CE, though it was located at the mosque's northeastern corner instead of to the south.[78][5] The first structure still exists embedded near the women's section of the mosque, and consists of a square chamber measuring 5.4 meters per side. Its entrance is covered by a wooden screen from the Marinid period which features an inscription carved in cursive Arabic above the doorway recording Abu Inan's foundation of the library.[5]: 64\n\n\nThe current library building dates in part from a Saadian construction by Ahmad al-Mansur (late 16th century), who built a chamber called *al-Ahmadiyya* behind the *qibla* wall.[40] Most of the building dates from a major 20th-century expansion commissioned by King Mohammed V that started in 1940. It included the current grand reading room, which measures 23 metres long and features an ornately-painted wooden ceiling, and also added an entrance outside the mosque which made it accessible to non-Muslims.[40][39] This new library expansion was inaugurated in 1949.[72] The library complex underwent another major restoration in recent years led by Aziza Chaouni and was set to reopen in 2016 or 2017.[79][76][77][80]\n\n\n\n## Status as world's oldest university[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Madrasa § Madrasa and university\n\nUNESCO has previously described al-Qarawiyyin to be the \"oldest university in the world\" in the World Heritage Sites entry for Medina of Fez.[13] UNESCO describes the University of Bologna (founded in 1088 and usually recognized as the oldest medieval European university) as the \"oldest university of the Western world\".[81] Some historians and scholars also refer to al-Qarawiyyin as the world's oldest existing university.[34]: 137[82][83][44][84][85] The claim is also published by the *Guinness World Records*, under its entry for \"[o]ldest higher-learning institution, oldest university\", where it describes al-Qarawiyyin as the \"oldest existing, and continually operating educational institution in the world\", while the University of Bologna is described as the \"oldest one in Europe\".[86] Similarly, the *Encyclopædia Britannica* dates al-Qarawiyyin University's foundation to the mosque's foundation in 859[87] and generally considers that \"universities\" existed outside Europe before the advent of the European university model.[88] Other sources also refer to the historical or pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin as a \"university\" or an \"Islamic university\".[89][90]\n\n\nMany scholars consider the term *university* to be applicable only to the educational institutions that initially took form in medieval Christian Europe, and argue that the first universities were located in Western Europe, with those of Paris and Bologna often cited as the earliest examples.[91][92][93][94][95][96][97] The modern Western university model is thus widely argued to descend from this European tradition, even if other models of higher education existed in other parts of the world.[97][88][98] Jacques Verger says that while the term *university* is occasionally applied by scholars to madrasas and other pre-modern higher learning institutions out of convenience, the European university marked a major disruption between earlier institutions of higher learning and was the earliest true modern university.[11] Many scholars consider that the university was only adopted outside the West, including into the Islamic world, in the course of modernization programs or under European colonial regimes since the beginning of the 19th century.[99][100][11][101]\n\n\nAmong opposing views, Yahya Pallavicini claims that the university model did not spread in Europe until the 12th century and that it was found throughout the Muslim world from the founding of al-Qarawiyyin in the 9th century until at least European colonialism.[82] Some scholars, noting certain parallels between such madrasas and European medieval universities, have proposed that the latter may have been influenced by the madrasas of the Muslim world, in particular via Islamic Spain and the Emirate of Sicily.[102][103][104] Other scholars have questioned this, citing the lack of evidence for an actual transmission from the Islamic world to Christian Europe and highlighting the differences in the structure, methodologies, procedures, curricula and legal status of the madrasa versus the European university.[105][106]\n\n\nSome scholars consider that al-Qarawiyyin operated essentially as an Islamic madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] These scholars date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[3][1][2] In the wake of these reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later.[1] Organization at the pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin differed from European universities and other Muslim institutions at al-Azhar (in Cairo) and al-Zaytouna (in Tunis) in that there was no defined scholastic year, registration was not imposed, study durations were not fixed, and there was no examination to ratify studies.[30] Students were expected to attend courses for a minimum of five years and would receive an *ijazah* if they were proven to have reached a high level of expertise.[22]: 457[30][102][43]\n\n\nThe earliest date of formal teaching at al-Qarawiyyin is also uncertain.[30][22] The most relevant major historical texts like the *Rawd al-Qirtas* and the *Zahrat al-As* do not provide clear details on the history of teaching at the mosque.[22]: 453 In the *Rawd al-Qirtas*, Ibn Abi Zar mentions the mosque but not its educational function. Al-Jazna'i, the 14th-century author of the *Zahrat al-As*, mentions that teaching had taken place there well before his time, but with no other details.[31]: 175 Otherwise, the earliest mentions of *halaqa* for learning and teaching may not have been until the 10th or the 12th century.[32][26] Moroccan historian Mohammed Al-Manouni believes that it was during the reign of the Almoravids (1040–1147) that the mosque acquired its function as a teaching institution.[30] French historian Évariste Lévi-Provençal dates the beginning of the madrasa and teaching to the later Marinid period (1244–1465).[33] Another Moroccan historian, Abdelhadi Tazi, indicated the earliest evidence of teaching at al-Qarawiyyin in 1121.[25] Upon reviewing the evidence in Abdelhadi Tazi's work, Abdul Latif Tibawi states that:\n\n\n\n\n> This is considerably later than the beginning of instruction at the al-Azhar under the Fatimids. So it is very difficult to sustain the claim that the University of Qarawiyyin is the \"oldest university\", and not only in the Muslim world! The mosque school or college did not assume the name of university until 1960 when in a ceremony Muhammad V invested it with that dignified title.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nA number of well-known philosophers, scholars, and politicians in the history of Morocco and the western Mediterranean have either studied or taught at the Qarawiyyin since its founding.\n\n\n\n* Maimonides (1135/1138–1204), Jewish philosopher[1][108][109][110]\n* Ibn Arabi (1165–1240), Sufi philosopher[108][109]\n* Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406), historian and philosopher[1][108][37][109]\n* Leo Africanus (1494–1554), author[108]\n* Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari (1632-1577), historian and theologian, appointed imam and mufti by the Saadi Sultan Zaydan[111]\n* Imam al-Bannani (1727–1780), faqīh (Muslim jurist)[*citation needed*]\n* Ahmad ibn Idris (1760–1837), Moroccan Sufi scholar[112]\n* Muhammad al-Kattani (1873–1909), writer and political leader[113]\n* Abd el-Krim el-Khattabi (1882–1963), Rifian-Moroccan political and military leader[114]\n* Allal al-Fassi (1910–1974), Moroccan politician[115]\n* Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali (1893–1987), translator[116]\n* Abdullah al-Ghumari (1910–1993), faqīh (Muslim jurist)[117]\n* Fatima al-Kabbaj (1932–), Member of High Council of Knowledge [ar] (Islamic council) Notably, one of the first few women to be admitted.[15]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Morocco portal\n\n\n* List of Islamic educational institutions\n* List of universities in Morocco\n* Education in Morocco\n* History of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** One single plate from *Bab al-Gna'iz* is also kept by the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris.[60]: 56\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** Lulat, Y.

It was founded as a mosque in Fès in the middle of the ninth century. It has been a destination for students and scholars of Islamic sciences and Arabic studies throughout the history of Morocco. There were also other religious schools like the madras of ibn yusuf and other schools in the sus. This system of basic education called al-ta'lim al-aSil was funded by the sultans of Morocco and many famous traditional families. After independence, al-qarawiyin maintained its reputation, but it seemed important to transform it into a university that would prepare graduates for a modern country while maintaining an emphasis on Islamic studies. Hence, al-qarawiyin university was founded in February 1963 and, while the dean's residence was kept in Fès, the new university initially had four colleges located in major regions of the country known for their religious influences and madrasas. These colleges were kuliyat al-shari's in Fès, kuliyat uSul al-din in Tétouan, kuliyat al-lugha al-'arabiya in Marrakech (all founded in 1963), and kuliyat al-shari'a in Ait Melloul near Agadir, which was founded in 1979.\n> \n>\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Belhachmi, Zakia (2008). *Women, Education, and Science within the Arab-Islamic Socio-Cultural History: Legacies for Social Change*.

In terms of structure, the adjustments were twofold: the reorganization of the available original madaris, and the creation of new institutions. This resulted in three different types of Islamic teaching institutions in al-Maghrib. The first type was derived from the fusion of old madaris with new universities. For example, Morocco transformed Al-Qarawiyin (859 A.D) into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education in 1963.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Petersen, Andrew: *Dictionary of Islamic Architecture*, Routledge, 1996, ISBN 978-0-415-06084-4, p. 87 (entry \"Fez\"): \n> The Quaraouiyine Mosque, founded in 859, is the most famous mosque of Morocco and attracted continuous investment by Muslim rulers.\n> \n>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** ***ad*** ***ae*** ***af*** ***ag*** ***ah*** ***ai*** ***aj*** ***ak*** ***al*** ***am*** ***an*** ***ao*** ***ap*** ***aq*** ***ar*** ***as*** ***at*** ***au*** ***av*** ***aw*** ***ax*** ***ay*** ***az*** ***ba*** ***bb*** ***bc*** ***bd*** ***be*** ***bf*** ***bg*** ***bh*** ***bi*** ***bj*** ***bk*** ***bl*** ***bm*** ***bn*** ***bo*** ***bp*** Terrasse, Henri (1968). *La Mosquée al-Qaraouiyin à Fès; avec une étude de Gaston Deverdun sur les inscriptions historiques de la mosquée*.

For example many madrasah teachers are versed in Islamic pedagogy but also in modern university pedagogic developments such as behaviourist, cognitivist and the more recent constructivist styles. Al-Qarawiyyin University, in Morocco, represents such an institution that is grounded in a traditional madrasah education but for example, continues to adopt ancillary subjects and modern technologies such as mobile learning.\n10. **^** Makdisi, George: \"Madrasa and University in the Middle Ages\", *Studia Islamica*, No. 32 (1970), pp. 255–264 (255f.): \n> In studying an institution which is foreign and remote in point of time, as is the case of the medieval madrasa, one runs the double risk of attributing to it characteristics borrowed from one's own institutions and one's own times. Thus gratuitous transfers may be made from one culture to the other, and the time factor may be ignored or dismissed as being without significance. One cannot, therefore, be too careful in attempting a comparative study of these two institutions: the madrasa and the university. But in spite of the pitfalls inherent in such a study, albeit sketchy, the results which may be obtained are well worth the risks involved. In any case, one cannot avoid making comparisons when certain unwarranted statements have already been made and seem to be currently accepted without question. The most unwarranted of these statements is the one which makes of the \"madrasa\" a \"university\".\n> \n>\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Verger, Jacques: \"Patterns\", in: Ridder-Symoens, Hilde de (ed.): *A History of the University in Europe.

It is no doubt true that other civilizations, prior to, or wholly alien to, the medieval West, such as the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Islam, or China, were familiar with forms of higher education which a number of historians, for the sake of convenience, have sometimes described as universities. Yet a closer look makes it plain that the institutional reality was altogether different and, no matter what has been said on the subject, there is no real link such as would justify us in associating them with medieval universities in the West. Until there is definite proof to the contrary, these latter must be regarded as the sole source of the model which gradually spread through the whole of Europe and then to the whole world. We are therefore concerned with what is indisputably an original institution, which can only be defined in terms of a historical analysis of its emergence and its mode of operation in concrete circumstances.\n> \n>\n12. **^** \"Oldest higher-learning institution, oldest university\". *Guinness World Records*.

These centres were places where teachers and students of that time would meet and also where all intellectuals would gather and take part in extremely important scientific debates. It is not a coincidence that around the 9th century the first university in the world, the Qarawiyyin University in Fez, was established in the Muslim world followed by az-Zaytuna in Tunis and Al-Azhar in Cairo. The university model, which in the West was widespread starting only from the 12th century, had an extraordinary fortune and was spread throughout the Muslim world at least until the colonial period.\n83. **^** Hardaker, Glenn; Ahmad Sabki, A'ishah (2012). \"An insight into Islamic pedagogy at the University of al-Qarawiyyin\". *Multicultural Education & Technology Journal*. **6** (2): 106–110. doi:10.1108/17504971211236308.\n84. **^** Gathiram, Prem; Hänninen, Osmo (2014). \"Medicine and medical sciences in Africa\". *Pathophysiology*. **21** (2): 129–133. doi:10.1016/j.pathophys.2013.11.003.

There are various reasons for this assertion. As a community of teachers and taught, accorded certain rights, such as administrative autonomy and the determination and realization of curricula (courses of study) and of the objectives of research as well as the award of publicly recognized degrees, it is a creation of medieval Europe, which was the Europe of papal Christianity...\n> \n> \n> No other European institution has spread over the entire world in the way in which the traditional form of the European university has done. The degrees awarded by European universities – the bachelor's degree, the licentiate, the master's degree, and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world. The four medieval faculties of *artes* – variously called philosophy, letters, arts, arts and sciences, and humanities –, law, medicine, and theology have survived and have been supplemented by numerous disciplines, particularly the social sciences and technological studies, but they remain nonetheless at the heart of universities throughout the world.\n> \n> \n> Even the name of the *Universitas*, which in the Middle Ages was applied to corporate bodies of the most diverse sorts and was accordingly applied to the corporate organization of teachers and students, has in the course of centuries been given a more particular focus: the university, as a *universitas litterarum*, has since the eighteenth century been the intellectual institution which cultivates and transmits the entire corpus of methodically studied intellectual disciplines.\n> \n>\n101. **^** Sanz, Nuria; Bergan, Sjur (eds.): *The Heritage of European Universities*, Council of Europe, 2002, ISBN 978-92-871-4960-2, p. 119: \n> In many respects, if there is any institution that Europe can most justifiably claim as one of its inventions, it is the university.

It was founded as a mosque by Fatima al-Fihri in 857–859 and subsequently became one of the leading spiritual and educational centers of the Islamic Golden Age. It was incorporated into Morocco's modern state university system in 1963 and officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later.[1] The mosque building itself is also a significant complex of historical Moroccan and Islamic architecture that features elements from many different periods of Moroccan history.[5]\n\n\nScholars consider al-Qarawiyyin to have been effectively run as a madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] Many scholars distinguish this status from the status of \"university\", which they view as a distinctly European invention.[10][11] They date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation from a madrasa into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[1][2][3] Some sources, such as UNESCO and the *Guinness World Records*, have cited al-Qarawiyyin as the oldest university or oldest continually operating higher learning institution in the world.[12][13]\n\n\nEducation at the University of al-Qarawiyyin concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and *Maliki* Sharia, though lessons on non-Islamic subjects are also offered to students. Teaching is still delivered in the traditional methods.[14] The university is attended by students from all over Morocco and Muslim West Africa, with some also coming from further abroad. Women were first admitted to the institution in the 1940s.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe Arabic name of the university, جَامِعَةُ الْقَرَوِيِّينَ pronounced [ʒaːmiʕtu lqarawijiːn] means \"University of the People from Kairouan (القَيْرَوَان [alqajrawaːn])\". Factors such as the provenance of Fatima al-Fihriya's family in Tunisia,[16] the presence of the letter *Qāf* (ق) – a voiceless uvular plosive which has no equivalent in European languages – the ويّي ([awijiː]) triphthong in the university's name, and the French colonization of Morocco have resulted in a number of different orthographies for the romanization of the university's name, including *al-Qarawiyyin*, a standard anglicization; *Al Quaraouiyine*, following French orthography; and *Al-Karaouine*, another rendering using French orthography.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qarawiyyin Mosque on the skyline of central Fes el-Bali: the green-tiled roofs of the prayer hall and the minaret (white tower on the left) are visible.\n### Foundation of the mosque[edit]\n\n\nIn the 9th century, Fez was the capital of the Idrisid dynasty, considered to be the first Moroccan Islamic state.[17] According to one of the major early sources on this period, the *Rawd al-Qirtas* by Ibn Abi Zar, al-Qarawiyyin was founded as a mosque in 857 or 859 by Fatima al-Fihri, the daughter of a wealthy merchant named Mohammed al-Fihri.[18][4][19][6][20][5]: 9[21]: 40 The al-Fihri family had migrated from Kairouan (hence the name of the mosque), Tunisia to Fez in the early 9th century, joining a community of other migrants from Kairouan who had settled in a western district of the city. Fatima and her sister Mariam, both of whom were well educated, inherited a large amount of money from their father. Fatima vowed to spend her entire inheritance to build a mosque suitable for her community.[22]: 48–49 Similarly, her sister Mariam is also reputed to have founded al-Andalusiyyin Mosque the same year.[23][22]\n\n\nThis foundation narrative has been questioned by some modern historians who see the symmetry of two sisters founding the two most famous mosques of Fez as too convenient and likely originating from a legend.[22]: 48–49[24][21]: 42 Ibn Abi Zar is also judged by contemporary historians to be a relatively unreliable source.[24] One of the biggest challenges to this story is a foundation inscription that was rediscovered during renovations to the mosque in the 20th century, previously hidden under layers of plaster for centuries. This inscription, carved onto cedar wood panels and written in a Kufic script very similar to foundation inscriptions in 9th-century Tunisia, was found on a wall above the probable site of the mosque's original *mihrab* (prior to the building's later expansions). The inscription, recorded and deciphered by Gaston Deverdun, proclaims the foundation of \"this mosque\" (Arabic: \"هذا المسجد\") by Dawud ibn Idris (a son of Idris II who governed this region of Morocco at the time) in *Dhu al-Qadah* 263 AH (July–August of 877 CE).[14] Deverdun suggested the inscription may have come from another unidentified mosque and was moved here at a later period (probably 15th or 16th century) when the veneration of the Idrisids was resurgent in Fez, and such relics would have held enough religious significance to be reused in this way.[14] However, Chafik Benchekroun argued more recently that a more likely explanation is that this inscription is the original foundation inscription of al-Qarawiyyin itself and that it might have been covered up in the 12th century just before the Almohads' arrival in the city.[24] Based on this evidence and on the many doubts about Ibn Abi Zar's narrative, he argues that Fatima al-Fihri is quite possibly a legendary figure rather than a historical one.[24]\n\n\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nSome scholars suggest that some teaching and instruction probably took place at al-Qarawiyyin Mosque from a very early period[25][22]: 453 or from its beginning.[26]: 287[1]: 71[27] Major mosques in the early Islamic period were typically multi-functional buildings where teaching and education took place alongside other religious and civic activities.[28][29] The al-Andalusiyyin Mosque, in the district across the river, may have also served a similar role up until at least the Marinid period, though it never equaled the Qarawiyyin's later prestige.[22]: 453 It is unclear at what time al-Qarawiyyin began to act more formally as an educational institution, partly because of the limited historical sources that pertain to its early period.[26][30][22] The most relevant major historical texts like the *Rawd al-Qirtas* by Ibn Abi Zar and the *Zahrat al-As* by Abu al-Hasan Ali al-Jazna'i do not provide any clear details on the history of teaching at the mosque,[22]: 453 though al-Jazna'i (who lived in the 14th century) mentions that teaching had taken place there before his time.[31]: 175 Otherwise, the earliest mentions of *halaqa* (circles) for learning and teaching may not have been until the 10th or the 12th century.[32][26] Historian Abdelhadi Tazi indicates the earliest clear evidence of teaching at al-Qarawiyyin in 1121.[25]: 112 Moroccan historian Mohammed Al-Manouni believes that the mosque acquired its function as a teaching institution during the reign of the Almoravids (1040–1147).[30] Historian Évariste Lévi-Provençal dates the beginning of teaching to the Marinid period (1244–1465).[33]\n\n\nIn the 10th century, the Idrisid dynasty fell from power and Fez was contested between the Fatimid and Córdoban Umayyad caliphates and their allies.[17] During this period, the Qarawiyyin Mosque progressively grew in prestige. At some point the *khutba* (Friday sermon) was transferred from the Shurafa Mosque of Idris II (today the Zawiya of Moulay Idris II) to the Qarawiyyin Mosque, granting it the status of Friday mosque (the community's main mosque). This transfer happened either in 919 or in 933, both dates that correspond to brief periods of Fatimid domination over the city, and suggests that the transfer may have occurred by Fatimid initiative.[5]: 12 The mosque and its learning institution continued to enjoy the respect of political elites, with the mosque itself being significantly expanded by the Almoravids and repeatedly embellished under subsequent dynasties.[5] Tradition was established that all the other mosques in Fez based the timing of their call to prayer (*adhan*) according to that of al-Qarawiyyin.[34]\n\n\n\n### Apogee during the Marinid period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Reconstruction of the 14th-century water clock from the *dar al-muwaqqit* of the Qarawiyyin Mosque (on display at the Istanbul Museum of the History of Science and Technology in Islam)\nMany scholars consider al-Qarawiyyin's high point as an intellectual and scholarly center to be in the 13th and 14th centuries, when the curriculum was at its broadest and its prestige had reached new heights after centuries of expansion and elite patronage.[1][34][30]: 141 Among the subjects taught around this period or shortly after were traditional religious subjects such as the Quran and *fiqh* (Islamic jurisprudence), and other sciences like grammar, rhetoric, logic, medicine, mathematics, astronomy and geography.[30][26][1][22]: 455 By contrast, some subjects like alchemy/chemistry were never officially taught as they were considered too unorthodox.[22]: 455\n\n![](image)The Al-Attarine Madrasa (founded in 1323), just north of the Qarawiyyin MosqueStarting in the late 13th century, and especially in the 14th century, the Marinid dynasty was responsible for constructing a number of formal madrasas in the areas around al-Qarawiyyin's main building. The first of these was the Saffarin Madrasa in 1271, followed by al-Attarine in 1323, and the Mesbahiya Madrasa in 1346.[35] A larger but much later madrasa, the Cherratine Madrasa, was also built nearby in 1670.[36] These madrasas taught their own courses and sometimes became well-known institutions, but they usually had narrower curricula or specializations.[34]: 141[37] One of their most important functions seems to have been to provide housing for students from other towns and cities – many of them poor – who needed a place to stay while studying at al-Qarawiyyin.[38]: 137[34]: 110[22]: 463 Thus, these buildings acted as complimentary or auxiliary institutions to al-Qarawiyyin itself, which remained the center of intellectual life in the city.\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin also compiled a large selection of manuscripts that were kept at a library founded by the Marinid sultan Abu Inan Faris in 1349.[5][39] The collection housed numerous works from the Maghreb, al-Andalus, and the Middle East.[40] Part of the collection was gathered decades earlier by Sultan Abu Yusuf Ya'qub (ruled 1258–1286), who persuaded Sancho IV of Castile to hand over a number of works from the libraries of Seville, Córdoba, Almeria, Granada, and Malaga in al-Andalus/Spain. Abu Yusuf initially housed these in the nearby Saffarin Madrasa (which he had recently built), but later moved them to al-Qarawiyyin.[40] Among the most precious manuscripts currently housed in the library are volumes from the *Al-Muwatta* of Malik written on gazelle parchment,[41] a copy of the *Sirat* by Ibn Ishaq,[41] a 9th-century Quran manuscript (also written on gazelle parchment),[34]: 148 a copy of the Quran given by Sultan Ahmad al-Mansur in 1602,[41] a copy of Ibn Rushd's *Al-Bayan Wa-al-Tahsil wa-al-Tawjih* (a commentary on *Maliki* *fiqh*) dating from 1320,[42][34]: 143 and the original copy of Ibn Khaldun's book *Al-'Ibar* (including the *Muqaddimah*) gifted by the author in 1396.[41][37] Recently rediscovered in the library is an *ijazah* certificate, written on deer parchment, which some scholars claim to be the oldest surviving predecessor of a Medical Doctorate degree, issued to a man called Abdellah Ben Saleh Al Koutami in 1207 CE under the authority of three other doctors and in the presence of the chief *qadi* (judge) of the city and two other witnesses.[43][44] The library was managed by a *qayim* or conservator, who oversaw the maintenance of the collection.[34]: 143[40] By 1613 one conservator estimated the library's collection at 32,000 volumes.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)A document from the Qarawiyyin's library which is claimed by some scholars to be the world's oldest surviving medical degree, issued in 1207 CE\nStudents were male, but traditionally it has been said that \"facilities were at times provided for interested women to listen to the discourse while accommodated in a special gallery (*riwaq*) overlooking the scholars' circle\".[26] The 12th-century cartographer Mohammed al-Idrisi, whose maps aided European exploration during the Renaissance, is said to have lived in Fez for some time, suggesting that he may have worked or studied at al-Qarawiyyin. The institution has produced numerous scholars who have strongly influenced the intellectual and academic history of the Muslim world. Among them are Ibn Rushayd al-Sabti (d. 1321), Mohammed Ibn al-Hajj al-Abdari al-Fasi (d. 1336), Abu Imran al-Fasi (d. 1015) – a leading theorist of the Maliki school of Islamic jurisprudence, and Leo Africanus. Pioneer scholars such as Muhammad al-Idrissi (d.1166 AD), Ibn al-Arabi (1165–1240 AD), Ibn Khaldun (1332–1395 AD), Ibn al-Khatib (d. 1374), Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji (Alpetragius) (d. 1294), and Ali ibn Hirzihim (d. 1163) were all connected with al-Qarawiyyin as either students or lecturers.[41] Some Christian scholars visited al-Qarawiyyin, including Nicolas Cleynaerts (d. 1542)[45][34]: 252 and the Jacobus Golius (d. 1667).[41] The 19th-century orientalist Jousé Ponteleimon Krestovitich also claimed that Gerbert d'Aurillac (later Pope Sylvester II) studied at al-Qarawiyyin in the 10th century.[46][34]: 138 Although this claim about Gerbert is sometimes repeated by modern authors,[20][47] modern scholarship has not produced evidence to support this story.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Decline and reforms[edit]\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin underwent a general decline in later centuries along with Fez. The strength of its teaching stagnated and its curriculum decreased in range and scope, becoming focused on traditional Islamic sciences and Arabic linguistic studies. Even some traditional Islamic specializations like *tafsir* (Quranic exegesis) were progressively neglected or abandoned.[1][30] In 1788–89, the Alaouite sultan Muhammad ibn Abdallah introduced reforms that regulated the institution's program, but also imposed stricter limits and excluded logic, philosophy, and the more radical Sufi texts from the curriculum.[26][30][50] Other subjects also disappeared over time, such as astronomy and medicine.[30] In 1845 Sultan Abd al-Rahman carried out further reforms, but it is unclear if this had any significant long-term effects.[1][30] Between 1830 and 1906 the number of faculty decreased from 425 to 266 (of which, among the latter, only 101 were still teaching).[1]: 71\n\n\nBy the 19th century, the mosque's library also suffered from decline and neglect.[30][40] A significant portion of its collection was lost over time, most likely due to lax supervision and to books that were not returned.[22]: 472 By the beginning of the 20th century, the collection had been reduced to around 1,600 manuscripts and 400 printed books, though many valuable historic items were retained.[30]\n\n\n\n### 20th century and transformation into state university[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Qarawiyyin Mosque in 1916\nAt the time Morocco became a French protectorate in 1912, al-Qarawiyyin worsened as a religious center of learning from its medieval prime,[1] though it retained some significance as an educational venue for the sultan's administration.[1] The student body was rigidly divided along social strata: ethnicity (Arab or Berber), social status, personal wealth, and geographic background (rural or urban) determined the group membership of the students who were segregated by the teaching facility, as well as in their personal quarters.[1] The French administration implemented a number of structural reforms between 1914 and 1947, including the institution of calendars, appointment of teachers, salaries, schedules, general administration, and the replacement of the *ijazah* with the *shahada alamiyha,* but did not modernize the contents of teaching likewise which were still dominated by the traditional worldviews of the *ulama*.[1] At the same time, the student numbers at al-Qarawiyyin decreased to 300 in 1922 as the Moroccan elite sent their children to the newly founded Western-style colleges and institutes elsewhere in the country.[1] In 1931 and 1933, on the orders of Muhammad V, al-Qarawiyyin's teaching was reorganized into elementary, secondary, and higher education.[30][26][50]\n\n\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin also played a role in the Moroccan nationalist movement and in protests against the French colonial regime. Many Moroccan nationalists had received their education here and some of their informal political networks were established due to the shared educational background.[51]: 140, 146 In July 1930, al-Qarawiyyin strongly participated in the propagation of *Ya Latif*, a communal prayer recited in times of calamity, to raise awareness and opposition to the Berber Dahir decreed by the French authorities two months earlier.[52][51]: 143–144 In 1937 the mosque was one of the rallying points (along with the nearby R'cif mosque) for demonstrations in response to a violent crackdown on Moroccan protesters in Meknes, which ended with French troops being deployed across Fes el-Bali and at the mosques.[17]: 387–389[51]: 168\n\n![](image)The main entrance to the library and other southern annexes of the mosque today, off Place SeffarineIn 1947 al-Qarawiyyin was integrated into the state educational system,[7] and women were first admitted to study there during the 1940s.[15] In 1963, after Moroccan independence, al-Qarawiyyin was officially transformed by royal decree into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education.[1][53][2] Classes at the old mosque ceased and a new campus was established at a former French Army barracks.[1] While the dean took his seat at Fez, four faculties were founded in and outside the city: a faculty of Islamic law in Fez, a faculty of Arab studies in Marrakech, and two faculties of theology in Tétouan and near Agadir. Modern curricula and textbooks were introduced and the professional training of the teachers improved.[1][54] Following the reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" in 1965.[1]\n\n\nIn 1975, General Studies was transferred to the newly founded Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University; al-Qarawiyyin kept the Islamic and theological courses of studies.[*citation needed*] In 1973, Abdelhadi Tazi published a three-volume history of the establishment entitled جامع القرويين (*The al-Qarawiyyin Mosque*).[55]\n\n\nIn 1988, after a hiatus of almost three decades, the teaching of traditional Islamic education at al-Qarawiyyin was resumed by King Hassan II in what has been interpreted as a move to bolster conservative support for the monarchy.[1]\n\n\n\n## Education and curriculum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scholar at the Al-Qarawiyyin library\nEducation at al-Qarawiyyin University concentrates on the Islamic religious and legal sciences with a heavy emphasis on, and particular strengths in, Classical Arabic grammar/linguistics and Maliki law, though some lessons on other non-Islamic subjects such as French and English are also offered to students.[56][57] Teaching is delivered with students seated in a semi-circle around a sheikh, who prompts them to read sections of a particular text; asks them questions on particular points of grammar, law, or interpretation; and explains difficult points. Students from Morocco and Islamic West Africa attend al-Qarawiyyin, though some come from Muslim Central Asia. Spanish Muslim converts frequently attend the institution, largely attracted by the fact that the sheikhs of al-Qarawiyyin, and Islamic scholarship in Morocco in general, are heirs to the rich, religious, and scholarly heritage of Muslim al-Andalus.[56]\n\n\nMost students at al-Qarawiyyin range are between 13 and 30 years old, and study towards high school-level diplomas and university-level bachelor's degrees, although Muslims with a sufficiently high level of Arabic can attend lecture circles on an informal basis, given the traditional category of visitors \"in search of [religious and legal] knowledge\" (\"zuwwaar li'l-talab fii 'ilm\"). In addition to being Muslim, prospective students of al-Qarawiyyin are required to have fully memorized the Quran, as well as other shorter medieval Islamic texts on grammar and *Maliki* law, and to be proficient in classical Arabic.[56][58]\n\n\n\n## Architecture of the mosque[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Floor plan of the mosque and some of its annexes. (Based on an early 20th-century survey; since then the southern part of the complex, the library, has been modified.)Al-Qarawiyyin Mosque was founded in the 9th century, but its present form is the result of a long historical evolution over the course of more than 1,000 years. Successive dynasties expanded the mosque until it became the largest in Africa, with a capacity of 22,000 worshipers.[59] The present-day mosque covers an extensive area of about half a hectare.[34]: 136 Broadly speaking, it consists of a large hypostyle interior space for prayers (the prayer hall), a courtyard with fountains (the *sahn*), a minaret at the courtyard's western end, and a number of annexes around the mosque itself.\n\n\n### Historical evolution[edit]\n\n\n#### Early history (9th–10th centuries)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Arches in the prayer hall of the mosque\nThe original mosque building was built in the 9th century. A major modern study of the mosque's structure, published by French archeologist and historian Henri Terrasse in 1968, determined that traces of the original mosque could be found in the layout of the current building.[5]: 10 This initial form of the mosque occupied a large space immediately to the south of the *sahn*, in what is now the prayer hall.[5][60]: 119 It had a rectangular floor plan measuring 36 by 32 meters, covering an area of 1520 square meters, and was composed of a prayer hall with four transverse aisles running roughly east–west, parallel to the southern *qibla* wall.[5][34]: 135 It probably also had a courtyard of relatively small size, and the first minaret, also of small size, reportedly stood on the location now occupied by the wooden *anaza* (at the central entrance to the prayer hall from the courtyard).[5] Water for the mosque was initially provided by a well dug within the mosque's precinct.[5]\n\n\nAs Fez grew and the mosque increased in prestige, the original building was insufficient for its religious and institutional needs.[5][34] During the 10th century, the Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba and the Fatimid Caliphate constantly fought for control over Fez and Morocco, seen as a buffer zone between the two.[17] Despite this uncertain period, the mosque received significant patronage and had its first expansions. The Zenata Berber emir Ahmed ibn Abi Said, one of the rulers of Fez during this period who was aligned with the Umayyads, wrote to the caliph Abd al-Rahman III in Córdoba for permission and funds to expand the mosque.[5] The caliph approved, and the work was carried out or completed in 956.[5] It expanded the mosque on three sides, encompassing the area of the present-day courtyard to the north and up to the current eastern and western boundaries of the building.[60] It also replaced the original minaret with a new, larger minaret still standing today. Its overall form, with a square shaft, was indicative of the subsequent development of Maghrebi and Andalusian minarets.[5][60]\n\n\nThe mosque was embellished when the Amirid ruler al-Muzaffar (son of al-Mansur) led a military expedition to Fez in 998. The embellishments included a new *minbar* and a dome topped by talismans in the shape of a rat, a serpent, and a scorpion.[5] Of these, only the dome itself, whose exterior is distinctively fluted or grooved, survives today, located above the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall. A similar dome, located across the courtyard over the northern entrance of the mosque (*Bab al-Ward* or \"Gate of the Rose\"), likely also dates from the same time.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Almoravid expansion (12th century)[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most significant expansions and renovations was carried out between 1135 and 1143 under the patronage of the Almoravid ruler Ali ibn Yusuf.[5] The prayer hall was extended by dismantling the existing southern wall and adding three more transverse aisles for a total of ten, while replicating the format of the existing arches of the mosque.[5][60] This expansion required the purchase and demolition of a number of neighboring houses and structures, including some that were apparently part of the nearby Jewish neighbourhood (before the Mellah of Fez).[5]\n\n\nThe new expansion of the mosque involved not only a new *mihrab* in the middle of the new southern wall, but also the reconstruction or embellishment of the prayer hall's central nave (the arches along its central axis, in a line perpendicular to the southern wall and to the other rows of arches) leading from the courtyard to the *mihrab*. This involved not only embellishing some of the arches with new forms but also adding a series of highly elaborate cupola ceilings composed in *muqarnas* (honeycomb or stalactite-like) sculpting and further decorated with intricate reliefs of arabesques and Kufic letters.[5][62] The craftsmen who worked on this expansion are mostly anonymous, except for two names that are carved on the bases of two of the cupolas: Ibrāhīm and Salāma ibn Mufarrij, who may have been of Andalusi origin.[62]: 76 Lastly, a new *minbar* in similar style and of similar artistic provenance as the *minbar* of the Koutoubia Mosque was completed and installed in 1144.[5] It is made of wood in an elaborate work of marquetry, and decorated with inlaid materials and intricately carved arabesque reliefs. Its style was emulated for later Moroccan minbars.[5][62]\n\n\nElsewhere, many of the mosque's main entrances were given doors made of wood overlaid with ornate bronze fittings, which today count among the oldest surviving bronze artworks in Moroccan architecture.[38][5] Another interesting element added to the mosque was a small secondary oratory, known as the *Jama' al-Gnaiz* (\"Funeral Mosque\" or \"Mosque of the Dead\"), which was separated from the main prayer hall and dedicated to providing funerary rites for the deceased before their burial.[5] The annex is also decorated with a *muqarnas* cupola and ornate archways and windows.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Almohad period (12th–13th centuries)[edit]\n\n\nLater dynasties continued to embellish the mosque or gift it with new furnishings, though no works as radical as the Almoravid expansion were undertaken again. The Almohads (later 12th century and 13th century) conquered Fez after a long siege in 1145–1146.[22][5] Historical sources (particularly the *Rawd al-Qirtas*) report a story claiming that the inhabitants of Fez, fearful that the \"puritan\" Almohads would resent the lavish decoration placed inside the mosque, used whitewash to cover up the most ornate decorations from Ibn Yusuf's expansion near the *mihrab.*[5]: 25–26 Terrasse suggests this operation may have actually been carried out a few years later by the Almohad authorities themselves.[5] The Almoravid ornamentation was only fully uncovered again during renovations in the early 20th century.[63][5] The plaster used to cover the Almoravid decoration seems to have been prepared too quickly and did not fully bond with the existing surface. This ended up making its removal easier during modern restorations and has helped to preserve much of the original Almoravid decoration now visible again today.[62]: 64\n\n\nUnder the reign of Muhammad al-Nasir (r. 1199–1213), the Almohads added and upgraded a number of elements in the mosque, some of which were nonetheless marked with strong decorative flourishes. The ablutions facilities in the courtyard were upgraded, a separate ablutions room was added to the north, and a new underground storage room was created.[5] They also replaced the mosque's grand chandelier with one made of bronze, which Terrasse described as \"the largest and most beautiful chandelier in the Islamic world,\" and which hangs in the central nave of the mosque today.[64][5][60][65] It was commissioned by Abu Muhammad 'Abd Allah ibn Musa, the *khatib* of the mosque during the years 1202 to 1219.[60]: 334 The chandelier has the shape of a 12-sided cupola surmounted by a large cone, around which are nine levels that hold candlesticks. It could originally hold 520 oil candles; the cost of providing the oil was so significant that it was only lit on special occasions, such as on the nights of Ramadan. The Marinid sultan Abu Ya'qub Yusuf (r. 1286–1307), upon seeing the cost, ordered that it only be lit for the last day of Ramadan. The visible surfaces of the chandelier are carved and pierced with intricate floral arabesque motifs as well as Kufic Arabic inscriptions. The chandelier is the oldest surviving chandelier in the western Islamic world, and it likely served as a model for the Marinid chandelier in the Great Mosque of Taza.[60]: 334\n\n\n\n#### Marinid period (13th–14th centuries)[edit]\n\n\nThe Marinids, who were responsible for building many of the madrasas around Fez, made various contributions to the mosque. In 1286 they restored and protected the 10th-century minaret, which had been made from deteriorating poor-quality stone with whitewash.[5] At its southern foot, they also built the *Dar al-Muwaqqit*, a chamber for the timekeeper (*muwaqqit*) of the mosque who was responsible for determining the precise times of prayer. The chamber was equipped with astrolabes and other scientific equipment of the era in order to aid in this task. Several water clocks were built for it in this period. The first two do not exist anymore, but are described by al-Jazna'i in the *Zahrat al-As*.[61] The first was commissioned by Abu Yusuf Ya'qub in the 13th century and designed by Muhammad ibn al-Habbak, a *faqih* and *muwaqqit*.[66][67] The second was built in 1317 or 1318 (717 AH), under the reign of Abu Sa'id, by a scholar named Abu Abdullah Muhammad al-Sanhaji. Its time divisions were engraved by Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn al-Saddina al-Qarsatuni. The clock was neglected then restored between 1346 and 1349 (747–749 AH) by a new *muwaqqit*, Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn al-'Arabi.[61][5]: 62[60]: 492 A third and final water clock, built on the orders of Sultan Abu Salim Ali II (ruled 1359–1361), is still partly preserved today.[60][68][69] It was designed by Abu Zayd Abd al-Rahman ibn Sulayman al-Laja'i and completed on November 20, 1361 (21 Muharram 763 AH), as recorded by an original inscription. It features a large astrolabe with a diameter of 71 cm, which is embedded into a wooden structure in the corner of the room, but its mechanism is no longer present.[61]\n\n* ![View of the Dar al-Muwaqqit, with its double-arched window overlooking the courtyard](image)\n\nView of the *Dar al-Muwaqqit*, with its double-arched window overlooking the courtyard\n* ![The astrolabe of the water clock device completed in 1361 by al-Laja'i](image)\n\nThe astrolabe of the water clock device completed in 1361 by al-Laja'i\n\nThe galleries around the *sahn* were also rebuilt or repaired in 1283 and 1296–97, while at the entrance from the courtyard to the prayer hall (leading to the central nave of the mihrab), a decorative wooden screen, called the *anaza,* was installed in 1289 and acted as a symbolic \"outdoor\" or \"summer\" mihrab for prayers in the courtyard.[5] The stucco decoration on the entrance arch itself, however, dates from much later.[61] At the central outer entrance to the courtyard from the north, the cupola ceiling over the entrance vestibule of the gate called *Bab al-Ward* (\"Gate of the Rose\") was redecorated with carved stucco in 1337.[5][61] The richly-sculpted archway on the inner side of the gate also dates from this time.[61]\n\n* ![Marinid decoration in the cupola over the vestibule of Bab al-Ward, the central northern gate of the mosque](image)\n\nMarinid decoration in the cupola over the vestibule of *Bab al-Ward*, the central northern gate of the mosque\n* ![Inner façade of Bab al-Ward, with Marinid-era stucco embellishment](image)\n\nInner façade of *Bab al-Ward*, with Marinid-era stucco embellishment\n* ![The wooden anaza at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall](image)\n\nThe wooden *anaza* at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall\n\nA number of ornate metal chandeliers hanging in the mosque's prayer hall date from the Marinid era. Three of them were made from church bells which Marinid craftsmen used as a base onto which they grafted ornate copper fittings. The largest of them, installed in the mosque in 1337, was a bell brought back from Gibraltar by the son of Sultan Abu al-Hasan, Abu Malik, after its reconquest from Spanish forces in 1333.[5]\n\n\nThe mosque's library was officially founded by Sultan Abu Inan in 1349 (750 AH), as dated by an inscription over its doorway.[5]: 64[20] This first Marinid library was located at the mosque's northeastern corner (as opposed to the library's current southern location).[20] In 1361, Sultan Abu Salim added a room to it, which was built above and over the adjacent street, and dedicated to readings of the Quran.[5]: 64\n\n\n\n#### Saadian and Alaouite period (16th-century to modern era)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the Saadian pavilions (late 16th and early 17th century) in the courtyard, featuring carved wood and stucco decoration\nThe Saadians embellished the mosque by adding two prominent pavilions to the western and eastern ends of the courtyard, each of which sheltered a new fountain. The Saadian sultan Ahmad al-Mansur was responsible for building the first pavilion to the east in 1587–88, while the western pavilion was added by his grandson Abdallah al-Ghalib II in 1609.[70]: 100 The pavilions emulate the ones in the Court of Lions of the Alhambra palaces (in Granada, Spain).[5][70] Al-Mansur also built a new room for the library on the south side of the mosque (around the library's current location), which was connected to the mosque via a door in the *qibla* wall.[71][20]\n\n\nThe Alaouite dynasty, which has ruled Morocco from the 17th century onward, continued to perform minor additions and regular maintenance on the mosque. A ribbed cupola in the central nave, where the 1337 Marinid chandelier hangs, has been dated by Terrasse to the Alaouite period,[5] although Xavier Salmon has more recently argued that at least some elements of the dome seem to date from the Marinid era.[61] The stucco decoration of the central archway at the courtyard entrance to the prayer hall (i.e. the arch inside which the Marinid-era *anaza* stands) also dates from the Alaouite period; an inscription at the top of the arch gives the year 1864–1865 (1281 AH).[61]\n\n\nThe present library building dates mainly from a major expansion and modification in the 20th century, particularly in the 1940s.[20][71]: 174 The new library expansion, which included a large new reading room, was inaugurated in 1949.[72]\n\n\n\n### Current structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Exterior[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nDoors of Bab al-Gna'iz today, with replicas of the original Almoravid bronze overlays\n![](image)\nFragments of the original bronze overlays of Bab al-Gna'iz, dating to the Almoravid period\n\nAl-Qarawiyyin's exterior does not generally present a monumental appearance and is integrated with the dense urban fabric around it. By one count there are 18 separate gates and entrances distributed around its perimeter.[34] The gates vary from small rectangular doorways to enormous horseshoe arches with huge doors preceded by wooden roofs covering the street in front of them.[5] While the doors are generally made of wood, some of the gates have extensive ornate bronze overlays crafted during the Almoravid period.[5] The most ornate and best-preserved examples include the doors of the principal northern gate, *Bab al-Ward* (which opens onto the courtyard), the western gate called *Bab Sbitriyyin*, and the southwestern gate *Bab al-Gna'iz*, which leads to the *Jama' al-Gna'iz*.[5][62] While the doors of *Bab al-Ward* preserve original pieces and were restored in 2005–2007, the doors of *Bab al-Gna'iz* and *Bab Sbitriyyin* are replicas made in the 1950s that replaced the originals, whose fragments are kept by the Dar Batha Museum.[60]: 56[a] The northwestern gates of the mosque, *Bab al-Shama'in* (or *Bab Chemaine*) and *Bab al-Maqsura*, also have heavy bronze fittings, including some ornate knockers that date from the Almoravid period.[5]\n\n\nAdjacent to *Bab al-Ward*, on its west side, is another doorway, *Bab al-Hafa* (\"Gate of the Barefooted\"). This gate dates to the Almohad era. It is distinguished by a small water channel that runs across the floor just inside it. The channel allowed worshipers entering the mosque to wash their feet on the way in, helping with initial ablutions.[36][5]\n\n\nNext to the mosque is a tower known as the *Borj Neffara* (برج النفارة, \"Tower of the Trumpeters\"), an observation tower that is sometimes confused as a minaret but was actually part of another *Dar al-Muwaqqit*.[73][38]: 150\n\n\n\n#### Prayer hall[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe central nave of the mosque, leading towards the *mihrab*, with some of the Almohad and Marinid chandeliers visible\n![](image)\nThe *mihrab* (niche symbolizing the direction of prayer)\n\nThe interior hypostyle prayer hall takes up most of the mosque's area. Like the interior of most traditional mosques in Moroccan architecture, it is a relatively austere space with mostly plain walls, wooden roofs, and rows upon rows of arches. The main area, south of the courtyard, is a vast space divided into ten transverse aisles by rows of arches running parallel to the southern wall.[5] The southern wall of this hall also marks the *qibla*. The central axis of the prayer hall, perpendicular to the *qibla* wall, is marked by a central nave running between two extra lines of arches along this axis, perpendicular to the other arches.[5] This nave leads towards the *mihrab:* a niche in the *qibla* wall which symbolizes the direction of prayer, and in front of which the imam usually leads prayers and delivers sermons. This overall layout (a hypostyle hall with a central nave emphasized against the others) is a familiar layout for North African mosques generally.[5][71]\n\n\nThe *mihrab*, which dates from the Almoravid (12th-century) expansion, is decorated with carved and painted stucco, as well as several windows of coloured glass. The *mihrab* niche itself is a small alcove which is covered by a small dome of *muqarnas* (stalactite or honeycomb-like sculpting).[62] On each side of the *mihrab*'s opening is a pair of engaged marble columns topped by deeply-carved capitals. These capitals are spolia from al-Andalus, dating from the time of the Caliphate of Córdoba, which were re-appropriated by the Almoravids for Ali Ibn Yusuf's expansion of the mosque.[62]: 60 On the mihrab's façade, the stucco ornamentation of the lower parts, immediately around the arch itself, was most likely redone in the 16th and/or early 19th centuries. The stucco decoration of the upper wall above this still dates from the Almoravid period. The Almoravid decoration prioritizes floral motifs, which contain more diversity than the later restorations below, over which bands of Kufic inscriptions have also been carved.[62]: 72–76\n\n\nThe central nave that runs along the axis of the *mihrab* is distinguished from the rest of the mosque by a number of architectural embellishments. The arches that run along it are of varying shapes, including both horseshoe arches and multi-lobed arches.[5] Instead of the plain timber ceilings, most sections of the nave are covered by a series of intricate *muqarnas* ceilings and cupolas, each slightly different from the other, as well as two \"ribbed\" dome cupolas (similar to the domes of the Great Mosque of Córdoba and Cristo de la Luz Mosque in Toledo) dating from the Almoravid and Alaouite periods.[5] The muqarnas vaults are made of plaster and are suspended from a hidden framework of wooden struts above them.[21]: 119–120 Many of the *muqarnas* compositions are further embellished with intricate reliefs of arabesques and Arabic inscriptions in both Kufic and cursive letters, highlighted with blue and red colours.[5][62][21]: 119–120 Additionally, there are several elaborately carved bronze chandeliers hanging in the nave which were gifted to the mosque during the Almohad and Marinid eras; at least three of which were made from bells (probably church bells) brought back from victories in Spain.[5][74]\n\n\nTo the right of the *mihrab* is the *minbar* of the mosque, which could also be stored in a small room behind a door in the *qibla* wall. The *minbar* is most likely of similar origins as the Almoravid *minbar* of the Koutoubia Mosque, made by a workshop in Córdoba not long after the latter and installed in al-Qarawiyyin Mosque in 1144 (at the end of the Almoravid works on the mosque).[5] It is another exceptional work of marquetry and woodcarving, decorated with geometric compositions, inlaid materials, and arabesque reliefs.[5][62]\n\n\nAside from the embellishments of the central nave, the rest of the mosque is architecturally uniform, but there are some minor irregularities in the floor plan. For example, the arches in the western half of the prayer hall are shorter than those in the eastern half, and some of the transverse aisles are slightly wider than others. These anomalies have not been fully explained but they appear to have been present since the early centuries of the mosque; they may be due to early reconstructions or alterations which have gone unrecorded in historical chronicles.[5]\n\n\n\n#### *Sahn*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The courtyard (*sahn*) of the Qarawiyyin Mosque, including the central fountain and one of the Saadian-era pavilions\nThe *sahn* is rectangular, surrounded by the prayer hall on three sides and by a gallery to the north. The floor is paved with typical Moroccan mosaic tiles (*zellij*) and at the center is a fountain.[71] From outside the mosque, the courtyard is accessed by the main northern gate, called *Bab al-Ward*, whose vestibule is covered by a Marinid-era white dome which is fluted on the outside and covered in painted and carved stucco on the inside.[5] Opposite this gate, situated on the mihrab axis, is the central entrance to the interior prayer hall, guarded by a carved and painted wooden screen called the *anaza* which also acted as a symbolic \"outdoor\" or \"summer\" mihrab for prayers taking place in the courtyard.[5] (These features are visible to visitors standing outside the gate.) Both this entrance to the prayer hall and the outer gate across from it have facades decorated with carved and painted stucco.[5]\n\n\nAt the western and eastern ends of the courtyard stand two ornate Saadian pavilions each sheltering another fountain. The pavilions have pyramidal domes and emulate the pavilions in the Court of the Lions in the Alhambra (Spain).[5] They are decorated with carved wood and stucco, mosaic-tiled walls, and marble columns.[70] Behind these pavilions are extensions of the main prayer hall divided into four naves by rows of arches.[5] The gallery and arched hall on the northeastern sides of the courtyard are a prayer space reserved for women.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Minaret[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nView of the minaret from the east\n![](image)\nView from the south, with the unusual vertically-elongated lobed window visible\n\nThe minaret was constructed in the 10th century under the sponsorship of the Umayyad caliph of Córdoba, Abd al-Rahman III.[75] It overlooks the courtyard from the west. Along with the contemporary minaret of the Mosque of the Andalusians, it is the oldest preserved minaret in Morocco.[60]: 126 It was constructed in local limestone of relatively poor quality and was covered in whitewash by the Marinids in the 13th century in order to protect it from deterioration. It has a square shaft and is topped by a dome, as well as a parapet from which the muezzin historically issued the call to prayer (*adhan*). The full structure is 26.75 meters tall.[5] One feature of the minaret is the lower window on its southern facade, which is shaped like a \"triple\" horseshoe arch, elongated vertically, which is unique to this structure.[60] On the minaret's southern side, just above the gallery of the courtyard, is the Dar al-Muwaqqit.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Funerary annex (*Jama' al-Gnaiz*)[edit]\n\n\nA number of annexes are attached around the mosque, serving various functions. The northwestern edge of the building is occupied by latrines.[5] Behind the southern *qibla* wall, to the west of the *mihrab* axis, is the *Jama' al-Gnaiz*, which served as a separate oratory reserved for funerary rites. This type of facility was not particularly common in the Islamic world but there are several examples in Fez, including at the Chrabliyine and Bab Guissa Mosques. It was kept separate from the main mosque to preserve the purity of the latter as a regular prayer space, which could be soiled by the presence of a dead body.[5][62] This oratory dates back to the Almoravid period and also features embellishments such as a *muqarnas* cupola and a number of ornate archways in varying forms.[5][62] Spoliated capitals from al-Andalus are also re-used here in the doorways leading from the prayer hall to the funerary annex and in the columns supporting the *muqarnas* cupola.[62]: 60\n\n\n\n#### Library[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nView into the modern reading room (قاعة المطالعة) of the Qarawiyyin library\n\nBehind the southern wall of the mosque and east of the *mihrab* axis is the historic library of the mosque and university.[5] It is sometimes cited as the world's oldest library that remains open.[34]: 147[76][77] The first purpose-built library structure was added to the mosque by the Marinid sultan Abu Inan Faris in 1349 CE, though it was located at the mosque's northeastern corner instead of to the south.[78][5] The first structure still exists embedded near the women's section of the mosque, and consists of a square chamber measuring 5.4 meters per side. Its entrance is covered by a wooden screen from the Marinid period which features an inscription carved in cursive Arabic above the doorway recording Abu Inan's foundation of the library.[5]: 64\n\n\nThe current library building dates in part from a Saadian construction by Ahmad al-Mansur (late 16th century), who built a chamber called *al-Ahmadiyya* behind the *qibla* wall.[40] Most of the building dates from a major 20th-century expansion commissioned by King Mohammed V that started in 1940. It included the current grand reading room, which measures 23 metres long and features an ornately-painted wooden ceiling, and also added an entrance outside the mosque which made it accessible to non-Muslims.[40][39] This new library expansion was inaugurated in 1949.[72] The library complex underwent another major restoration in recent years led by Aziza Chaouni and was set to reopen in 2016 or 2017.[79][76][77][80]\n\n\n\n## Status as world's oldest university[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Madrasa § Madrasa and university\n\nUNESCO has previously described al-Qarawiyyin to be the \"oldest university in the world\" in the World Heritage Sites entry for Medina of Fez.[13] UNESCO describes the University of Bologna (founded in 1088 and usually recognized as the oldest medieval European university) as the \"oldest university of the Western world\".[81] Some historians and scholars also refer to al-Qarawiyyin as the world's oldest existing university.[34]: 137[82][83][44][84][85] The claim is also published by the *Guinness World Records*, under its entry for \"[o]ldest higher-learning institution, oldest university\", where it describes al-Qarawiyyin as the \"oldest existing, and continually operating educational institution in the world\", while the University of Bologna is described as the \"oldest one in Europe\".[86] Similarly, the *Encyclopædia Britannica* dates al-Qarawiyyin University's foundation to the mosque's foundation in 859[87] and generally considers that \"universities\" existed outside Europe before the advent of the European university model.[88] Other sources also refer to the historical or pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin as a \"university\" or an \"Islamic university\".[89][90]\n\n\nMany scholars consider the term *university* to be applicable only to the educational institutions that initially took form in medieval Christian Europe, and argue that the first universities were located in Western Europe, with those of Paris and Bologna often cited as the earliest examples.[91][92][93][94][95][96][97] The modern Western university model is thus widely argued to descend from this European tradition, even if other models of higher education existed in other parts of the world.[97][88][98] Jacques Verger says that while the term *university* is occasionally applied by scholars to madrasas and other pre-modern higher learning institutions out of convenience, the European university marked a major disruption between earlier institutions of higher learning and was the earliest true modern university.[11] Many scholars consider that the university was only adopted outside the West, including into the Islamic world, in the course of modernization programs or under European colonial regimes since the beginning of the 19th century.[99][100][11][101]\n\n\nAmong opposing views, Yahya Pallavicini claims that the university model did not spread in Europe until the 12th century and that it was found throughout the Muslim world from the founding of al-Qarawiyyin in the 9th century until at least European colonialism.[82] Some scholars, noting certain parallels between such madrasas and European medieval universities, have proposed that the latter may have been influenced by the madrasas of the Muslim world, in particular via Islamic Spain and the Emirate of Sicily.[102][103][104] Other scholars have questioned this, citing the lack of evidence for an actual transmission from the Islamic world to Christian Europe and highlighting the differences in the structure, methodologies, procedures, curricula and legal status of the madrasa versus the European university.[105][106]\n\n\nSome scholars consider that al-Qarawiyyin operated essentially as an Islamic madrasa until after World War II.[6][3][7][8][9] These scholars date al-Qarawiyyin's transformation into a university to its modern reorganization in 1963.[3][1][2] In the wake of these reforms, al-Qarawiyyin was officially renamed \"University of Al Quaraouiyine\" two years later.[1] Organization at the pre-modern al-Qarawiyyin differed from European universities and other Muslim institutions at al-Azhar (in Cairo) and al-Zaytouna (in Tunis) in that there was no defined scholastic year, registration was not imposed, study durations were not fixed, and there was no examination to ratify studies.[30] Students were expected to attend courses for a minimum of five years and would receive an *ijazah* if they were proven to have reached a high level of expertise.[22]: 457[30][102][43]\n\n\nThe earliest date of formal teaching at al-Qarawiyyin is also uncertain.[30][22] The most relevant major historical texts like the *Rawd al-Qirtas* and the *Zahrat al-As* do not provide clear details on the history of teaching at the mosque.[22]: 453 In the *Rawd al-Qirtas*, Ibn Abi Zar mentions the mosque but not its educational function. Al-Jazna'i, the 14th-century author of the *Zahrat al-As*, mentions that teaching had taken place there well before his time, but with no other details.[31]: 175 Otherwise, the earliest mentions of *halaqa* for learning and teaching may not have been until the 10th or the 12th century.[32][26] Moroccan historian Mohammed Al-Manouni believes that it was during the reign of the Almoravids (1040–1147) that the mosque acquired its function as a teaching institution.[30] French historian Évariste Lévi-Provençal dates the beginning of the madrasa and teaching to the later Marinid period (1244–1465).[33] Another Moroccan historian, Abdelhadi Tazi, indicated the earliest evidence of teaching at al-Qarawiyyin in 1121.[25] Upon reviewing the evidence in Abdelhadi Tazi's work, Abdul Latif Tibawi states that:\n\n\n\n\n> This is considerably later than the beginning of instruction at the al-Azhar under the Fatimids. So it is very difficult to sustain the claim that the University of Qarawiyyin is the \"oldest university\", and not only in the Muslim world! The mosque school or college did not assume the name of university until 1960 when in a ceremony Muhammad V invested it with that dignified title.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nA number of well-known philosophers, scholars, and politicians in the history of Morocco and the western Mediterranean have either studied or taught at the Qarawiyyin since its founding.\n\n\n\n* Maimonides (1135/1138–1204), Jewish philosopher[1][108][109][110]\n* Ibn Arabi (1165–1240), Sufi philosopher[108][109]\n* Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406), historian and philosopher[1][108][37][109]\n* Leo Africanus (1494–1554), author[108]\n* Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari (1632-1577), historian and theologian, appointed imam and mufti by the Saadi Sultan Zaydan[111]\n* Imam al-Bannani (1727–1780), faqīh (Muslim jurist)[*citation needed*]\n* Ahmad ibn Idris (1760–1837), Moroccan Sufi scholar[112]\n* Muhammad al-Kattani (1873–1909), writer and political leader[113]\n* Abd el-Krim el-Khattabi (1882–1963), Rifian-Moroccan political and military leader[114]\n* Allal al-Fassi (1910–1974), Moroccan politician[115]\n* Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali (1893–1987), translator[116]\n* Abdullah al-Ghumari (1910–1993), faqīh (Muslim jurist)[117]\n* Fatima al-Kabbaj (1932–), Member of High Council of Knowledge [ar] (Islamic council) Notably, one of the first few women to be admitted.[15]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Morocco portal\n\n\n* List of Islamic educational institutions\n* List of universities in Morocco\n* Education in Morocco\n* History of medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** One single plate from *Bab al-Gna'iz* is also kept by the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris.[60]: 56\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** Lulat, Y.

It was founded as a mosque in Fès in the middle of the ninth century. It has been a destination for students and scholars of Islamic sciences and Arabic studies throughout the history of Morocco. There were also other religious schools like the madras of ibn yusuf and other schools in the sus. This system of basic education called al-ta'lim al-aSil was funded by the sultans of Morocco and many famous traditional families. After independence, al-qarawiyin maintained its reputation, but it seemed important to transform it into a university that would prepare graduates for a modern country while maintaining an emphasis on Islamic studies. Hence, al-qarawiyin university was founded in February 1963 and, while the dean's residence was kept in Fès, the new university initially had four colleges located in major regions of the country known for their religious influences and madrasas. These colleges were kuliyat al-shari's in Fès, kuliyat uSul al-din in Tétouan, kuliyat al-lugha al-'arabiya in Marrakech (all founded in 1963), and kuliyat al-shari'a in Ait Melloul near Agadir, which was founded in 1979.\n> \n>\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Belhachmi, Zakia (2008). *Women, Education, and Science within the Arab-Islamic Socio-Cultural History: Legacies for Social Change*.

In terms of structure, the adjustments were twofold: the reorganization of the available original madaris, and the creation of new institutions. This resulted in three different types of Islamic teaching institutions in al-Maghrib. The first type was derived from the fusion of old madaris with new universities. For example, Morocco transformed Al-Qarawiyin (859 A.D) into a university under the supervision of the ministry of education in 1963.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Petersen, Andrew: *Dictionary of Islamic Architecture*, Routledge, 1996, ISBN 978-0-415-06084-4, p. 87 (entry \"Fez\"): \n> The Quaraouiyine Mosque, founded in 859, is the most famous mosque of Morocco and attracted continuous investment by Muslim rulers.\n> \n>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** ***ad*** ***ae*** ***af*** ***ag*** ***ah*** ***ai*** ***aj*** ***ak*** ***al*** ***am*** ***an*** ***ao*** ***ap*** ***aq*** ***ar*** ***as*** ***at*** ***au*** ***av*** ***aw*** ***ax*** ***ay*** ***az*** ***ba*** ***bb*** ***bc*** ***bd*** ***be*** ***bf*** ***bg*** ***bh*** ***bi*** ***bj*** ***bk*** ***bl*** ***bm*** ***bn*** ***bo*** ***bp*** Terrasse, Henri (1968). *La Mosquée al-Qaraouiyin à Fès; avec une étude de Gaston Deverdun sur les inscriptions historiques de la mosquée*.

For example many madrasah teachers are versed in Islamic pedagogy but also in modern university pedagogic developments such as behaviourist, cognitivist and the more recent constructivist styles. Al-Qarawiyyin University, in Morocco, represents such an institution that is grounded in a traditional madrasah education but for example, continues to adopt ancillary subjects and modern technologies such as mobile learning.\n10. **^** Makdisi, George: \"Madrasa and University in the Middle Ages\", *Studia Islamica*, No. 32 (1970), pp. 255–264 (255f.): \n> In studying an institution which is foreign and remote in point of time, as is the case of the medieval madrasa, one runs the double risk of attributing to it characteristics borrowed from one's own institutions and one's own times. Thus gratuitous transfers may be made from one culture to the other, and the time factor may be ignored or dismissed as being without significance. One cannot, therefore, be too careful in attempting a comparative study of these two institutions: the madrasa and the university. But in spite of the pitfalls inherent in such a study, albeit sketchy, the results which may be obtained are well worth the risks involved. In any case, one cannot avoid making comparisons when certain unwarranted statements have already been made and seem to be currently accepted without question. The most unwarranted of these statements is the one which makes of the \"madrasa\" a \"university\".\n> \n>\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Verger, Jacques: \"Patterns\", in: Ridder-Symoens, Hilde de (ed.): *A History of the University in Europe.

It is no doubt true that other civilizations, prior to, or wholly alien to, the medieval West, such as the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Islam, or China, were familiar with forms of higher education which a number of historians, for the sake of convenience, have sometimes described as universities. Yet a closer look makes it plain that the institutional reality was altogether different and, no matter what has been said on the subject, there is no real link such as would justify us in associating them with medieval universities in the West. Until there is definite proof to the contrary, these latter must be regarded as the sole source of the model which gradually spread through the whole of Europe and then to the whole world. We are therefore concerned with what is indisputably an original institution, which can only be defined in terms of a historical analysis of its emergence and its mode of operation in concrete circumstances.\n> \n>\n12. **^** \"Oldest higher-learning institution, oldest university\". *Guinness World Records*.

Vol. I: Universities in the Middle Ages*, Cambridge University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-521-36105-2, pp. XIX-XX: \n> The university is a European institution; indeed, it is the European institution *par excellence*. There are various reasons for this assertion. As a community of teachers and taught, accorded certain rights, such as administrative autonomy and the determination and realization of curricula (courses of study) and of the objectives of research as well as the award of publicly recognized degrees, it is a creation of medieval Europe, which was the Europe of papal Christianity...\n> \n> \n> No other European institution has spread over the entire world in the way in which the traditional form of the European university has done. The degrees awarded by European universities – the bachelor's degree, the licentiate, the master's degree, and the doctorate – have been adopted in the most diverse societies throughout the world. The four medieval faculties of *artes* – variously called philosophy, letters, arts, arts and sciences, and humanities –, law, medicine, and theology have survived and have been supplemented by numerous disciplines, particularly the social sciences and technological studies, but they remain nonetheless at the heart of universities throughout the world.\n> \n> \n> Even the name of the *Universitas*, which in the Middle Ages was applied to corporate bodies of the most diverse sorts and was accordingly applied to the corporate organization of teachers and students, has in the course of centuries been given a more particular focus: the university, as a *universitas litterarum*, has since the eighteenth century been the intellectual institution which cultivates and transmits the entire corpus of methodically studied intellectual disciplines.\n> \n>\n101. **^** Sanz, Nuria; Bergan, Sjur (eds.): *The Heritage of European Universities*, Council of Europe, 2002, ISBN 978-92-871-4960-2, p. 119: \n> In many respects, if there is any institution that Europe can most justifiably claim as one of its inventions, it is the university. As proof thereof and without wishing here to recount the whole history of the birth of universities, it will suffice to describe briefly how the invention of universities took the form of a polycentric process of specifically European origin.\n> \n>\n102. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Makdisi, George (April–June 1989), \"Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West\", *Journal of the American Oriental Society*, **109** (2), American Oriental Society: 175–182 [176], doi:10.2307/604423, JSTOR 604423\n103. **^** Burke II, Edmund (2009). \"Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity\". *Journal of World History*. **20** (2): 165–186. doi:10.1353/jwh.0.0045.

Associated with Al-Azhar Al-Sharif in Islamic Cairo, it is Egypt's oldest degree-granting university and is known as one of the most prestigious universities for Islamic learning.[2][3] In addition to higher education, Al-Azhar oversees a national network of schools with approximately two million students.[4] As of 1996, over 4,000 teaching institutes in Egypt were affiliated with the university.[5]\n\n\nFounded in 970 or 972 by the Fatimid Caliphate as a centre of Islamic learning, its students studied the Qur'an and Islamic law in detail, along with logic, grammar, rhetoric, and how to calculate the phases of the moon. Today it is the chief centre of Arabic literature and Islamic learning in the world.[6] In 1961 additional non-religious subjects were added to its curriculum.[7]\n\n\nIts library is considered second in importance in Egypt only to the Egyptian National Library and Archives.[8] In May 2005, Al-Azhar in partnership with a Dubai information technology enterprise, IT Education Project (ITEP) launched the H.H. Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum project to preserve Al Azhar scripts and publish them online (the \"Al-Azhar Online Project\") to eventually publish online access to the library's entire rare manuscripts collection, comprising about seven million pages of material.[9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### Beginnings under the Fatimids\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The courtyard of the Al-Azhar Mosque, which largely dates to the Fatimid period \nAl-Azhar is one of the relics of the Isma'ili Shi'a Fatimid dynasty, which claimed descent from Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad and wife of Ali, son-in-law, and cousin of Muhammad. Fatimah was called *al-Zahra* (the luminous), and the institution was named in her honor.[11] It was founded as a mosque by the Fatimid commander Jawhar al-Siqilli at the orders of the Caliph and Imam Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah as he founded the city for Cairo. It was begun (probably on Saturday) in Jumada al-Awwal in the year AH 359 (March/April 970 CE). Its building was completed on the 9th of Ramadan in AH 361 (24 June 972 CE). Both Caliph al-Aziz Billah and Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah added to its premises. It was further repaired, renovated, and extended by al-Mustansir Billah and al-Hafiz li-Din Allah.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prayer hall of Al-Azhar Mosque\nThe Fatimid caliphs always encouraged scholars and jurists to have their study-circles and gatherings in this mosque and thus it was turned into a madrasa which has the claim to be considered as the oldest such institution still functioning.[12][13] The mosque provided teaching on a variety of subjects from a variety of scholars.[14] According to Syed Farid Alatas, these subjects included Islamic law and jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, Islamic philosophy, and logic.[15] Under the Fatimids, Al-Azhar also notably promoted Shia Islam.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Saladin\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 12th century, following the overthrow of the Isma'ili Fatimid dynasty, Saladin (the founder of the Sunni Ayyubid Dynasty) converted Al-Azhar to a Shafi'ite Sunni center of learning.[6][18] Therefore, \"he had all the treasures of the palace, including the books, sold over a period of ten years. Many were burned, thrown into the Nile, or thrown into a great heap, which was covered with sand, so that a regular \"hill of books\" was formed and the soldiers used to sole their shoes with the fine bindings. The number of books said to have disposed of varies from 120,000 to 2,000,000.\"[19][20] Abd-el-latif delivered lectures on Islamic medicine at Al-Azhar, while according to legend the Jewish philosopher Maimonides delivered lectures on medicine and astronomy there during the time of Saladin though no historical proof has corroborated this.[21]\n\n\nSaladin introduced the college system in Egypt, which was also adopted in Al-Azhar. Under this system, the college was a separate institution within the mosque compound, with its own classrooms, dormitories and a library.[22]\n\n\n\n### Mamluks\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder the Mamluks, Al-Azhar gained influence and rose in prestige.[23] \nThe Mamluks established salaries for instructors and stipends for the students and gave the institution an endowment.[22] A college was built for the institution in 1340, outside of the mosque. In the late 1400s, the buildings were renovated and new dormitories were built for the students.[22]\n\n\nDuring this time Cairo had 70 other institutions of Islamic learning, however, Al-Azhar attracted many scholars due to its prestige. The famed Ibn Khaldun taught at Al-Azhar starting in 1383.[23]\n\n\nDuring this time texts were few and much of the learning happened by students memorizing their teachers' lectures and notes. In fact, blind young boys were enrolled at Al-Azhar in the hopes that they could eventually earn a living as teachers.[22]\n\n\n\n### Ottomans\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Gate of the Barbers, one of the entrances to the mosque embellished during the Ottoman period\nDuring the Ottoman period, Al-Azhar's prestige and influence grew to the point of becoming the preeminent institution for Islamic learning in the Sunni Muslim world.[23] During this time, the *Shaykh Al-Azhar* was established, an office given to the leading scholar at the institution; prior to this the head of the institution was not necessarily a scholar.[24] In 1748, the Ottoman pasha tried to get Al-Azhar to teach astronomy and mathematics, to little avail.[22]\n\n\nDuring the time there wasn't a system of academic degrees, instead the *shaykh* (professor) determined if the student was sufficiently trained to enter a professor (ijazah). The average length of study was 6 years. Despite the lack of bureaucracy, the training remained rigorous and prolonged.[22] Students were loosely organized into *riwaq* (a sort of fraternity) organized according to their nationality and branch of Islamic law they studied. Each *riwaq* was supervised by a professor. A rector, usually a senior professor, oversaw the finances.[22]\n\n\n\n### Post-Ottoman\n\n[edit]\n\nBy the mid 19th century, al-Azhar had surpassed Istanbul and was considered the capital of Sunni legal expertise;[25] a main centre of power in the Islamic world; and a rival to Damascus, Mecca and Baghdad.\n\n\nWhen the Kingdom of Egypt was established in 1923, the signing of the new nation's constitution was delayed because of King Fuad I's insistence that Al-Azhar and other religious institutions were to be subject to him and not the Egyptian parliament.[26] The King Fuad I Edition of the Qur’an[27] was first published on 10 July 1924 by a committee from Al-Azhar University[28] Prominent committee members included Islamic scholar, Muhammad b. ‘Ali al-Husayni al-Haddad. Noteworthy Western scholars/academics working in Egypt at the time include Bergsträsser and Jeffery. Methodological differences aside, speculation alludes to a spirit of cooperation. Bergsträsser was certainly impressed with the work.[29]\n\n\nIn March 1924, Abdülmecid II had been deposed as Caliph, supreme religious and political leader of all Muslims across the world.[30] The Grand Sheikh of al-Azhar repudiated the abolition[31] and was part of a call from Al-Azhar for an Islamic Conference. The unsuccessful \"caliphate conference\" was held under the presidency of the Grand Chancellor of Azhar in 1926[32][33] but no one was able to gain a consensus for the candidacy across the Islamic world. Candidates proposed for the caliphate included King Fuad.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Modernization\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)An Azhari institute in TantaThe pioneering Pakistani journalist Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah became the first woman to address the university in 1955. In 1961, Al-Azhar was re-established as a university under the government of Egypt's second President Gamal Abdel Nasser when a wide range of secular faculties were added for the first time, such as business, economics, science, pharmacy, medicine, engineering and agriculture. Before that date, the *Encyclopaedia of Islam* classifies the Al-Azhar variously as madrasa, center of higher learning and, since the 19th century, religious university, but not as a university in the full sense, referring to the modern transition process as \"from madrasa to university\".[7][34] Other academic sources also refer to al-Azhar as a madrasa in pre-modern times before its transformation into a university.[35][36][37] An Islamic women's faculty was also added in the same year, six years after Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah had been the first woman to speak at the university.[38]\n\n\n## Religious ideology\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Ash'arism |\n| ![](image)Rock carved with *al-'Aqida al-Murshida* by Ibn Tumart\n |\n|

The theological schools of al-Ash'ari and al-Maturidi were both represented. It has a long tradition of teaching all four schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi, and Hanbali). The chief mufti of each school of thought acted as the dean, responsible for the teachers and students in that group.[39] During the time of the Ottomans, the Hanafi dean came to hold a position as *primus inter pares*.[39] It also had membership from the seven main Sufi orders.[40] Al-Azhar has had an antagonistic relationship with Wahhabism.[41] According to a 2011 report issued by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Al Azhar is strongly Sufi in character:\n\n\n\n\n> Adherence to a Sufi order has long been standard for both professors and students in the al-Azhar mosque and university system. Although al-Azhar is not monolithic, its identity has been strongly associated with Sufism. The current Shaykh al-Azhar (rector of the school), Ahmed el-Tayeb, is a hereditary Sufi shaykh from Upper Egypt who has recently expressed his support for the formation of a world Sufi league; the former Grand Mufti of Egypt and senior al-Azhar scholar Ali Gomaa is also a highly respected Sufi master.[42]\n> \n> \n\n\nHowever, in the early 20th century, enlightened Modernist thinkers such as Muhammad Abduh led a reform of the curriculum, reintroducing a desire for legal reform through ijtihad.[43][44] Subsequently, disputes were had between modernist intellectuals and traditionalists within al-Azhar.[45] Al-Azhar now maintains a modernist position, advocating \"Wasatiyya\" (centrism), a reaction against the extreme textualism of many Wahhabi Salafi ideologues. Wasatiyya covers a range of thinkers, some of whom are liberal intellectuals with religious inclinations, preachers such as Yusuf al-Qaradawi and many members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Since the 2013 coup however, Al-Azhar has taken a position against the brotherhood.[46]\n\n\nThe nineteenth and current Grand Mufti of Egypt and Al Azhar scholar, is Shawki Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam. The university is opposed to overt liberal reform of Islam and issued a fatwa against the liberal Ibn Rushd-Goethe mosque in Berlin because it banned face-covering veils such as burqa and niqab on its premises while allowing women and men to pray together. The fatwa encompassed all present and future liberal mosques.[47]\n\n\n\n## Council of Senior Scholars\n\n[edit]\n\nAl-Azhar University's Council of Senior Scholars was founded in 1911 but was replaced in 1961 by the Center for Islamic Research. In July 2012, after the law restricting Al-Azhar University's autonomy was modified by the incoming president Mohamed Morsi, the council was reformed.[48] The Council consists of 40 members and as of February 2013 had 14 vacancies[49] all appointed by the current imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed El-Tayeb,[50] who was appointed by the prior president, Hosni Mubarak. Once the remaining 14 vacancies are filled, new vacancies will be appointed by the existing Council itself.[49] All four madhahib (schools) of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence are proportionally represented on the council (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Hanbali, Maliki) and voting is on a majority basis.[48] In addition to El-Tayeb, other prominent members of the Council include the outgoing Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa.[51] The council is tasked with nominating the Grand Mufti of Egypt (subject to presidential approval), electing the next Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque, and is expected to be the final authority in determining if new legislation is compliant with Islamic law.[48] Although the council's decisions are not binding (absent new legislation), it is expected that it would be difficult for the parliament to pass legislation deemed by the council as against Islamic law.[48]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Al-Tayeb referred a relatively minor issue related to Islamic bonds to the council, for the first time asserting the council's jurisdiction.[48] In 2013, the Council elected Shawki Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam to be the next Grand Mufti of Egypt. This marks the first time that the Grand Mufti would be elected by Islamic scholars since the position was created in 1895. Prior to this, the Egyptian head of state made the appointment.[50]\n\n\n\n## Views\n\n[edit]\n\nAl-Azhar's muftis have a history of being consulted on political issues. Muhammad Ali Pasha appointed Al-Azhar muftis to the *Consultative Council* in 1829 and this would be repeated by Abbas I and later Isma'il Pasha. At the same time, there were many cases where the Egyptian ruler would disregard the opinion of Al-Azhar scholars.[39]\nSheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy noted that among the priorities of Muslims are \"to master all knowledge of the world and the hereafter, not least the technology of modern weapons to strengthen and defend the community and faith\". He added that \"mastery over modern weaponry is important to prepare for any eventuality or prejudices of the others, although Islam is a religion of peace\".[52]\n\n\nSheikh Tantawy also reasserted that his is the best faith to follow and that Muslims have the duty of active da'wa. He has made declarations about Muslims interacting with non-Muslims who are not a threat to Muslims. There are non-Muslims living apart from Muslims and who are not enemies of Islam (\"Muslims are allowed to undertake exchanges of interests with these non-Muslims so long as these ties do not tarnish the image of the faith\"), and there are \"the non-Muslims who live in the same country as the Muslims in cooperation and on friendly terms, and are not enemies of the faith\" (\"in this case, their rights and responsibilities are the same as the Muslims so long as they do not become enemies of Islam\"). Shi'a fiqh (according to a fatwa by Al-Azhar)[53] is accepted as a fifth school of Islamic thought.\n\n\nIn October 2007, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, then the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, drew allegations of stifling freedom of speech when he asked the Egyptian government to toughen its rules and punishments against journalists. During a Friday sermon in the presence of Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif and a number of ministers, Tantawy was alleged to have stated that journalism which contributes to the spread of false rumours rather than true news deserved to be boycotted, and that it was tantamount to sinning for readers to purchase such newspapers. Tantawy, a supporter of then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, also called for a punishment of eighty lashes to \"those who spread rumors\" in an indictment of speculation by journalists over Mubarak's ill health and possible death.[54][55] This was not the first time that he had criticized the Egyptian press regarding its news coverage nor the first time he in return had been accused by the press of opposing freedom of speech. During a religious celebration in the same month, Tantawy had released comments alluding to \"the arrogant and the pretenders who accuse others with the ugliest vice and unsubstantiated charges\". In response, Egypt's press union issued a statement suggesting that Tantawy appeared to be involved in inciting and escalating a campaign against journalists and freedom of the press.[56] Tantawy died in 2010 and was succeeded by Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb.\n\n\nIn 2016 Ahmed el-Tayeb reissued the fatwa on Shia Muslims, calling Shia the fifth school of Islam and seeing no problem with conversions from Sunni to Shia Islam.[57] However, the NGOs report that violence and propaganda against the country's Shia minority continues. Shia Muslims are frequently denied services in addition to being called derogatory names. Anti-Shia sentiment is spread through education at all levels. Clerics educated at Al-Azhar University publicly promote sectarian beliefs by calling Shia Muslims infidels and encourage isolation and marginalization of Shia Muslims in Egypt.[58][59]\n\n\nScholars from Al-Azhar declared the writings to Farag Foda to be blasphemous.[60] Muhammad al-Ghazali, a member of Al-Azhar, declared Foda to be guilty of apostasy.[60] According to Geneive Abdo, Muhammad al-Ghazali also added that anyone killing an apostate would not be punished, while according to Nathan Brown, Muhammad al-Ghazali stopped just short of condoning Foroda's assassination.\n[61] Foda was assassinated in June 1992,[62][63] by an Egyptian terrorist group al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya, who claimed justification from Al-Azhar's fatwas.[64] In response, a scholar at Al-Azhar published *Man Qatala Faraj Fawda*.[65]\n\n\n\n## Notable people\n\n[edit]\n\n**10th–17th centuries**\n\n\n\n* Fatimid commander Jawhar at the orders of the Caliph Al-Muizz (972)\n* Al-'Aziz Billah (975–996)\n* Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (996–1021)\n* Al-Mustansir Billah (1021–1036) and Al-Hafiz Li-Din-illah\n* Ibn al-Haytham (965 –1040) Arab physicist, mathematician, astronomer and referred to as \"the father of modern optics\".\n* Sibt al-Maridini (1423 – 1506) Arab physicist, mathematician and astronomer.\n* Abd al-'Aziz al-Wafa'i (15th century) Arab physicist, mathematician and astronomer.\n* Abdul Qadir al-Baghdadi (1620–1682 AD) author, philologist, grammarian, magistrate, bibliophile and a leading literary encyclopedic of the Ottoman era.\n\n\n**19th – early 20th centuries**\n\n\n\n* Muhammad Abduh and Sayd Jamal edin Afghani, founder of Islamic Modernism\n* Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, founder and leader of Black Hand\n* Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, Mufti of Jerusalem\n* Ahmed Orabi, Egyptian nationalist and army general who led the Urabi Revolt against Khedive Tewfik\n\n\n**1910s–1950s**\n\n\n\n* Hassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood (he graduated from Dar al-Ulum which is an affiliate of Cairo University)\n* Syed Mujtaba Ali, Bangladeshi author, journalist, travel enthusiast, academic, scholar and linguist.

Associated with Al-Azhar Al-Sharif in Islamic Cairo, it is Egypt's oldest degree-granting university and is known as one of the most prestigious universities for Islamic learning.[2][3] In addition to higher education, Al-Azhar oversees a national network of schools with approximately two million students.[4] As of 1996, over 4,000 teaching institutes in Egypt were affiliated with the university.[5]\n\n\nFounded in 970 or 972 by the Fatimid Caliphate as a centre of Islamic learning, its students studied the Qur'an and Islamic law in detail, along with logic, grammar, rhetoric, and how to calculate the phases of the moon. Today it is the chief centre of Arabic literature and Islamic learning in the world.[6] In 1961 additional non-religious subjects were added to its curriculum.[7]\n\n\nIts library is considered second in importance in Egypt only to the Egyptian National Library and Archives.[8] In May 2005, Al-Azhar in partnership with a Dubai information technology enterprise, IT Education Project (ITEP) launched the H.H. Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum project to preserve Al Azhar scripts and publish them online (the \"Al-Azhar Online Project\") to eventually publish online access to the library's entire rare manuscripts collection, comprising about seven million pages of material.[9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### Beginnings under the Fatimids\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The courtyard of the Al-Azhar Mosque, which largely dates to the Fatimid period \nAl-Azhar is one of the relics of the Isma'ili Shi'a Fatimid dynasty, which claimed descent from Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad and wife of Ali, son-in-law, and cousin of Muhammad. Fatimah was called *al-Zahra* (the luminous), and the institution was named in her honor.[11] It was founded as a mosque by the Fatimid commander Jawhar al-Siqilli at the orders of the Caliph and Imam Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah as he founded the city for Cairo. It was begun (probably on Saturday) in Jumada al-Awwal in the year AH 359 (March/April 970 CE). Its building was completed on the 9th of Ramadan in AH 361 (24 June 972 CE). Both Caliph al-Aziz Billah and Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah added to its premises. It was further repaired, renovated, and extended by al-Mustansir Billah and al-Hafiz li-Din Allah.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prayer hall of Al-Azhar Mosque\nThe Fatimid caliphs always encouraged scholars and jurists to have their study-circles and gatherings in this mosque and thus it was turned into a madrasa which has the claim to be considered as the oldest such institution still functioning.[12][13] The mosque provided teaching on a variety of subjects from a variety of scholars.[14] According to Syed Farid Alatas, these subjects included Islamic law and jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, Islamic philosophy, and logic.[15] Under the Fatimids, Al-Azhar also notably promoted Shia Islam.[16][17]\n\n\n\n### Saladin\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 12th century, following the overthrow of the Isma'ili Fatimid dynasty, Saladin (the founder of the Sunni Ayyubid Dynasty) converted Al-Azhar to a Shafi'ite Sunni center of learning.[6][18] Therefore, \"he had all the treasures of the palace, including the books, sold over a period of ten years. Many were burned, thrown into the Nile, or thrown into a great heap, which was covered with sand, so that a regular \"hill of books\" was formed and the soldiers used to sole their shoes with the fine bindings. The number of books said to have disposed of varies from 120,000 to 2,000,000.\"[19][20] Abd-el-latif delivered lectures on Islamic medicine at Al-Azhar, while according to legend the Jewish philosopher Maimonides delivered lectures on medicine and astronomy there during the time of Saladin though no historical proof has corroborated this.[21]\n\n\nSaladin introduced the college system in Egypt, which was also adopted in Al-Azhar. Under this system, the college was a separate institution within the mosque compound, with its own classrooms, dormitories and a library.[22]\n\n\n\n### Mamluks\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder the Mamluks, Al-Azhar gained influence and rose in prestige.[23] \nThe Mamluks established salaries for instructors and stipends for the students and gave the institution an endowment.[22] A college was built for the institution in 1340, outside of the mosque. In the late 1400s, the buildings were renovated and new dormitories were built for the students.[22]\n\n\nDuring this time Cairo had 70 other institutions of Islamic learning, however, Al-Azhar attracted many scholars due to its prestige. The famed Ibn Khaldun taught at Al-Azhar starting in 1383.[23]\n\n\nDuring this time texts were few and much of the learning happened by students memorizing their teachers' lectures and notes. In fact, blind young boys were enrolled at Al-Azhar in the hopes that they could eventually earn a living as teachers.[22]\n\n\n\n### Ottomans\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Gate of the Barbers, one of the entrances to the mosque embellished during the Ottoman period\nDuring the Ottoman period, Al-Azhar's prestige and influence grew to the point of becoming the preeminent institution for Islamic learning in the Sunni Muslim world.[23] During this time, the *Shaykh Al-Azhar* was established, an office given to the leading scholar at the institution; prior to this the head of the institution was not necessarily a scholar.[24] In 1748, the Ottoman pasha tried to get Al-Azhar to teach astronomy and mathematics, to little avail.[22]\n\n\nDuring the time there wasn't a system of academic degrees, instead the *shaykh* (professor) determined if the student was sufficiently trained to enter a professor (ijazah). The average length of study was 6 years. Despite the lack of bureaucracy, the training remained rigorous and prolonged.[22] Students were loosely organized into *riwaq* (a sort of fraternity) organized according to their nationality and branch of Islamic law they studied. Each *riwaq* was supervised by a professor. A rector, usually a senior professor, oversaw the finances.[22]\n\n\n\n### Post-Ottoman\n\n[edit]\n\nBy the mid 19th century, al-Azhar had surpassed Istanbul and was considered the capital of Sunni legal expertise;[25] a main centre of power in the Islamic world; and a rival to Damascus, Mecca and Baghdad.\n\n\nWhen the Kingdom of Egypt was established in 1923, the signing of the new nation's constitution was delayed because of King Fuad I's insistence that Al-Azhar and other religious institutions were to be subject to him and not the Egyptian parliament.[26] The King Fuad I Edition of the Qur’an[27] was first published on 10 July 1924 by a committee from Al-Azhar University[28] Prominent committee members included Islamic scholar, Muhammad b. ‘Ali al-Husayni al-Haddad. Noteworthy Western scholars/academics working in Egypt at the time include Bergsträsser and Jeffery. Methodological differences aside, speculation alludes to a spirit of cooperation. Bergsträsser was certainly impressed with the work.[29]\n\n\nIn March 1924, Abdülmecid II had been deposed as Caliph, supreme religious and political leader of all Muslims across the world.[30] The Grand Sheikh of al-Azhar repudiated the abolition[31] and was part of a call from Al-Azhar for an Islamic Conference. The unsuccessful \"caliphate conference\" was held under the presidency of the Grand Chancellor of Azhar in 1926[32][33] but no one was able to gain a consensus for the candidacy across the Islamic world. Candidates proposed for the caliphate included King Fuad.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Modernization\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)An Azhari institute in TantaThe pioneering Pakistani journalist Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah became the first woman to address the university in 1955. In 1961, Al-Azhar was re-established as a university under the government of Egypt's second President Gamal Abdel Nasser when a wide range of secular faculties were added for the first time, such as business, economics, science, pharmacy, medicine, engineering and agriculture. Before that date, the *Encyclopaedia of Islam* classifies the Al-Azhar variously as madrasa, center of higher learning and, since the 19th century, religious university, but not as a university in the full sense, referring to the modern transition process as \"from madrasa to university\".[7][34] Other academic sources also refer to al-Azhar as a madrasa in pre-modern times before its transformation into a university.[35][36][37] An Islamic women's faculty was also added in the same year, six years after Zaib-un-Nissa Hamidullah had been the first woman to speak at the university.[38]\n\n\n## Religious ideology\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Ash'arism |\n| ![](image)Rock carved with *al-'Aqida al-Murshida* by Ibn Tumart\n |\n|

The theological schools of al-Ash'ari and al-Maturidi were both represented. It has a long tradition of teaching all four schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi, and Hanbali). The chief mufti of each school of thought acted as the dean, responsible for the teachers and students in that group.[39] During the time of the Ottomans, the Hanafi dean came to hold a position as *primus inter pares*.[39] It also had membership from the seven main Sufi orders.[40] Al-Azhar has had an antagonistic relationship with Wahhabism.[41] According to a 2011 report issued by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Al Azhar is strongly Sufi in character:\n\n\n\n\n> Adherence to a Sufi order has long been standard for both professors and students in the al-Azhar mosque and university system. Although al-Azhar is not monolithic, its identity has been strongly associated with Sufism. The current Shaykh al-Azhar (rector of the school), Ahmed el-Tayeb, is a hereditary Sufi shaykh from Upper Egypt who has recently expressed his support for the formation of a world Sufi league; the former Grand Mufti of Egypt and senior al-Azhar scholar Ali Gomaa is also a highly respected Sufi master.[42]\n> \n> \n\n\nHowever, in the early 20th century, enlightened Modernist thinkers such as Muhammad Abduh led a reform of the curriculum, reintroducing a desire for legal reform through ijtihad.[43][44] Subsequently, disputes were had between modernist intellectuals and traditionalists within al-Azhar.[45] Al-Azhar now maintains a modernist position, advocating \"Wasatiyya\" (centrism), a reaction against the extreme textualism of many Wahhabi Salafi ideologues. Wasatiyya covers a range of thinkers, some of whom are liberal intellectuals with religious inclinations, preachers such as Yusuf al-Qaradawi and many members of the Muslim Brotherhood. Since the 2013 coup however, Al-Azhar has taken a position against the brotherhood.[46]\n\n\nThe nineteenth and current Grand Mufti of Egypt and Al Azhar scholar, is Shawki Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam. The university is opposed to overt liberal reform of Islam and issued a fatwa against the liberal Ibn Rushd-Goethe mosque in Berlin because it banned face-covering veils such as burqa and niqab on its premises while allowing women and men to pray together. The fatwa encompassed all present and future liberal mosques.[47]\n\n\n\n## Council of Senior Scholars\n\n[edit]\n\nAl-Azhar University's Council of Senior Scholars was founded in 1911 but was replaced in 1961 by the Center for Islamic Research. In July 2012, after the law restricting Al-Azhar University's autonomy was modified by the incoming president Mohamed Morsi, the council was reformed.[48] The Council consists of 40 members and as of February 2013 had 14 vacancies[49] all appointed by the current imam of Al-Azhar, Ahmed El-Tayeb,[50] who was appointed by the prior president, Hosni Mubarak. Once the remaining 14 vacancies are filled, new vacancies will be appointed by the existing Council itself.[49] All four madhahib (schools) of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence are proportionally represented on the council (Hanafi, Shafi'i, Hanbali, Maliki) and voting is on a majority basis.[48] In addition to El-Tayeb, other prominent members of the Council include the outgoing Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa.[51] The council is tasked with nominating the Grand Mufti of Egypt (subject to presidential approval), electing the next Grand Imam of Al-Azhar Mosque, and is expected to be the final authority in determining if new legislation is compliant with Islamic law.[48] Although the council's decisions are not binding (absent new legislation), it is expected that it would be difficult for the parliament to pass legislation deemed by the council as against Islamic law.[48]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Al-Tayeb referred a relatively minor issue related to Islamic bonds to the council, for the first time asserting the council's jurisdiction.[48] In 2013, the Council elected Shawki Ibrahim Abdel-Karim Allam to be the next Grand Mufti of Egypt. This marks the first time that the Grand Mufti would be elected by Islamic scholars since the position was created in 1895. Prior to this, the Egyptian head of state made the appointment.[50]\n\n\n\n## Views\n\n[edit]\n\nAl-Azhar's muftis have a history of being consulted on political issues. Muhammad Ali Pasha appointed Al-Azhar muftis to the *Consultative Council* in 1829 and this would be repeated by Abbas I and later Isma'il Pasha. At the same time, there were many cases where the Egyptian ruler would disregard the opinion of Al-Azhar scholars.[39]\nSheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy noted that among the priorities of Muslims are \"to master all knowledge of the world and the hereafter, not least the technology of modern weapons to strengthen and defend the community and faith\". He added that \"mastery over modern weaponry is important to prepare for any eventuality or prejudices of the others, although Islam is a religion of peace\".[52]\n\n\nSheikh Tantawy also reasserted that his is the best faith to follow and that Muslims have the duty of active da'wa. He has made declarations about Muslims interacting with non-Muslims who are not a threat to Muslims. There are non-Muslims living apart from Muslims and who are not enemies of Islam (\"Muslims are allowed to undertake exchanges of interests with these non-Muslims so long as these ties do not tarnish the image of the faith\"), and there are \"the non-Muslims who live in the same country as the Muslims in cooperation and on friendly terms, and are not enemies of the faith\" (\"in this case, their rights and responsibilities are the same as the Muslims so long as they do not become enemies of Islam\"). Shi'a fiqh (according to a fatwa by Al-Azhar)[53] is accepted as a fifth school of Islamic thought.\n\n\nIn October 2007, Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, then the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar, drew allegations of stifling freedom of speech when he asked the Egyptian government to toughen its rules and punishments against journalists. During a Friday sermon in the presence of Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif and a number of ministers, Tantawy was alleged to have stated that journalism which contributes to the spread of false rumours rather than true news deserved to be boycotted, and that it was tantamount to sinning for readers to purchase such newspapers. Tantawy, a supporter of then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, also called for a punishment of eighty lashes to \"those who spread rumors\" in an indictment of speculation by journalists over Mubarak's ill health and possible death.[54][55] This was not the first time that he had criticized the Egyptian press regarding its news coverage nor the first time he in return had been accused by the press of opposing freedom of speech. During a religious celebration in the same month, Tantawy had released comments alluding to \"the arrogant and the pretenders who accuse others with the ugliest vice and unsubstantiated charges\". In response, Egypt's press union issued a statement suggesting that Tantawy appeared to be involved in inciting and escalating a campaign against journalists and freedom of the press.[56] Tantawy died in 2010 and was succeeded by Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb.\n\n\nIn 2016 Ahmed el-Tayeb reissued the fatwa on Shia Muslims, calling Shia the fifth school of Islam and seeing no problem with conversions from Sunni to Shia Islam.[57] However, the NGOs report that violence and propaganda against the country's Shia minority continues. Shia Muslims are frequently denied services in addition to being called derogatory names. Anti-Shia sentiment is spread through education at all levels. Clerics educated at Al-Azhar University publicly promote sectarian beliefs by calling Shia Muslims infidels and encourage isolation and marginalization of Shia Muslims in Egypt.[58][59]\n\n\nScholars from Al-Azhar declared the writings to Farag Foda to be blasphemous.[60] Muhammad al-Ghazali, a member of Al-Azhar, declared Foda to be guilty of apostasy.[60] According to Geneive Abdo, Muhammad al-Ghazali also added that anyone killing an apostate would not be punished, while according to Nathan Brown, Muhammad al-Ghazali stopped just short of condoning Foroda's assassination.\n[61] Foda was assassinated in June 1992,[62][63] by an Egyptian terrorist group al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya, who claimed justification from Al-Azhar's fatwas.[64] In response, a scholar at Al-Azhar published *Man Qatala Faraj Fawda*.[65]\n\n\n\n## Notable people\n\n[edit]\n\n**10th–17th centuries**\n\n\n\n* Fatimid commander Jawhar at the orders of the Caliph Al-Muizz (972)\n* Al-'Aziz Billah (975–996)\n* Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (996–1021)\n* Al-Mustansir Billah (1021–1036) and Al-Hafiz Li-Din-illah\n* Ibn al-Haytham (965 –1040) Arab physicist, mathematician, astronomer and referred to as \"the father of modern optics\".\n* Sibt al-Maridini (1423 – 1506) Arab physicist, mathematician and astronomer.\n* Abd al-'Aziz al-Wafa'i (15th century) Arab physicist, mathematician and astronomer.\n* Abdul Qadir al-Baghdadi (1620–1682 AD) author, philologist, grammarian, magistrate, bibliophile and a leading literary encyclopedic of the Ottoman era.\n\n\n**19th – early 20th centuries**\n\n\n\n* Muhammad Abduh and Sayd Jamal edin Afghani, founder of Islamic Modernism\n* Izz ad-Din al-Qassam, founder and leader of Black Hand\n* Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, Mufti of Jerusalem\n* Ahmed Orabi, Egyptian nationalist and army general who led the Urabi Revolt against Khedive Tewfik\n\n\n**1910s–1950s**\n\n\n\n* Hassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood (he graduated from Dar al-Ulum which is an affiliate of Cairo University)\n* Syed Mujtaba Ali, Bangladeshi author, journalist, travel enthusiast, academic, scholar and linguist.

To be included in the list below, the university must have been founded before 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a country or region. It must also be still in operation, with institutional continuity retained throughout its history. So some early universities, including the University of Paris, founded around the beginning of the 13th century[5] but abolished by the French Revolution in 1793,[6] are excluded. Some institutions reemerge, but with new foundations, such as the modern University of Paris, which came into existence in 1896 after the *Louis Liard law* disbanded Napoleon's University of France system.\n\n\nThe word *university* is derived from the Latin *universitas magistrorum et scholarium*, which approximately means 'community of teachers and scholars'. The University of Bologna in Bologna, Italy, where teaching began around 1088 and which was organised into a university in the late twelfth century, is the world's oldest university in continuous operation,[1] and the first university in the sense of a higher-learning and degree-awarding institute.[7][8][1] The origin of many medieval universities can be traced back to the Catholic cathedral schools or monastic schools, which appeared as early as the sixth century and were run for hundreds of years as such before their formal establishment as universities in the high medieval period.[9]\n\n\nAncient higher-learning institutions, such as those of ancient Greece, ancient Persia, ancient Rome, Byzantium, ancient China, ancient India and the Islamic world, are not included in this list owing to their cultural, historical, structural and legal differences from the medieval European university from which the modern university evolved.[Note 2][Note 3][12] These include the University of al-Qarawiyyin and Al-Azhar University, which were founded as mosques in 857 and 970 respectively and developed into madrasas prior to the establishment of any European university, making them the oldest institutions of higher learning in continuous operation in the world. They became universities in 1963 and 1961 respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Medieval origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medieval university\n\nThe university as an institution was historically rooted in medieval society, which it in turn influenced and shaped. Academic historian Walter Rüegg asserts that:[12]\n\n\n\n\n> The university is a European institution; indeed, it is the European institution *par excellence*. There are various reasons for this assertion. As a community of teachers and taught, accorded certain rights, such as administrative autonomy and the determination and realisation of curricula (courses of study) and of the objectives of research as well as the award of publicly recognised degrees, it is a creation of medieval Europe, which was the Europe of papal Christianity [...].\n> \n> \n\n\n## Modern spread[edit]\n\n\nFrom the early modern period onwards, the university spread from the medieval Latin West across the globe, eventually replacing all other higher-learning institutions and becoming the preeminent institution for higher education everywhere. The process occurred in the following chronological order:[13]\n\n\n\n* Southern and Western Europe (from the 11th or 12th century)\n* Central and Northern Europe (from the 14th or 15th century)\n* Americas (from the 16th century)\n* Australia (from the 19th century)\n* Asia and Africa (from the 19th or 20th century), with the exception of the Philippines, where the University of Santo Tomas was established in the 17th century.\n\n\n## Founded as universities before 1500[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of medieval universities\n\nThis list includes medieval universities that were founded before 1500 and which have retained institutional continuity since then (excluding not only those that ceased to exist, but also those that merged into or split away to an institution which is regarded as newly established). Several of these have been closed for brief periods: for example the University of Siena was closed 1805–1815 during the Napoleonic wars, and universities in the Czech Republic and Poland were closed during Nazi occupation, 1938–1945.\n\n\nUniversities are dated from when, according to scholars, they first met the definition of a university. In cases such as the universities of Bologna and Oxford which trace their history back to teaching in individual schools prior to their formation into a university, or which existed in another form prior to being a university, the date in the list below is thus later than the date given by the institutions for their foundation.[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | University\n | Location\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Original | Current\n |\n| 1180–1190[15](teaching from c. 1088)\n | University of Bologna | ![](image) Kingdom of Italy,![](image) Holy Roman Empire | ![Italy](image) Bologna, Italy\n | Law schools existed in Bologna from the second half of the 12th century, with 1088 often considered to be the date on which teaching outside of ecclesiastical schools began.[16] In 1158, petitions by Bolognese doctors of law led to Emperor Barbarossa granting the \"Authentic *Habita*\", which granted various rights to students and masters but did not name Bologna or any other particular place of study.[17] However, it is unlikely that the university had become organised by the 1150s, and this may have been as late as the 1180s.[18] The law schools appear to have remained independent, private entities until around 1180, but became organised over the following decade. In 1189 the masters made an agreement with the commune not to transfer the *studium* to another town, while the Lombard students were organised into a 'nation' by 1191.[16][19] |\n| 1200–1214[20](teaching from c. 1096)\n | University of Oxford | ![](image) Kingdom of England | ![United Kingdom](image) Oxford, United Kingdom\n | Teaching existed in Oxford from the late 11th century,[21] with the university giving the date of 1096 for the earliest classes.[22] However, it was not until the early 13th century that the schools in Oxford took on an organised character. In 1201 a papal letter described John Grimm as *magister scolarum Oxonie*.[23] In 1209 the masters suspended their teaching in Oxford and moved to other towns (including Cambridge, leading to the foundation of the university there),[24] returning after a bull issued on 20 June 1214 by the papal legate, Niccolò de Romanis, that granted a number of rights to the university and established the office of chancellor.[25] Both Oxford and Cambridge were granted rights of discipline over students and of fixing rents in letters issued by King Henry III in 1231.[26] A royal charter, sometimes referred to as the Magna Carta of the university, was granted in 1244, awarding further rights to the university.[27] The university received a papal bull *Querentes in agro* in 1254, with a first version issued on 27 September and a second version on 6 October. The first version followed the common form of privileges granted to monastic houses, confirming the liberties and immunities granted to the university and placing the members of the university under papal protection, but the second version (which was the version recorded in the papal register) explicitly recognised and approved the existence of the university as a scholarly community and confirmed its \"liberties, ancient customs and approved statutes\".[28] |\n| 1209–1225[5] | University of Cambridge | ![](image) Kingdom of England | ![United Kingdom](image) Cambridge, United Kingdom\n | Founded by scholars leaving Oxford after a dispute caused by the execution of three scholars in 1209.[24] The university was organised under a chancellor by 1225.[29] The university takes 1209 as its official anniversary.[30] Along with Oxford, Cambridge was granted rights of discipline over its students and of fixing rents in letters issued by King Henry III in 1231.[26] It received papal recognition as an academic corporation via an indult granted by Pope Gregory IX in 1233 and was named as a *studium generale* in the papal bull *Inter singula* in 1318. The traditional view was that this raised it to a *studium generale* but more recent scholarship (which is now generally, although not universally, accepted) sees the bull as confirming, rather than conferring, this status.[31][32] |\n| 1218–1219[5] | University of Salamanca | ![Pennant of the Kingdom of León](image) Kingdom of León | ![Spain](image) Salamanca, Spain\n | The oldest university in the Hispanic world. The university was founded by Alfonso IX of León in 1218 and recognised by a papal bull from Pope Alexander IV in 1255.[33] |\n| 1222[5] | University of Padua | ![](image) Medieval commune of Padua | ![Italy](image) Padua, Italy\n | Founded by scholars and professors after leaving Bologna. Awarded the first degree in the world to be conferred on a woman, Elena Cornaro Piscopia, in 1678.[34][35] |\n| 1224[5] | University of Naples Federico II | ![](image) Kingdom of Sicily | ![Italy](image) Naples, Italy\n | It is the world's oldest state-funded university in continuous operation,[2][3] as one of the first to be founded by a head of state, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Sicily. Refounded in 1234, 1239 and 1465, and closed 1490–1507.[36] |\n| 1290[5] | University of Coimbra | ![Flag of Portugal (1248–1385](image) Kingdom of Portugal | ![Portugal](image) Coimbra, Portugal\n | Originally established in Lisbon but relocated to Coimbra from 1308 to 1338 and again from 1354 to 1377,[5] before finally moving permanently to Coimbra in 1537.[37] |\n| 1293 (Papal recognition 1346)[5] | University of Valladolid | ![Pennant of the Crown of Castile](image) Crown of Castile | ![Spain](image) Valladolid, Spain\n | Founded in the late 13th century,[5] probably by the city,[38] with the first documented reference dating from 1293.[39] |\n| 1308[5] | University of Perugia | ![Coat of arms of the Papal States](image) Papal States | ![Italy](image) Perugia, Italy\n | The university traces its history back to 1276 and statutes were granted in 1306 prior to the bull of Pope Clement V of 8 September 1308.[40] |\n| 1347[5] | Charles University | ![Coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia](image) Kingdom of Bohemia,![](image) Holy Roman Empire | ![Czech Republic](image) Prague, Czech Republic\n | Faculties of theology, law and medicine closed during the Bohemian Reformation, leaving only the faculty of liberal arts. Became Charles-Ferdinand University after the Thirty Years' War, with all four faculties restored. Split into German and Czech parts in 1882; the Czech branch restored the name Charles University after independence in 1918 and closed briefly during Nazi occupation (1939–1945) while the German branch closed permanently in 1945.[41] |\n| 1357[5](originally 1246–1252)[5] | University of Siena | ![Coat of arms of Siena](image) Republic of Siena | ![Italy](image) Siena, Italy\n | Claims to have been founded in 1240 by the Commune of Siena,[42] although Rashdall dates the proclamation of the Studium to 1246, when Frederick II tried to place a ban on scholars travelling to Bologna, the date also given by Verger.[5] Was granted some exemptions from taxes by Pope Innocent II in 1252, but closed shortly after when the scholars returned to Bologna. Attempted revivals in 1275 and (fed by further short-lived migrations of scholars from Bologna) in 1321 and 1338 were unsuccessful. Gained an Imperial Bull in 1357 \"granting it *de novo* the 'privileges of a Studium Generale.'\", but was not firmly established until \"[i]n 1408 a fresh grant of privileges was obtained from Pope Gregory XII\".[43] Closed temporarily in 1808–1815 when Napoleonic forces occupied Tuscany.[42] |\n| 1361[5] | University of Pavia | ![House of Visconti](image) Domain of the House of Visconti | ![Italy](image) Pavia, Italy\n | Transferred to Piacenza 1398–1412.[5] Closed for short periods during the Italian Wars, Napoleonic wars, and Revolutions of 1848.\n |\n| 1364[5] (re-established in 1400)[5] | Jagiellonian University | ![](image) Kingdom of Poland | ![Poland](image) Kraków, Poland\n | Founded by King Casimir the Great as a *studium generale* in 1364. After the death of Casimir the Great in 1370, the development of the university stalled, with lectures being held in various places across the city, including churches and the Wawel cathedral school, and eventually coming to a pause. The faculty of theology was re-opened in 1397 by Queen Jadwiga who left a large endowment to the university upon her death in 1399. The university was formally re-established on 26 July 1400 by King Władysław Jagiełło. After Kraków was incorporated into the Austrian Empire, the university was merged with Lwów University from 1805 to 1809. The university was forcibly shut down during the German Occupation of Poland (1939–1945). The staff was deported to German-Nazi concentration camps, and many of its collections were deliberately destroyed by the occupying German authorities. Underground lectures continued for around 800 students during this period and the university formally reopened in 1945.[44] |\n| 1365[5] | University of Vienna | ![](image) Holy Roman Empire | ![Austria](image) Vienna, Austria\n | Founded by Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, granted papal assent in 1384 by Pope Urban VI. The oldest university in the contemporary German-speaking world; it remains a question of definition whether Charles University in Prague was also German-speaking when founded. Due to its strong association with the Catholic Church, the university suffered setbacks during the Reformation, but never ceased operation.\n |\n| 1385[5] | Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg | ![Germany](image) Heidelberg, Germany\n | Oldest university in Germany. Pope Urban VI granted permission for the founding of a university in October 1385 to Rupert I, Elector Palatine; teaching began in June 1386. Gradually declined during the 17th and 18th centuries until re-established as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden in 1803.\n |\n| c. 1400[5](originally 1343 to c. 1360)[5] | University of Pisa | ![Coat of arms of the Republic of Pisa](image) Republic of Pisa | ![Italy](image) Pisa, Italy\n | Established 1343 but closed around 1360; refounded at the start of the 15th century.[5] Formally founded on 3 September 1343 by a bull of Pope Clement VI, although according to the university \"a number of scholars claim its origin dates back to the 11th century\". Transferred to Pistoia, Prato and Florence between 1494 and 1543.[45] |\n| 1404[5] | University of Turin | ![](image) Duchy of Savoy | ![Italy](image) Turin, Italy\n |  |\n| 1409[5] | University of Leipzig | ![](image) Holy Roman Empire | ![Germany](image) Leipzig, Germany\n |  |\n| 1410[5]–1413[46] | University of St. Andrews | ![](image) Kingdom of Scotland | ![United Kingdom](image) St. Andrews, United Kingdom\n | A school of higher studies was founded in 1410 and was chartered by Bishop Henry Wardlaw in 1411. Full university status conferred by a papal bull of Antipope Benedict XIII on 28 August 1413.[46]\nThe university was founded in 1410 when a group of Augustinian clergy, driven from the University of Paris by the Avignon schism and from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, formed a society of higher learning in St Andrews, which offered courses of lectures in divinity, logic, philosophy, and law. St Andrews was the obvious choice — \"for centuries, it was the heart of the Scottish church and political activities\"[47] and \"the seat of the greatest bishopric in Scotland and location of a monastery noted as a centre for learning\".[48] A charter of privilege was bestowed upon the society of masters and scholars by the Bishop of St Andrews, Henry Wardlaw,[49] on 28 February 1411.[50] Wardlaw then successfully petitioned the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII to grant the school university status by issuing a series of papal bulls, which followed on 28 August 1413.[51] King James I of Scotland confirmed the charter of the university in 1432. Subsequent kings supported the university, with King James V of Scotland \"confirming privileges of the university\" in 1532.[52][53]\n |\n| 1419[5] | University of Rostock | ![](image) Holy Roman Empire | ![Germany](image) Rostock, Germany\n | Continuous operation during the Reformation is disputed. Some sources state that \"the Catholic university of Rostock closed altogether and the closure was long enough to make the refounded body feel a new institution\"[54] and that \"[the university] fell into complete decay after the beginning of the Reformation in (1523) when the university revenues were lost and matriculations ceased\".[55] However, Johann Oldendorp is reported by several sources as having held a professorship at the university from 1526 to 1534, although this is not proven beyond doubt,[56] and other historians refer to \"the remaining university lecturers\" as supporting plans to restore the university revenues in 1532 (which was eventually accomplished via the Rostock Formula concordiae in 1563).[57] There are records of a number of professors being appointed in 1551, including Johannes Aurifaber, David Chytraeus, and Johann Draconites [de].[58][59] |\n| 1430[5](originally 1391–1394)[5] | University of Ferrara | ![House of Este](image) House of Este | ![Italy](image) Ferrara, Italy\n |  |\n| 1431[5](originally 1303 to c. 1400)[5] | Sapienza University of Rome | ![Coat of arms of the Papal States](image) Papal States | ![Italy](image) Rome, Italy\n | Founded in 1303 but closed at the end of the 14th century; refounded 1431.[5] |\n| 1444[5] | University of Catania | ![Kingdom of the Two Sicilies](image) Kingdom of Sicily | ![Italy](image) Catania, Italy\n |  |\n| 1450[5] | University of Barcelona | ![Standard of the Crown of Aragon](image) Crown of Aragon | ![Spain](image) Barcelona, Spain\n | Founded by Alfonso V of Aragon on 3 September 1450 as the *Estudi General de Barcelona*. From 1401 the city had a medical school founded by King Martin of Aragon (the *Estudi General de Medecina de Barcelona*), to which a faculty of arts was added in 1402. Before this, there were chairs of higher education (associated with the cathedral, the Dominican Convent of Santa Carolina, and the *escoles majors* supported by the city's governing council) from the 13th century.[60] |\n| 1451[5] | University of Glasgow | ![](image) Kingdom of Scotland | ![United Kingdom](image) Glasgow, United Kingdom\n | Founded by papal bull in 1451, it is the fourth-oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Scotland's four ancient universities. Along with the universities of Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and St Andrews, the university was part of the Scottish Enlightenment during the 18th century.\n |\n| 1456[5] | University of Greifswald | ![](image) Holy Roman Empire | ![Germany](image) Greifswald, Germany\n | Some professors from Rostock taught temporarily in Greifswald between 1437 and 1443 due to unrest in Rostock. The university was founded in 1456 by Duke Wartislaw IX with the approval of Pope Callixtus III on the initiative of Heinrich Rubenow, Lord Mayor of Greifswald (and first rector). Teaching paused temporarily during the Protestant Reformation (1527–39).[61] |\n| 1457[5] | Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg | ![Germany](image) Freiburg, Germany\n | A papal bull of 1455 authorised the Bishop of Constance to establish a university, and in 1457 a ducal charter from Albert VI, Archduke of Austria founded the university.[62] |\n| 1459[5] | University of Basel | ![Switzerland](image) Basel, Switzerland\n |  |\n| 1459[5]–1472[63] | Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich | ![Germany](image) Munich, Germany\n | Founded in Ingolstadt in 1472; with a papal bull obtained in 1459 from Pope Pius II by Louis the Rich, transferred to Landshut in 1800 and then to Munich in 1826.[63] |\n| 1475[5] | University of Copenhagen | ![](image) Kingdom of Denmark within the  ![](image) Kalmar Union | ![Denmark](image) Copenhagen, Denmark\n |  |\n| 1476[5] | Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen | ![](image) Holy Roman Empire | ![Germany](image) Tübingen, Germany\n |  |\n| 1477[5] | Uppsala University | ![](image) Kingdom of Sweden within the  ![](image) Kalmar Union | ![Sweden](image) Uppsala, Sweden\n | Established in 1477 by the Catholic Archbishop Jakob Ulvsson.

Very little is known of this institution over the next two centuries.[66] In 1499 a papal bull was granted by Pope Alexander VI authorising Archbishop Cisneros to establish a *Colegio Mayor* in Alcalá with the same powers as the universities of Salamanca and Vallodolid, from which date Verger considers it a university.[5] The new university opened in 1509.[67] The university was moved to Madrid in 1836 by royal decree.[68] |\n| 1500[5] | University of Valencia | ![Standard of the Crown of Aragon](image) Crown of Aragon | ![Spain](image) Valencia, Spain\n |  |\n\n\n## Oldest universities by country or region after 1500 still in operation[edit]\n\n\nThe majority of European countries had universities by 1500. Many universities were established at institutes of learning such as schools and colleges that may have been founded significantly earlier but were not classed as universities upon their foundation; this is normally described in the notes for that institution. In some countries (particularly the US and those influenced by its culture), degree-granting higher education institutions that would normally be called universities are instead called colleges. In this case, both the oldest institution that would normally be regarded as a university and the oldest institution (if different) to actually be called a university are given. In many parts of the world, the first university to have a presence was an institution based elsewhere (often the University of London via the affiliation of a local college); where this is different from the first locally established university, both are given.\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Location\n | Current name\n | Year\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Current\n | Original\n |\n| ![](image) Algeria(Algiers) | ![France](image) French Algeria(Algiers) | University of Algiers | 1909 |  |\n| ![](image) Angola(Luanda) | ![Portugal](image) Portuguese Angola(Luanda) | Agostinho Neto University | 1962 | Founded as *Estudos Gerais Universitários de Angola*.

And I must define a university very strictly here. A university is something more than a center of higher education and study. One must reserve the term *university* for—and I'm quoting Rashdall here—'a scholastic guild, whether of masters or students, engaged in higher education and study,\" which was later defined, after the emergence of universities, as \"studium generale'.\"[4]\n2. **^** \"No one today would dispute the fact that universities, in the sense in which the term is now generally understood, were a creation of the Middle Ages, appearing for the first time between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It is no doubt true that other civilizations, prior to, or wholly alien to, the medieval West, such as the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Islam, or China, were familiar with forms of higher education which a number of historians, for the sake of convenience, have sometimes described as universities.Yet a closer look makes it plain that the institutional reality was altogether different and, no matter what has been said on the subject, there is no real link such as would justify us in associating them with medieval universities in the West. Until there is definite proof to the contrary, these latter must be regarded as the sole source of the model which gradually spread through the whole of Europe and then to the whole world. We are therefore concerned with what is indisputably an original institution, which can only be defined in terms of a historical analysis of its emergence and its mode of operation in concrete circumstances.\"[10]\n3. **^** \"Thus the university, as a form of social organization, was peculiar to medieval Europe. Later, it was exported to all parts of the world, including the Muslim East; and it has remained with us down to the present day. But back in the Middle Ages, outside of Europe, there was nothing anything quite like it anywhere.\"[11]\n4. **^** The Court of Cassation of Belgium ruled 26 November 1846, that this new Catholic University of Louvain founded in Mechlin in 1834 does not have any links with the Old University of Louvain founded in 1425 and abolished in 1797 and can not be regarded as continuing it: \"The Catholic University of Louvain can not be regarded as continuing the old University of Louvain\", in, *Table générale alphabétique et chronologique de la Pasicrisie Belge contenant la jurisprudence du Royaume de 1814 à 1850*, Brussels, 1855, p. 585, column 1, alinea 2. See also: *Bulletin Usuel des Lois et Arrêtés*, 1861, p.166. To see also this rule of the *Cour d'Appel* of 1844: *La Belgique Judiciaire*, 28 July 1844 n° 69, p. 1 : \"*Cour d'Appel de Bruxelles. Deuxième chambre. L'université libre de Louvain ne représente pas légalement l'antique université de cette ville. Attendu que cette université (l'ancienne Université de Louvain), instituée par une bulle papale, de concert avec l'autorité souveraine, formait un corps reconnu dans l'État, ayant différentes attributions, dont plusieurs même lui étaient déléguées par le pouvoir civil; Attendu que ce corps a été supprimé par les lois de la république française; Attendu que l'université existant actuellement à Louvain ne peut être considérée comme continuant celle qui existait en 1457, ces deux établissemens ayant un caractère bien distinct, puisque l'université actuelle, non reconnue comme personne civile, n'est qu'un établissement tout-à-fait privé, résultat de la liberté d'enseignement, en dehors de toute action du pouvoir et sans autorité dans l'État...*\".\n\n\"Court of Appeal of Brussels. Second Chamber. The Free University of Louvain is not legally representend the old university in that city. Whereas this University (formerly University of Louvain), established by a papal bull, together with the sovereign authority, formed a body recognized by the State, with different functions, many of which even he was delegated by the civil power. And whereas this body was removed by the laws of the French Republic; Whereas the currently existing university in Leuven can not be regarded as continuing that which existed in 1457, these two establishments with a distinct character, since the currently university is not recognized as legal person, and is institution is entirely private, the result of academic freedom, apart from any action without authority and power in the state.\"\n\nAccording to Arlette Graffart,[105] only the State University of Louvain, deserves to be considered as the \"resurrection of this one\" : \"elle seule ⟨the State University of Louvain⟩ et non point celle qui vit le jour en 1834 à l'initiative des évêques de Belgique, c'est-à-dire l'université catholique de Malines devenue de Louvain l'année suivante\".\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** de Ridder-Symoens, Hilde: *A History of the University in Europe: Volume 1, Universities in the Middle Ages*, Cambridge University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-521-36105-2, pp. 47–55\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Storia d'Italia* (in Italian).

There is no indication, however, that up until around 1180, the Bolognese law schools were anything other than private schools opened and run by each master after his own fashion, gathering together the students that had entered into an agreement with him and paid him fees (collectae) in return for his teaching. The crucial change would seem to have taken place around the years 1180–90. ... The masters, who were themselves mainly Bolognese in origin, agreed from 1189 to swear an oath to the commune not to seek to transfer the *studium* elsewhere. The students, on the other hand, began to group themselves in nations, according to their places of origin (we hear of the Lombard nation as early as 1191), and these were soon federated into 'universities' with elected rectors at their head. `{{cite book}}`: `|work=` ignored (help)\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The University from the 12th to the 20th century\".

The first indications of the gestation of a scholars' guild comes from Bologna in 1189 when the commune forced the masters to swear not to transfer the *studium* to another town. Thereafter, evidence confirming that Bologna had become a *universitas* and announcing similar developments elsewhere proliferate. The collective identity of the many Paris schools received some sort of official recognition in 1194 when their scholars were implicitly given a grant of clerical immunity by Pope Celestine III, which were confirmed six years later by the king, Philip II. By 1208 a university had definitely begun to take shape. In that year the city's bishop, who claimed the right to license private teachers and interfere in their teaching, accepted that the masters could form an autonomous guild and police themselves, albeit under his ultimate control. In 1215 the pope blessed this arrangement by granting the fledgling university is first statutes.\n20. **^** Jacques Verger (16 October 2003).

To be included in the list below, the university must have been founded before 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a country or region. It must also be still in operation, with institutional continuity retained throughout its history. So some early universities, including the University of Paris, founded around the beginning of the 13th century[5] but abolished by the French Revolution in 1793,[6] are excluded. Some institutions reemerge, but with new foundations, such as the modern University of Paris, which came into existence in 1896 after the *Louis Liard law* disbanded Napoleon's University of France system.\n\n\nThe word *university* is derived from the Latin *universitas magistrorum et scholarium*, which approximately means 'community of teachers and scholars'. The University of Bologna in Bologna, Italy, where teaching began around 1088 and which was organised into a university in the late twelfth century, is the world's oldest university in continuous operation,[1] and the first university in the sense of a higher-learning and degree-awarding institute.[7][8][1] The origin of many medieval universities can be traced back to the Catholic cathedral schools or monastic schools, which appeared as early as the sixth century and were run for hundreds of years as such before their formal establishment as universities in the high medieval period.[9]\n\n\nAncient higher-learning institutions, such as those of ancient Greece, ancient Persia, ancient Rome, Byzantium, ancient China, ancient India and the Islamic world, are not included in this list owing to their cultural, historical, structural and legal differences from the medieval European university from which the modern university evolved.[Note 2][Note 3][12] These include the University of al-Qarawiyyin and Al-Azhar University, which were founded as mosques in 857 and 970 respectively and developed into madrasas prior to the establishment of any European university, making them the oldest institutions of higher learning in continuous operation in the world. They became universities in 1963 and 1961 respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Medieval origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medieval university\n\nThe university as an institution was historically rooted in medieval society, which it in turn influenced and shaped. Academic historian Walter Rüegg asserts that:[12]\n\n\n\n\n> The university is a European institution; indeed, it is the European institution *par excellence*. There are various reasons for this assertion. As a community of teachers and taught, accorded certain rights, such as administrative autonomy and the determination and realisation of curricula (courses of study) and of the objectives of research as well as the award of publicly recognised degrees, it is a creation of medieval Europe, which was the Europe of papal Christianity [...].\n> \n> \n\n\n## Modern spread[edit]\n\n\nFrom the early modern period onwards, the university spread from the medieval Latin West across the globe, eventually replacing all other higher-learning institutions and becoming the preeminent institution for higher education everywhere. The process occurred in the following chronological order:[13]\n\n\n\n* Southern and Western Europe (from the 11th or 12th century)\n* Central and Northern Europe (from the 14th or 15th century)\n* Americas (from the 16th century)\n* Australia (from the 19th century)\n* Asia and Africa (from the 19th or 20th century), with the exception of the Philippines, where the University of Santo Tomas was established in the 17th century.\n\n\n## Founded as universities before 1500[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of medieval universities\n\nThis list includes medieval universities that were founded before 1500 and which have retained institutional continuity since then (excluding not only those that ceased to exist, but also those that merged into or split away to an institution which is regarded as newly established). Several of these have been closed for brief periods: for example the University of Siena was closed 1805–1815 during the Napoleonic wars, and universities in the Czech Republic and Poland were closed during Nazi occupation, 1938–1945.\n\n\nUniversities are dated from when, according to scholars, they first met the definition of a university. In cases such as the universities of Bologna and Oxford which trace their history back to teaching in individual schools prior to their formation into a university, or which existed in another form prior to being a university, the date in the list below is thus later than the date given by the institutions for their foundation.[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | University\n | Location\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Original | Current\n |\n| 1180–1190[15](teaching from c. 1088)\n | University of Bologna | ![](image) Kingdom of Italy,![](image) Holy Roman Empire | ![Italy](image) Bologna, Italy\n | Law schools existed in Bologna from the second half of the 12th century, with 1088 often considered to be the date on which teaching outside of ecclesiastical schools began.[16] In 1158, petitions by Bolognese doctors of law led to Emperor Barbarossa granting the \"Authentic *Habita*\", which granted various rights to students and masters but did not name Bologna or any other particular place of study.[17] However, it is unlikely that the university had become organised by the 1150s, and this may have been as late as the 1180s.[18] The law schools appear to have remained independent, private entities until around 1180, but became organised over the following decade. In 1189 the masters made an agreement with the commune not to transfer the *studium* to another town, while the Lombard students were organised into a 'nation' by 1191.[16][19] |\n| 1200–1214[20](teaching from c. 1096)\n | University of Oxford | ![](image) Kingdom of England | ![United Kingdom](image) Oxford, United Kingdom\n | Teaching existed in Oxford from the late 11th century,[21] with the university giving the date of 1096 for the earliest classes.[22] However, it was not until the early 13th century that the schools in Oxford took on an organised character. In 1201 a papal letter described John Grimm as *magister scolarum Oxonie*.[23] In 1209 the masters suspended their teaching in Oxford and moved to other towns (including Cambridge, leading to the foundation of the university there),[24] returning after a bull issued on 20 June 1214 by the papal legate, Niccolò de Romanis, that granted a number of rights to the university and established the office of chancellor.[25] Both Oxford and Cambridge were granted rights of discipline over students and of fixing rents in letters issued by King Henry III in 1231.[26] A royal charter, sometimes referred to as the Magna Carta of the university, was granted in 1244, awarding further rights to the university.[27] The university received a papal bull *Querentes in agro* in 1254, with a first version issued on 27 September and a second version on 6 October. The first version followed the common form of privileges granted to monastic houses, confirming the liberties and immunities granted to the university and placing the members of the university under papal protection, but the second version (which was the version recorded in the papal register) explicitly recognised and approved the existence of the university as a scholarly community and confirmed its \"liberties, ancient customs and approved statutes\".[28] |\n| 1209–1225[5] | University of Cambridge | ![](image) Kingdom of England | ![United Kingdom](image) Cambridge, United Kingdom\n | Founded by scholars leaving Oxford after a dispute caused by the execution of three scholars in 1209.[24] The university was organised under a chancellor by 1225.[29] The university takes 1209 as its official anniversary.[30] Along with Oxford, Cambridge was granted rights of discipline over its students and of fixing rents in letters issued by King Henry III in 1231.[26] It received papal recognition as an academic corporation via an indult granted by Pope Gregory IX in 1233 and was named as a *studium generale* in the papal bull *Inter singula* in 1318. The traditional view was that this raised it to a *studium generale* but more recent scholarship (which is now generally, although not universally, accepted) sees the bull as confirming, rather than conferring, this status.[31][32] |\n| 1218–1219[5] | University of Salamanca | ![Pennant of the Kingdom of León](image) Kingdom of León | ![Spain](image) Salamanca, Spain\n | The oldest university in the Hispanic world. The university was founded by Alfonso IX of León in 1218 and recognised by a papal bull from Pope Alexander IV in 1255.[33] |\n| 1222[5] | University of Padua | ![](image) Medieval commune of Padua | ![Italy](image) Padua, Italy\n | Founded by scholars and professors after leaving Bologna.

Became Charles-Ferdinand University after the Thirty Years' War, with all four faculties restored. Split into German and Czech parts in 1882; the Czech branch restored the name Charles University after independence in 1918 and closed briefly during Nazi occupation (1939–1945) while the German branch closed permanently in 1945.[41] |\n| 1357[5](originally 1246–1252)[5] | University of Siena | ![Coat of arms of Siena](image) Republic of Siena | ![Italy](image) Siena, Italy\n | Claims to have been founded in 1240 by the Commune of Siena,[42] although Rashdall dates the proclamation of the Studium to 1246, when Frederick II tried to place a ban on scholars travelling to Bologna, the date also given by Verger.[5] Was granted some exemptions from taxes by Pope Innocent II in 1252, but closed shortly after when the scholars returned to Bologna. Attempted revivals in 1275 and (fed by further short-lived migrations of scholars from Bologna) in 1321 and 1338 were unsuccessful. Gained an Imperial Bull in 1357 \"granting it *de novo* the 'privileges of a Studium Generale.'\", but was not firmly established until \"[i]n 1408 a fresh grant of privileges was obtained from Pope Gregory XII\".[43] Closed temporarily in 1808–1815 when Napoleonic forces occupied Tuscany.[42] |\n| 1361[5] | University of Pavia | ![House of Visconti](image) Domain of the House of Visconti | ![Italy](image) Pavia, Italy\n | Transferred to Piacenza 1398–1412.[5] Closed for short periods during the Italian Wars, Napoleonic wars, and Revolutions of 1848.\n |\n| 1364[5] (re-established in 1400)[5] | Jagiellonian University | ![](image) Kingdom of Poland | ![Poland](image) Kraków, Poland\n | Founded by King Casimir the Great as a *studium generale* in 1364. After the death of Casimir the Great in 1370, the development of the university stalled, with lectures being held in various places across the city, including churches and the Wawel cathedral school, and eventually coming to a pause. The faculty of theology was re-opened in 1397 by Queen Jadwiga who left a large endowment to the university upon her death in 1399. The university was formally re-established on 26 July 1400 by King Władysław Jagiełło. After Kraków was incorporated into the Austrian Empire, the university was merged with Lwów University from 1805 to 1809. The university was forcibly shut down during the German Occupation of Poland (1939–1945). The staff was deported to German-Nazi concentration camps, and many of its collections were deliberately destroyed by the occupying German authorities. Underground lectures continued for around 800 students during this period and the university formally reopened in 1945.[44] |\n| 1365[5] | University of Vienna | ![](image) Holy Roman Empire | ![Austria](image) Vienna, Austria\n | Founded by Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria, granted papal assent in 1384 by Pope Urban VI. The oldest university in the contemporary German-speaking world; it remains a question of definition whether Charles University in Prague was also German-speaking when founded. Due to its strong association with the Catholic Church, the university suffered setbacks during the Reformation, but never ceased operation.\n |\n| 1385[5] | Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg | ![Germany](image) Heidelberg, Germany\n | Oldest university in Germany. Pope Urban VI granted permission for the founding of a university in October 1385 to Rupert I, Elector Palatine; teaching began in June 1386.

Full university status conferred by a papal bull of Antipope Benedict XIII on 28 August 1413.[46]\nThe university was founded in 1410 when a group of Augustinian clergy, driven from the University of Paris by the Avignon schism and from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, formed a society of higher learning in St Andrews, which offered courses of lectures in divinity, logic, philosophy, and law. St Andrews was the obvious choice — \"for centuries, it was the heart of the Scottish church and political activities\"[47] and \"the seat of the greatest bishopric in Scotland and location of a monastery noted as a centre for learning\".[48] A charter of privilege was bestowed upon the society of masters and scholars by the Bishop of St Andrews, Henry Wardlaw,[49] on 28 February 1411.[50] Wardlaw then successfully petitioned the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII to grant the school university status by issuing a series of papal bulls, which followed on 28 August 1413.[51] King James I of Scotland confirmed the charter of the university in 1432. Subsequent kings supported the university, with King James V of Scotland \"confirming privileges of the university\" in 1532.[52][53]\n |\n| 1419[5] | University of Rostock | ![](image) Holy Roman Empire | ![Germany](image) Rostock, Germany\n | Continuous operation during the Reformation is disputed. Some sources state that \"the Catholic university of Rostock closed altogether and the closure was long enough to make the refounded body feel a new institution\"[54] and that \"[the university] fell into complete decay after the beginning of the Reformation in (1523) when the university revenues were lost and matriculations ceased\".[55] However, Johann Oldendorp is reported by several sources as having held a professorship at the university from 1526 to 1534, although this is not proven beyond doubt,[56] and other historians refer to \"the remaining university lecturers\" as supporting plans to restore the university revenues in 1532 (which was eventually accomplished via the Rostock Formula concordiae in 1563).[57] There are records of a number of professors being appointed in 1551, including Johannes Aurifaber, David Chytraeus, and Johann Draconites [de].[58][59] |\n| 1430[5](originally 1391–1394)[5] | University of Ferrara | ![House of Este](image) House of Este | ![Italy](image) Ferrara, Italy\n |  |\n| 1431[5](originally 1303 to c. 1400)[5] | Sapienza University of Rome | ![Coat of arms of the Papal States](image) Papal States | ![Italy](image) Rome, Italy\n | Founded in 1303 but closed at the end of the 14th century; refounded 1431.[5] |\n| 1444[5] | University of Catania | ![Kingdom of the Two Sicilies](image) Kingdom of Sicily | ![Italy](image) Catania, Italy\n |  |\n| 1450[5] | University of Barcelona | ![Standard of the Crown of Aragon](image) Crown of Aragon | ![Spain](image) Barcelona, Spain\n | Founded by Alfonso V of Aragon on 3 September 1450 as the *Estudi General de Barcelona*.

Before this, there were chairs of higher education (associated with the cathedral, the Dominican Convent of Santa Carolina, and the *escoles majors* supported by the city's governing council) from the 13th century.[60] |\n| 1451[5] | University of Glasgow | ![](image) Kingdom of Scotland | ![United Kingdom](image) Glasgow, United Kingdom\n | Founded by papal bull in 1451, it is the fourth-oldest university in the English-speaking world and one of Scotland's four ancient universities.

The university was founded in 1456 by Duke Wartislaw IX with the approval of Pope Callixtus III on the initiative of Heinrich Rubenow, Lord Mayor of Greifswald (and first rector).

Many universities were established at institutes of learning such as schools and colleges that may have been founded significantly earlier but were not classed as universities upon their foundation; this is normally described in the notes for that institution. In some countries (particularly the US and those influenced by its culture), degree-granting higher education institutions that would normally be called universities are instead called colleges. In this case, both the oldest institution that would normally be regarded as a university and the oldest institution (if different) to actually be called a university are given. In many parts of the world, the first university to have a presence was an institution based elsewhere (often the University of London via the affiliation of a local college); where this is different from the first locally established university, both are given.\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Location\n | Current name\n | Year\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Current\n | Original\n |\n| ![](image) Algeria(Algiers) | ![France](image) French Algeria(Algiers) | University of Algiers | 1909 |  |\n| ![](image) Angola(Luanda) | ![Portugal](image) Portuguese Angola(Luanda) | Agostinho Neto University | 1962 | Founded as *Estudos Gerais Universitários de Angola*.

One must reserve the term *university* for—and I'm quoting Rashdall here—'a scholastic guild, whether of masters or students, engaged in higher education and study,\" which was later defined, after the emergence of universities, as \"studium generale'.\"[4]\n2. **^** \"No one today would dispute the fact that universities, in the sense in which the term is now generally understood, were a creation of the Middle Ages, appearing for the first time between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. It is no doubt true that other civilizations, prior to, or wholly alien to, the medieval West, such as the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Islam, or China, were familiar with forms of higher education which a number of historians, for the sake of convenience, have sometimes described as universities.Yet a closer look makes it plain that the institutional reality was altogether different and, no matter what has been said on the subject, there is no real link such as would justify us in associating them with medieval universities in the West. Until there is definite proof to the contrary, these latter must be regarded as the sole source of the model which gradually spread through the whole of Europe and then to the whole world. We are therefore concerned with what is indisputably an original institution, which can only be defined in terms of a historical analysis of its emergence and its mode of operation in concrete circumstances.\"[10]\n3. **^** \"Thus the university, as a form of social organization, was peculiar to medieval Europe. Later, it was exported to all parts of the world, including the Muslim East; and it has remained with us down to the present day. But back in the Middle Ages, outside of Europe, there was nothing anything quite like it anywhere.\"[11]\n4. **^** The Court of Cassation of Belgium ruled 26 November 1846, that this new Catholic University of Louvain founded in Mechlin in 1834 does not have any links with the Old University of Louvain founded in 1425 and abolished in 1797 and can not be regarded as continuing it: \"The Catholic University of Louvain can not be regarded as continuing the old University of Louvain\", in, *Table générale alphabétique et chronologique de la Pasicrisie Belge contenant la jurisprudence du Royaume de 1814 à 1850*, Brussels, 1855, p. 585, column 1, alinea 2. See also: *Bulletin Usuel des Lois et Arrêtés*, 1861, p.166. To see also this rule of the *Cour d'Appel* of 1844: *La Belgique Judiciaire*, 28 July 1844 n° 69, p. 1 : \"*Cour d'Appel de Bruxelles. Deuxième chambre. L'université libre de Louvain ne représente pas légalement l'antique université de cette ville. Attendu que cette université (l'ancienne Université de Louvain), instituée par une bulle papale, de concert avec l'autorité souveraine, formait un corps reconnu dans l'État, ayant différentes attributions, dont plusieurs même lui étaient déléguées par le pouvoir civil; Attendu que ce corps a été supprimé par les lois de la république française; Attendu que l'université existant actuellement à Louvain ne peut être considérée comme continuant celle qui existait en 1457, ces deux établissemens ayant un caractère bien distinct, puisque l'université actuelle, non reconnue comme personne civile, n'est qu'un établissement tout-à-fait privé, résultat de la liberté d'enseignement, en dehors de toute action du pouvoir et sans autorité dans l'État...*\".\n\n\"Court of Appeal of Brussels. Second Chamber. The Free University of Louvain is not legally representend the old university in that city. Whereas this University (formerly University of Louvain), established by a papal bull, together with the sovereign authority, formed a body recognized by the State, with different functions, many of which even he was delegated by the civil power. And whereas this body was removed by the laws of the French Republic; Whereas the currently existing university in Leuven can not be regarded as continuing that which existed in 1457, these two establishments with a distinct character, since the currently university is not recognized as legal person, and is institution is entirely private, the result of academic freedom, apart from any action without authority and power in the state.\"\n\nAccording to Arlette Graffart,[105] only the State University of Louvain, deserves to be considered as the \"resurrection of this one\" : \"elle seule ⟨the State University of Louvain⟩ et non point celle qui vit le jour en 1834 à l'initiative des évêques de Belgique, c'est-à-dire l'université catholique de Malines devenue de Louvain l'année suivante\".\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** de Ridder-Symoens, Hilde: *A History of the University in Europe: Volume 1, Universities in the Middle Ages*, Cambridge University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-521-36105-2, pp. 47–55\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Storia d'Italia* (in Italian).

There is no indication, however, that up until around 1180, the Bolognese law schools were anything other than private schools opened and run by each master after his own fashion, gathering together the students that had entered into an agreement with him and paid him fees (collectae) in return for his teaching. The crucial change would seem to have taken place around the years 1180–90. ... The masters, who were themselves mainly Bolognese in origin, agreed from 1189 to swear an oath to the commune not to seek to transfer the *studium* elsewhere. The students, on the other hand, began to group themselves in nations, according to their places of origin (we hear of the Lombard nation as early as 1191), and these were soon federated into 'universities' with elected rectors at their head. `{{cite book}}`: `|work=` ignored (help)\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The University from the 12th to the 20th century\".

The first indications of the gestation of a scholars' guild comes from Bologna in 1189 when the commune forced the masters to swear not to transfer the *studium* to another town. Thereafter, evidence confirming that Bologna had become a *universitas* and announcing similar developments elsewhere proliferate. The collective identity of the many Paris schools received some sort of official recognition in 1194 when their scholars were implicitly given a grant of clerical immunity by Pope Celestine III, which were confirmed six years later by the king, Philip II. By 1208 a university had definitely begun to take shape. In that year the city's bishop, who claimed the right to license private teachers and interfere in their teaching, accepted that the masters could form an autonomous guild and police themselves, albeit under his ultimate control. In 1215 the pope blessed this arrangement by granting the fledgling university is first statutes.\n20. **^** Jacques Verger (16 October 2003).
