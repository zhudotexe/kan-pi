The world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity (22,500\u00a0MW),[5][6] the Three Gorges Dam generates 95\u00b120\u00a0TWh of electricity per year on average, depending on the amount of precipitation in the river basin.[7] After the extensive monsoon rainfalls of 2020, the dam's annual production reached nearly 112\u00a0TWh, breaking the previous world record of ~103\u00a0TWh set by Itaipu Dam in 2016.[8][9]\n\n\nThe dam's body was completed in 2006; the power plant was completed and fully operational by 2012,[10][11] when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production. Each of the main water turbines has a capacity of 700\u00a0MW.[12][13] Combining the capacity of the dam's 32 main turbines with the two smaller generators (50\u00a0MW each) that provide power to the plant itself, the total electric generating capacity of the Three Gorges Dam is 22,500\u00a0MW.[12][14][15] The last major component of the project, the ship lift, was completed in 2015.[16]\n\n\nIn addition to generating electricity, the dam was designed to increase the Yangtze River's shipping capacity. By providing flood storage space, the dam reduces the potential for flooding downstream, which historically plagued the Yangtze Plain. In 1931, floods on the river caused the deaths of up to 4\u00a0million people. As a result, China regards the project as a monumental social and economical success,[17] with the design of state-of-the-art large turbines[18] and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions.[19] But the dam has led to some ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides,[20][21] which have made it controversial domestically and abroad.[22][23][24][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Three Gorges Dam |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Simplified Chinese | \u4e09\u5ce1\u5927\u575d |\n| Traditional\u00a0Chinese | \u4e09\u5cfd\u5927\u58e9 |\n| Literal meaning | Three Gorges Great Dam |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | S\u0101nxi\u00e1 D\u00e0b\u00e0 |\n| Bopomofo | \u3119\u3122 \u3112\u3127\u311a\u02ca \u3109\u311a\u02cb \u3105\u311a\u02cb |\n| IPA | [sa\u0301n.\u0255ja\u030c\u00a0ta\u0302.pa\u0302] |\n| other Mandarin |\n| Dungan | \u0441\u0430\u043d\u044c \u0441\u044f \u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0430 |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In his poem \"Swimming\" (1956), engraved on the 1954 Flood Memorial in Wuhan, Mao Zedong envisions \"A Great Stone Wall, to catch the clouds and rains of Wushan as the fall\" as \"A Great lake shall rise upon the gorge!\".[26]\n![](image)Map of the location of the Three Gorges Dam and the most important cities along the Yangtze River\nSun Yat-sen envisioned a large dam across the Yangtze River in *The International Development of China* (1919).[27][28] He wrote that a dam capable of generating 30\u00a0million horsepower (22\u00a0GW) was possible downstream of the Three Gorges.[28] In 1932, the Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, began preliminary work on plans in the Three Gorges. In 1939, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Japanese military forces occupied Yichang and surveyed the area. \n\n\nIn 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation's head design engineer, John L. Savage, surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for a \"Yangtze River Project\".[29] Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the US for training. The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships: the ships would enter locks at the dam's lower and upper ends and then cranes would move them from each lock to the next. Groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency. It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods.[30] No construction work was performed because of the Nationalists' worsening situation in the Chinese Civil War.[31]:\u200a204\n\n\nAfter the 1949 Communist Revolution, Mao Zedong supported the project, but began the Gezhouba Dam project nearby first, and economic problems including the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution slowed progress. After the 1954 Yangtze River Floods, in 1956, Mao wrote \"Swimming\", a poem about his fascination with a dam on the Yangtze River. In 1958, after the Hundred Flowers Campaign, some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned.[32]\n\n\nDuring China's emphasis on the Four Modernizations during its early period of Reform and Opening Up, The Communist Party revived plans for the dam and proposed to start construction in 1986.[31]:\u200a204 It emphasized the need to develop hydroelectric power.[31]:\u200a204\n\n\nThe Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference became a center of opposition to the proposed dam.[31]:\u200a204 It convened panels of experts who recommended delaying the project.[31]:\u200a204\n\n\nThe National People's Congress approved the dam in 1992: of 2,633 delegates, 1,767 voted in favour, 177 voted against, 664 abstained, and 25 members did not vote, giving the legislation an unusually low 67.75% approval rate.[33][34] Construction started on December 14, 1994.[35] The dam was expected to be fully operational in 2009, but additional projects, such as the underground power plant with six additional generators, delayed full operation until 2012.[15][32][36] The ship lift was completed in 2015.[16][37] The dam raised the water level in the reservoir to 172.5\u00a0m (566\u00a0ft) above sea level by 2008 and to the designed maximum level of 175\u00a0m (574\u00a0ft) by 2010.[38][39]\n\n\n\n## Composition and dimensions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nModel of the Three Gorges Dam looking upstream, showing the dam body (middle left), the spillway (middle of the dam body) and the ship lift (to the right).\n![](image)\nModel of the Three Gorges Dam showing the ship lift and the ship lock. The ship lift is to the right of the dam body with its own designated waterway. The ship locks are to the right (northeast) of the ship lift.\n![](image)\nEarthfill south dam in foreground with view along main dam. The wall beyond is to separate spillway and turbine flows from the lock and ship lift upstream approach channel. A similar separation is used on the downstream side, seen partially in the preceding image.\n\nMade of concrete and steel, the dam is 2,335\u00a0m (2,554\u00a0yd; 1.451\u00a0mi) long and 185\u00a0m (607\u00a0ft) above sea level at its top. The project used 27.2\u00a0million\u00a0m3 (35.6\u00a0million\u00a0cu\u00a0yd) of concrete (mainly for the dam wall), used 463,000 tonnes of steel (enough to build 63 Eiffel Towers), and moved about 102.6\u00a0million\u00a0m3 (134.2\u00a0million\u00a0cu\u00a0yd) of earth.[40] The concrete dam wall is 181\u00a0m (594\u00a0ft) high above the rock basis.\n\n\nWhen the water level is at its maximum of 175\u00a0m (574\u00a0ft) above sea level, 110\u00a0m (361\u00a0ft) higher than the river level downstream, the dam reservoir is on average about 660\u00a0km (410\u00a0mi) in length and 1.12\u00a0km (3,675\u00a0ft) in width. It contains 39.3\u00a0km3 (31,900,000\u00a0acre\u22c5ft) of water and has a total surface area of 1,045\u00a0km2 (403\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). On completion, the reservoir flooded a total area of 632\u00a0km2 (156,000 acres) of land, compared to the 1,350\u00a0km2 (330,000 acres) of reservoir created by the Itaipu Dam.[41]\n\n\n\n## Economics[edit]\n\n\nThe Chinese government estimated that the Three Gorges Dam project would cost 180\u00a0billion yuan (US$22.5\u00a0billion).[42] By the end of 2008, spending had reached 148.365\u00a0billion yuan, of which 64.613\u00a0billion yuan was spent on construction, 68.557\u00a0billion yuan on relocating affected residents, and 15.195\u00a0billion yuan on financing.[43] It was estimated in 2009 that the cost of construction would be fully recouped when the dam had generated 1,000 terawatt-hours (3,600\u00a0PJ) of electricity, yielding 250\u00a0billion yuan; total cost recovery was thus expected to be completed ten years after the dam became fully operational.[42] In fact, the entire cost of the Three Gorges Dam was recovered by December 20, 2013.[44][*third-party source needed*]\n\n\nFunding sources include the Three Gorges Dam Construction Fund, profits from the Gezhouba Dam, loans from the China Development Bank, loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks, corporate bonds, and revenue from both before and after the dam had become fully operational. Additional charges were assessed as follows: every province receiving power from the Three Gorges Dam had to pay an extra \u00a57.00 per MWh, and the other provinces had to pay an additional charge of \u00a54.00 per MWh. No surcharge was imposed on the Tibet Autonomous Region.[45]\n\n\n\n## Power generation and distribution[edit]\n\n\n### Generating capacity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Electricity production in China by source. Compare: The fully completed Three Gorges dam contributes about 100\u00a0TWh of generation per year.\n![](image)Three Gorges Dam compared to all other Chinese hydroelectricity production\nPower generation is managed by China Yangtze Power, a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC), a Central Enterprise administered by SASAC. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest capacity hydroelectric power station, with 34\u00a0generators: 32 main generators, each with a capacity of 700\u00a0MW, and two plant power generators, each with capacity of 50\u00a0MW, for a total of 22,500\u00a0MW.[12] Among the 32 main generators, 14 are installed on the dam's north side, 12 on the south side, and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam. Annual electricity generation in 2018 was 101.6\u00a0TWh,[7] which is 20 times more than the Hoover Dam.[46]\n\n\n\n### Generators[edit]\n\n\nThe main generators each weigh approximately 6,000\u00a0tonnes and are designed to produce more than 700\u00a0MW of power each. The designed hydraulic head of the generators is 80.6 metres (264\u00a0ft). The flow rate varies between 600\u2013950 cubic metres per second (21,000\u201334,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) depending on the head available; the greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses Francis turbines with a diameter of 9.7/10.4\u00a0m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and a rotation speed of 75\u00a0revolutions per minute. This means that in order to generate power at 50\u00a0Hz, the generator rotors have 80 poles. Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840\u00a0MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20\u00a0kV. The electricity generated is then stepped up to 500\u00a0kV for transmission at 50\u00a0Hz. The generator's stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3\u00a0m in height; the outer diameter of the stator is 21.4/20.9\u00a0m, the inner diameter is 18.5/18.8\u00a0m, and the bearing load is 5,050/5,500 tonnes. Average efficiency is over 94%, with a maximum efficiency of 96.5% reached.[47][48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Francis turbine at Three Gorges Dam\nThe generators were manufactured by two joint ventures: Alstom, ABB, Kvaerner, and the Chinese company Harbin Motor; and Voith, General Electric, Siemens (abbreviated as VGS), and the Chinese company Oriental Motor. The technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract. Most of the generators are water-cooled. Some of the newer ones are air-cooled, making them simpler in design and easier to manufacture and maintain.[49]\n\n\n\n### Generator installation progress[edit]\n\n\nThe first north-side main generator (No.\u00a02) started up on July 10, 2003. The north side became completely operational on September 7, 2005, with the implementation of generator No.\u00a09. Full power (9,800\u00a0MW) was eventually achieved on October 18, 2006, after the water level reached 156\u00a0meters.[50]\n\n\nOn the south side, main generator No.\u00a022 started up on June 11, 2007, and No.\u00a015 became operational on October 30, 2008.[13] The sixth (No.\u00a017) began operation on December 18, 2007, raising capacity to 14.1\u00a0GW, exceeding that of Itaipu dam (14.0\u00a0GW) to become the world's largest hydro power plant by capacity.[51][52][53][54]\n\n\nWhen the last main generator (No. 27) finished its final test on May 23, 2012, the six underground main generators were all operational, raising the capacity to 22.5 GW.[10] After nine years of construction, installation and testing, the power plant was fully operational by July 2012.[15][55][56]\n\n\n\n### Output milestones[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAnnual production of electricity\n| Year\n | Number ofinstalled units\n | TWh\n |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2003\n | 6\n | 8.607 |  |\n| 2004\n | 11\n | 39.155 |  |\n| 2005\n | 14\n | 49.090 |  |\n| 2006\n | 14\n | 49.250 |  |\n| 2007\n | 21\n | 61.600 |  |\n| 2008\n | 26\n | 80.812 | [57] |\n| 2009\n | 26\n | 79.470 | [58] |\n| 2010\n | 26\n | 84.370 | [59] |\n| 2011\n | 29\n | 78.290 | [60] |\n| 2012\n | 32\n | 98.100 | [61] |\n| 2013\n | 32\n | 83.270 | [62] |\n| 2014\n | 32\n | 98.800 | [63] |\n| 2015\n | 32\n | 87.000 | [64] |\n| 2016\n | 32\n | 93.500 | [65] |\n| 2017\n | 32\n | 97.600 | [66] |\n| 2018\n | 32\n | 101.600\n | [7][67] |\n| 2019\n | 32\n | 96.880 | [68] |\n| 2020\n | 32\n | 111.800 | [8] |\n| 2021\n | 32\n | 103.649 | [69] |\n| 2022\n | 32\n | 78.79 | [70] |\n\n\n![](image)Three Gorges Dam annual power output\n![](image)Yangtze River flow rate comparing to the dam intake capacity\nBy August 16, 2011, the plant had generated 500\u00a0TWh of electricity.[71][72] In July 2008 it generated 10.3\u00a0TWh of electricity, its first month over 10\u00a0TWh.[73] On June 30, 2009, after the river flow rate increased to over 24,000\u00a0m3/s, all 28 generators were switched on, producing only 16,100\u00a0MW because the head available during flood season is insufficient.[74] During an August 2009 flood, the plant first reached its maximum output for a short period.[75]\n\n\nDuring the November to May dry season, power output is limited by the river's flow rate, as seen in the diagrams on the right. When there is enough flow, power output is limited by plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming the water level is 175\u00a0m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.[76][77]\n\n\nThe Three Gorges Dam reached its design-maximum reservoir water level of 175\u00a0m (574\u00a0ft) for the first time on October 26, 2010, in which the intended annual power-generation capacity of 84.7 TWh was realized.[38] It has a combined generating capacity of 22.5 gigawatts and a designed annual generation capacity of 88.2 billion kilowatt hours. In 2012, the dam's 32 generating units generated a record 98.1 TWh of electricity, which accounts for 14% of China's total hydro generation.[78] Between 2012 (first year with all 32 generating units operating) and 2021, the dam generated an average of 97.22 TWh of electricity per year, higher than Itaipu dam's average of 89.22 TWh of electricity per year during the same period. Due to the extensive 2020 monsoon season rainfall, the annual production reached ~112 TWh that year, which broke the previous world record of annual production by Itaipu Dam equal to ~103 TWh.[8]\n\n\n\n### Distribution[edit]\n\n\nThe State Grid Corporation and China Southern Power Grid paid a flat rate of \u00a5250\u00a0per MWh (US$35.7) until July 2, 2008. Since then, the price has varied by province, from \u00a5228.7 to \u00a5401.8\u00a0per MWh. Higher-paying customers, such as Shanghai, receive priority.[79] Nine provinces and two cities consume power from the dam.[80]\n\n\nPower distribution and transmission infrastructure cost about 34.387\u00a0billion yuan. Construction was completed in December 2007, one year ahead of schedule.[81]\n\n\nPower is distributed over multiple 500 kV transmission lines. Three direct current (DC) lines to the East China Grid carry 7,200 MW: Three Gorges \u2013 Shanghai (3,000 MW), HVDC Three Gorges \u2013 Changzhou (3,000 MW), and HVDC Gezhouba \u2013 Shanghai (1,200 MW). The alternating current (AC) lines to the Central China Grid have a total capacity of 12,000 MW. The DC transmission line HVDC Three Gorges \u2013 Guangdong to the South China Grid has a capacity of 3,000 MW.[82]\n\n\nThe dam was expected to provide 10% of China's power. However, electricity demand has increased more quickly than previously projected. Even fully operational, on average, it supports only about 1.7% of electricity demand in China in the year of 2011, when the Chinese electricity demand reached 4,692.8 TWh.[83][84]\n\n\n\n## Environmental impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite map showing areas flooded by the Three Gorges reservoir. Compare November 7, 2006 (above) with April 17, 1987 (below).\n![](image)Flood mark on Yangtze river\n### Emissions[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the National Development and Reform Commission, 366\u00a0grams of coal would produce 1\u00a0kWh of electricity during 2006.[85] From 2003 to 2007, power production equaled that of 84\u00a0million tonnes of standard coal.[86]\n\n\n\n### Erosion and sedimentation[edit]\n\n\nTwo hazards are uniquely identified with the dam:[87] that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, and that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is eroding, depositing about 40\u00a0million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually.[88] Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment settles there instead of flowing downstream, and there is less sediment downstream.\n\n\nThe absence of silt downstream has three effects:\n\n\n\n* Some hydrologists expect downstream riverbanks to become more vulnerable to flooding.[89]\n* Shanghai, more than 1,600\u00a0km (990\u00a0mi) away, rests on a massive sedimentary plain. The \"arriving silt\u00a0\u2013 so long as it does arrive\u00a0\u2013 strengthens the bed on which Shanghai is built\u00a0... the less the tonnage of arriving sediment the more vulnerable is this biggest of Chinese cities to inundation\".[90]\n* Benthic sediment buildup causes biological damage and reduces aquatic biodiversity.[91]\n\n\n### Landslides[edit]\n\n\nErosion in the reservoir, induced by rising water, causes frequent major landslides that have led to noticeable disturbance in the reservoir surface, including two incidents in May 2009 when somewhere between 20,000 and 50,000 cubic metres (26,000 and 65,000\u00a0cu\u00a0yd) of material plunged into the flooded Wuxia Gorge of the Wu River.[92] In the first four months of 2010, there were 97 significant landslides.[93]\n\n\n\n### Waste management[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zigui County seat source water protection area in Maoping Town, a few kilometres upstream of the dam\n![](image)Collecting garbage at the dam's southeast corner\nThe dam catalyzed improved upstream wastewater treatment around Chongqing and its suburban areas. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007, more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84\u00a0million tonnes per day, 65% of the total need. About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5\u00a0tonnes of solid waste every day.[94] Over one\u00a0billion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river,[88] which was more likely to be swept away before the reservoir was created. This has left the water stagnant, polluted and murky.[93]\n\n\n\n### Forest cover[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, the Three Gorges area had 10% forestation, down from 20% in the 1950s.[88]\n\n\nResearch by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization suggested that the Asia-Pacific region would gain about 6,000\u00a0km2 (2,300\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of forest by 2008. That is a significant change from the 13,000\u00a0km2 (5,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) net loss of forest each year in the 1990s. This is largely due to China's large reforestation effort. This accelerated after the 1998 Yangtze River floods convinced the government that it should restore tree cover, especially in the Yangtze's basin upstream of the Three Gorges Dam.[95]\n\n\n\n### Wildlife[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(October 2017)*\n |\n\n\nConcerns about the dam's impact on wildlife predate the National People's Congress's approval in 1992.[96] This region has long been known for its rich biodiversity. It is home to 6,388 plant species, which belong to 238 families and 1,508 genera. Of these species, 57 are endangered.[97] These rare species are also used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicines.[98] The proportion of forested area in the region surrounding the Three Gorges Dam dropped from 20% in 1950 to less than 10% as of 2002,[98] adversely affecting all plant species there. The region also provides habitats to hundreds of freshwater and terrestrial animal species.[97] Freshwater fish are especially affected by dams due to changes in the water temperature and flow regime. Many other fish are injured in the hydroelectric plants' turbine blades. This is particularly detrimental to the region's ecosystem because the Yangtze River basin is home to 361 different fish species and accounts for 27% of China's endangered freshwater fish species.[99] Other aquatic species have been endangered by the dam, particularly the baiji, or Chinese river dolphin,[88] now extinct. In fact, Chinese Government scholars even claim that the Three Gorges Dam directly caused the extinction of the baiji.[100]\n\n\nOf the 3,000 to 4,000 remaining critically endangered Siberian crane, many spend the winter in wetlands that the Three Gorges Dam will destroy.[101] Populations of the Yangtze sturgeon are guaranteed to be \"negatively affected\" by the dam.[102] In 2022 the Chinese paddlefish was declared extinct, with the last confirmed sighting in 2003.[103]\n\n\n\n### Terrestrial impact[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, NASA scientists calculated that the shift of water mass stored by the dams would increase the total length of the Earth's day by 0.06 microseconds and make the Earth slightly more round in the middle and flat on the poles.[104] A study published in 2022 in the journal Open Geosciences suggests that the change of reservoir water level affects the gravity field in western Sichuan, which in turn affects the seismicity in that area.[105]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of the Three Gorges Dam\n\n## Floods, agriculture, industry[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Water level and inflow during the 2020 China floods\nAn important function of the dam is to control flooding, which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the Yangtze. Millions of people live downstream of the dam, with many large, important cities like Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai located adjacent to the river. Large areas of farmland and China's most important industrial area are situated beside the river.\n\n\nThe reservoir's flood storage capacity is 22\u00a0km3 (5.3\u00a0cu\u00a0mi; 18\u00a0million\u00a0acre\u22c5ft). This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every 10 years to once every 100\u00a0years. The dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a \"super\" flood.[106][107] The river flooded in 1954 over an area of 193,000\u00a0km2 (74,500\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), killing 33,169 people and forcing almost 18.9\u00a0million people to move. The flood waters covered Wuhan, a city of eight million people, for over three months, and the Jingguang Railway was out of service for more than 100\u00a0days.[108] The 1954 flood carried 50 cubic kilometres (12\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of water. The dam could only divert the water above Chenglingji, leaving 30 to 40\u00a0km3 (7.2 to 9.6\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) to be diverted.[109] The dam cannot protect against some of the large tributaries downstream, including the Xiang, Zishui, Yuanshui, Lishui, Hanshui, and Gan.[110]\n\n\nIn 1998, a flood in the same area caused billions of dollars worth of damage, when 2,039\u00a0km2 (787\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of farmland were flooded. The flood affected more than 2.3\u00a0million people, killing 1,526.[111] In early August 2009, the largest flood in five years passed through the dam site. During this flood, the dam limited the water flow to less than 40,000\u00a0m3/s (1.4\u00a0million\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) per second, raising the upstream water level from 145.13\u00a0m (476.1\u00a0ft) on August 1, to 152.88\u00a0m (501.6\u00a0ft) on August 8. A full 4.27\u00a0km3 (1.02\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of flood water was captured and the river flow was cut by as much as 15,000\u00a0m3 (530,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) per second.[75]\n\n\nThe dam discharges its reservoir during the dry season every year, between December and March.[112] This increases the flow rate of the river downstream, providing fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage, and improving shipping conditions. The water level upstream drops from 175 to 145\u00a0m (574 to 476\u00a0ft),[113] in preparation for the rainy season. The water also powers the Gezhouba Dam downstream.\n\n\nSince the filling of the reservoir in 2003, the Three Gorges Dam has supplied an extra 11\u00a0km3 (2.6\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) of fresh water to downstream cities and farms over the course of the dry season.[114]\n\n\n\nDuring the South China floods in July 2010, inflows at the Three Gorges Dam reached a peak of 70,000\u00a0m3/s (2.5\u00a0million\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s), exceeding the peak inflow during the 1998 Yangtze River floods. The dam's reservoir rose nearly 3\u00a0m (9.8\u00a0ft) in 24 hours and reduced the outflow to 40,000\u00a0m3/s (1.4\u00a0million\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) in discharges downstream, preventing any significant impact on the middle and lower river.[115][116]\n\n\n\n## Navigating the dam[edit]\n\n\n### Locks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ship locks for river traffic to bypass the Three Gorges Dam, May 2004\n![](image)Construction of TGP ship locks at Yangtze River, September 1996\n![](image)The other end of Three Gorges Dam lock; note the bridge in the background\nThe installation of ship locks is intended to increase river shipping from ten\u00a0million to 100\u00a0million tonnes annually; as a result transportation costs will be cut between 30 and 37%. Shipping will become safer, since the gorges are notoriously dangerous to navigate.[86]\n\n\nThere are two series of ship locks installed near the dam (30\u00b050\u203212\u2033N 111\u00b01\u203210\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff30.83667\u00b0N 111.01944\u00b0E\ufeff / 30.83667; 111.01944). Each of them is made up of five stages, with transit time at around four hours. Maximum vessel size is 10,000\u00a0tons.[117] The locks are 280\u00a0m long, 35\u00a0m wide, and 5\u00a0m deep (918 \u00d7 114 \u00d7 16.4\u00a0ft).[118][119] That is 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) longer than those on the St Lawrence Seaway, but half as deep. Before the dam was constructed, the maximum freight capacity at the Three Gorges site was 18.0\u00a0million tonnes per year. From 2004 to 2007, a total of 198\u00a0million tonnes of freight passed through the locks. The freight capacity of the river increased six\u00a0times and the cost of shipping was reduced by 25%. Originally, the total capacity of the ship locks was expected to reach 100\u00a0million tonnes per year.[86] In 2022, their cargo turnover reached 159.65 million tons, with an annual increase of 6% over the past few years.[120]\n\n\nThese locks are staircase locks, whereby inner lock gate pairs serve as both the upper gate and lower gate. The gates are the vulnerable hinged type, which, if damaged, could temporarily render the entire flight unusable. As there are separate sets of locks for upstream and downstream traffic, this system is more water efficient than bi-directional staircase locks.\n\n\n\n### Ship lift[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)The *shiplift*, a kind of elevator, can lift vessels of up to 3,000 tonnes, at a fraction of the time to transit the staircase locks.\nIn addition to the canal locks, there is a ship lift, a kind of elevator for vessels. The ship lift can lift ships of up to 3,000\u00a0tons.[16][121] The vertical distance traveled is 113\u00a0m (371\u00a0ft),[122] and the size of the ship lift's basin is 120\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a018\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0m (394\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a059\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a011\u00a0ft). The ship lift takes 30 to 40 minutes to transit, as opposed to the three to four hours for stepping through the locks.[123] One complicating factor is that the water level can vary dramatically. The ship lift must work even if water levels vary by 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) on the lower side, and 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) on the upper side.\n\n\nThe ship lift's design uses a helical gear system, to climb or descend a toothed rack.[124]\n\n\nThe ship lift was not yet complete when the rest of the project was officially opened on May 20, 2006.[125][126]\nIn November 2007, it was reported in the local media that construction of the ship lift started in October 2007.[37]\n\n\nIn February 2012, *Xinhua* reported that the four towers that are to support the ship lift had almost been completed.[127]\n\n\nThe report said the towers had reached 189\u00a0m (620\u00a0ft) of the anticipated 195\u00a0m (640\u00a0ft), the towers would be completed by June 2012 and the entire shiplift in 2015.\n\n\nAs of May 2014, the ship lift was expected to be completed by July 2015.[128] It was tested in December 2015 and announced complete in January 2016.[16][129] Lahmeyer, the German firm that designed the ship lift, said it will take a vessel less than an hour to transit the lift.[124] An article in Steel Construction says the actual time of the lift will be 21 minutes.[130] It says that the expected dimensions of the 3,000\u00a0t (3\u00a0million\u00a0kg) passenger vessels the ship lift's basin was designed to carry will be 84.5 by 17.2 by 2.65 metres (277.2\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a056.4\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a08.7\u00a0ft). The moving mass (including counterweights) is 34,000 tonnes.\n\n\nThe trials of elevator finished in July 2016, the first cargo ship was lifted on July 15; the lift time comprised 8 minutes.[131] *Shanghai Daily* reported that the first operational use of the lift was on September 18, 2016, when limited \"operational testing\" of the lift began.[132]\n\n\n\n### Portage railways[edit]\n\n\nPlans also exist for the construction of short portage railways bypassing the dam area altogether. Two short rail lines, one on each side of the river, are to be constructed. The 88-kilometre-long (55\u00a0mi) northern portage railway (\u5317\u5cb8\u7ffb\u575d\u94c1\u8def) will run from the Taipingxi port facility (\u592a\u5e73\u6eaa\u6e2f) on the northern side of the Yangtze, just upstream from the dam, via Yichang East Railway Station to the Baiyang Tianjiahe port facility in Baiyang Town (\u767d\u6d0b\u9547), below Yichang.[133] The 95-kilometre-long (59\u00a0mi) southern portage railway (\u5357\u5cb8\u7ffb\u575d\u94c1\u8def) will run from Maoping (upstream of the dam) via Yichang South Railway Station to Zhicheng (on the Jiaozuo\u2013Liuzhou Railway).[133]\n\n\nIn late 2012, preliminary work started along both future railway routes.[134]\n\n\n\n## Displacement of residents[edit]\n\n\nDuring planning, it was estimated that 13 cities, 140 towns and 1,350 villages would be partially or completely flooded by the reservoir,[135][136][137] amounting to roughly 1.5% of Hubei's 60.3\u00a0million people and Chongqing Municipality's 31.44\u00a0million people.[138] These people were moved to new homes by the Chinese government, which considered the displacement justified by the flood protection provided for the communities downstream of the dam.[139]\n\n\nBetween 2002 and 2005, Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky documented the impact of the project on the surrounding areas, including the town of Wanzhou.[140][141] Other photographers who recorded the change include Chengdu-based Muge,[142] Paris-based Zeng Nian (originally from Jiangsu),[143] and Israeli Nadav Kander.[144] Living conditions deteriorated for many, and hundreds of thousands of people could not find work. The older generation was particularly affected, but younger generations benefited from the educational and career opportunities afforded by moving to large cities with new, modern companies and schools.[145]\n\n\nSome 2007 reports claimed that Chongqing Municipality would encourage four million more people to move away from the dam to Chongqing's main urban area by 2020.[146][147][148] The municipal government asserted that the relocation was driven by urbanization, rather than a direct result of the dam project, and that the people involved included other areas of the municipality.[149]\n\n\nBy June 2008, China had moved 1.24\u00a0million residents as far as Gaoyang in Hubei Province,[150] and the moves concluded the following month.[136]\n\n\n\n## Other effects[edit]\n\n\n### Cultural and history[edit]\n\n\nThe area which would fill with water behind the dam included locations with significant cultural history.[31]:\u200a206 The State Council authorized a \u00a5505 million archaeology salvage effort.[31]:\u200a206 Over the course of several years, archaeologists excavated 723 sites and conducted surface archaeology recovery missions at an additional 346 sites.[31]:\u200a206 Archaeologists recovered 200,000 artifacts of which 13,000 were considered as particularly historically or culturally notable.[31]:\u200a206 As part of this effort, the old Chongqing City Museum was replaced by the Chongqing China Sanxia Museum to house many of the recovered artifacts.[31]:\u200a206\n\n\nRecovered structures that were too large for museums were moved upland to reconstruction districts (*fu jian qu*), which are outdoor museum parks. Recovered structures placed in such parks include temples, pavilions, houses, and bridges, among others.[31]:\u200a206\n\n\nSome sites could not be moved because of their location, size, or design, such as the hanging coffins site high in the Shen Nong Gorge, part of the cliffs.[151]\n\n\n\n### National security[edit]\n\n\nThe United States Department of Defense reported that in Taiwan, \"proponents of strikes against the mainland apparently hope that merely presenting credible threats to China's urban population or high-value targets, such as the Three Gorges Dam, will deter Chinese military coercion\".[152] Destroying the Three Gorges Dam has been a tactic discussed and debated in Taiwan since the early 1990s, when the dam was still in the planning phase.[153]\n\n\nThe notion that the military in Taiwan would seek to destroy the dam provoked an angry response from the mainland Chinese media. People's Liberation Army General Liu Yuan was quoted in the *China Youth Daily* saying that the People's Republic of China would be \"seriously on guard against threats from Taiwan independence terrorists\".[154]\n\n\nThe Three Gorges Dam is a steel-concrete gravity dam. The water is held back by the innate mass of the individual dam sections. As a result, damage to an individual section should not affect other parts of the dam.[153] Zhang Boting, deputy secretary-general of China Society for Hydropower Engineering, suggested that concrete gravity dams are resistant to nuclear strikes.[155] Former Taiwanese Ministry of Defense advisor Sung Chao-wen, called the notion of using cruise missiles to destroy the Three Gorges Dam \"ridiculous\", saying missiles would deliver minimal damage to the reinforced concrete, and any attack attempts would have to go through multiple layers of ground and air defenses.[156][157]\n\n\nDebate among Chinese scholars and analysts about the basic principles of China's no first use policy of nuclear weapons includes whether to include narrow exceptions, such as acts that produce catastrophic consequences equivalent to that of a nuclear attack, including attacks intended to destroy the Three Gorges Dam.[158][159]\n\n\n\n### Structural integrity[edit]\n\n\nImmediately after the reservoir was first filled, around 80 hairline cracks were observed in the dam's structure.[160][161][162] Still, an experts group gave the project overall a good-quality rating.[163] The 163,000 concrete units all passed quality testing, with normal deformation within design limits.\n\n\n\n## Upstream dams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Longitudinal profile of upstream Yangtze River\nIn order to maximize the utility of the Three Gorges Dam and cut down on sedimentation from the Jinsha River, the upper course of the Yangtze River, authorities are building a series of dams on the Jinsha, including the now completed Wudongde, Baihetan, Xiluodu, and Xiangjiaba dams. The total capacity of those four dams is 38,500\u00a0MW,[164] almost double the capacity of the Three Gorges.[165]\n\n\nBaihetan is under construction and should be fully operational by July 2022.[166] Wudongde was opened in June 2021. Another eight dams are in the midstream of the Jinsha and eight more upstream of it.[167]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Renewable energy portal\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![icon](image)Water portal\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Three Gorges Dam.\n\n* Baiheliang Underwater Museum\n* South\u2013North Water Transfer Project\n* Energy policy of China\n* List of largest power stations\n* List of largest hydroelectric power stations\n* List of power stations in China\n* List of dams and reservoirs in China\n* Three Gorges Museum\n* Liang Weiyan, one of the leading engineers who designed the water turbines for the dam\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Ma, Yue (November 26, 2010). \"Three Gorges Dam\". *large.stanford.edu*.

The dam is a 289-meter-tall double-curvature arch dam with a crest elevation of 827 m, and a width of 72 m at the base and 13 m at the crest.[4] It is considered to be the last large hydropower project in China after a series of projects starting with the Three Gorges Dam.[5] It is also the second largest hydropower plant in the world. The hydropower station is equipped with 16 hydro-generating units that each have a capacity of 1 million kilowatts, making it the largest single-unit capacity globally.[6] All hydro-generating units of the Baihetan hydropower station became fully operational on 20 December 2022.[7]\n\n\nThe dam is also part of the \u201cworld\u2019s largest clean energy corridor\u201d, where it joins other mega hydropower projects like the Three Gorges Dam, Wudongde Dam, Xiluodu Dam, and Xiangjiaba Dam, all located on the same river system, to produce and transmit renewable energy from the resource-rich western region to the cities in the east.[8][6] In addition to power generation, the hydropower project also provides flood control, improved navigation, and sand blocking.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn June 1959, an on-site survey was conducted at Qiaojia by a domestic expert group and a Czechoslovakian expert group and, consequently, the future site for the Baihetan Power Station was selected. However, the breaking down of relations during the Sino-Soviet split in 1962, resulted in the survey team being withdrawn. The beginning of China\u2019s \u201cCultural Revolution\" also saw the construction plans becoming shelved for many years.[9] It wasn't until August 3, 2017, when construction of the main dam was officially started.[9] An opening ceremony took place on February 5, 2021, and storage of water behind the dam commenced on April 7 of the same year, and by April 24, the water storage elevation of the hydro plant had risen over 720 meters.[9] On 20 December 2022, the formal completion of Baihetan Hydropower Station was achieved when the final hydro-generating unit was connected to the grid and began producing power.[7]\n\n\n\n## Power generation[edit]\n\n\nThe facility generates power by utilizing 16 turbines, each with a generating capacity of 1.0 GW, taking the generating capacity to 16,000 MW.[10] In terms of generating capacity, it is the second largest hydroelectric power plant in the world, after the Three Gorges Dam.[11] It is estimated to generate 62.44 billion kilowatt-hour (kWh) annually and will save about 90.45 million tons of coal per year and consequently reduce annual carbon emissions by 248.4 million tonnes.[7]\n\n\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\nSurveying of the dam site was done in 1992.[12] In 2008, the original plan for the construction of Baihetan Hydropower Station, was formally started. In December 2008, the Baihetan site began construction.[9] The dam was originally scheduled to be constructed between 2009 and 2018.[13] The Jinsha River became officially closed on November 2014.[9] Actual construction started on August 3, 2017.[14]\n\n\nThe manufacturing of the first water guiding mechanism in the Baihetan Hydro-generator units was completed in Harbin, where it both passed inspection and was awarded approval on October 27, 2018. The first 1,000 MW turbine runner was completed at Dongfang Electric\u2019s Baihetan Runner Processing Plant on January 12, 2019.[9]\n\n\nThe reservoir first started storing water on 7 April 2021, and by 24 April, the water storage elevation of the power station had risen over 720 metres.[9] The hydropower station started partial electricity generation in July of the same year. The dam was expected to be fully operational by July 2022.[15] Experts have noted the 4-year construction period as being exceptionally fast for a project of its type.[16]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2021, the Baihetan Dam began generating electricity, when the project's first two turbines started operating.[17] The third turbine followed in July and the fourth in November of the same year.[18] The final generating unit was connected to the grid on 20 December 2022.[19]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nThe dam and reservoir have particularly affected upstream Qiaojia County, providing thousands of jobs to local residents, while also requiring resettlement of 32 villages totaling 50,178 residents. Coinciding with the dam construction, the road network was also improved.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Water portal\n* ![icon](image)Renewable energy portal\n\n* Wudongde Dam, the next dam upstream\n* Xiluodu Dam, the next dam downstream\n* List of power stations in China\n* List of largest power stations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Xie, Echo (28 June 2021). \"China turns on world's first giant hydropower turbines\". *South China Morning Post*.

It is the third largest hydroelectric dam in the world, and holds the 45th largest reservoir in the world.\n\n\nThe name \"Itaipu\" was taken from an isle that existed near the construction site. In the Guarani language, *Itaipu* means \"the sounding stone\".[2] The Itaipu Dam's hydroelectric power plant produced the second-most electricity of any in the world as of 2020, only surpassed by the Three Gorges Dam plant in electricity production.\n\n\nCompleted in 1984, it is a binational undertaking run by Brazil and Paraguay at the border between the two countries, 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) north of the Friendship Bridge. The project ranges from Foz do Igua\u00e7u, in Brazil, and Ciudad del Este in Paraguay, in the south to Gua\u00edra and Salto del Guair\u00e1 in the north. The installed generation capacity of the plant is 14\u00a0GW, with 20 generating units providing 700 MW each with a hydraulic design head of 118 metres (387\u00a0ft). In 2016, the plant employed 3038 workers.[3]\n\n\nOf the twenty generator units currently installed, ten generate at 50\u00a0Hz for Paraguay and ten generate at 60\u00a0Hz for Brazil. Since the output capacity of the Paraguayan generators far exceeds the load in Paraguay, most of their production is exported directly to the Brazilian side, from where two 600\u00a0kV HVDC lines, each approximately 800 kilometres (500\u00a0mi) long, carry the majority of the energy to the S\u00e3o Paulo/Rio de Janeiro region where the terminal equipment converts the power to 60\u00a0Hz.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Negotiations between Brazil and Paraguay[edit]\n\n\nThe concept behind the Itaipu Power Plant was the result of serious negotiations between the two countries during the 1960s. The \"Ata do Igua\u00e7u\" (Igua\u00e7u Act) was signed on July 22, 1966, by the Brazilian and Paraguayan Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Juracy Magalh\u00e3es and Ra\u00fal Sapena Pastor. This was a joint declaration of the mutual interest in studying the exploitation of the hydro resources that the two countries shared in the section of the Paran\u00e1 River starting from, and including, the *Salto de Sete Quedas*, to the *Igua\u00e7u River* watershed. The treaty that gave origin to the power plant was signed in 1973.\n\n\nThe terms of the treaty, which expires in 2023, have been the subject of widespread discontent in Paraguay. The government of President Lugo vowed to renegotiate the terms of the treaty with Brazil, which long remained hostile to any renegotiation.[4][5]\n\n\nIn 2009, Brazil agreed to a fairer payment of electricity to Paraguay and also allowed Paraguay to sell excess power directly to Brazilian companies instead of solely through the Brazilian electricity monopoly.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Construction starts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1970, the consortium formed by the companies ELC Electroconsult S.p.A. (from Italy) and IECO (from the United States)[8] won the international competition for the realization of the viability studies and for the elaboration of the construction project. Design studies began in February 1971. On April 26, 1973, Brazil and Paraguay signed the Itaipu Treaty, the legal instrument for the hydroelectric exploitation of the Paran\u00e1 River by the two countries. On May 17, 1974, the Itaipu Binacional entity was created to administer the plant's construction. The construction began in January of the following year. Brazil's (and Latin America's) first electric car was introduced in late 1974; it received the name *Itaipu* in honor of the project.[9]\n\n\n\n### Paran\u00e1 River rerouted[edit]\n\n\nOn October 14, 1978, the Paran\u00e1 River had its route changed, which allowed a section of the riverbed to dry so the dam could be built there.\n\n\n\n### Agreement by Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina[edit]\n\n\nThe construction of the dam was first contested by Argentina, but the negotiations and resolution of the dispute ended up setting the basis for Argentine\u2013Brazilian integration later on.[10]\nAn important diplomatic settlement was reached with the signing of the *Acordo Tripartite* by Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, on October 19, 1979. This agreement established the allowed river levels and how much they could change as a result of the various hydroelectrical undertakings in the watershed that was shared by the three countries.\n\n\n\n### Formation of the lake[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Itaipu Lake\n\nThe reservoir began its formation on October 13, 1982, when the dam works were completed and the side canal's gates were closed. Throughout this period, heavy rains and flooding accelerated the filling of the reservoir as the water rose 100 meters (330 feet) and reached the gates of the spillway on October 27.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Start of operations[edit]\n\n\nOn May 5, 1984, the first generation unit started running in Itaipu. The first 18 units were installed at the rate of two to three a year; the last two of these started running in the year 1991.\n\n\n\n### Capacity expansion in 2007[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The dam undergoes expansion work.\nThe last two of the 20 electric generation units started operations in September 2006 and in March 2007, thus raising the installed capacity to 14 GW and completing the power plant. This increase in capacity allows 18 generation units to run permanently while two are shut down for maintenance. Due to a clause in the treaty signed between Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, the maximum number of generating units allowed to operate simultaneously cannot exceed 18 (see the agreement section for more information).\n\n\nThe rated nominal power of each generating unit (turbine and generator) is 700 MW. However, because the head (difference between reservoir level and the river level at the bottom of the dam) that actually occurs is higher than the designed head (118\u00a0m or 387\u00a0ft), the power available exceeds 750 MW half of the time for each generator.\nEach turbine generates around 700 MW; by comparison, all the water from the Igua\u00e7u Falls would have the capacity to feed only two generators.\n\n\n\n## November 2009 power failure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2009 Brazil and Paraguay blackout\n\nOn November 10, 2009, transmission from the plant was completely disrupted, possibly due to a storm damaging up to three high-voltage transmission lines.[11] Itaipu itself was not damaged. This caused massive power outages in Brazil and Paraguay, blacking out the entire country of Paraguay for 15 minutes, and plunging Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo into darkness for more than 2 hours. 50 million people were reportedly affected.[12] The blackout hit at 22:13 local time. It affected the southeast of Brazil most severely, leaving S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Esp\u00edrito Santo completely without electricity. Blackouts also swept through the interior of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Mato Grosso do Sul, Mato Grosso, the interior of Bahia and parts of Pernambuco, energy officials said.[13] By 00:30 power had been restored to most areas.\n\n\n\n## Wonder of the Modern World[edit]\n\n\nIn 1994, the American Society of Civil Engineers elected the Itaipu Dam as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World. In 1995, the American magazine *Popular Mechanics* published the results.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the Itaipu Dam, with the spillways (closed at the time of the photo) on the left\n\n![](image)\nThis diagram shows in detail the heights:\n325 metres (1,066\u00a0ft), entire dam including the 100 metres (330\u00a0ft) high Power Line 4 Pylons atop the Barrage   \n \n260 metres (850\u00a0ft), dam + the foundation inside water until the river floor   \n \n247 metres (810\u00a0ft), 196 metres (643\u00a0ft) high of roof reinforcement concrete dam + Cranes atop the Barrage   \n\n225 metres (738\u00a0ft), Elevation End Main Concrete Barrage   \n\n\n\n\n196 metres (643\u00a0ft), The official roof given from Itaip\u00fa Binacional Webpage\n\n## Social and environmental impacts[edit]\n\n\nWhen construction of the dam began, approximately 10,000 families living beside the Paran\u00e1 River were displaced because of construction.[15][16]\n\n\nThe world's largest waterfall by volume, the Gua\u00edra Falls, was inundated by the newly formed Itaipu reservoir. The Brazilian government later liquidated the Gua\u00edra Falls National Park. A few months before the reservoir was filled, 80 people died when an overcrowded bridge overlooking the falls collapsed, as tourists sought a last glimpse of the falls.[17]\n\n\nThe Gua\u00edra Falls was an effective barrier that separated freshwater species in the upper Paran\u00e1 basin (with its many endemics) from species found below it, and the two are recognized as different ecoregions.[18] After the falls disappeared, many species formerly restricted to one of these areas have been able to invade the other, causing problems typically associated with introduced species. For example, more than 30 fish species that formerly were restricted to the region below the falls have been able to invade the region above.[18]\n\n\nThe American composer Philip Glass has written a symphonic cantata named *Itaipu*, in honour of the structure.\n\n\nThe Santa Maria Ecological Corridor now connects the Igua\u00e7u National Park with the protected margins of Lake Itaipu, and via these margins with the Ilha Grande National Park.[19]\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Central Control Room (CCR)\n![](image)The dam at night\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\n* The course of the seventh biggest river in the world was shifted, as were 50 million tonnes of earth and rock.\n* The amount of concrete used to build the Itaipu Power Plant would be enough to build 210 football stadiums the size of the Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3.\n* The iron and steel used would allow for the construction of 380 Eiffel Towers.\n* The volume of excavation of earth and rock in Itaipu is 8.5 times greater than that of the Channel Tunnel and the volume of concrete is 15 times greater.\n* Around forty thousand people worked in the construction.[20]\n* Itaipu is one of the most expensive objects ever built.\n\n\n### Generating station and dam[edit]\n\n\n* The total length of the dam is 7,235 metres (23,737\u00a0ft). The crest elevation is 225 metres (738\u00a0ft). Itaipu is actually four dams joined together\u00a0\u2013 from the far left, an earth fill dam, a rock fill dam, a concrete buttress main dam, and a concrete wing dam to the right.\n* The spillway has a length of 483 metres (1,585\u00a0ft).\n* The maximum flow of Itaipu's fourteen segmented spillways is 62.2\u00a0thousand cubic metres per second (2.20\u00d710~~^~~6\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s), into three skislope formed canals. It is equivalent to 40 times the average flow of the nearby natural Igua\u00e7u Falls.\n* The flow of two generators (700 cubic metres per second (25,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) each) is roughly equivalent to the average flow of the Igua\u00e7u Falls (1,500 cubic metres per second (53,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)).\n* The dam is 196 metres (643\u00a0ft) high, equivalent to a 65-story building.[21]\n* Though it is the seventh largest reservoir in size in Brazil, the Itaipu's reservoir has the best relation between electricity production and flooded area. For the 14,000\u00a0MW installed power, 1,350 square kilometres (520\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) were flooded. The reservoirs for the hydroelectric power plants of Sobradinho Dam, Tucuru\u00ed Dam, Porto Primavera Dam, Balbina Dam, Serra da Mesa Dam and Furnas Dam are all larger than the one for Itaipu, but have a smaller installed generating capacity. The one with the next largest hydroelectric production, Tucuru\u00ed, has an installed capacity of 8,000\u00a0MW, while flooding 2,430\u00a0km2 (938\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land.\n* Electricity is 55% cheaper when made by the Itaipu Dam than the other types of power plants in the area.\n\n\n### Generation[edit]\n\n\n![Inside the dam structure](image)\nInside the dam structure\n\nAlthough its designed peak generating capacity is only 14,000 MW, behind the 22,500 MW Three Gorges Dam, the dam formerly held the record for energy production with 101.6 TWh produced in 2016. This record was beaten in 2020, when the Three Gorges Dam produced a new record 111.8 TWh after extensive monsoon rainfall that year.[22]\n\n\nIn the period 2012\u20132021, the Itaipu Dam maintained the second highest average annual hydroelectric production in the world averaging 89.22 TWh per year, second to the 97.22 TWh per year average of the Three Gorges Dam in that period.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual production of energy\n| Year | Installed units | TWh |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1984 | 0\u20132 | 2.770\n |\n| 1985 | 2\u20133 | 6.327\n |\n| 1986 | 3\u20136 | 21.853\n |\n| 1987 | 6\u20139 | 35.807\n |\n| 1988 | 9\u201312 | 38.508\n |\n| 1989 | 12\u201315 | 47.230\n |\n| 1990 | 15\u201316 | 53.090\n |\n| 1991 | 16\u201318 | 57.517\n |\n| 1992 | 18 | 52.268\n |\n| 1993 | 18 | 59.997\n |\n| 1994 | 18 | 69.394\n |\n| 1995 | 18 | 77.212\n |\n| 1996 | 18 | 81.654\n |\n| 1997 | 18 | 89.237\n |\n| 1998 | 18 | 87.845\n |\n| 1999 | 18 | 90.001\n |\n| 2000 | 18 | 93.428\n |\n| 2001 | 18 | 79.300\n |\n| 2004 | 18 | 89.911\n |\n| 2005 | 18 | 87.971\n |\n| 2006 | 19 | 92.690\n |\n| 2007 | 20 | 90.620\n |\n| 2008 | 20 | 94.684\n |\n| 2009 | 20 | 91.652\n |\n| 2010 | 20 | 85.970\n |\n| 2011 | 20 | 92.246[23] |\n| 2012 | 20 | 98.287[24] |\n| 2013 | 20 | 98.630[25][26] |\n| 2014 | 20 | 87.8[25] |\n| 2015 | 20 | 89.2[27] |\n| 2016 | 20 | 103.1[28] |\n| 2017 | 20 | 96.387\n |\n| 2018 | 20 | 96.585\n |\n| 2019 | 20 | 79.444\n |\n| 2020 | 20 | 76.382[29] |\n| 2021 | 20 | 66.369[30] |\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Renewable energy portal\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![flag](image)Brazil portal\n* ![flag](image)Paraguay portal\n\n\n* List of largest dams\n* List of largest hydroelectric power stations\n* List of largest power stations in the world\n* List of conventional hydroelectric power stations\n* List of dam megaprojects\n* List of power stations in Brazil\n* List of tallest dams\n* Megaproject\n* Three Gorges Dam\n* List of hydroelectric power station failures\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Energy | Itaipu Binacional\".\n2. **^** \"Energy\".

It is located near the town of Xiluodu in Yongshan County of Yunnan Province but the dam straddles into Leibo County of Sichuan Province on the opposite side of the river. The primary purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power generation and its power station has an installed capacity of 13,860 MW. Additionally, the dam provides for flood control, silt control and its regulated water releases are intended to improve navigation downstream. Construction on the dam and power station began in 2005 and the first generator was commissioned in 2013, the last in 2014. It is operated by China Yangtze Power and is currently the fourth-largest power station in the world, as well as the fifth tallest dam world-wide.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\nThe Xiluodu Dam is located on the Jinsha (Upper Yangtze) River as it exits the mountainous region of the Hengduan Mountains and Yungui Plateau and enters the Sichuan Basin. This part of the Jinsha flows between the Daliang Mountains in Sichuan on the left (northwest) bank, and the Wulian Feng in Yunnan on the right (southeast) bank. The Jinsha falls to an elevation of 400\u00a0m (1,300\u00a0ft) above sea level here while mountains rise more than 2,000\u00a0m (6,600\u00a0ft) above the Jinsha on either side.[5]\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nPreliminary construction (roads, bridges, tunnels) for the dam began in 2003 and work on main structures officially commenced on 26 December 2005. In November 2007, the Jinsha was successfully diverted around the construction site, allowing the dam to be built. Concrete pouring began in 2008.[6] The reservoir was impounded in May 2013 and the first of 18\u00d7770 MW Francis turbine-generators was commissioned on 15 July 2013.[7] The fourteenth generator was commissioned in April 2014.[8] The eighteenth and final generator was commissioned on 30 June 2014.[3]\n\n\n\n## Design[edit]\n\n\nThe Xiluodu is a 285.5\u00a0m (937\u00a0ft) tall and 700\u00a0m (2,300\u00a0ft) long double-curvature arch dam. It is the third tallest arch dam in the world and a key component of the Jinsha River Project. It withholds a reservoir of 12,670,000,000 cubic metres (10,270,000\u00a0acre\u22c5ft) of which 6,460,000,000 cubic metres (5,240,000\u00a0acre\u22c5ft) is considered active storage for power generation. The dam contains several spillways to include seven surface outlets, eight mid-level orifices and four spillway tunnels. All spillways afford a maximum discharge of 32,278\u00a0m3/s (1,139,900\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).[9] The dam's power station is split into two underground power stations, one located behind the right abutment, the second behind the left abutment. Each power station contains nine 770 MW Francis turbine-generators for a total installed capacity of 13,860 MW.[10]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Water portal\n* ![icon](image)Renewable energy portal\n\n* List of power stations in China\n* List of tallest dams in the world\n* List of tallest dams in China\n* List of dams and reservoirs in China\n* List of largest power stations in the world\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Xiluodu Dam, Jinsha River, China\".
