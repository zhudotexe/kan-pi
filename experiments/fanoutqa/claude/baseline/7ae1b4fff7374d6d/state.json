former competitive swimmer. He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time[7] with a total of 28 medals.[8] Phelps also holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[9] Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic medals in individual events (16).[10] At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Phelps tied the record of eight medals of any color at a single Games, held by gymnast Alexander Dityatin, by winning six gold and two bronze medals. Four years later, when he won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Games, he broke fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven first-place finishes at any single Olympic Games. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps won four gold and two silver medals, and at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, he won five gold medals and one silver. This made him the most successful athlete of the Games for the fourth Olympics in a row.[11][12]\n\n\nPhelps is a former long course world record holder in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and 400-meter individual medley. He has won 82 medals in major international long course competitions, of which 65 were gold, 14 silver, and three bronze, spanning the Olympics, the World Championships, and the Pan Pacific Championships. Phelps's international titles and record-breaking performances have earned him the World Swimmer of the Year Award eight times and American Swimmer of the Year Award eleven times, as well as the FINA Swimmer of the Year Award in 2012 and 2016. Phelps earned *Sports Illustrated* magazine's Sportsman of the Year award due to his unprecedented Olympic success in the 2008 Games.\n\n\nAfter the 2008 Summer Olympics, Phelps started the Michael Phelps Foundation, which focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles. Phelps retired following the 2012 Olympics, but he made a comeback in April 2014.[13] At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro,[14] his fifth Olympics, he was selected by his team to be the flag bearer of the United States at the 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations. He announced his second retirement on August 12, 2016,[15] having won more medals than 161 countries. He is widely regarded as the greatest swimmer of all time and is often considered to be one of the greatest athletes of all time.[16][17]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was born in Baltimore, Maryland,[6] and raised in the Rodgers Forge neighborhood of nearby Towson.[18] He attended Rodgers Forge Elementary, Dumbarton Middle School, and Towson High School.[19] Phelps is the youngest of three children. His mother, Deborah Sue \"Debbie\" Phelps (*n\u00e9e* Davisson), is a middle school principal.[20] His father, Michael Fred Phelps, was a retired Maryland State Trooper who played football in high school and college and tried out for the team now known as the Washington Commanders in the 1970s.[20][21] Phelps is of English, German, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent.[22] His parents divorced in 1994 when he was nine years old, and his father remarried in 2000.[21] Phelps later revealed that the divorce had a severe negative impact on him and his siblings, and his relationship with his father was distant for a few years after the divorce.[23] He graduated from Towson High School in 2003.[24]\n\n\nPhelps began swimming at the age of seven, partly because of the influence of his sisters and partly to provide him with an outlet for his energy.[25] After retirement in 2016, he stated \"The only reason I ever got in the water was my mom wanted me to just learn how to swim. My sisters and myself fell in love with the sport, and we decided to swim.\"[26] When Phelps was in the sixth grade, he was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).[27][28] By the age of 10, he held a national record for his age group (in the 100-meter butterfly)[29] and began to train at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club under coach Bob Bowman. More age group records followed, and as of August 21, 2018, Phelps still held 11 age group records, eight in long course,[30] and three in short course.[31]\n\n\n\n## Swimming career[edit]\n\n\n### Training[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has trained under Bob Bowman since he was 11 years old.[32] Bowman swam for Florida State University from 1983 to 1985.[33] Phelps has said Bowman reminded him of a drill sergeant because of his disciplined and regimented ways.[34] Phelps has said, \"Training with Bob is the smartest thing I've ever done ... I'm not going to swim for anyone else.\"[35] After the 2004 Summer Olympics, Bowman was hired as the head coach for the University of Michigan after Jon Urbanchek retired. Phelps joined Bowman at Michigan to train and attended classes over a span of four years, but did not pursue a degree.[36][37] Phelps served as a volunteer assistant coach at Michigan.[38] After the 2008 Summer Olympics, Bowman returned to Baltimore as CEO at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club. Phelps also returned to Baltimore with Bowman.[39] When Bowman was hired as the men's and women's swimming coach at Arizona State University in 2015, Phelps moved to Arizona to continue training under Bowman.[40] There is a popular myth that Phelps ate 12,000 calories every day, but Phelps has stated it has been exaggerated and that he did not eat so much even in his growing days.[41][42]\n\n\n\n### 2000 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\nPhelps's rapid improvement culminated when he qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics at the age of 15, as he became the youngest male (since Ralph Flanagan in 1932) to make a U.S. Olympic swim team in 68 years.[43] While he did not win a medal, he did make the finals and finished fifth in the 200-meter butterfly.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2001 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2001 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.58 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the World Championship Trials for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, on March 30, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter butterfly to become, at 15 years and 9 months, the youngest male ever to set a world record in swimming. Previously the youngest male had been Ian Thorpe, who captured the 400-meter freestyle world record at 16 years, 10 months.[45] At the World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Phelps broke his own world record in the 200-meter butterfly while en route to become a world champion for the first time.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2002 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps in 2002\n\n\n| 2002 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:12.48\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m medley  | 3:33.48 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1.55.41\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 7:11.81\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, the selection meet for the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Phelps set an American record in the 200-meter individual medley and was just off the world record in the 200-meter butterfly.[47] In the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps bettered the world record held by Tom Dolan with a time of 4:11.09, just ahead of Erik Vendt, who finished second with a time of 4:11.27, also below the old world record. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps was barely beaten by Klete Keller and in the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps beat Ian Crocker.[48]\n\n\nAt the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Phelps won three gold medals and two silvers. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won gold ahead of Erik Vendt with a time of 4:12.48. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps lost to Tom Malchow, finishing behind him 1:55.41 to 1:55.21. Phelps said he lost because he did not take butterfly training seriously after he broke the world record. In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:59.70. In the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Nate Dusing, Klete Keller, and Chad Carvin, won the silver medal with a time 7:11.81 finishing behind Australia. The U.S. 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay team consisted of Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen, Phelps, and Ian Crocker. In the final for the medley relay, Phelps swam a 51.1 split, at the time the fastest split in history. The final time of 3:33.48 was a world record.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2003 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2003 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.35\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:09.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m medley  | 3:31.54 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.10\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 7:10.26\n |\n\n\nAt Nationals, Phelps won the 200-meter freestyle, 200-meter backstroke, and the 100-meter butterfly.[50] He became the first American swimmer to win three different races in three different strokes at a national championship.[50] At the 2003 Duel in the Pool, a meet that pits swimming stars from Australia and the United States, Phelps broke the world record in the 400-meter individual medley with a time of 4:10.73 and almost broke the world record in the 100-meter butterfly, just missing the record by 0.03 seconds.[51] At a meet in Santa Clara County, California, Phelps broke the world record in the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:57.94.[52] Phelps said he broke the 200-meter individual medley world record after Don Talbot said Phelps was unproven, using his words as motivation.[53]\n\n\nAt the 2003 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won four gold medals, two silver medals, and broke five world records.[54] Phelps broke his first world record on July 22 in the semi-finals for the 200-meter butterfly. Phelps swam a 1:53.93 to break his own world record of 1:54.58 set in 2001 and became the first man to swim under 1:54.00.[55] In the final of the 200-meter butterfly, on July 23, Phelps easily won the gold medal, but did not come close to his world record with a time of 1:54.35.[56] Less than an hour later, Phelps swam the lead-off leg for the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay. Phelps put up a solid time of 1:46.60 (an American record) but the Americans could not match the depth of the Australians and ultimately finished second 7:10.26 to 7:08.58.[57]\n\n\nIn the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps dominated. On July 24, in the semi-finals of the 200-meter individual medley, he broke his own world record with a time of 1:57.52.[58] On July 25, in the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps smashed his own record with a time of 1:56.04 to win the gold medal and finished almost 3 seconds ahead of Ian Thorpe.[59] About an hour before the final of the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps swam in the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly. Phelps dominated again, finishing in the top seed position with a world record time of 51.47.[60] However, in the final of the 100-meter butterfly, on July 26, Ian Crocker erased Phelps's world record with a time of 50.98, to become the first man under 51 seconds. Phelps swam a 51.10 (also under his former world record), but had to settle for silver.[61] In the final of the 400-meter individual medley, on July 27, Phelps broke his own world record with a time of 4:09.09 to easily claim the gold medal.[62] About half an hour later, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay.[63] Phelps did not swim in the finals, but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[64]\n\n\n\n### 2004 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six events; the 200- and 400-meter individual medley, the 100- and 200-meter butterfly, the 200-meter freestyle, and the 200-meter backstroke.[65] In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a world record time of 4:08.41.[66] Two days later, in the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:46.27, finishing sixth-tenths of a second ahead of Klete Keller.[67] Phelps, however, was not pleased with the result and wanted to be in the 1:45s and was uncertain if he would swim the event in Athens.[68] The following day, Phelps won in the 200-meter butterfly with a time of 1:54.31, three seconds ahead of second-place finisher Tom Malchow.[69] After two days off, Phelps was back in the pool and finished second to Aaron Peirsol (who broke the world record) in the 200-meter backstroke.[70] Less than half an hour later, Phelps won the 200-meter individual medley title ahead of Ryan Lochte by 2.70 seconds.[71][72] The following day, Phelps finished second to Ian Crocker in the 100-meter butterfly. Crocker won in a time of 50.76, a world record and 0.39 seconds ahead of Phelps.[73] When the Trials were over, Phelps became the first person to qualify in six individual events for a U.S. Olympic team.[74] However, Phelps dropped the 200-meter backstroke to focus on the 200-meter freestyle because he wanted to race Ian Thorpe.[74] Even though Phelps did not compete in the 100-meter freestyle at the Trials, he was still selected for the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay. Gary Hall, Jr. thought this was unfair and said Phelps did not deserve a spot on the relay. Phelps argued his program was too crowded to compete in 100-meter freestyle and was at least among the top four swimmers because he had beaten the top-seeded Jason Lezak the last time he had swum against him.[75]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2004 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.25 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.04 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:57.14 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:08.26 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 7:07.33 (NR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m medley  | 3:30.68 (WR) (Phelps swam in heats only)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal \u2013 third place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:45.32 (NR)\n |\n| ![Bronze medal \u2013 third place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m freestyle  | 3:14.62\n |\n\n\n#### Athens[edit]\n\n\nIn his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won his first Olympic gold medal in the world record time of 4:08.26.[76][77] The following day, Phelps, along with Ian Crocker, Neil Walker, and Jason Lezak, finished in third place in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay with a time of 3:14.62.[78][79] Crocker's lead-off time of 50.05 was the worst among the field and was blamed on sickness.[80][81] In the event many were calling *The Race of the Century*, the 200-meter freestyle that was held the following day, Phelps finished in third place behind Ian Thorpe and Pieter van den Hoogenband.[82][83] Although this race ended the chance to match Spitz's record, Phelps had savored the challenge even though it was not his strongest event, saying \"How can I be disappointed? I swam in a field with the two fastest freestylers of all time\".[84] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, held the following day, Phelps won a gold medal with a time of 1:54.04, breaking Tom Malchow's Olympic record.[85][86] About an hour later, in the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, finished in first place with a time of 7:07.33.[87]\n\n\nTwo days later, in the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished first with a time of 1:57.14, an Olympic record.[88] In the 100-meter butterfly final, held the following day, Phelps defeated American teammate Ian Crocker (who held the world record in the event at the time) by just 0.04 seconds with a time of 51.25.[89][90] Traditionally, the American who places highest in an individual event will be automatically given the corresponding leg in the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay final. This gave Phelps an automatic entry into the medley relay, but he deferred and Crocker swam instead.[90][91] Phelps's gesture gave Crocker a chance to make amends (for a mistake at the start of a previous race) as well, getting his final shot at a gold medal.[91] The American medley team went on to win the event in world-record time, and, since Phelps had raced in a preliminary heat of the medley relay, he was also awarded a gold medal along with the team members who competed in the final.[92][93] In winning six gold and two bronze medals, Phelps, still a teenager, had the second-best performance ever at a single Olympics, behind Mark Spitz's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Also, he became the second male swimmer ever to win more than two individual titles at a single Games with four, tying Spitz's four from 1972.\n\n\n\n### 2005 World championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Victory lap of the 100 m butterfly during the 2005 FINA World Championships in Montr\u00e9al.

This was the fourth gold medal for Phelps.[106] On July 30, Phelps swam in his last individual event, the 100-meter butterfly. In the final, Phelps could not match the speed of Ian Crocker and had to settle for silver, finishing 51.65 to 50.40, a new world record for Crocker.[107] On July 31, Phelps earned his final gold medal when the United States team won the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay.[108] Phelps did not swim in the finals but still earned a medal because he swam in the heats.[109]\n\n\n\n### 2006 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2006 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.80 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:55.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:10.47 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m freestyle  | 3:12.46 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 7:05.28 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  200 m backstroke  | 1:56.81\n |\n\n\nAt the 2006 National Championships, Phelps won three events.[110] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a championship record of 1:54.32.[111] In his second event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps just edged out Ian Crocker 51.51 (another championship record) to 51.73.[112] In his third event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a time of 1:56.50, just ahead of Ryan Lochte's time of 1:56.78.[113]\n\n\nAt the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, Phelps won five gold medals and one silver.[114] In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won in a world record time of 1:53.80, his first world record in two years.[115] In his second event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps easily won with a time of 4:10.47, 3.38 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Robert Margalis.[116] In his third event, the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Ryan Lochte, Peter Vanderkaay, and Klete Keller, won the gold medal with a time of 7:05.28.[117] In his fourth event, the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps won the silver medal, finishing behind Aaron Peirsol 1:56.81 to 1:54.44 (a new world record).[118] In his fifth event, the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, along with Neil Walker, Cullen Jones, and Jason Lezak, won the gold medal with a world-record time 3:12.46.[119] In his sixth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps won with a world record time of 1:55.84, breaking his record of 1:55.94 set in 2003.[120]\n\n\n\n### 2007 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2007 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.86 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.77\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.09 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.98 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:06.22 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m freestyle  | 3:12.72 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 7:03.24 (WR)\n |\n\n\nAt the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won seven gold medals, tying the record for a global long-course championship held by Mark Spitz since the 1972 Summer Olympics, and broke five world records.[121] Phelps first gold medal came in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.42 seconds and Neil Walker, Cullen Jones and Jason Lezak each expanded the lead to win in a Championship record of 3:12.72, just missing the world record of 3:12.46 set the previous year.[122] His lead-off time was faster than the winning time in the individual 100-meter freestyle final later in the meet. Phelps set his first world record in the Championships in the 200-meter freestyle, his second race. Phelps won the gold ahead of Pieter van den Hoogenband and broke Ian Thorpe's six-year-old world record with a time of 1:43.86.[123] For his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and bettered his own world record of 1:53.71 with a time of 1:52.09.[124] For his fourth race, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps set his third world record with a time of 1:54.98, bettering his own world-record time of 1:55.84[125] For his fifth race, the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.36 as the American team of Ryan Lochte, Klete Keller, and Peter Vanderkaay went on to win the gold medal and beat the previous world record set by Australia in 2001 with a time 7:03.24.[126] For his sixth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps edged out Ian Crocker 50.77 to 50.82 to win his sixth gold medal.[127] For his seventh event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps won the gold medal in a world-record time of 4:06.22, more than 3.5 seconds ahead of Ryan Lochte.[128] By winning seven gold medals, Phelps broke the record of six set by Ian Thorpe at the 2001 World Championships. The 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay team received a disqualification for a false start during a changeover in the heats, ending Phelps's chance of eight gold medals.[129]\n\n\nEven though Phelps competed in the backstroke in international competition only once (at the 2006 Pan Pacific Championships), he was among the best backstroke swimmers in the world. This is illustrated by his personal best times set in 2007, four months after the World Championships. At the US Nationals in Indianapolis on August 1, 2007, Phelps swam a 1:54.65 in the 200-meter backstroke, which was the third fastest of all time in the event, 0.33 of a second off the world record of 1:54.32 held by Ryan Lochte.[130] Two days later Phelps swam a time of 53.01 sec in the 100-meter backstroke, 0.03 of a second short of the world record of 52.98 held by Aaron Peirsol and the second-fastest performance of all time.[131]\nIn 2007 Phelps swam into the all-time top three performances in seven individual events, four of these being world records.\n\n\n\n### 2008 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2008 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:42.96 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.58 (OR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:52.03 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.23 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  400 m medley  | 4:03.84 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m freestyle  | 3:08.24 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 6:58.56 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m medley  | 3:29.34 (WR)\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Phelps competed in six individual events. In his first event, the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 4:06.22 with a time of 4:05.25.[132] In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.10, ahead of Peter Vanderkaay's time 1:45.85.[133] In his third event, the 100-meter freestyle, Phelps placed second in his heat with a time of 47.92, ensuring him a spot on the relay.[134] In his fourth event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 1:52.20.[135] In his fifth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps broke his own world record of 1:54.98 with a time of 1:54.80.[136] In his sixth and final event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a time of 50.89.[137] When asked about his chances of winning eight gold medals in Beijing, Phelps said, \"I am going to prepare for that meet just like I do every other meet ... There is only so much I can do in a month and then I am going to prepare myself the best that I can.\"[138]\n\n\n\n#### Beijing[edit]\n\n\nPhelps set an Olympic record in the preliminary heats of the 400-meter individual medley.[139][140] He followed that up in the final by winning the gold medal, as well as breaking his previous world record by nearly two seconds.[141][142] This swim went on to become the longest men's world record to stand in long course meters, beating Germany's Otto Farr who held the 100 backstroke world record from 1912 until 1926.[143]\n\n\nPhelps swam the first leg of the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay in a time of 47.51 seconds (an American record for the 100-meter freestyle), and won his second gold medal of the 2008 Olympics, as well as setting his second world record of the Olympics (3:08.24).[144] Teammate Jason Lezak, after beginning the anchor leg more than half a body length behind Alain Bernard, managed to finish ahead of the favored French swimmer by eight hundredths of a second. The top five teams in the final finished ahead of the world record of 3:12.23 set the previous day by the American B team in a preliminary heat.[145] Phelps remarked that Bernard's pre-race comments of \"smashing the Americans\" had \"fired me up more than anything else\". *Le Nouvel Observateur* noted \"Phelps taking the time to applaud and console Bernard\" and wrote that this sportsmanship was \"proof that the person who swims in the wake of Mark Spitz is also a great gentleman.\"[146]\n\n\nFor his third race, Phelps broke his previous world record in the 200-meter freestyle by nearly a second and won his third gold medal. He also set his third world record at the Olympics, 1:42.96, winning by nearly two seconds over silver medalist Park Tae-hwan.[147] In this race, Phelps became the fifth Olympic athlete in modern history to win nine gold medals, joining Mark Spitz, Larisa Latynina, Paavo Nurmi, and Carl Lewis.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps holds his gold medal on the podium on August 10, 2008. Pictured with Ryan Lochte and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Cseh.\nThe next day, Phelps participated in two finals. In his first event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps made it four gold medals and world records in four events by swimming the final in 1:52.03, defeating silver medalist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Cseh by almost seven-tenths of a second despite his goggles' having filled up with water and being unable to \"see anything for the last 100 meters.[149] This fourth gold medal was his tenth, and made him the all-time leader for most Olympic gold medals won by an individual in the modern Olympic era.[150] Moreover, Phelps became the first swimmer, male or female, to win three Olympic butterfly titles, after his two titles in the Athens 2004 Olympics. He also became the first swimmer to successfully defend an Olympic butterfly title.\n\n\nLess than one hour after his gold medal victory in the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps swam the lead-off leg of the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay. With Lochte, Ricky Berens, and Peter Vanderkaay, he won his fifth gold and set his fifth world record as the American team finished first with a time of 6:58.56. The Americans were the first team to break the seven-minute mark in the relay, and broke the previous record, set in Melbourne, Australia, by more than four and a half seconds.[151]\n\n\nAfter taking a day off from finals (Phelps did swim in qualifying heats), Phelps won his sixth gold of the Beijing Games on August 15 by winning the 200-meter individual medley with a world record time of 1:54.23, finishing ahead of Cseh by over two seconds.[152]\n\n\n\n##### Seventh gold medal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phelps *(in black cap)* starting the 4 x 100m relay at the Beijing Olympic Games, August 11, 2008\nBefore the final of the 100-meter butterfly, US born Serbian swimmer Milorad \u010cavi\u0107 caused a minor stir when he said it would be \"good\" if Phelps lost. \"It'd be good for him if he loses. It would be nice if historians talk about Michael Phelps winning seven gold medals and losing the eighth to 'some guy.' I'd like to be that guy\", \u010cavi\u0107 said.[153] Phelps responded, \"When people say things like that, it fires me up more than anything.\"[154] On August 16, Phelps won his seventh gold medal of the Games in the men's 100-meter butterfly, setting an Olympic record for the event with a time of 50.58 seconds and edging out his nearest competitor \u010cavi\u0107, by one hundredth (0.01) of a second.[155]\n\n\nUnlike all six of his previous events in the 2008 Games, Phelps did not set a new world record, leaving intact Ian Crocker's world-record time of 50.40 seconds, set in 2005.\n\n\nPhelps's finish 0.01 seconds ahead of \u010cavi\u0107 prompted the Serbian delegation to file a protest. Subsequent analysis of the video by the FINA panel, which required analyzing frames shot 1/10,000th of a second apart, was used to officially confirm Phelps's victory,[156] but the images were not immediately released to the press. The initial refusal by official timekeeper Omega to release underwater photos of the finish also raised questions due to Phelps's sponsorship relationship with Omega.[157] \u010cavi\u0107 later wrote in his blog, \"People, this is the greatest moment of my life. If you ask me, it should be accepted and we should move on. I've accepted defeat, and there's nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been.\"[158]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Epic. It goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest Olympian of all time, he's maybe the greatest athlete of all time. He's the greatest racer who ever walked the planet.

It was also his fifth individual gold medal in Beijing, tying the record for individual gold medals at a single Games originally set by Eric Heiden in the 1980 Winter Olympics and equaled by Vitaly Scherbo at the 1992 Summer Games. Said Phelps upon setting his seventh-straight Olympic record of the Games in as many events, \"Dream as big as you can dream, and anything is possible ... I am sort of in a dream world. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure it is real.\"[160]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michael Phelps celebrates with his teammates after winning his 8th gold medal.\n##### All-time record[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, Phelps won his eighth gold medal in the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay, breaking Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals won in a single Olympic Games, which had stood since 1972.[161] Phelps, along with teammates Brendan Hansen, Aaron Peirsol, and Jason Lezak, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes and 29.34 seconds, 0.7 seconds ahead of second-place Australia and 1.34 seconds faster than the previous record set by the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. When Phelps dived in to swim the 100-meter butterfly leg, the third leg of the 400-meter medley, the United States had been trailing Australia and Japan. Phelps completed his split in 50.1 seconds, the fastest butterfly split ever for the event, giving teammate Jason Lezak a more than half-second lead for the final leg, which he held onto to clinch the event in world record time.[162] Said Phelps, upon completing the event that awarded him his eighth gold medal and eighth Olympic record in as many events, \"Records are always made to be broken no matter what they are ... Anybody can do anything that they set their mind to.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### Performance-enhancing drugs testing[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 Olympics, Phelps was questioned by the press as to whether perhaps his feats were \"too good to be true\", a reference to unsupported rumors that Phelps might be taking performance-enhancing substances.[164][165] In response, Phelps noted that he had signed up for *Project Believe*, a project by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in which U.S. Olympians can volunteer to be tested in excess of the World Anti-Doping Agency guidelines.[166] During the Games, Phelps passed all nine tests that were administered to him.[167][168]\n\n\n\n### 2009 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2009 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 49.82 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:51.51 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m freestyle  | 3:09.21 (CR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 6:58.55 (WR)\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m medley  | 3:27.28 (WR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:43.22\n |\n\n\nAt the 2009 National Championships, Phelps drastically shortened his program, swimming in only three individual events. In his first event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won with a time of 1:44.23.[169] In his second event, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps easily won with a time of 1:52.76, 0.88 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.[170] In his third event, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won with a world-record time of 50.22.[171]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps (center) before the start of the 200-meter butterfly semi-final during 2009 FINA World Championships\nAt the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, Phelps won a total of 6 medals, 5 golds and 1 silver. In his first event, the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 47.78, well off his 47.51 performance in Beijing, but the American team was able to edge out Russia and France for the gold.[172] For his second race, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps lost his first race in four years to Germany's Paul Biedermann. Phelps touched second in 1:43.22, but Biedermann smashed Phelps's record of 1:42.96 set in Beijing a year ago with a time of 1:42.00.[173] Phelps took the silver graciously, but coach Bob Bowman threatened to withdraw Phelps from international competition because Bowman claimed Biedermann had an unfair advantage because he was wearing a full polyurethane swimsuit, specifically an Arena X-Glide.[174]\nBowman said, \"It took me five years to get Michael from 1:46 to 1:42 and this guy has done it in 11 months. That's an amazing training performance. I'd like to know how to do that.\"[175] Phelps rebounded from this loss and for his third race, the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and broke his own world record of 1:52.03 with a time of 1:51.51.[176] For his fourth race, the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:44.49 as the team went on to win the gold medal and break the world record set the previous year.[177] After his loss in the 200-meter freestyle, many thought Phelps was vulnerable coming into the final for the 100-meter butterfly.[178] His closest competitor, Milorad \u010cavi\u0107, who wore an Arena X-Glide (the same suit Biedermann beat Phelps with), thought people were making excuses for Phelps because he was wearing an LZR Racer. \u010cavi\u0107 even offered to buy Phelps a new suit.[179] For his fifth race, the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won the gold and became the first man to complete it in under 50 seconds, beating \u010cavi\u0107 49.82 to 49.95.[180] The victory prompted a fierce celebration from Phelps.[181] For his final event, the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay, Phelps won his fifth gold medal. Phelps, along with teammates Aaron Peirsol, Eric Shanteau, and David Walters, set a new world record in the event with a time of 3 minutes, 27.28 seconds.[182]\n\n\n\n### 2010 Pan Pacific championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2010 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.86\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:54.11\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m freestyle  | 3:11.74\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 7:03.84\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m medley  | 3:32.48\n |\n\n\nAt the 2010 National Championships, Phelps competed in five individual events. In the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won ahead of Ryan Lochte in a time of 1:45.61.[183] About an hour later, Phelps returned to the pool to win the 200-meter butterfly.[184] But Phelps was not happy with his performance and called it the \"worst\" 200-meter butterfly of his life. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his 50th national title in 50.65.[185] After the race, Phelps said he was \"fairly pleased\" with the result.[186][187] In the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps finished second to Lochte 1:55.94 to 1:54.84.[188] It was the first time Lochte had beat Phelps in a major national meet.[189] In the 200-meter backstroke, Phelps finished in 4th place in 1:56.98.[190]\n\n\nOn the first day of competition at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, Phelps opted out swimming in the final of the 200-meter freestyle to focus on the 200-meter butterfly. In the 200-meter butterfly, Phelps led from start to finish, coming in first with a time of 1:54.11. Although it was much slower than his 1:51.51 time from the previous year, Phelps had not lost a 200-meter butterfly final since 2002.[191][192] On day two of the competition, Phelps swam in the heats of the 400-meter individual medley and contributed in the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay. In the heats of the 400-meter individual medley, Phelps failed to make the A final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American positions.[193] Phelps did not swim in the B final of the 400-meter individual medley. In the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Lochte, finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[194] On day three of the competition, Phelps competed in the 100-meter butterfly and contributed in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay. In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps finished first in a time of 50.86, a championship record.[195] In the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps, with Lochte, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian, finished first ahead of Australia and South Africa. As the lead-off leg in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay, Phelps set the championship record in the 100-meter freestyle with a time of 48.13.[196] In his final event, Phelps swam in the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay with Aaron Peirsol, Mark Gangloff, and Adrian and finished first ahead of Japan and Australia.[197]\n\n\n\n### 2011 World championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2011 World Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 50.71\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.34\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 7:02.67\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m medley  | 3:32.06\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  200 m freestyle  | 1:44.79\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.16\n |\n| ![Bronze medal \u2013 third place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m freestyle  | 3:11.96\n |\n\n\nIn his first event at the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai, Phelps won bronze in the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay with Garrett Weber-Gale, Jason Lezak, and Nathan Adrian.[198] This was Phelps's first bronze in a World Aquatics Championships. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 48.08, the second-best lead-off in the field behind James Magnussen's 47.49. In his second event, the 200-meter freestyle, Phelps won silver for the second consecutive time at a World Aquatics Championships. This time he finished second to Ryan Lochte in the event with a time of 1:44.79, compared to Lochte's time of 1:44.44.[199] In his third final, the 200-meter butterfly, he won his first gold medal with a time of 1:53.34 to become the first swimmer to win five gold medals in one discipline at the World Aquatics Championships.[200]\n\n\nIn his fourth event, the 200-meter individual medley, Phelps again finished second to Lochte in a personal best of 1:54.16, which was 0.16 behind Lochte who swam a new world record.[201] It was Phelps's 30th medal in the World Aquatics Championships. Shortly after completing the semi-finals of the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps competed in the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay with Peter Vanderkaay, Ricky Berens, and Ryan Lochte. Phelps's team won the gold medal in a time of 7:02.67. Phelps swam the lead-off leg in 1:45.53, the third-best leg in the field.[202] In the 100-meter butterfly, Phelps won his third consecutive title (also winning in 2007 and 2009) and second individual title of the meet with a time of 50.71.[203] In his last event, the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay, Phelps teamed with Nick Thoman, Mark Gangloff, and Nathan Adrian to win gold in a time of 3:32.06. Phelps's butterfly leg of 50.57 was by far the fastest butterfly leg in the field.[204]\n\n\n\n### 2012 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.21\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.27\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 6:59.70\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m medley  | 3:29.35\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.01\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m freestyle  | 3:10.38\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Phelps originally stated he would never do eight events again, and would instead try new events. Phelps said, \"I keep saying I want to go down and start sprinting, but Bob [Bowman, Phelps's coach] really isn't so keen on that ... I don't think that's going to happen ... Over the next four years, I'd like to try some different events, maybe not do some of the events I did here.\"[205][206] However, at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, the qualifying meet for the 2012 Summer Olympics, Phelps qualified in the same eight events that he swam in Beijing in 2008. He later dropped the 200-meter freestyle from his program, as he stated he wanted to focus on the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay.[207] During the trials, Phelps finished first in the 200-meter freestyle, 100-meter butterfly, 200-meter butterfly, 200-meter individual medley, and second in the 400-meter individual medley. In making his fourth Olympic team, Phelps holds the record for men for the most Olympic appearances in swimming representing the United States.[208]\n\n\n\n#### London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In his 100m butterfly heat, Phelps (fourth from top) was 8th at the 50m split before winning his heat and qualifying for the semi-finals\nOn July 28, 2012, Phelps placed eighth in the morning prelims for the 400-meter individual medley. Phelps, the two-time defending Olympic champion, won his heat in 4 minutes, 13.33 seconds with a time that was well off his world record of 4:03.84 set four years earlier in Beijing, when Phelps won a record eight gold medals. He out-touched L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Cseh by 0.07 seconds in his heat to qualify last for the final, locking out Cseh. In his first finals of the Summer Olympics, Phelps placed fourth behind fellow American Ryan Lochte, Thiago Pereira of Brazil, and Kosuke Hagino of Japan in the 400-meter individual medley. It was the first time Phelps failed to medal in an Olympic event since 2000.[209] The next night, in his second event of the Games, he got a silver as a member of the 4\u00d7100-meter free relay. Phelps swam the fastest leg of the US relay team and the second-fastest of anyone in the race.[210]\n\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Phelps won a silver medal in the 200-meter butterfly behind South African Chad le Clos by 5/100ths of a second, and a gold medal in the 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay, thereby equaling and then surpassing Larisa Latynina to become the all-time record holder for most Olympic medals won.[211][212] Latynina was present at the race and asked to be the presenter of Phelps's medal, but was told that Olympic rules would not allow it. She called Phelps deserving of the record.[213]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2012, Phelps won his 16th Olympic gold medal when he edged out Ryan Lochte to win the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 1:54.27, and by that victory also became the first male swimmer to win the same event in three consecutive Olympics.[214] Rebecca Soni and Phelps (twice) are the only swimmers to successfully defend an individual title from the 2008 Games.[215] This win also marked Phelps's fifth Olympic title in the individual medley, breaking the record of four shared by Hungarian Tam\u00e1s Darnyi and Ukrainian Yana Klochkova.\n\n\nHe repeated the achievement of winning the same event at three Olympics the following evening, winning the Olympic gold medal in the 100 m butterfly, his last individual event.[216] After two very close victories in the 100 m butterfly at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics (by 0.04 and 0.01 sec, respectively), in this race Phelps beat Le Clos and Yevgeny Korotyshkin, who tied for silver, by 0.23 sec.\n\n\nPhelps's final event was the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay in which he went on to win his 18th career gold medal and his 22nd overall. By winning 4 gold and 2 silver medals, Phelps concluded the 2012 Olympics as the most successful swimmer of the meet for the third Olympics in a row.[217][218]\nAfter his last event, the international swimming federation FINA honored Phelps with an award commemorating his standing as the most decorated Olympian ever.[219]\n\n\nAfter the 2012 Olympics, Phelps retired from swimming, stating: \"I'm done. I'm finished. I'm retired. I'm done. No more,\" and that \"I just wanted to be done with swimming and didn't want anything to do with the sport anymore.\"[220]\n\n\n\n### 2014 comeback from retirement[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2014 Pan Pacific Championships |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.29\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 7:05.17\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m medley  | 3:29.94 (CR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:56.04\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m freestyle  | 3:13.36\n |\n\n\nIn April 2014, Phelps announced he would come out of retirement, and would enter an event later that month.[221] In May 2014, he won the 100-meter butterfly event at the Arena Grand Prix in Charlotte, North Carolina.[222] Phelps was reportedly motivated by the national team's failure to win the men's 4 \u00d7 100 m freestyle relay since their Beijing 2008 and Rome 2009 titles.[223][224] The relationship between Phelps and coach Bob Bowman had deteriorated in the preparations for London 2012, so Phelps convinced a skeptical Bowman that he \"wasn't training for history. He wasn't training for the medals. He wasn't even training for all the fans. This time Phelps wanted to swim for himself...and enjoy the journey\".[224] Since his returning from retirement in 2014, Phelps \"scaled back his calorie intake\" and \"increased his postswim ice baths\". By the 2016 Olympic Trials, despite his age Phelps \"felt physically stronger in the water, perhaps because of drills Bowman added to his pool workouts, like multiple repeats of 40 seconds of dolphin kicking while hugging a 10-pound weight to his chest\".[225]\n\n\n\n### 2015 US Nationals[edit]\n\n\nAfter having been dropped from the team for the 2015 World Aquatics Championships for a DUI, Phelps instead competed in the US National Championships (long course) in San Antonio as his target meet of the summer. He won gold medals in the 100-meter butterfly (50.45 s),[226] 200-meter butterfly (1:52.94),[227] and the 200-meter individual medley (1:54.75).[228] In each of these events he swam the fastest time in the world for 2015.\n\n\nIn December 2015 at the Winter Nationals in Federal Way, Phelps won titles in the same three events, again in long course, bringing his career total to 62 national titles.[229]\n\n\n\n### 2016 Summer Olympics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2016 Summer Olympics |\n| --- |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m butterfly  | 1:53.36\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  200 m medley  | 1:54.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m freestyle  | 3:09.92\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7200 m freestyle  | 7:00.66\n |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  4\u00d7100 m medley  | 3:27.95 (OR)\n |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  100 m butterfly  | 51.14\n |\n\n\n#### Trials[edit]\n\n\nAt the US trials in Omaha for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Phelps won the 200 m butterfly (1:54.84), the 200 m individual medley (1:55.91), and the 100 m butterfly (51.00 s) events. This made him the first American male swimmer, and the second American swimmer overall after Dara Torres, to qualify for a fifth Olympics.[230] Phelps's 100 m freestyle times at the Trials were not impressive. However at a final training camp in Atlanta a week before heading to Rio, Phelps put out \"the fourth-fastest flat-start time of the year\" in a 100 free time trial, automatically securing one of the seven spots on the Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay for the Olympics.[231]\n\n\n\n#### Rio de Janeiro[edit]\n\n\nPhelps was chosen to be the American flag bearer at the opening ceremony, which was the first Olympic opening ceremony that he would attend.[232][233] Phelps was also voted by the U.S. Olympic swim team as one of six team captains for the US delegation to the Olympics.[234] He displayed a relaxed, sociable demeanor in the athletes' village and in press conferences; this pleasant behavior was in stark contrast to his isolation in previous Olympics.[224] He was accompanied by fianc\u00e9e Nicole Johnson and son Boomer.[235]\n\n\nIn his first event on August 7, the 4 \u00d7 100 m freestyle relay, he won his first gold medal of the 2016 Games and his 19th Olympic gold medal overall. Phelps swam the second leg with what his coach Bob Bowman described as \"maybe the best turn that's ever been done\",[236] overtaking France's Fabien Gilot to give his American teammates a lead which they would not relinquish.[237] Phelps's leg proved to be the decisive factor in the race, and Gilot later remarked \"As fast as my teammates were, the extraterrestrial that is Phelps was faster\".[231] Phelps achieved a split time of 47.12, the fourth-fastest of the field (the three fastest times were posted by the team anchors),[231] which was also faster than any of his relay splits at the last three Olympics.[238][239]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps carrying the flag on behalf of athletes from the United States during the parade of nation within the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\nIn his second event on August 9, the 200-meter butterfly, he became the first swimmer in history to make five finals in the same event, after finishing 5th in 2000, 1st in 2004 and 2008, and 2nd in 2012.[240] (Federica Pellegrini would be the second swimmer to do so at the 2020 Olympics.) At Rio, he won the title that he had lost to Chad le Clos four years earlier in London, edging Masato Sakai by 0.04 s. Phelps stated that winning back this title had been the main goal during his comeback.[241] The preliminary and final of that event was heavily hyped as a rematch between Phelps and Le Clos. The relationship between Le Clos and Phelps had been cordial back in 2012\u201313 but it deteriorated in 2014 when Phelps came back from retirement and suggested that the current butterfly times were slow.[242] In the ready room prior to the preliminary race, Le Clos's shadow boxing while Phelps \"glowered in a corner\" spawned the Internet meme with the hashtag #PhelpsFace.[243] At age 31, the victory made Phelps not only the oldest male champion,[244] but also the oldest individual champion in Olympic swimming history,[245] beating the records set by Duke Kahanamoku in 1920, and Inge de Bruijn in 2004 respectively. Phelps also became the first swimmer to win individual gold medals 12 years apart.[246] Both these records were broken by Anthony Ervin three days later.[247][248]\n\n\nAlso on August 9, Phelps won his 21st gold medal in the 4 \u00d7 200 m freestyle relay together with Conor Dwyer, Townley Haas, and Ryan Lochte.[249] For Phelps and Lochte, this was their 4th consecutive gold medal in this event,[250] an all-time record in swimming for any event.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Phelps with Nathan Adrian, Ryan Held and Caeleb Dressel, after winning the 4 \u00d7 100 m freestyle relay\nOn August 11, Phelps won his 22nd gold medal in the 200 m individual medley. He beat Kosuke Hagino, the 400 m individual medley champion, by 1.95 seconds. This was Phelps's 4th consecutive gold medal in the event as well as his 4th in the Games. He became the first swimmer to win the same individual event four times, surpassing the previous record of three held by Dawn Fraser and Krisztina Egerszegi.[251] He also became the third Olympian to win the same individual event four times, after athletes Al Oerter and Carl Lewis.[9][252] With that 13th individual gold medal, Phelps broke an ancient Olympic record, set by Leonidas of Rhodes, who had held the most Olympic individual titles of all time, with twelve.[244][253]\n\n\nIn the 100 m butterfly, Phelps was defeated in his last individual event of the Rio Olympics by Singaporean Joseph Schooling, when he earned joint silver along with Chad le Clos and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Cseh.[254][255]\n\n\nOn August 13, in the 4 \u00d7 100-meter medley relay, Phelps ended his career with another gold medal, his 23rd at the Olympics and his 28th Olympic medal overall. Together with Ryan Murphy, Cody Miller, and Nathan Adrian, swimming as the butterfly leg of the medley, they broke the Olympic record,[256] and won the United States' 1001st all time Olympic gold medal, in accordance with the USOC.[257][258][259] Phelps retired from competitive swimming again following the Rio Olympics.[260]\n\n\nPhelps's performance in the Rio Olympics was unique in \"winning multiple gold medals at 31 years old, well beyond the typical peak for male swimmers\". Phelps is considered one of the greatest Olympians of all time.[261][262][263]\n\n\n\n### International long-course competition results[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Meet\n | 100 free\n | 200 free\n | 400 free\n | 200 back\n | 100 fly\n | 200 fly\n | 200 IM\n | 400 IM\n | 4\u00d7100 free\n | 4\u00d7200 free\n | 4\u00d7100 medley\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| OG 2000 |  |  |  |  |  | 5th |  |  |  |  |  |\n| WC 2001 |  |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2002 |  |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2003 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| OG 2004 |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| WC 2005 | 7th | ![Gold](image) | 18th |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image)[a] |\n| PPC 2006 |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| WC 2007 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |\n| OG 2008 |  | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2009 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| PPC 2010 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | heats[b] | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2011 |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![3rd place, bronze medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| OG 2012 |  |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | 4th | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2013 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PPC 2014 | 4th |  |  |  | ![Gold](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n| WC 2015 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| OG 2016 |  |  |  |  | ![2nd place, silver medalist(s)](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |  | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) | ![Gold](image) |\n\n\n**a** Phelps swam only in the heats.

They secretly married on June 13, 2016, and the marriage was not publicly reported until four months later.[269] They met in 2007 at the ESPYs, broke up in 2008, later got back together but broke up again in 2010. In 2012 they started to reconcile and ultimately got engaged in February 2015.[270][271][272] They have three sons together.[273] The family lives in Paradise Valley, Arizona, where Phelps volunteers alongside Bowman as an assistant coach for the Arizona State Sun Devils swim team.[274]\n\n\nAs a teenager, Phelps idolized Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe and modeled his public image after Thorpe.[275] Thorpe initially said that it would be highly unlikely for Phelps to win eight gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.[276] Phelps used the remarks as motivation and taped the words to his locker during the Games.[277] Thorpe was in the stands for the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay, where Phelps was swimming for his eighth Olympic gold medal. When Phelps and his teammates captured the gold, Thorpe gave a congratulatory kiss to Phelps's mother, then gave a handshake and a hug to congratulate Phelps. Afterwards, Thorpe said \"I'm really proud of him not just because he won eight golds. Rather, it's how much he has grown up and matured into a great human being. Never in my life have I been so happy to have been proved wrong.\"[161][278]\n\n\nPhelps has also cited Michael Jordan as a sporting idol of his, and stated that \"he changed the sport of basketball\".[279] Phelps is also a fan of the Baltimore Ravens and stated that he found his life purpose and desire to compete in the 2016 Summer Olympics after seeking Ray Lewis's advice.[280][281]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Phelps revealed that he has struggled both with ADHD and depression, having contemplated suicide after the 2012 Olympics.[282][283]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nAt age 19 in November 2004, Phelps was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in Salisbury, Maryland.[284] He pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and was sentenced to serve 18 months of probation, fined $250, ordered to speak to high school students about drinking and driving, and to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) meeting.[285] When Phelps was later asked about the incident by Matt Lauer on the *Today Show*, he said that he had \"let a lot of people in the country down\".[18]\n\n\nIn February 2009, a photograph of Phelps using a bong went viral; this resulted in the loss of the Kellogg's as a sponsor, as well as a three-month suspension by USA Swimming. Phelps admitted that the photo, which was taken at a party at the University of South Carolina, was authentic. He publicly apologized, calling his behavior \"inappropriate\".[286]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Phelps was arrested again, this time on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol and speeding in Baltimore.[287] As a result, USA Swimming suspended him from all competitions for six months, and stated he would not be chosen to represent the United States at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships in August.[288] With Phelps off the team, the United States failed to qualify for the finals of the 4 \u00d7 100 m freestyle relay.[239]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nPhelps with *im* program participants (*left*), Phelps Foundation's *im* logo (*right*).\n\nAfter the 2008 Olympics, Phelps used his $1\u00a0million Speedo bonus to set up the Michael Phelps Foundation.[289][290][291] His foundation focuses on growing the sport of swimming and promoting healthier lifestyles.[292]\n\n\nIn 2010, the Michael Phelps Foundation, the Michael Phelps Swim School and KidsHealth.org developed and nationally piloted the \"im\" program for Boys & Girls Club members. The im program teaches children the importance of being active and healthy, with a focus on the sport of swimming. It also promotes the value of planning and goal-setting.[293] *im* is offered through the Boys & Girls Clubs of America[293] and through Special Olympics International.[294] The Foundation has since developed two other programs, Level Field Fund-Swimming and Caps-for-a-Cause.[295][296]\n\n\nThe Foundation's largest event is its annual fundraiser, the Michael Phelps Foundation Golf Classic.[297][298] Phelps stated he hoped to work with his Foundation more after retirement from competition following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.[299]\n\n\nIn 2017, Phelps joined the board of Medibio, a company focused on diagnosis of mental health disorders.[300]\n\n\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\nPhelps has set 39 world records (29 individual, 10 relay), which is more records than any other swimmer that is recognized by FINA; this achievement surpassed Mark Spitz's previous record of 33 world records (26 individual, 7 relay).[*citation needed*] However, Johnny Weissmuller is reported to have broken 67 official world records.[301]\n\n\nAll but two of the records were set in a long-course (50-meter) pool. As of July\u00a023, 2023[update], he holds world records in two events (indicated in **bold**), after his last standing individual world record in 400m IM was broken.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Distance\n | Event\n | Time\n | Location\n | Date\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly | 1:54.92\n | Austin, Texas, US\n | March 30, 2001 | [302] |\n| 2\n | 200 m\n | Butterfly (2)\n | 1:54.58\n | Fukuoka, Japan\n | July 24, 2001 | [302] |\n| 3\n | 400 m\n | Individual medley | 4:11.09\n | Ft.

artistic gymnast. Between 1956 and 1964 she won 14 individual Olympic medals and four team medals. She holds the record for the most Olympic gold medals by a gymnast, male or female, with 9. Her total of 18 Olympic medals was a record for 48 years. She held the record for individual event medals, winning 14 over 52 years. She is credited with helping to establish the Soviet Union as a dominant force in gymnastics.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nShe was born as **Larisa Semyonovna Diriy** in the Ukrainian SSR.[1] Her father, Semyon Andreyevich Diriy, left the family when she was 11 months old, and she was raised by her illiterate mother, who worked as a cleaner during the day, and as a watchman during the night. Her father was killed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where he served as a machine gun operator.[3] She first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of Kherson. She graduated from high school in 1953, and moved to Kyiv. She attended the Lenin Polytechnic Institute, and continued her training at the Burevestnik VSS. At the age of 19, she debuted internationally at the 1954 Rome World Championships, winning the gold medal in the team competition.\n\n\n\n## Gymnastics career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Latynina during the vault award ceremony at the 1964 Olympics\nIn 1956, at the age of 21, Latynina made her Olympic debut at the Melbourne Olympic Games. In the all-around event, she fought off stiff competition to win gold. She finished first in the vault, second in the uneven bars hand in the exercise on the floor and fourth in the balancing beam. She also led the Soviet Union in Team Event to victory.[4]\n\n\nAfter a very successful World Championships in 1958 (winning five out of six titles despite competing whilst four months pregnant and medaling in every event), Latynina was the favorite for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.[5] In the all-around event, she led the Soviet Union to take the first four places, thereby also securing a win in the team competition by a margin of nine points. Latynina defended her floor title, took silver medals in the balance beam and uneven bars events, and bronze in the vault competition.\n\n\nLatynina won all-around titles at the 1962 World Championships, beating V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 of Czechoslovakia. Still the defending World Champion at the 1964 Summer Olympics, she was beaten by \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 in the all-around competition. Latynina added two more gold medals to her tally, winning the team event and the floor event both for the third time in a row. A silver medal and two bronzes in the other apparatus events brought her total of Olympic medals to eighteen\u2014nine gold medals, five silver, and four bronze. She won a medal in every event in which she competed, except for the 1956 balance beam where she came in fourth.\n\n\nLatynina's nine gold medals make her second on the list of most Olympic gold medalists. She held the distinction of having more Olympic medals (either individually or with a team) than anybody, from 1964 until 2012. She is the only woman to have won nine gold medals.[6] She is also the only female athlete who at some point has held the record for most Olympic gold medals. Additionally, within the sport of gymnastics, she is the only woman who has won an all-around medal in more than two Olympiads, the only woman who has won an individual event (floor exercise) in more than two Olympiads, and one of only three women who have won every individual event at either the World Championship or Olympic level. She is the only female gymnast to have twice won team gold, all-around gold, and an event final gold at the same Olympics, having done so in 1956 and four years later, in 1960.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nShe was born to Pelageya Anisimovna Barabamyuk (1902\u20131975) and Semyon Andreevich Diriy (1906\u20131943), who died in the Battle of Stalingrad. Larisa was married three times.[7] Her current husband is Yuri Izrailovich Feldman (b. 1938), a member of the Russian Academy of Electrotechnical Sciences and a former competitive cyclist. Her daughter from a former marriage, Tatyana Ivanovna Latynina (b. 1958), is a folk dancer. She was born only five months after her mother won a world all-around title, and seven months after her birth Latynina competed at the national championships. Latynina kept her pregnancy a secret, even from her coach. She also had a son.[1][7][8]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nLatynina retired after the 1966 World Championships and became a coach for the Soviet national gymnastics team, a position she held until 1977.[8] Under her coaching the Soviet women team won gold in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics.[5] She organized the gymnastics competition at the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nShe holds Russian citizenship and lives in Moscow. Latynina has received numerous Soviet and Russian state accolades.[9]\n\n\nIn 2023, she spoke out against Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag at the Olympics due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, calling it \"unpatriotic\".[10]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n1989: Olympic Order (silver), International Olympic Committee  \n\n1998: Inducted into the International

She specialized in the 200 meters from 2003 to 2013, then gradually shifted to the 400 meters later in her career.[2] At 200 meters, Felix is the 2012 Olympic champion, a three-time world champion (2005\u20132009), a two-time Olympic silver medalist (2004 and 2008), and the 2011 world bronze medalist. At 400 meters, she is the 2015 world champion, 2011 world silver medalist, 2016 Olympic silver medalist, 2017 world bronze medalist, and 2020 Olympic bronze medalist. Across the short distances, Felix is a ten-time U.S. national champion (2004, 2005, 2007\u20132012, 2015 and 2016).\n\n\nFelix played a key role on the United States women's relay teams, winning six additional Olympic gold medals: four consecutive medals at 4 \u00d7 400 meters (2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020) and two at 4 \u00d7 100 meters (2012 and 2016). The 2012 and 2016 U.S. Olympic 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m teams set a world record of 40.82\u00a0s and the second fastest time of 41.01\u00a0s, respectively. With these six golds from relays and one from an individual event, Felix became the first female track and field athlete to ever win seven Olympic gold medals.[3] She is also the most decorated woman in Olympic track and field history and the most decorated American track and field athlete in Olympic history, having earned 11 total medals from five consecutive Olympic Games.[4] Felix is the most decorated athlete, male or female, in World Athletics Championships history with 20 career medals, 7 from individual events and 13 from team relays.[5] With a combined Olympic and World Championship total of 31 medals, she is also the overall most decorated athlete in track and field history, with 12 medals from individual events and 19 from relays. Felix was the first athlete in track and field history to medal in 3 different relays, 4 \u00d7 100\u00a0m, 4 \u00d7 400\u00a0m and mixed 4 \u00d7 400\u00a0m. \n\n\nAmong Felix's notable performances, her 200 meters personal best of 21.69 seconds, which was set at the 2012 U.S. Olympic trials, ranked at the time as the third-fastest time ever run by an American woman and sixth-fastest time by a female athlete in history.[6][7] She also ran a 47.72-second leg on the U.S. women's 4 \u00d7 400\u00a0m relay team at the 2015 Beijing World Championships, recording the fastest split ever by an American woman, and third-fastest split ever by a female athlete.[8]\n\n\nFelix, along with Alysia Monta\u00f1o and Kara Goucher, is credited with stirring public outcry over Nike's refusal to guarantee salary protections for its pregnant athletes, prompting the sportswear brand to expand its maternity policy in 2019.[9] Two years after her departure from Nike, the athlete turned entrepreneur launched her own footwear company, Saysh, in June 2021.[10]\n\n\nShe was included in *Time* magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2020 and 2021.[11][12] In 2022, Felix received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from her alma mater USC and also served as the commencement speaker for that year's graduation ceremony.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAllyson Felix was born on November 18, 1985, in Los Angeles, California.[2] She is the daughter of Paul, an ordained minister and professor of New Testament at The Master's Seminary in Sun Valley, California,[14] and Marlean, an elementary school teacher at Balboa Magnet Elementary. Her elder brother Wes Felix was also a sprinter, winning the 2002 USA Junior Championships in the 200 meters race[15] and later, the Pac-10 championships in 2003 and 2004 as a collegiate athlete for USC. Wes now acts as the agent for his sister.[16] Felix describes her running ability as a gift from God: \"For me, my faith is the reason I run. I definitely feel I have this amazing gift that God has blessed me with, and it's all about using it to the best of my ability.\"[17]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nAllyson Felix attended Los Angeles Baptist High School in North Hills, California, where she was nicknamed \"Chicken Legs\" by her teammates, because the five-foot-six, 125-pound sprinter's body had skinny legs despite her strength. Her slightness belied her speed on the track and strength in the gym, as she could deadlift at least 270 pounds while still in high school.[18] Felix credits much of her early success to her high school sprint coach, Jonathan Patton.\n\n\nFelix began to discover her athletic talents after she tried out for track in the ninth grade. Just ten weeks after that first tryout, she finished seventh in the 200 meters at the CIF California State Meet. In the coming seasons, she became a five-time winner at the meet.[19][16] In 2001, at the Debrecan World Youth Championships, Felix achieved her first international title in the 100 meters.[20] In 2003, she was named the national girls' \"High School Athlete of the Year\" by *Track and Field News*.[21] As a senior, Felix finished second in the 200 meters at the US Indoor Track & Field Championships. A few months later, in front of 50,000 fans in Mexico City, she ran 22.11 seconds, the fastest in history for a high school girl, though it could not count as a world junior record because there was no drug testing at the meet.[22][23]\n\n\nFelix graduated high school in 2003, making headlines by forgoing college eligibility to sign a professional contract with Adidas via her agent Nik Visger. Adidas paid her an undisclosed sum and picked up her college tuition at the University of Southern California.[24] She graduated with a degree in elementary education.[25]\n\n\n\n## Professional[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Felix celebrating her victory at the 2007 Osaka World Championships.\nAt the 2003 U.S. national championships, the seventeen-year-old phenomenon finished second in the 200 meters sprint with a time of 22.59 seconds, earning her spot to the 2003 Paris World Championships. In the quarter-finals of the 200 meters in Paris, Felix finished sixth in 23.33 seconds.\n\n\nAt the age of 18, Felix earned an Olympic silver medal in the 200 meters at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, behind Veronica Campbell of Jamaica; in doing so, she set a world junior record over 200 meters with her time of 22.18 seconds. After leaving Athens, Felix and her coach Pat Connolly, who also guided the 1984 Olympic 100 meters champion Evelyn Ashford, parted ways as Connolly moved back to Virginia and Felix cited difficulties training alone.[23][26] The young sprinter then sought the tutelage of controversial[27][28] sprint coach Bob Kersee, whom she would train under for the next 18 years.[23][29]\n\n\nNineteen-year-old Felix became the youngest world champion ever in the 200 meters at the 2005 Helsinki World Championships and then successfully defended her world title in Osaka two years later.[30] At the 2007 Osaka World Championships, Felix caught Jamaican rival, Veronica Campbell, on the bend and surged down the straightaway to finish in 21.81 seconds, dipping under the 22-second barrier for the first time in her career. After the final, Felix stated in the post-race interview: \"I feel so good. I am so excited. I have been waiting for so long to run such a time, to run under 22 seconds. It has not been an easy road, but finally, I managed.\" At that time, she addressed her future, saying, \"My next goal is not the world record, but gold in Beijing. I want to take it step-by-step. I might consider doing both \u2013 the 200 and the 400 meters \u2013 there.\" Days later, after partaking in the winning U.S. 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay and also the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay, in which she unofficially split 48.01 seconds on the second leg, Felix became only the second female athlete, after Marita Koch in 1983, to win three gold medals at a single IAAF World Championships in Athletics.[8][31]\n\n\n\n### 2008\u201309[edit]\n\n\nFelix qualified for the 2008 Summer Olympics at the 2008 Olympic trials by winning the 200 meters sprint in 21.82 seconds, but narrowly missed qualifying for the 100 meters sprint. In the Olympic 200 meter final, despite running her season's best time in the 200 meters at 21.93 seconds, she again finished second to Campbell, who ran 21.74 seconds, the best time of the decade, to win the gold medal.[32] Felix avenged her disappointing loss by regaining the lead for the U.S. women's 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay team during her 48.55-second leg, allowing Team USA to eventually win and earning her first Olympic gold medal.[33][34][8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Felix during the 200 meters final at the 2009 Berlin World Championships\nIn the build-up to the 2009 World Championships in Athletics, Felix was part of a U.S. 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay team that ran the fastest women's sprint relay in twelve years. Lauryn Williams, Felix, Muna Lee and Carmelita Jeter finished with a time of 41.58\u00a0seconds, bringing them to eighth on the all-time list.[35] In 2009, at merely 23 years old, Felix proceeded to claim her third 200-meter world championship gold medal, an unprecedented accomplishment in women's sprinting.[36] Felix clocked 22.02 sec to comfortably beat Jamaica's Olympic 200-meter champion Veronica Campbell-Brown.\n\n\nAfterwards she said, \"It's really special to win a third world title. I wanted to do it in this stadium, represent my country and make Jesse Owens proud.\" But Felix admitted that she would rather have the one gold medal that she was missing. \"I would love to trade my three world championships for your gold,\" Felix jokingly said to Veronica Campbell-Brown of Jamaica at the medalists' news conference, referring to the 2008 Olympic gold medal in the 200 meters, a race Felix was heavily favored to win. Still distressed over finishing second to Campbell-Brown in Beijing, Felix stated: \"I don't think I ever want to get over it. I never want to be satisfied with losing.\" At the same time, she also commented, \"I'm just grateful to have had success quickly, and sometimes I do have to pinch myself and realize all this has happened in not that much time.\" Felix later claimed another gold medal by running a 48.75-second leg on Team USA's victorious 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay team.[8]\n\n\n\n### 2010\u201311[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Felix and Montsho at the finish line in 2011 Daegu World ChampionshipsIn 2010, Felix focused on running more 400-meter races. Running the 200 meters and the 400 meters, she became the first person ever to win two IAAF Diamond League trophies in the same year. She continued her dominance by winning 21 out of 22 races, only losing to Veronica Campbell-Brown in New York. Felix also became the U.S. 100 meters champion by winning the sprint in 11.27 seconds against a strong \u22122.5\u00a0m/s headwind.[37]\n\n\nAt the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, Felix ran in the 200 and 400 meters, as well as the 4 \u00d7 100 and 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay races. In the 400-meter event, Felix's best efforts yielded only a second-place finish despite straining down the homestretch to a personal best of 49.59 seconds, 0.03 behind winner Amantle Montsho of Botswana. Montsho later tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexaneamine in 2014.[38] In the 200-meter final, Felix finished third in a subpar time of 22.42 seconds due to fatigue. Veronica Campbell-Brown won the gold and Carmelita Jeter won silver. In the relay events, Felix ran the second leg in both the 4 \u00d7 100 meters and 4 \u00d7 400 meters. Team USA won both events, attaining world-leading times in both finals as Felix added two world championship gold medals to her collection. The 25-year-old American sprinter was the only athlete to leave Daegu with four medals.[39]\n\n\n\n### 2012\u201313[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Felix returned to the Olympic trials, choosing to race the 100 meters in addition to her main event, the 200 meters. The top three finishers in each event qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics team. In the 100 meters final, she ran 11.07 seconds, placing third, but not without controversy.[40] Officials ruled that training partners Felix and Jeneba Tarmoh were in a dead heat for third place, the final qualification position, after initially declaring Tarmoh ahead. A run-off between Tarmoh and Felix was scheduled, but Tarmoh eventually withdrew due to emotional and physical fatigue, conceding the final 100-meter spot to Felix.[41][42] In the 200 meters final at the 2012 Olympic trials, Felix recorded a personal best and a meet record of 21.69 seconds, the third-fastest time an American woman had ever run and the fourth-fastest ever clocked by a female athlete, up until that point.[43] Carmelita Jeter and Sanya Richards-Ross placed second and third, respectively. \n\n![](image)Felix running second leg on the U.S. 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay team at the 2012 London Olympics\nAt the 2012 Summer Olympics, Felix competed in four events: 100 meters, 200 meters, 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay, and 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay, placing fifth in the 100 meters and winning gold in the other three, thus becoming the first American woman to win three golds in athletics at an Olympics since Florence Griffith-Joyner at the 1988 Summer Olympics.[44] In her first final, the 100 meters final, she placed fifth with a personal best of 10.89 seconds. The 200 meters final, a race she lost twice at the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics to Jamaican rival, Veronica Campbell-Brown, proved to be her successful third attempt as she won in 21.88 seconds, outracing a stacked field that included Campbell-Brown, 2012 Olympic 100 meters champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, 2012 Olympic 100 meters silver medalist Carmelita Jeter, and 2012 Olympic 400 meters champion Sanya Richards-Ross. Felix pushed out of the blocks with a strong start and was on par with the Jamaican athletes coming off of the curve before pulling away in the final 50 meters to clinch her long-awaited individual Olympic gold medal.[45] Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce won silver and American compatriot Carmelita Jeter took the bronze medal.\n\n\nFelix took to the track again as part of the women's 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay team alongside Tianna Madison, Bianca Knight, and Carmelita Jeter. The foursome won with a time of 40.82 seconds, breaking the long-held world record of 41.37 seconds, set by East Germany in October 1985. On the final night of Olympic athletics, Felix ran a 48.2-second leg on the U.S. women's 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay team that included DeeDee Trotter, Francena McCorory, and Sanya Richards-Ross, winning in a time of 3:16.87, the third-fastest time in Olympic history behind the Soviet Union and the United States at the 1988 Summer Olympics, and the fifth-fastest time overall, up until that point.[8]\n\n\nIn the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, Felix entered in the 200 meters and was expected to also appear in the relays, but succumbed to a hamstring injury in the 200 meters final and was carried off the track by her brother. The race was won by Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce.[46]\n\n\n\n### 2014\u201315[edit]\n\n\nAfter a nine-month layoff due to a hamstring injury, Felix resumed competition in the 400 meters at the Shanghai Diamond League meet in May 2014, in which she finished fifth with a time of 50.81 seconds. She later competed in the 200 meters at the Prefontaine Classic meet, finishing third with a season's best of 22.44 seconds.\n\n![](image)Felix after her victory at the 2015 World Championships.\nAs the winner of the 2014 IAAF Diamond League 200-meter title, Felix received a bye into the 2015 World Championships in Athletics. Obligated to participate in the 2015 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships but not required to run the 200 meters, she opted for the 400 meters. Felix won the event in 50.19 seconds with a late surge from fourth place at the 300-meter mark, catching Natasha Hastings right before the finish line to earn her ninth U.S. championship title.[47] World number one ranked Francena McCorory and number two Sanya Richards-Ross failed to qualify for the 2015 Beijing World Championships.\n\n\nThe 2015 Beijing World Championships schedule placed the 400-meter final just over an hour after the 200-meter semi-finals, making it virtually impossible to perform to world championship level in both events.[48] As of July 1, Felix held the fastest seed time in both the 400 (0.11 over the fastest competitor) and 200 (0.22 over the fastest competitor), leaving her with a difficult choice as to which event to put her full effort into. Felix eventually chose the 400 meters and later triumphed in the event final with a personal best of 49.26 seconds. She dominated the race from beginning to end, making up the stagger from the start of the gun and never relinquishing her lead to claim the 400 meters title.[49] In doing so, Felix became the first woman to win world titles in the 200 meters and the 400 meters. Additionally, she has now won the most world championship gold medals, and most overall world championship medals, out of any American track and field athlete.[50] She continued to add to her medal collection by earning silver medals in both the 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay and 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay. In the latter race, Felix received the baton with a significant deficit to the leading Jamaican team, prompting her to sprint a historic split time of 47.72 seconds to regain the lead for the American women before the final handoff. This was the fastest 4 \u00d7 400 meters split ever recorded by an American woman and third-fastest 4 \u00d7 400 meters split ever by any female athlete, after Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 and Marita Koch.[8] Running the final leg, Francena McCorory failed to hold onto the lead and was overtaken by Novlene Williams-Mills in the final meters.[51]\n\n\n\n### 2016\u201317[edit]\n\n\nFelix began her 2016 season with an uncharacteristically slow start after a gym accident in April, when she dropped from a pull-up bar and landed awkwardly, twisting her right ankle and tearing multiple ligaments.[52] Felix was slated to run in a Diamond League meet in Doha as well as the Prefontaine Classic, but pulled out of both meets.[53] In early June, she ran the 400 meters in 51.23 seconds at a low-key San Diego meet.[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)Felix at 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials\nStill dealing with the physical repercussions from the accident, Felix raced the 200 meters and 400 meters anyway at the 2016 Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon, attempting to fulfill her goal of completing a 200\u2013400 meters double victory at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. In the 400 meters trials final, she surged from the middle of the pack down the homestretch and overtook the field in the final meters, recording a world-leading time of 49.68 seconds. Then, in the 200 meters final, the lack of speed work due to injury eventually caught up with her as she was narrowly edged out by Jenna Prandini, who dove across the finish line to secure the third and final spot on the team, beating Felix by 0.01 seconds (22.53 to 22.54 seconds).[54] Felix took the rest of July and early part of August off to give her ankle more time to heal while she continued preparations for the Olympics.\n\n\nAt the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, Felix bumped her overall Olympic haul to nine overall medals: six golds and three silvers, tying Jamaican legend Merlene Ottey's record for the most Olympic medals won by a female track and field athlete, although most of Ottey's medal collection consists of individual medals.[55] Felix's hope of winning the 400 meters Olympic gold medal came up short after she lost by 0.07 to Shaunae Miller of the Bahamas, who made a legal but unusual dive across the finish line as Felix was quickly closing the distance.[56] Felix recovered from the disappointing performance to win two golds with the U.S. 4 \u00d7 100 meters and 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay teams. The 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay win drew much controversy, as Team USA was initially disqualified in their semi-final run after Felix had dropped the baton during the handoff attempt to English Gardner. However, replays showed that the Brazilian sprinter in the neighboring lane swung her arm and accidentally impeded Felix right before the handoff, causing her to lose her balance.[57] After the appeal was accepted, Team USA was awarded a solo run the next day.[58] With a successful time trial, Felix and her teammates advanced to the final, where they won in 41.01 seconds, the second-fastest 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay time in history.[59]\n\n\nThe following year, during the 2017 World Championships in London, Felix added three more medals to her collection, cementing her position as the most decorated athlete in IAAF World Championships history. Felix equaled Merlene Ottey's and Usain Bolt's 14 medal tally by winning a bronze medal in the 400-meter final with a time of 50.08 seconds. She admitted that the result was disappointing, as she was hoping to defend her title in the discipline.[60] Just a month prior to the championships, Felix had won the London's Diamond League meet held at the same track with a world-leading time of 49.65 seconds.[61] Felix earned two additional gold medals by partaking in the 4 \u00d7 100 relay and also the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay, in which she ran a 48.7-second leg, bringing her tally up to 16 world championship medals.[62][63][8]\n\n\n\n### 2018\u201319[edit]\n\n\n#### Pregnancy emergency[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Felix at a 2019 U.S. House hearing\nFelix reduced her racing schedule in 2018, stating: \"In the 19 years that I've been running track, I've never taken a break. Never had a year where I took it easy. Now that this is kind of a year without a championship, I've had to force myself to have a different approach because my goal is 2020. So, if you guys don't see me at as many of the races as I usually run, don't worry. I'm fine. I'm just challenging myself to be smarter.\"[64] Later in December 2018, Felix revealed her difficult pregnancy story to espnW.[65] During her 32nd-week pregnancy checkup, doctors discovered that Felix had developed pre-eclampsia, a condition that is disproportionately prevalent in African-American women and is marked by high blood pressure along with potentially harmful childbirth effects.[66] With the baby's heart rate steadily decreasing, Felix had to deliver her premature daughter via emergency C-section within 48 hours. Motivated by her life-threatening experience, Felix testified before the United States House Committee on Ways and Means on the topic of the black maternal mortality crisis: \"Research shows that racial bias in our maternal health care system includes things like providers spending less time with Black mothers, underestimating the pain of their Black patients, ignoring symptoms and dismissing complaints.\"[66]\n\n\n\n#### Nike controversy[edit]\n\n\nThe new mom furthered her maternal advocacy work in May 2019 by penning an op-ed for *The New York Times*, accusing her longtime sponsor Nike of refusing to guarantee salary protections for female athletes in the months following pregnancy.[67] Her story underscored the earlier allegations made by her former Nike teammates Alysia Monta\u00f1o and Kara Goucher regarding their pregnancy disputes with the sportswear company.[68] In the article, Felix explained that after her contract ended in December 2017, she and Nike negotiated for a contract renewal. Planning to start a family in 2018, Felix asked Nike for written financial security, in case her performance yielded subpar results while recovering from childbirth; the negotiators declined after already offering a 70 percent pay cut in this contract proposal.[67] Soon after, Felix left and signed a clothing sponsorship deal with the Gap Inc.\u2013owned apparel company Athleta in July 2019, becoming their first sponsored athlete.[69] Following the public controversy, Nike altered their maternal policy in August 2019, promising to not apply any performance-related salary reductions for 18 consecutive months, starting eight months before the due date. During this period, the sportswear company would also not float the possibility of termination if the athlete chooses to not race due to pregnancy.[9]\n\n\n\n#### Return to competition[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2019, Felix competed in her first race since giving birth in November 2018, finishing sixth in the 400-meter sprint at the U.S. national championships in Des Moines, Iowa. Although failing to qualify into the individual 400-meter event for the 2019 Doha World Championships, Felix's sixth-place finish still placed her in the U.S. 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay pool. In the first-ever mixed-gender 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay at the world championships, Felix competed with Michael Cherry, Wil London III, and Courtney Okolo to set a world record time of 3:09.34. Felix ran a 50.4-second split for her leg.[70] She earned another gold medal as a runner in the preliminary heats for the U.S. women's 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay, although she was not selected to participate in the final. With her 12th and 13th world championship gold medals, Felix surpassed Usain Bolt for the most golds by any athlete in World Athletics Championships history.[71]\n\n\n\n### 2020\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nFelix trained during the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of qualifying for her fifth Olympic Games \u2013 her first as a mom. She completed workouts on streets, empty soccer fields, and beaches when quarantine measures were first enacted in March 2020.[72] A former participant in the US Anti-Doping Agency's \"Project Believe\" program in 2008, she volunteered again for \"Project Believe 2020\" to help test an unprecedented sample collection procedure for athletes during the coronavirus stay-at-home orders.[73][74]\n\n\nIn June 2021, two years after she publicized her contract dispute with Nike, Felix launched her own footwear company, Saysh, and began wearing spikes created by the brand into competitions.[10] Within the same month, at the U.S. Olympic trials, the 35-year-old American qualified for the 400 meters individual event by finishing second with a time of 50.02 seconds, a new masters athletics record (35\u201340 age group) and also her fastest time since July 2017.[75]\n\n\nLeading up to the 400 meters final of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, some doubted that the track veteran would stand on the podium again for her final individual Olympic event due to her age, U.S Olympics trials performance, and semi-final time.[76][77] Every finalist in the 400 meters final ran sub-50 seconds in their semi-final, with Felix running the second-slowest qualifying time of 49.89 seconds.[78] Despite the odds, Felix ran 49.46 seconds in the final to claim the bronze medal, her 10th overall Olympic medal.[76] This accomplishment lowered her 400-meter masters athletics record, tied her with Carl Lewis as the most decorated American track and field Olympian, and broke her tie with Merlene Ottey as the most decorated female track and field Olympian.[79] Felix concluded her Olympic career after winning gold in the women's 4 \u00d7 400 meters final, alongside a team that included Sydney McLaughlin, Dalilah Muhammad, and Athing Mu. This 11th Olympic medal broke Felix's tie with Carl Lewis and officially established her as the most decorated American track and field athlete in Olympic history.[80]\n\n\nFelix has announced that she intends to retire before the 2024 Olympics in Paris.[81]\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nAllyson Felix is a five-time recipient of the Jesse Owens/Jackie Joyner Kersee Award, an accolade given by USA Track & Field to commend the chosen athlete of the year. She won the award for the first time in 2005, and then again in 2007, 2010, 2012 and 2015.[82][83][84] After her success at the 2012 London Olympics, Felix received the 2012 IAAF Female World Athlete of the Year award. In 2022, Felix received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[85]\n\n\n\n### Personal bests[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Event\n | Time (seconds)\n | Venue\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 60\u00a0meters | 7.10\n | Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States\n | February 12, 2012\n |\n| 100\u00a0meters | 10.89\n | London, United Kingdom\n | August 4, 2012\n |\n| 150\u00a0meters | 16.28\n | Osaka, Japan\n | August 31, 2007\n |\n| 200\u00a0meters | 21.69\n | Eugene, United States\n | June 30, 2012\n |\n| 300\u00a0meters | 36.33\n | Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States\n | February 9, 2007\n |\n| 400\u00a0meters | 49.26\n | Beijing, China | August 27, 2015[86] |\n\n\n* At the 2012 Summer Olympics Felix ran the second leg of the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay in a time of 48.2 seconds.\n* At the 2015 World Championships Felix ran the third leg of the 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay in a time of 47.72 seconds, which is the fastest 4 \u00d7 400 meters split ever by an American woman and third-fastest 4 \u00d7 400 meters split ever by any female athlete, after Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 and Marita Koch.[8]\n\n\n### National titles[edit]\n\n\n* Six-time national 200 meters champion \u2013 2004 (22.28), 2005 (22.13), 2007 (22.34), 2008 (21.82), 2009 (22.02), 2012 (21.69)\n* Three-time national 400 meters champion \u2013 2011 (50.40), 2015 (50.05), 2016 (49.68)\n* U.S. national 100 meters champion \u2013 2010 (11.27 with \u22122.5\u00a0m/s headwind)\n\n\nNotes: The 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 U.S. championships double as the U.S. Olympic track and field trials.

Active Schools\" event hosted by First Lady Michelle Obama.[93][94][95]\n\n\nIn November 2014, Felix traveled to Brazil as a Sports Diplomacy Sports Envoy for the U.S. Department of State. In this function, she worked with Josh George to conduct clinics, speeches and other events for 510 youth, many of whom had disabilities or came from marginalized communities. The program was designed to remove barriers and create activities that benefit audiences with and without disabilities, whilst speaking with a young, at-risk public about important life and sports values, such as respect, discipline and overcoming adversity.[96]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nShe is married to American sprinter and hurdler Kenneth Ferguson. They have a daughter, Camryn, born in 2018.[97][98] Felix is a Christian.[99]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of multiple Olympic gold medalists in one event\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Athlete Bio: Allyson Felix\". *USA Track & Field*.
