The university is affiliated with the Ministry of Education, and is co-sponsored by the ministry and Shanghai City. The university is part of Project 985, Project 211, and the Double First Class University Plan.\n\n\nFudan has five undergraduate colleges \u2013 Zhide (\u5fd7\u5fb7), Tengfei (\u817e\u98de), Keqing (\u514b\u537f), Renzhong (\u4efb\u91cd), and Xide (\u5e0c\u5fb7). The university has four campuses in Shanghai \u2013 Handan (\u90af\u90f8), Fenglin (\u67ab\u6797), Zhangjiang (\u5f20\u6c5f), and Jiangwan (\u6c5f\u6e7e) \u2013 which share the same central administration. It also has 17 affiliated hospitals. The university is a member of the C9 League.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFudan University, then romanized as **Fuh Tan**, was founded as Fudan Public School in 1905, by Ma Xiangbo, SJ, who had resigned from Aurora University. The two Chinese characters *Fu* (\u5fa9, means \"again\") and *Dan* (\u65e6, means \"morning\", \"light\" ), meaning both \"(heavenly light shines) day after day\" and \"Aurora Revived\", were chosen by Ma on the recommendation of Yu You-jen, from the Confucian Classic *Shangshu Dazhuan* (Chinese: \u5c19\u66f8\u5927\u50b3): \"Itinerant as the twilight, sun glows and moon luminesces\" (Chinese: \u65e5\u6708\u5149\u83ef\uff0c\u65e6\u5fa9\u65e6\u516e). The university motto \"Scientia et studium, quaestio et cogitatio\" comes from Analects Book 19.6 (Chinese: \u535a\u5b78\u800c\u7be4\u5fd7\uff0c\u5207\u554f\u800c\u8fd1\u601d), which means \"rich in knowledge and tenacious of purposes, inquiring with earnestness and reflecting with self-practice\".\n\n\nIn 1911, during the Xinhai Revolution, the college was occupied as headquarters of the Guangfu Army and closed down for almost one year.[4]\n\n\nIn 1917, Fudan Public School became a private university named the Private Fudan University, and also had a middle school and university-preparatory school. In 1929, Fudan reorganized its departments, expanding to include departments of journalism, municipals[*clarification needed*], law, and education.[4]\n\n\nAfter the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, Fudan moved with the Kuomintang government to the inland city of Chongqing, the wartime Chinese capital. On December 25, 1941, the First Meeting of Fifth Conference of the Highest Executive Authority of the National Government of the Republic of China voted to change Fudan University (Chongqing) to a public university with Wu Nanxuan as its president. Fudan University then became National Fudan University. After the end of World War II, it moved back to Shanghai.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 1949 - present[edit]\n\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Fudan lost its \"National\" appellation and became Fudan University to reflect the fact that all universities under the new socialist state would be public. Fudan was the first university to be reorganized by the new government in 1952 and modeled on Soviet education. The original departments were changed, with arts and sciences departments from at least ten other universities in eastern China being added.[*citation needed*] Parts of Aurora University merged into Fudan in 1952.\n\n\nIn the late 1970s, after the Cultural Revolution, the university was converted to a modern, comprehensive[*clarification needed*] university.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFudan University and Shanghai Medical University merged in 2000.[5]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Institutions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Fudan has been placed consistently among the three most selective universities (with Tsinghua University and Peking University) in China for the last twenty years.[30][31][32][33] Fudan is one of the four universities (together with Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in China whose undergraduate programs are the hardest for students to get in: less than 0.2% of National College Entrance Examination (\"Gaokao\") takers can make it. (As a comparison, the five most selective Ivy League schools in 2012 let in three times the percentage (0.6%) of SAT-takers.)[34]\n\n\n\n### Undergraduate program[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduation souvenir T-shirt, Class of 2005. Students from each department (or school) design their own souvenir T-shirts when they graduate.\nFudan has reconstructed its course system to suit education goals. A course scheme of general education, specialized education and basic education in arts and sciences has been implemented. Encompassing a complete and comprehensive range of disciplines, the courses of general education enable students to receive education in diverse fields. All of the 70-plus undergraduate majors of Fudan have been put into seven general categories so that students can benefit on a broader scale from the systematic discipline training. According to the Education Scheme for Arts and Sciences, course modules are determined by discipline systems and course suits, and credits by course modules. In this sense, Fudan provides students with more options for their college studies. In contrast with the traditional syllabus, the new module has appropriately decreased the gross credits and class hours. Along with minor programs and extracurricular academic activities, it contributes greatly to the intellectual development of undergraduate students, exposing them to a wider range of knowledge.\n\n\n\n### Graduate program[edit]\n\n\nThe Graduate School of Fudan University was established on 6 November 1984 and the Graduate School of Shanghai Medical University on 25 January 1985. Both were among the first 22 graduate schools after China's universities officially resumed enrolling graduate students. With the merger of Shanghai Medical University and Fudan University in April 2000, the two graduate schools were joined to be a new Graduate School of Fudan University. Therefore, a comprehensive graduate education structure is formed with disciplines in humanities, law, sciences, engineering, medicine, and management.\n\n\n\n### International students[edit]\n\n\nStarting from the 1950s, Fudan has enrolled international students \u2013 one of the first few institutions in China to do so. Since then, Fudan has accepted and trained over 10,000 foreign students from 100 countries and regions worldwide. The international student programs consist of degree programs and non-degree programs.[35]\n\n\nFudan University has an International Student's Dormitory at its Handan and Fenglin campuses.[36] These dormitories are reserved as living quarters for students from countries other than China studying in either degree or non-degree programs.\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

In July 2014, the campus began a 2-year large-scale construction project. About 4000 students move out of the old campus for the construction and in July 2017 students came back to it.\n\n\n\n### Zhangjiang campus[edit]\n\n\nZhangjiang campus is located in Shanghai's Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park, Pudong District. It comprises the School of Microelectronics, the School of Computer science and technology, the School of Software, and the School of Pharmacy.\n\n\n\n### Jiangwan campus[edit]\n\n\nOnly 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) apart from Handan campus, Jiangwan campus is a new campus of Fudan University. The School of Law has moved to Jiangwan, and other schools will follow, including the School of Life Science, the College of Foreign Language and Literature, and School of Social Development and Public Policy.\n\n\n\n## Student associations[edit]\n\n\nThere are four categories of student associations: Academic Societies, Practical Societies, Artistic Societies, and Physical Culture Societies. See also Student Associations at Fudan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Fudan University people\n\nSince 1952, Fudan University has a total of 95 academicians alumni, second only to Peking University and Tsinghua University in China.[37] Fudan's notable alumni include Chen Yinke, Chen Wangdao, Chu Coching, Yan Fu, Yu Youren, Chen Zhili, and \"China's Kissinger\" Wang Huning.[38][39]\n\n\n\n## Partnerships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.
