The company owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services.[20] Meta is one of the world's most valuable companies and among the ten largest publicly traded corporations in the United States.[21] It is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Google's parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n\n\nIn addition to Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, Meta has also acquired Oculus (which it has integrated into Reality Labs), Mapillary, CTRL-Labs, and a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms; the company additionally endeavored into non-VR hardware, such as the discontinued Meta Portal smart displays line and presently partners with Luxottica through the Ray-Ban Stories series of smart glasses.[22][23] Despite endeavors into hardware, the company still relies on advertising for a vast majority of its revenue, which in 2022 made up 97.5 percent of its revenue.[12]\n\n\nOn October 28, 2021, the parent company of Facebook changed its name from Facebook, Inc., to Meta Platforms, Inc., to \"reflect its focus on building the metaverse\".[24] According to Meta, the term \"metaverse\" refers to the integrated environment that links all of the company's products and services.[25][26][27]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of Facebook and Initial public offering of Facebook\n\n![](image)Billboard on the Thomson Reuters building welcomes Facebook to Nasdaq, 2012\n![](image)Early chart of Facebook's stock\n![](image)Facebook corporate logo from 2019 to 2021\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series about |\n| Meta Platforms |\n| ![](image) |\n| * History\n\t+ Instagram\n\t+ WhatsApp\n* Acquisitions\n |\n| \nProducts and services |\n| Facebook\n* 2021 outage\n* Features\n\t+ Dating\n\t+ Feed\n\t+ Like button\n |\n| Other products\n* Instagram\n\t+ Threads\n* Messenger\n\t+ Kids\n* Meta AI\n* Meta Portal\n* Quest\n\t+ Quest 2\n\t+ Quest 3\n\t+ Supernatural\n* Ray-Ban Stories\n* WhatsApp\n |\n| \nPeople |\n| Executives and board members\n* Mark Zuckerberg\n* Sheryl Sandberg\n |\n| Notable employees\n* Adam Mosseri\n |\n| Related organizations\n* Oversight Board\n |\n| \nBusiness |\n| Criticism\n* Privacy concerns\n* Content management\n\t+ Censorship of\n\t+ Censorship by\n* Cambridge Analytica data scandal\n* 2020 ad boycotts\n* 2021 company files leak\n* WhatsApp security and privacy features\n* WhatsApp snooping scandal\n |\n| Litigation\n* *Young v.

IPO\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nFacebook filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on January 1, 2012.[28] The preliminary prospectus stated that the company sought to raise $5 billion, had 845 million monthly active users, and a website accruing 2.7 billion likes and comments daily.[29] After the IPO, Zuckerberg would retain a 22% ownership share in Facebook and would own 57% of the voting shares.[30]\n\n\nUnderwriters valued the shares at $38 each, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation to date for a newly public company.[31] On May 16, one day before the IPO, Facebook announced it would sell 25% more shares than originally planned due to high demand.[32] The IPO raised $16 billion, making it the third-largest in US history (slightly ahead of AT&T Wireless and behind only General Motors and Visa). The stock price left the company with a higher market capitalization than all but a few U.S. corporations\u2014surpassing heavyweights such as Amazon, McDonald's, Disney, and Kraft Foods\u2014and made Zuckerberg's stock worth $19 billion.[33][34] *The New York Times* stated that the offering overcame questions about Facebook's difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform the company into a \"must-own stock\". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase described it as \"the next great blue-chip\".[33] Writers at TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating, \"That's a big multiple to live up to, and Facebook will likely need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth valuation.\"[35]\n\n\nTrading in the stock, which began on May 18, was delayed that day due to technical problems with the Nasdaq exchange.[36] The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to support the price.[37] At the closing bell, shares were valued at $38.23,[38] only $0.23 above the IPO price and down $3.82 from the opening bell value. The opening was widely described by the financial press as a disappointment.[39] The stock nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[40] On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading at $31.91, a 16.5% decline.[41]\n\n\nOn May 22, 2012, regulators from Wall Street's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting Facebook had improperly shared information only with select clients rather than the general public. Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the same issue.[42] The allegations sparked \"fury\" among some investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits, one of them a class action suit claiming more than $2.5 billion in losses due to the IPO.[43] Bloomberg estimated that retail investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook stock since its debut.[44] Standard & Poor's added Facebook to its S&P 500 index on December 21, 2013.[45]\n\n\nOn May 2, 2014, Zuckerberg announced that the company would be changing its internal motto from \"Move fast and break things\" to \"Move fast with stable infrastructure\".[46][47] The earlier motto had been described as Zuckerberg's \"prime directive to his developers and team\" in a 2009 interview in *Business Insider*, in which he also said, \"Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough.\"[48]\n\n\n\n### 2018\u20132020: Focus on the metaverse[edit]\n\n\nLasso was a short-video sharing app from Facebook similar to TikTok that was launched on iOS and Android in 2018 and was aimed at teenagers. On July 2, 2020, Facebook announced that Lasso would be shutting down on July 10.[49][50][51]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Oculus lead, Jason Rubin, sent his 50-page vision document titled \"The Metaverse\" to Facebook's leadership. In the document, Rubin acknowledged that Facebook's virtual reality business had not caught on as expected, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on content for early adopters. He also urged the company to execute fast and invest heavily in the vision, to shut out HTC, Apple, Google and other competitors in the VR space. Regarding other players' participation in the metaverse vision, he called for the company to build the \"metaverse\" to prevent their competitors from \"being in the VR business in a meaningful way at all\".[52]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Facebook founded Libra Networks, reportedly to develop their own stablecoin cryptocurrency.[53] Later, it was reported that Libra was being supported by financial companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber. The consortium of companies was expected to pool in $10 million each to fund the launch of the cryptocurrency coin named Libra.[54] Depending on when it would receive approval from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory authority to operate as a payments service, the Libra Association had planned to launch a limited format cryptocurrency in 2021.[55] Libra was renamed Diem, before being shut down and sold in January 2022 after backlash from government regulators and the public.[56][57]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of online services including Facebook grew globally.[58] Zuckerberg predicted this would be a \"permanent acceleration\" that would continue after the pandemic.[58] Facebook hired aggressively, growing from 48,268 employees in March 2020 to more than 87,000 by September 2022.[58]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Rebrand as Meta[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Criticism of Facebook, Instagram \u00a7\u00a0Impact on people, 2021 Facebook leak, and Frances Haugen\nSee also: Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal and 2020 Facebook ad boycotts\n\nFollowing a period of intense scrutiny and damaging whistleblower leaks, news started to emerge on October 21, 2021, about Facebook's plan to rebrand the company and to change its name.[59][60] In the Q3 2021 Earnings Call, on October 25, Mark Zuckerberg discussed the ongoing criticism of the company's social services and the way it operates, and pointed to the pivoting efforts to building the metaverse \u2013 without mentioning the rebranding and the name change.[61] The metaverse vision and the name change from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms was introduced at Facebook Connect on October 28, 2021.[62] Based on Facebook's PR campaign, the name change reflects the company's shifting long term focus of building the metaverse, a digital extension of the physical world by social media, virtual reality and augmented reality features.[62][63]\n\n\n\"Meta\" had been registered as a trademark in the United States in 2018 (after an initial filing in 2015) for marketing, advertising, and computer services, by a Canadian company that provided big data analysis of scientific literature.[64] This company was acquired in 2017 by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a foundation established by Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, and became one of their projects.[65] Following the rebranding announcement, CZI announced that it had already decided to deprioritize the earlier Meta project, that it would be transferring its rights to the name to Meta Platforms, and that the project would end in 2022.[66]\n\n\n\n### 2022\u2013present: Declining profits and mass layoffs[edit]\n\n\nSoon after the rebranding, in early February 2022, Meta reported a greater-than-expected decline in profits in the fourth quarter of 2021.[67] It reported no growth in monthly users,[68] and indicated it expected revenue growth to stall.[67] It also expected measures taken by Apple, Inc. to protect user privacy to cost it some $10 billion in advertisement revenue, an amount equal to roughly 8% of its revenue for 2021.[69] In meeting with Meta staff the day after earnings were reported, Zuckerberg blamed competition for user attention, particularly from video-based apps such as TikTok.[70]\n\n\nThe 27% reduction in the company's share price which occurred in reaction to the news eliminated some $230 billion of value from Meta's market capitalization.[71] Bloomberg described the decline as \"an epic rout that, in its sheer scale, is unlike anything Wall Street or Silicon Valley has ever seen\".[71] Zuckerberg's net worth fell by as much as $31 billion.[72] Zuckerberg owns 13% of Meta, and the holding makes up the bulk of his wealth.[73][74]\n\n\nAccording to published reports by Bloomberg on March 30, 2022, Meta turned over data such as phone numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, a Meta representative said, \"We review every data request for legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse.\"[75] In June 2022, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of 14 years, announced she would step down that year. Zuckerberg said that Javier Olivan would replace Sandberg, though in a \"more traditional\" role.[76]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Meta (except Meta-owned WhatsApp) and Instagram were banned in Russia and added to Russian list of terrorist and extremist organizations for alleged Russophobia amid ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.[77] Meta appealed against the ban but it was upheld by a Moscow court in June of the same year.[77]\n\n\nAlso in March 2022, Meta and Italian eyewear giant Luxottica released Ray-Ban Stories, a series of smartglasses which could play music and take pictures. Meta and Luxottica parent company EssilorLuxottica declined to disclose sales on the line of products as of September 2022, though Meta has expressed satisfaction with its customer feedback.[23][78][79]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Meta saw its first year-on-year revenue decline when its total revenue slipped by 1% to $28.8bn.[80] Analysts and journalists accredited the loss to its advertising business, which has been limited by Apple's app tracking transparency feature and the number of people who have opted not to be tracked by Meta apps. Zuckerberg also accredited the decline to increasing competition from TikTok.[81][82][83] On October 27, 2022, Meta's market value dropped to $268 billion, a loss of around $700 billion compared to 2021, and its shares fell by 24%. It lost its spot among the top 20 US companies by market cap, despite reaching the top 5 in the previous year.[84]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, 13% of its workforce. Zuckerberg said the decision to aggressively increase Meta's investments had been a mistake, as he had wrongly predicted that the surge in e-commerce would last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. He also attributed the decline to increased competition, a global economic downturn and \"ads signal loss\".[85] Plans to lay off a further 10,000 employees began in April 2023.[86] The layoffs were part of a general downturn in the technology industry, alongside layoffs by companies including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Snap, Twitter and Lyft.[87][88]\n\n\nMeta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for the first quarter of 2023 after announcing that it was increasing its focus on AI.[89] On July 6, 2023, Meta launched a new app, Threads, a competitor to Twitter.[90]\n\n\nIn July 2023, the company announced it was making Llama 2, its artificial intelligence model, available for commercial use via partnerships with major cloud providers like Microsoft. This was the first project to be unveiled out of Meta's generative AI group after it was set up in February. It would not charge access or usage but instead operate with an open-source model to allow Meta to ascertain what improvements need to be made. Prior to this announcement, Meta said it had no plans to release Llama 2 for commercial use. An earlier version of Llama was released to academics.[91][92]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Meta announced its permanent removal of news content from Facebook and Instagram in Canada due to the *Online News Act*, which requires Canadian news outlets to be compensated for content shared on its platform. The Online News Act will be effective by year-end, but Meta will not participate in the regulatory process.[93]\n\n\n\n## Mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of mergers and acquisitions by Meta Platforms.\n\nMeta has acquired multiple companies (often identified as talent acquisitions).[94] One of its first major acquisitions was in April 2012, when it acquired Instagram for approximately US$1 billion in cash and stock.[95] In October 2013, Facebook, Inc. acquired Onavo, an Israeli mobile web analytics company.[96][97] In February 2014, Facebook, Inc. announced it would buy mobile messaging company WhatsApp for US$19 billion in cash and stock.[98][99] Later that year, Facebook bought Oculus VR for $2.3 billion in cash and stock,[100] which released its first consumer virtual reality headset in 2016. In late November 2019, Facebook, Inc. announced the acquisition of the game developer Beat Games, responsible for developing one of that year's most popular VR games, *Beat Saber*.[101] In Late 2022 after Facebook Inc rebranded to Meta Platforms Inc, Oculus was rebranded to Meta Quest.\n\n\nIn May 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced it had acquired Giphy for a reported cash price of $400 million. It will be integrated with the Instagram team.[102] However, in August 2021, UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated that Facebook, Inc. might have to sell Giphy, after an investigation found that the deal between the two companies would harm competition in display advertising market.[103] Facebook, Inc. was fined $70 million by CMA for deliberately failing to report all information regarding the acquisition and the ongoing antitrust investigation.[104] In October 2022, the CMA ruled for a second time that Meta be required to divest Giphy, stating that Meta already controls half of the advertising in the UK. Meta agreed to the sale, though it stated that it disagrees with the decision itself.[105] In May 2023, Giphy was divested to Shutterstock for $53\u00a0million.[106]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced that it planned to purchase the customer-service platform and chatbot specialist startup Kustomer to promote companies to use their platform for business. It has been reported that Kustomer valued at slightly over $1 billion.[107] The deal was closed in February 2022 after regulatory approval.[108]\n\n\nIn September 2022, Meta acquired Lofelt, a Berlin-based haptic tech startup.[109]\n\n\n\n## Lobbying[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, Facebook, Inc. spent $19.7 million on lobbying, hiring 79 lobbyists. By 2019, it had spent $16.7 million on lobbying and had a team of 71 lobbyists, up from $12.6 million and 51 lobbyists in 2018.[110] Facebook was the largest spender of lobbying money among the Big Tech companies in 2020.[111] The lobbying team includes top congressional aide John Branscome, who was hired in September 2021, to help the company fend off threats from Democratic lawmakers and the Biden administration.[112]\n\n\n\n## Lawsuits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lawsuits involving Meta Platforms\n\nNumerous lawsuits have been filed against the company, both when it was known as Facebook, Inc., and as Meta Platforms.\n\n\nIn March 2020, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) sued Facebook, for significant and persistent infringements of the rule on privacy involving the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. Every violation of the Privacy Act is subject to a theoretical cumulative liability of $1.7 million. The OAIC estimated that a total of 311,127 Australians had been exposed.[113]\n\n\nOn December 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and 46 states (excluding Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and South Dakota), the District of Columbia and the territory of Guam, launched *Federal Trade Commission v. Facebook* as an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook. The lawsuit concerns Facebook's acquisition of two competitors\u2014Instagram and WhatsApp\u2014and the ensuing monopolistic situation. FTC alleges that Facebook holds monopolistic power in the US social networking market and seeks to force the company to divest from Instagram and WhatsApp to break up the conglomerate.[114] William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, argued the case will be difficult to win as it would require the government to create a counterfactual argument of an internet where the Facebook-WhatsApp-Instagram entity did not exist, and prove that harmed competition or consumers.[115]\n\n\nOn December 24, 2021, a court in Russia fined Meta for $27 million after the company declined to remove unspecified banned content. The fine was reportedly tied to the company's annual revenue in the country.[116]\n\n\nIn May 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Kenya against Meta and its local outsourcing company Sama. Allegedly, Meta has poor working conditions in Kenya for workers moderating Facebook posts. According to the lawsuit, 260 screeners were declared redundant with confusing reasoning. The lawsuit seeks financial compensation and an order that outsourced moderators be given the same health benefits and pay scale as Meta employees.[117][118]\n\n\nIn June 2022, 8 lawsuits were filed across the US over the allege that excessive exposure to platforms including Facebook and Instagram has led to attempted or actual suicides, eating disorders and sleeplessness, among other issues. The litigation follows a former Facebook employee's testimony in Congress that the company refused to take responsibility. The company noted that tools have been developed for parents to keep track of their children's activity on Instagram and set time limits in addition to Meta's \"Take a break\" reminders. In addition, the company is providing resources specific to eating disorders as well as developing AI to prevent children under the age of 13 signing up for Facebook or Instagram.[119]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Meta settled a lawsuit with the US Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2019, alleged that the company enabled housing discrimination through targeted advertising, as it allowed home owners and landlords to run housing ads excluding people based on sex, race, religion, and other characteristics. The US Department of Justice stated that this was in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Meta was handed a penalty of $115,054 and given until December 31, 2022, to shadow the algorithm tool.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Meta was fined \u20ac390 million for violations of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation.[123]\n\n\nIn May 2023, the European Data Protection Board fined Meta a record \u20ac1.2 billion for breaching European Union data privacy laws by transferring personal data of Facebook users to servers in the U.S.[124]\n\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder, chairman and CEO of Meta, in 2012\n### Management[edit]\n\n\nMeta's key management consists of:[125][126]\n\n\n\n* Mark Zuckerberg, chairman and chief executive officer\n* Javier Olivan, chief operating officer\n* Sir Nick Clegg, president, global affairs\n* Susan Li, chief financial officer\n* Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer\n* David Wehner, chief strategy officer\n* Chris Cox, chief product officer\n* Jennifer Newstead, chief legal officer\n\n\nAs of October\u00a02022[update], Meta had 83,553 employees worldwide.\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 2023, Meta's board consisted of the following directors;[127]\n\n\n\n* Mark Zuckerberg (chairman, co-founder, controlling shareholder, and chief executive officer)\n* Sheryl Sandberg (non-executive director and former chief operating officer)\n* Peggy Alford (non-executive director, executive vice president, global sales, PayPal)\n* Marc Andreessen (non-executive director, co-founder and general partner, Andreessen Horowitz)\n* Drew Houston (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer, Dropbox)\n* Nancy Killefer (non-executive director, senior partner, McKinsey & Company)\n* Robert M. Kimmitt (non-executive director, senior international counsel, WilmerHale)\n* Tracey Travis (non-executive director, executive vice president, chief financial officer, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies)\n* Tony Xu (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer, DoorDash)\n\n\n### Company governance[edit]\n\n\nEarly Facebook investor and Zuckerberg's former mentor, Roger McNamee described Facebook as having \"the most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company.\"[128] Nathan Schneider, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder argued for transforming Facebook into a platform cooperative owned and governed by the users.[129]\n\n\nFacebook co-founder Chris Hughes has stated that chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg has too much power, that the company is now a monopoly, and that, as a result, it should be split into multiple smaller companies. In an op-ed in *The New York Times*, Hughes said he was concerned that Zuckerberg had surrounded himself with a team that did not challenge him, and that it is the U.S. government's job to hold him accountable and curb his \"unchecked power\".[130] He also said that \"Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American.\"[131] Several U.S. politicians agreed with Hughes.[132] European Union Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager stated that splitting Facebook should be done only as \"a remedy of the very last resort\", and that it would not solve Facebook's underlying problems.[133]\n\n\n\n## Revenue[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRevenue  \n(in millions USD)\n| Year | Revenue | Growth\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | $0.4[134] | \u2014\n |\n| 2005 | $9[134] | 2150%\n |\n| 2006 | $48[134] | 433%\n |\n| 2007 | $153[134] | 219%\n |\n| 2008 | $280[135] | 83%\n |\n| 2009 | $775[136] | 177%\n |\n| 2010 | $2,000[137] | 158%\n |\n| 2011 | $3,711[138] | 86%\n |\n| 2012 | $5,089[139] | 37%\n |\n| 2013 | $7,872[139] | 55%\n |\n| 2014 | $12,466[140] | 58%\n |\n| 2015 | $17,928[141] | 44%\n |\n| 2016 | $27,638[142] | 54%\n |\n| 2017 | $40,653[143] | 47%\n |\n| 2018 | $55,838[144] | 37%\n |\n| 2019 | $70,697[144] | 27%\n |\n| 2020 | $85,965[145] | 22%\n |\n| 2021 | $117,929[146] | 37%\n |\n| 2022 | $116,609[13] | -1%\n |\n\n\nFacebook ranked No. 34 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue, with almost $86 billion in revenue[147] most of it coming from advertising.[148][149] One analysis of 2017 data determined that the company earned US$20.21 per user from advertising.[150]\n\n\nAccording to *New York*, since its rebranding, Meta has reportedly lost $500 billion as a result of new privacy measures put in place by companies such as Apple and Google which prevents Meta from gathering users' data.[151][152]\n\n\n\n### Number of advertisers[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Facebook announced it had reached two million active advertisers, with most of the gain coming from small businesses. An active advertiser was defined as an entity that had advertised on the Facebook platform in the last 28 days.[153] In March 2016, Facebook announced it had reached three million active advertisers with more than 70% from outside the United States.[154] Prices for advertising follow a variable pricing model based on auctioning ad placements, and potential engagement levels of the advertisement itself. Similar to other online advertising platforms like Google and Twitter, targeting of advertisements is one of the chief merits of digital advertising compared to traditional media. Marketing on Meta is employed through two methods based on the viewing habits, likes and shares, and purchasing data of the audience, namely targeted audiences and \"look alike\" audiences.[155]\n\n\n\n### Tax affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland \u00a7\u00a0Multinational tax schemes, and Double Irish arrangement \u00a7\u00a0Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n\nThe US IRS challenged the valuation Facebook used when it transferred IP from the US to Facebook Ireland (now Meta Platforms Ireland) in 2010 (which Facebook Ireland then revalued higher before charging out), as it was building its double Irish tax structure.[156][157] The case is ongoing and Meta faces a potential fine of $3\u20135bn.[158]\n\n\nThe US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 changed Facebook's global tax calculations. Meta Platforms Ireland is subject to the US GILTI tax of 10.5% on global intangible profits (i.e. Irish profits). On the basis that Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is paying some tax, the effective minimum US tax for Facebook Ireland will be circa 11%. In contrast, Meta Platforms Inc. would incur a special IP tax rate of 13.125% (the FDII rate) if its Irish business relocated to the US. Tax relief in the US (21% vs. Irish at the GILTI rate) and accelerated capital expensing, would make this effective US rate around 12%.[159][160][161]\n\n\nThe insignificance of the US/Irish tax difference was demonstrated when Facebook moved 1.5bn non-EU accounts to the US to limit exposure to GDPR.[162][163]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Offices[edit]\n\n\nUsers outside of the US and Canada contract with Meta's Irish subsidiary, Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (formerly *Facebook Ireland Limited*), allowing Meta to avoid US taxes for all users in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America. Meta is making use of the Double Irish arrangement which allows it to pay 2\u20133% corporation tax on all international revenue.[164] In 2010, Facebook opened its fourth office, in Hyderabad, India,[165] which houses online advertising and developer support teams and provides support to users and advertisers.[166] In India, Meta is registered as Facebook India Online Services Pvt Ltd.[167] It also has support centers in Chittagong; Dublin;[*clarification needed*] California; Ireland; and Austin, Texas.[168][*not specific enough to verify*]\n\n\nFacebook opened its London headquarters in 2017 in Fitzrovia in central London. Facebook opened an office in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 2018. The offices were initially home to the \"Connectivity Lab\", a group focused on bringing Internet access to those who do not have access to the Internet.[169] In April 2019, Facebook opened its Taiwan headquarters in Taipei.[170]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Meta opened new regional headquarters in Dubai.[171]\n\n\nIn September 2023, it was reported that Meta had paid \u00a3149m to British Land in order to break the lease on Triton Square London office. Meta reportedly had another 18 years left on its lease on the site. [172]\n\n\n\n* ![Entrance to Meta's headquarters complex in Menlo Park, California](image)\n\nEntrance to Meta's headquarters complex in Menlo Park, California\n\n\n* ![Entrance to Facebook's previous headquarters in the Stanford Research Park, Palo Alto, California](image)\n\nEntrance to Facebook's previous headquarters in the Stanford Research Park, Palo Alto, California\n\n\n* ![Inside the Facebook headquarters in 2014](image)\n\nInside the Facebook headquarters in 2014\n\n\n\n### Data centers[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Facebook operated 21 data centers.[173] It committed to purchase 100% renewable energy and to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 75% by 2020.[174] Its data center technologies include Fabric Aggregator, a distributed network system that accommodates larger regions and varied traffic patterns.[175]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Criticism of Facebook, Privacy concerns with Facebook, and Censorship by Facebook\n\nUS Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded in a tweet to Zuckerberg's announcement about Meta, saying: \"Meta as in 'we are a cancer to democracy metastasizing into a global surveillance and propaganda machine for boosting authoritarian regimes and destroying civil society\u00a0... for profit!'\"[176]\n\n\nEx-Facebook employee Frances Haugen and whistleblower behind the Facebook Papers responded to the rebranding efforts by expressing doubts about the company's ability to improve while led by Mark Zuckerberg, and urged the chief executive officer to resign.[177]\n\n\nIn November 2021, a video published by Inspired by Iceland went viral, in which a Zuckerberg look-alike promoted the Icelandverse, a place of \"enhanced actual reality without silly looking headsets\".[178]\n\n\nIn a December 2021 interview, SpaceX and Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk said he could not see a compelling use-case for the VR-driven metaverse, adding: \"I don't see someone strapping a frigging screen to their face all day.\"[179]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Louise Eccles of *The Sunday Times* logged into the metaverse with the intention of making a video guide. She wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Initially, my experience with the Oculus went well. I attended work meetings as an avatar and tried an exercise class set in the streets of Paris. The headset enabled me to feel the thrill of carving down mountains on a snowboard and the adrenaline rush of climbing a mountain without ropes. Yet switching to the social apps, where you mingle with strangers also using VR headsets, it was at times predatory and vile.\n> \n> \n\n\nEccles described being sexually harassed by another user, as well as \"accents from all over the world, American, Indian, English, Australian, using racist, sexist, homophobic and transphobic language\". She also encountered users as young as 7 years old on the platform, despite Oculus headsets being intended for users over 13.[180]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Big Tech\n* Criticism of Facebook\n* Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal\n* 2021 Facebook leak\n* Meta AI\n* *The Social Network*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Madrigal, Alexis C.

It has been often referred to as \"one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world\",[5] and is often regarded as one of the world's most valuable brands.[6] It is considered to be one of the Big Five American technology companies, alongside Alphabet (parent company of Google), Apple, Meta and Microsoft.\n\n\nAmazon was founded by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington,[7] on July 5, 1994. Initially an online marketplace for books, it has expanded into a multitude of product categories, a strategy that has earned it the moniker *The Everything Store*.[8] It has multiple subsidiaries including Amazon Web Services (cloud computing), Zoox (autonomous vehicles), Kuiper Systems (satellite Internet), and Amazon Lab126 (computer hardware R&D). Its other subsidiaries include Ring, Twitch, IMDb, and Whole Foods Market. Its acquisition of Whole Foods in August 2017 for US$13.4\u00a0billion substantially increased its footprint as a physical retailer.[9]\n\n\nAmazon has earned a reputation as a disruptor of well-established industries through technological innovation and \"aggressive\" reinvestment of profits into capital expenditures.[10][11][12][13] As of 2023[update], it is the world's largest online retailer and marketplace, smart speaker provider, cloud computing service through AWS,[14] live-streaming service through Twitch, and Internet company as measured by revenue and market share.[15] In 2021, it surpassed Walmart as the world's largest retailer outside of China, driven in large part by its paid subscription plan, Amazon Prime, which has close to 200\u00a0million subscribers worldwide.[16][17] It is the second-largest private employer in the United States.[18]\n\n\nAmazon also distributes a variety of downloadable and streaming content through its Amazon Prime Video, MGM+, Amazon Music, Twitch, and Audible units. It publishes books through its publishing arm, Amazon Publishing, film and television content through Amazon MGM Studios, including the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio which acquired in March 2022. It also produces consumer electronics\u2014most notably, Kindle e-readers, Echo devices, Fire tablets, and Fire TVs.\n\n\nAmazon has been criticized for customer data collection practices,[19] a toxic work culture,[20] tax avoidance,[21][22] and anti-competitive behavior.[23][24]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Amazon\n\n### 1994\u20132009: early years[edit]\n\n\nAmazon was founded on July 5, 1994, by Jeff Bezos, who chose the Seattle area for its abundance of technical talent, as Microsoft was in the area.[25]\n\n\nAmazon went public in May 1997. It began selling music and videos in 1998, and began international operations by acquiring online sellers of books in the United Kingdom and Germany. In the subsequent year, it initiated the sale of a diverse range of products, including music, video games, consumer electronics, home improvement items, software, games, and toys..[26][27]\n\n\nIn 2002, it launched Amazon Web Services (AWS), which initially focused on providing APIs for web developers to build web applications on top of Amazon's ecommerce platform.[28][29] In 2004, AWS was expanded to provide website popularity statistics and web crawler data from the Alexa Web Information Service.[30] AWS later shifted toward providing enterprise services with Simple Storage Service (S3) in 2006,[31] and Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2008,[32] allowing companies to rent data storage and computing power from Amazon. In 2006, Amazon also launched the *Fulfillment by Amazon* program, which allowed individuals and small companies (called \"third-party sellers\") to sell products through Amazon's warehouses and fulfillment infrastructure.[33]\n\n\n\n### 2010\u2013present: growth[edit]\n\n\nAmazon purchased the Whole Foods Market supermarket chain in 2017.[34] It is the leading e-retailer in the United States with approximately US$178 billion net sales in 2017. It has over 300 million active customer accounts globally.[35]\n\n\nAmazon saw large growth during the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring more than 100,000 staff in the United States and Canada.[36] Some Amazon workers in the US, France, and Italy protested the company's decision to \"run normal shifts\" due to COVID-19's ease of spread in warehouses.[37][38] In Spain, the company faced legal complaints over its policies,[39] while a group of US Senators wrote an open letter to Bezos expressing concerns about workplace safety.[40]\n\n\nOn February 2, 2021, Bezos announced that he would step down as CEO to become executive chair of Amazon's board. The transition officially took place on July 5, 2021, with former CEO of AWS Andy Jassy replacing him as CEO.[41][42] In January 2023, Amazon cut over 18,000 jobs, primarily in consumer retail and its human resources division in an attempt to cut costs.[43]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Amazon products and services\n\n### Amazon.com [edit]\n\n\n\n\namazon.com| ![](image)Logo since January 2000\n |\n| Screenshot\n![](image)Homepage\n |\n| Type of site\n | E-commerce |\n| Available\u00a0in | * Arabic\n* Chinese\n* Dutch\n* English\n* French\n* German\n* Hindi\n* Italian\n* Japanese\n* Polish\n* Portuguese\n* Spanish\n* Swedish\n* Turkish\n |\n| Owner | Amazon |\n| URL | amazon.com (original US site) |\n| Commercial | Yes |\n| Registration | Optional |\n| Launched | 1995; 29\u00a0years ago\u00a0(1995) |\n| Current\u00a0status | Active |\n| Written\u00a0in | C++ and Java |\n| [44] |\n\n\nAmazon.com is an e-commerce platform that sells many product lines, including media (books, movies, music, and software), apparel, baby products, consumer electronics, beauty products, gourmet food, groceries, health and personal care products, industrial & scientific supplies, kitchen items, jewelry, watches, lawn and garden items, musical instruments, sporting goods, tools, automotive items, toys and games, and farm supplies[45] and consulting services.[46] Amazon websites are country-specific (for example, amazon.com for the US and amazon.fr for France), though some offer international shipping.[47]\n\n\nVisits to *amazon.com* grew from 615\u00a0million annual visitors in 2008,[48] to more than 2 billion per month in 2022.[49] The e-commerce platform is the 14th most visited website in the world.[50]\n\n\nResults generated by Amazon's search engine are partly determined by promotional fees.[51] The company's localized storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and country code:\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n| Region | Country | Domain name | Since | Languages\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Africa\n | Egypt | amazon.eg | September 2021 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com Egypt\n |\n| Americas\n | Brazil | amazon.com.br | December 2012 | Portuguese\n |  |\n| Canada | amazon.ca | June 2002 | English, French\n |  |\n| Mexico | amazon.com.mx | August 2013 | Spanish\n |  |\n| United States | amazon.com | July 1995 | English, Spanish, Arabic, German, Hebrew, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional)\n | International customers without a localized Amazon website may purchase eBooks from the Kindle Store on Amazon US.[52] |\n| Asia\n | China | amazon.cn | September 2004 | Chinese (Simplified)\n | Formerly known as Joyo.com CHN\n |\n| India | amazon.in | June 2013 | English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi\n |  |\n| Japan | amazon.co.jp | November 2000 | Japanese, English, Chinese (Simplified)\n |  |\n| Saudi Arabia | amazon.sa | June 2020 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com KSA\n |\n| Singapore | amazon.sg | July 2017 | English\n |  |\n| Turkey | amazon.com.tr | September 2018 | Turkish\n |  |\n| United Arab Emirates | amazon.ae | May 2019 | Arabic, English\n | Formerly known as Souq.com UAE\n |\n| Europe\n | Belgium | amazon.com.be | October 2022 | Dutch, French, English\n |  |\n| France | amazon.fr | August 2000 | French\n |  |\n| Germany | amazon.de | October 1998 | German, English, Czech, Dutch, Polish, Turkish\n | Also serves Austria,[53] Denmark[54] and Switzerland[55] |\n| Italy | amazon.it | November 2010 | Italian\n |  |\n| Netherlands | amazon.nl | November 2014 | Dutch, English\n | Initially only books & e-books, full shop opened March 2020[56] |\n| Poland | amazon.pl | March 2021 | Polish\n |  |\n| Spain | amazon.es | September 2011 | Spanish, Portuguese\n | Also serves Portugal[57] |\n| Sweden | amazon.se | October 2020 | Swedish, English\n |  |\n| United Kingdom | amazon.co.uk | October 1998 | English\n | Also serves Ireland[58] |\n| Oceania | Australia | amazon.com.au | November 2017 | English\n | Also serves New Zealand[59] |\n\n\n#### Merchant partnerships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, US toy retailer Toys \"R\" Us entered into a 10-year agreement with Amazon, valued at $50\u00a0million per year plus a cut of sales, under which Toys \"R\" Us would be the exclusive supplier of toys and baby products on the service, and the chain's website would redirect to Amazon's Toys & Games category. In 2004, Toys \"R\" Us sued Amazon, claiming that because of a perceived lack of variety in Toys \"R\" Us stock, Amazon had knowingly allowed third-party sellers to offer items on the service in categories that Toys \"R\" Us had been granted exclusivity. In 2006, a court ruled in favor of Toys \"R\" Us, giving it the right to unwind its agreement with Amazon and establish its independent e-commerce website. The company was later awarded $51 million in damages.[60][61][62]\n\n\nIn 2001, Amazon entered into a similar agreement with Borders Group, under which Amazon would comanage Borders.com as a co-branded service.[63] Borders pulled out of the arrangement in 2007, with plans to also launch its own online store.[64]\n\n\nOn October 18, 2011, Amazon.com announced a partnership with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to many popular comics, including *Superman*, *Batman*, *Green Lantern*, *The Sandman*, and *Watchmen*. The partnership has caused well-known bookstores like Barnes & Noble to remove these titles from their shelves.[65]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Amazon announced a partnership with the United States Postal Service to begin delivering orders on Sundays. The service, included in Amazon's standard shipping rates, initiated in metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and New York because of the high-volume and inability to deliver in a timely way, with plans to expand into Dallas, Houston, New Orleans and Phoenix by 2014.[66]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Nike agreed to sell products through Amazon in exchange for better policing of counterfeit goods.[67][68] This proved unsuccessful and Nike withdrew from the partnership in November 2019.[68][69] Companies including IKEA and Birkenstock also stopped selling through Amazon around the same time, citing similar frustrations over business practices and counterfeit goods.[70]\n\n\nIn September 2017, Amazon ventured with one of its sellers JV Appario Retail owned by Patni Group which has recorded a total income of US$\u2009104.44\u2009million (\u20b9759 \u2009crore) in financial year 2017\u20132018.[71]\n\n\nAs of October\u00a011, 2017[update], AmazonFresh sold a range of Booths branded products for home delivery in selected areas.[72]\n\n\nIn November 2018, Amazon reached an agreement with Apple Inc. to sell selected products through the service, via the company and selected Apple Authorized Resellers. As a result of this partnership, only Apple Authorized Resellers may sell Apple products on Amazon effective January 4, 2019.[73][74]\n\n\n\n#### Private-label products[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Amazon brands\n\nAmazon sells many products under its own brand names, including phone chargers, batteries, and diaper wipes. The AmazonBasics brand was introduced in 2009, and now features hundreds of product lines, including smartphone cases, computer mice, batteries, dumbbells, and dog crates. Amazon owned 34 private-label brands as of 2019. These brands account for 0.15% of Amazon's global sales, whereas the average for other large retailers is 18%.[75] Other Amazon retail brands include Presto!, Mama Bear, and Amazon Essentials.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Third-party sellers[edit]\n\n\nAmazon derives many of its sales (around 40% in 2008) from third-party sellers who sell products on Amazon.[77] Some other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.[78]\n\n\n\n#### Affiliate program[edit]\n\n\nPublishers can signup as affiliates and receive a commission for referring customers to Amazon by placing links to Amazon on their websites if the referral results in a sale. Worldwide, Amazon has \"over 900,000 members\" in its affiliate programs.[79] In the middle of 2014, the Amazon Affiliate Program is used by 1.2% of all websites and it is the second most popular advertising network after Google Ads.[80] It is frequently used by websites and non-profits to provide a way for supporters to earn them a commission.[81]\n\n\nAssociates can access the Amazon catalog directly on their websites by using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) XML service. A new affiliate product, aStore, allows Associates to embed a subset of Amazon products within another website, or linked to another website. In June 2010, Amazon Seller Product Suggestions was launched to provide more transparency to sellers by recommending specific products to third-party sellers to sell on Amazon. Products suggested are based on customers' browsing history.[82]\n\n\n\n#### Product reviews[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Criticism of Amazon \u00a7\u00a0Amazon reviews\n\nAmazon allows users to submit reviews to the web page of each product. Reviewers must rate the product on a rating scale from one to five stars. Amazon provides a badging option for reviewers which indicates the real name of the reviewer (based on confirmation of a credit card account) or which indicates that the reviewer is one of the top reviewers by popularity. As of December 16, 2020, Amazon removed the ability of sellers and customers to comment on product reviews and purged their websites of all posted product review comments. In an email to sellers Amazon gave its rationale for removing this feature: \"... *the comments feature on customer reviews was rarely used*.\" The remaining review response options are to indicate whether the reader finds the review helpful or to report that it violates Amazon policies (abuse). If a review is given enough \"helpful\" hits, it appears on the front page of the product. In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.[83]\n\n\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available\u2014the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".[84]\n\n\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by public relations companies on behalf of their clients[85] and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works.\n\n\n\n#### Amazon sales rank[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon sales rank (ASR) indicates the popularity of a product sold on any Amazon locale. It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.[86] While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.[86] Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.[87] For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public. However, Amazon has now begun to release point of sale data via the Nielsen BookScan service to verified authors.[88] While the ASR has been the source of much speculation by publishers, manufacturers, and marketers, Amazon itself does not release the details of its sales rank calculation algorithm. Some companies have analyzed Amazon sales data to generate sales estimates based on the ASR,[89] though Amazon states:\n\n\n\n\n> Please keep in mind that our sales rank figures are simply meant to be a guide of general interest for the customer and not definitive sales information for publishers\u2014we assume you have this information regularly from your distribution sources\n> \n> \u2014\u200aAmazon.com Help[90]\n> \n\n\n### Physical stores[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in University Village in Seattle. The store is 5,500 square feet and prices for all products match those on its website.[91] Amazon opened its tenth physical book store in 2017;[92] media speculation suggests that Amazon plans to eventually roll out 300 to 400 bookstores around the country.[91]\n\n\nIn June 2018, it was reported that Amazon planned to open brick and mortar bookstores in Germany.[93]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Amazon applied to have a liquor store in San Francisco, CA, as a means to ship beer and alcohol within the city.[94]\n\n\nIn 2020, Amazon Fresh opened several physical stores in the US and the United Kingdom.[95]\n\n\n\n### Hardware and services[edit]\n\n\nAmazon has a number of products and services available, including its digital assistant Alexa, Amazon Music and Prime Video for music and videos respectively, the Amazon Appstore for Android apps, the Kindle line of eink e-readers, Fire and Fire HD color LCD tablets. Audible provides audiobooks for purchase and listening.\n\n\nIn September 2021, Amazon announced the launch of Astro, its first household robot, powered by its Alexa smart home technology. This can be remote-controlled when not at home, to check on pets, people, or home security. It will send owners a notification if it detects something unusual.[96]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Amazon announced the launch of RXPass, a prescription drug delivery service. It allows US Amazon Prime members to pay a $5 monthly fee for access to 60 medications. The service was launched immediately after the announcement except in states with specific prescription delivery requirements. Beneficiaries of government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will not be able to sign up for RXPass.[97]\n\n\n\n### Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mergers and acquisitions by Amazon\n\nAmazon owns over 100 subsidiaries, including Amazon Web Services, Audible, Diapers.com, Goodreads, IMDb, Kiva Systems (now Amazon Robotics), Shopbop, Teachstreet, Twitch, Zappos, and Zoox.[98]\n\n\n\n#### Amazon Web Services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon Web Services\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a subsidiary of that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide distributed computing processing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms. As of 2021 Q4, AWS has 33% market share for cloud infrastructure while the next two competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have 21%, and 10% respectively, according to Synergy Group.[99][100]\n\n\n\n#### Audible[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Audible (service)\n\nAudible is a seller and producer of spoken audio entertainment, information, and educational programming on the Internet. Audible sells digital audiobooks, radio and television programs, and audio versions of magazines and newspapers. Through its production arm, Audible Studios, Audible has also become the world's largest producer of downloadable audiobooks. On January 31, 2008, Amazon announced it would buy Audible for about $300\u00a0million. The deal closed in March 2008 and Audible became a subsidiary of Amazon.[101]\n\n\n\n#### Goodreads[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Goodreads\n\nGoodreads is a \"social cataloging\" website founded in December 2006 and launched in January 2007 by Otis Chandler, a software engineer, and entrepreneur, and Elizabeth Khuri. The website allows individuals to freely search Goodreads' extensive user-populated database of books, annotations, and reviews. Users can sign up and register books to generate library catalogs and reading lists. They can also create their groups of book suggestions and discussions. In December 2007, the site had over 650,000 members, and over a million books had been added. Amazon bought the company in March 2013.[102]\n\n\n\n#### Ring[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ring (company)\n\nRing is a home automation company founded by Jamie Siminoff in 2013.

Amazon bought Ring for US$1\u00a0billion in 2018.[103]\n\n\n\n#### Twitch[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Twitch (service)\n\n![](image)Twitch at the Electronic Entertainment Expo\nTwitch is a live streaming platform for video, primarily oriented towards video gaming content. Twitch was acquired by Amazon in August 2014 for $970\u00a0million.[104] The site's rapid growth had been boosted primarily by the prominence of major esports competitions on the service, leading GameSpot senior esports editor Rod Breslau to have described the service as \"the ESPN of esports\".[105] As of 2015[update], the service had over 1.5\u00a0million broadcasters and 100\u00a0million monthly viewers.[106]\n\n\n\n#### Whole Foods Market[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Whole Foods Market store in Ann Arbor, Michigan\nWhole Foods Market is an American supermarket chain exclusively featuring foods without artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats.[107] Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August 2017.[108][109][9]\n\n\n\n#### Other[edit]\n\n\nOther Amazon subsidiaries include:\n\n\n\n* **A9.com**, a company focused on researching and building innovative technology; it has been a subsidiary since 2003.[110]\n* **Amazon Maritime**, Inc. holds a Federal Maritime Commission license to operate as a non-vessel-owning common carrier (NVOCC), which enables the company to manage its shipments from China into the United States.[111]\n* **Amazon Pharmacy** is an online delivery service dedicated to prescription drugs, launched in November 2020. The service provides discounts up to 80% for generic drugs and up to 40% for branded drugs for Prime subscribe users. The products can be purchased on the company's website or at over 50,000 bricks-and-mortar pharmacies in the United States.[112]\n* **Annapurna Labs**, an Israel-based microelectronics company reputedly for US$350\u2013370M acquired by Amazon Web Services in January 2015 .[113][114][115]\n* **Beijing Century Joyo Courier Services**, which applied for a freight forwarding license with the US Maritime Commission. Amazon is also building out its logistics in trucking and air freight to potentially compete with UPS and FedEx.[116][117]\n* **Brilliance Audio**, an audiobook publisher founded in 1984 by Michael Snodgrass in Grand Haven, Michigan.[118] The company produced its first eight audio titles in 1985.[118] The company was purchased by Amazon in 2007 for an undisclosed amount.[119][120] At the time of the acquisition, Brilliance was producing 12\u201315 new titles a month.[120] It operates as an independent company within Amazon. In 1984, Brilliance Audio invented a technique for recording twice as much on the same cassette.[121] The technique involved recording on each of the two channels of each stereo track.[121] It has been credited with revolutionizing the burgeoning audiobook market in the mid-1980s since it made unabridged books affordable.[121]\n* **ComiXology**, a cloud-based digital comics platform with over 200\u00a0million comic downloads as of September\u00a02013[update]. It offers a selection of more than 40,000 comic books and graphic novels across Android, iOS, Fire OS and Windows 8 devices and over a web browser.

The startup will form part of Amazon Care, which is the company's employee healthcare service. This follows the 2018 purchase of PillPack for under $1\u00a0billion, which has also been included into Amazon Care.[128]\n* **Junglee**, a former online shopping service provided by Amazon that enabled customers to search for products from online and offline retailers in India. Junglee started as a virtual database that was used to extract information from the Internet and deliver it to enterprise applications. As it progressed, Junglee started to use its database technology to create a single window marketplace on the Internet by making every item from every supplier available for purchase. Web shoppers could locate, compare and transact millions of products from across the Internet shopping mall through one window.[129] Amazon acquired Junglee in 1998, and the website Junglee.com was launched in India in February 2012[130] as a comparison-shopping website. It curated and enabled searching for a diverse variety of products such as clothing, electronics, toys, jewelry, and video games, among others, across thousands of online and offline sellers. Millions of products are browsable, the client selects a price, and then they are directed to a seller. In November 2017, Amazon closed down Junglee.com and the former domain currently redirects to Amazon India.[131]\n* **Kuiper Systems**, a subsidiary of Amazon, set up to deploy a broadband satellite internet constellation with an announced 3,236 Low Earth orbit satellites to provide satellite based Internet connectivity.[132][133][134]\n* **Lab126**, developers of integrated consumer electronics such as the Kindle, became a subsidiary in 2004.[135]\n* **Shelfari**, a former social cataloging website for books.

Amazon bought the company in August 2008.[102] Shelfari continued to function as an independent book social network within the Amazon until January 2016, when Amazon announced that it would be merging Shelfari with Goodreads and closing down Shelfari.[136][137]\n* **Souq**, the former largest e-commerce platform in the Arab world. The company launched in 2005 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and served multiple areas across the Middle East.[138] On March 28, 2017, Amazon acquired Souq.com for $580\u00a0million.[139] The company was re-branded as Amazon and its infrastructure was used to expand Amazon's online platform in the Middle East.[140]\n\n\nAmazon also has investments in renewable energy and plans to expand its position into the Canadian market through an investment in a new plant in Alberta.[141]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Amazon locations\n\n### Logistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon Transportation Services truck at an Amazon Logistics delivery station\nAmazon uses many different transportation services to deliver packages. Amazon-branded services include:\n\n\n\n* Amazon Air, a cargo airline for bulk transport, with last-mile delivery handled either by Amazon Flex, Amazon Logistics, or the US Postal Service.\n\n\n![](image)Amazon delivery station in La Crosse by the La Crosse airport\n* Amazon Flex, a smartphone app that enables individuals to act as independent contractors, delivering packages to customers from personal vehicles without uniforms. Deliveries include one or two hours Prime Now, same or next day Amazon Fresh groceries, and standard Amazon.com orders, in addition to orders from local stores that contract with Amazon.[142]\n* Amazon Logistics, in which Amazon contracts with small businesses (which it calls \"Delivery Service Partners\") to perform deliveries to customers. Each business has a fleet of approximately 20\u201340 Amazon-branded vans, and employees of the contractors wear Amazon uniforms. As of December 2020, it operates in the United States, Canada, Italy, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom.[143]\n* Amazon Prime Air is an experimental drone delivery service that delivers packages via drones to Amazon Prime subscribers in select cities.\n\n\nAmazon directly employs people to work at its warehouses, bulk distribution centers, staffed \"Amazon Hub Locker+\" locations, and delivery stations where drivers pick up packages. As of December 2020, it is not hiring delivery drivers as employees.[144]\n\n\nRakuten Intelligence estimated that in 2020 in the United States, the proportion of last-mile deliveries was 56% by Amazon's directly contracted services (mostly in urban areas), 30% by the US Postal Service (mostly in rural areas), and 14% by UPS.[145] In April 2021, Amazon reported to investors it had increased its in-house delivery capacity by 50% in the last 12 months (which included the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States).[146]\n\n\n\n### Supply chain[edit]\n\n\nAmazon first launched its distribution network in 1997 with two fulfillment centers in Seattle and New Castle, Delaware. Amazon has several types of distribution facilities consisting of cross-dock centers, fulfillment centers, sortation centers, delivery stations, Prime now hubs, and Prime air hubs. There are 75 fulfillment centers and 25 sortation centers with over 125,000 employees.[147][148] Employees are responsible for five basic tasks: unpacking and inspecting incoming goods; placing goods in storage and recording their location; picking goods from their computer recorded locations to make up an individual shipment; sorting and packing orders; and shipping. A computer that records the location of goods and maps out routes for pickers plays a key role: employees carry hand-held computers which communicate with the central computer and monitor their rate of progress. Some warehouses are partially automated with systems built by Amazon Robotics.[149]\n\n\nIn September 2006, Amazon launched a program called FBA (Fulfillment By Amazon) whereby it could handle storage, packing and distribution of products and services for small sellers.[33]\n\n\n\n* ![Amazon.fr fulfillment center in Lauwin-Planque, France](image)\n\nAmazon.fr fulfillment center in Lauwin-Planque, France\n* ![Amazon.es fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, Spain](image)\n\nAmazon.es fulfillment center in San Fernando de Henares, Spain\n* ![Amazon.co.uk fulfillment center in Glenrothes, Scotland, UK](image)\n\nAmazon.co.uk fulfillment center in Glenrothes, Scotland, UK\n* ![Amazon.de fulfillment center in Graben, Germany](image)\n\nAmazon.de fulfillment center in Graben, Germany\n* ![Amazon.co.jp fulfillment center in Ichikawa, Japan](image)\n\nAmazon.co.jp fulfillment center in Ichikawa, Japan\n* ![Amazon fulfillment center in Macon, Georgia, US](image)\n\nAmazon fulfillment center in Macon, Georgia, US\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2016\nAs of June\u00a02022[update], Amazon's board of directors were:[150]\n\n\n\n* Jeff Bezos, executive chairman, Amazon.com, Inc.\n* Andy Jassy, president and CEO, Amazon.com, Inc.\n* Keith B.

Since 2007 sales increased from 14.835\u00a0billion to 469.822\u00a0billion, due to continued business expansion.[153]\n\n\nAmazon's market capitalization went over US$1\u00a0trillion again in early February 2020 after the announcement of the fourth quarter 2019 results.[154]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Revenue[155]in mil.

He also read many emails addressed by customers to his public email address.[174] One of Bezos's most well-known internal memos was his mandate for \"all teams\" to \"expose their data and functionality\" through service interfaces \"designed from the ground up to be externalizable\". This process, commonly known as a service-oriented architecture (SOA), resulted in mandatory dogfooding of services that would later be commercialized as part of AWS.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Lobbying[edit]\n\n\nAmazon lobbies the United States federal government and state governments on multiple issues such as the enforcement of sales taxes on online sales, transportation safety, privacy and data protection and intellectual property. According to regulatory filings, Amazon.com focuses its lobbying on the United States Congress, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Reserve. Amazon.com spent roughly $3.5\u00a0million, $5\u00a0million and $9.5\u00a0million on lobbying, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.[175] In 2019, it spent $16.8\u00a0million and had a team of 104 lobbyists.[176]\n\n\nAmazon.com was a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) until it dropped membership following protests at its shareholders' meeting on May 24, 2012.[177]\n\n\nIn 2014, Amazon expanded its lobbying practices as it prepared to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its drone delivery program, hiring the Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld lobbying firm in June.[178] Amazon and its lobbyists have visited with Federal Aviation Administration officials and aviation committees in Washington, D.C. to explain its plans to deliver packages.[179] In September 2020 this moved one step closer with the granting of a critical certificate by the FAA.[180]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Criticism of Amazon\n\n![](image)A sticker expressing an anti-Amazon message is pictured on the back of a street sign in Seattle.Amazon has attracted criticism for its actions, including: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools;[181] forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA;[182] leading customers away from bookshops;[183] adversely impacting the environment;[184] placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers;[185] actively opposing unionization efforts;[186] remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; seeking to patent its 1-Click technology; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination;[23][24] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content.[187][188] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.[189] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap.it countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products.[190][191]\n\n\nThe company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, \"that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\"[51] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[192] In 2019, Amazon banned selling skin-lightening products after pushback from Minnesota health and environmental activists.[193] In 2022, a lawsuit filed by state attorney-general Letitia James was dismissed by the New York state court of appeals.[194]\n\n\nJane Friedman[195] discovered six listings of books fraudulently using her name, on Amazon and Goodreads. Amazon and Goodreads resisted removing the fraudulent titles until the author's complaints went viral on social media, in a blog post titled \"I Would Rather See My Books Get Pirated Than This (Or: Why Goodreads and Amazon Are Becoming Dumpster Fires).\"[196][197][198][199]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Internet portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* Amazon Breakthrough Novel Award\n* Amazon Pay\n* Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN)\n* Camelcamelcamel \u2013 a website that tracks the prices of products sold on Amazon.com\n* History of Amazon\n* Internal carbon pricing\n* List of book distributors\n* Statistically improbable phrases \u2013 Amazon.com's phrase extraction technique for indexing books\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Amazon.com, Inc. 2022 Form 10-K Annual Report\".

It was opened to employees in April 2017, while construction was still underway, and superseded Apple Campus as the company's corporate headquarters, which opened in 1993.[7]\n\n\nThe main building's scale and circular groundscraper design, by Norman Foster,[8] have earned the structure the media nickname \"the spaceship\".[9][10][11] Located on a suburban site totaling 1.46\u00a0km2 (360 acres), it houses more than 12,000 employees in one central four-story circular building of approximately 0.26\u00a0km2 (64 acres). Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted the campus to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge; 80 percent of the site consists of green space planted with drought-resistant trees and plants indigenous to the Cupertino area, and the center courtyard of the main building features an artificial pond.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2006, Apple's then CEO Steve Jobs announced to the city council of Cupertino that Apple had acquired nine contiguous properties to build a second campus, the Apple Campus 2.[12][13] The idea for a new headquarters was conceived by Jobs and Apple's then chief designer Jony Ive.[14] Ive was Apple's immediate choice to design the project, going on to work very closely together with Norman Foster across five years, designing every detail, from the glass panels to the elevator buttons.[15][16]\n\n\nPurchases of the needed properties were made through the company Hines Interests,[17][18] which in at least some cases did not disclose the fact that Apple was the ultimate buyer;[18] Philip Mahoney, a partner with a local commercial real estate brokerage, noted that this is common practice in attempts to arrange the purchase of contiguous land made up of multiple parcels with separate owners, in order to keep costs from skyrocketing and not reveal the company's plans to competitors.[18] Among the sellers of the properties were SummerHill Homes (a plot of 8 acres or 3.2 hectares) and Hewlett-Packard (three buildings of their campus in Cupertino).[18]\n\n\nUntil April 2008, Apple had not sought the necessary permits to begin construction, so it was estimated that the project would not be ready in 2010 as originally proposed; however, the buildings on the site were held by Apple for its operations. In November 2010 the *San Jose Mercury News* revealed[19] that Apple had bought an additional 98 acres (40\u00a0ha) no longer used by HP Inc., just north across Pruneridge Ave. This space had been the HP campus in Cupertino before it was relocated to Palo Alto.\n\n\nOn June 7, 2011, Jobs presented to the Cupertino City Council details of the architectural design of the new buildings and their surroundings.[20] He did not live to see construction begin, dying a few months later on October 5.[21]\n\n\nOn October 15, 2013, Cupertino City Council unanimously approved Apple's plans for the new campus after a six-hour debate.[22] Shortly thereafter, demolition work began to prepare the site for construction.[23]\n\n\nOriginally expected to break ground in 2013 and open in 2015, the project was delayed and started in 2014.[24][25] On February 22, 2017, Apple announced the official name of the campus as the \"Apple Park\", and the auditorium to be named the \"Steve Jobs Theater\".[2]\n\n\nThe campus opened for workers in April 2017, despite continued construction work.[26] This was followed by the first event in the Steve Jobs Theater, which took place on September 12, 2017.[27] The Apple Park Visitor Center opened five days later, on September 17, 2017.[28]\n\n\nAs a consequence of the presence of the Apple Park in the area, surrounding streets have met with both increased tourism, along with rising real estate values of local housing, often drawing in Apple employees wanting to live near the workplace.[29][30]\n\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cupertino, California, with the circular building of Apple Park, located north of Interstate 280\nApple Park is located 1.2 miles (1.9\u00a0km) east of the original Apple Campus. Apple has had a presence in Cupertino since 1977, which is why the company decided to build in the area rather than move to a cheaper, distant location. The campus is also next to a contaminated site under Superfund legislation with a groundwater plume found to contain trichloroethylene from improper disposal of industrial waste by semiconductor manufacturers.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Design and construction[edit]\n\n\nSteve Jobs, in June 2011, in his final public appearance before his death, was quoted as saying:\n\n\n\n\n> It's got a gorgeous courtyard in the middle, and a lot more. It's a circle, so it's curved all the way round. This is not the cheapest way to build something. Every pane of glass in the main building will be curved. We have a shot at building the best office building in the world. I really do think that architecture students will come here to see it.[33]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Apple Park aerial view during construction in August 2016, north of (below) I-280. The original Apple Campus, located 1.2 miles westwards, is also shown on the top-right, south of I-280.\nThe ring-shaped building, advertised as \"a perfect circle\", was not originally planned as such. The inner rim and outer rim on each floor are left open as walkways. There are eight buildings, separated by nine mini-atria. The campus is one mile (1.6\u00a0km) in circumference, with a diameter of 1,512 feet (461\u00a0m). The one circular building houses most employees.[34] It is four stories above the ground and three stories underground.[35] Apple created life-size mock-ups of all parts of the building to analyze any design issues.\n\n\nThe design hides the roads and parking spaces underground. The campus uses only glass for its walls and views of the inner courtyard as well as of the landscape facing the exterior of the building.[36][37] Around 83,000 square feet (7,700\u00a0m2) of space is for meetings and breakout spaces in the building. The inner part of the circular building contains a 30-acre (12\u00a0ha) park featuring a pond, with fruit trees and winding pathways inspired by California fruit orchards.\n\n\nApple brought to the construction project the same \"fanatical attention to detail\" which the company is famous for lavishing upon its products.[38] Apple insisted on extraordinarily tight tolerances, even for parts of the structure normally hidden from view.[38] Construction workers were often required to wear gloves to minimize accidental damage to surfaces.[38] All interior wood used for furniture was harvested from a certain species of maple, with Apple working with construction companies from 19 countries for designs and materials.[39]\n\n\nA breathing, hollow concrete slab acts as floor, ceiling, and HVAC system. A total of 4,300 such slabs were used.[40] Some of the slabs weigh 60,000 pounds (27\u00a0t).[41]\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\nDuring construction, the building's structure was started by Skanska and DPR, but they were removed from the job for undisclosed reasons.[42] Apple hired Rudolph and Sletten and Holder Construction as its new general contractors, and they completed the structure, envelope, and interior buildout.[43] Truebeck Construction (then known as BNBTBuilders) worked on the exterior landscaping, Steve Jobs Theater, and the health and fitness center; a joint venture of BNBTBuilders and Webcor Builders worked on an adjacent group of research and development buildings; McCarthy Building Companies built the parking garage; and Granite Construction performed road widening and utility work.[43] The project created approximately 13,000 full-time construction jobs.[38]\n\n\nThe facade panes are produced by Bavarian companies Josef Gartner and Sedak. The latter company is a subsidiary of Seele GmbH; Apple had previously worked with Seele, an expert on glass facades, for some of its more prominent Apple Stores such as the one on 5th Avenue in New York City.

In 2011, the budget for Apple Campus 2 was less than $3 billion.[46] However, in 2013 the total cost was estimated to be closer to $5 billion.[46][47]\n\n\n\n### Energy source[edit]\n\n\nThe campus is one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world,[2] and the main building,[48] Steve Jobs Theater,[49] and fitness center[50] are all LEED Platinum certified. In an April 2018 press release, Apple announced that it had switched to being powered entirely by renewable energy.[51] The solar panels installed on the roof of the campus can generate 17 megawatts of power, sufficient to power 75% during peak daytime,[52] and making it one of the largest solar roofs of the world. The other 4 megawatts are generated onsite using Bloom Energy Server fuel cells, which are powered by biofuel or natural gas.[53] The air flows freely between the inside and outside of the building, providing natural ventilation and obviating the need for HVAC systems during nine months of the year.[2]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Caf\u00e9s[edit]\n\n\nThe campus has seven caf\u00e9s, with the largest being a three-level caf\u00e9 for 3,000 sitting people. It has light-colored stone lining and glass railing with no metal support and is surrounded by extensive landscaping. The mezzanine space of 20,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (1,900\u00a0m2) can accommodate 600 people and 1,750 seats on terraces outside, with a capacity to serve 15,000 lunches a day, housed by specially designed 500 tables made of solid Spessart white oak, measuring 18\u00a0ft (5.5\u00a0m) long and 4\u00a0ft (1.2\u00a0m) wide.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe sports tables and benches resemble those in Apple Stores.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Auditorium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Steve Jobs Theater\n\n![](image)External view of the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park\nOfficially known as the Steve Jobs Theater,[2] after the co-founder and former CEO of Apple, the facility is located atop a hill on the campus. It is an underground, 1,000-seat auditorium intended for Apple product launches and press meets. It has a large above-ground cylinder-shaped lobby with stairs down to the auditorium. The theater has 350 parking spaces on North Tantau Avenue and a pedestrian path leading to the main campus located northwest of the theater.\n\n\nThe theater plays host to many types of events, from Apple Events such as product announcements, WWDC (Apple's Developers Conference), and shareholder's meetings, to special Apple Music events, such as performances by Billie Eilish and Ludovico Einaudi.\n\n\nThe theater's lobby has cylindrical-shaped glass walls and no support columns, which give an unhindered 360-degree view of the surrounding campus. The 80-short-ton (73-metric-ton) carbon-fiber roof, made of 44 identical panels, was supplied by the Dubai-based company, Premier Composite Technologies. Each panel is 70\u00a0ft (21\u00a0m) long and 11\u00a0ft (3.4\u00a0m) wide and locks in the middle with the other panels.[54] It is the largest carbon-fiber roof and the largest glass-supported structure in the world.[55]\n\n\nThe theater also includes a 42-foot (13\u00a0m) high glass elevator that rotates 171 degrees from the bottom floor to the upper lobby level. The elevator is made from chemically tempered glass, and is considered to be the tallest free-standing glass elevator in the world.[55]\n\n\nThe theater's first press event was held on September 12, 2017, where the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, Apple Watch Series 3 and Apple TV 4K were announced.[56]\n\n\n\n### Wellness center[edit]\n\n\nA 100,000-square-foot (9,300\u00a0m2) fitness center is located in the northwest of the campus. Apart from gym equipment, the fitness center features other amenities like changing rooms, showers, laundry services, and rooms for group sessions.[57]\n\n\n\n### Research and development facility[edit]\n\n\nThe research and development facilities feature two large 300,000-square-foot (28,000\u00a0m2) buildings on the southern edge of the campus and are occupied by more than 2,000 people. The top floor of each building houses the department comprising industrial design and human interface teams formerly headed by design chief Jony Ive.[58]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\n#### Bus[edit]\n\n\nEmployees traveling by bus will board and depart from the bus station, which leads to the main campus via two white staircases.[35] The area is also served by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), which runs a local bus service from Cupertino to nearby cities. Prominent transit consultant Jarrett Walker, who worked with the VTA on providing service to the campus, criticized the campus' design due to its poor access to public transit.[59]\n\n\n\n#### Parking[edit]\n\n\nParking is located both underground and in two large parking structures accommodating approximately 14,200 employees.[60] Cupertino regulations required a minimum of 11,000 parking spaces,[61] 700 of which have electric vehicle charging stations.[62]\n\n\nThere are 2,000 parking spaces in the subterranean parking garage. The parking is managed by sensors and apps, which manage the traffic and parking spaces.[63]\n\n\n\n#### Cycling[edit]\n\n\nThere are 1,000 bikes on the campus for employees to get around, with miles of cycling and jogging trails all over the 175-acre (71\u00a0ha) campus.[64] There are an additional 2,000 bicycle parking spaces in the subterranean car parking garage.[63]\n\n\n\n### Apple Park Visitor Center[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Apple Park Visitor Center\nApple Park Visitor Center is a two-story 20,135\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (1,870.6\u00a0m2) structure with four main areas: an Apple Store[65] featuring Apple-branded merchandise (T-shirts, hats, tote bags, postcards) not sold at regular Apple stores,[66] a 2,386\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (221.7\u00a0m2) caf\u00e9, an exhibition space which currently showcases a 3D model of Apple Park with augmented reality, and a roof terrace overlooking the campus. It opened to the public on November 17, 2017.[67][68] The estimated cost of the center is $80 million.[69] The property at 10600 North Tantau Avenue (northeast corner of Tantau and Pruneridge avenues) is across the road from the campus proper and abuts a Santa Clara residential neighborhood.[70] The underground parking garage, with close to 700 spaces, has an estimated cost of $26 million. The Visitor Center is the only part of Apple Park which tourists are permitted to visit.\n\n\n\n### Apple Park Developer Center[edit]\n\n\nApple Park Developer Center is a two-story structure across the street from the Apple Park Visitor Center at 10500 North Tantau Avenue (southeast corner of Tantau and Pruneridge avenues). Construction began in May 2021. Apple Park Developer Center was inaugurated on June 6, 2022, during WWDC.[71]\n\n\n\n## Grounds[edit]\n\n\n### Landscaping[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Park under construction, January 2016\n80% of the campus consists of green space.[72] The spacious courtyard in the middle of the primary building was planted with apricot, olive, and apple orchards, as well as a herb garden near the cafe. Other plants selected for the campus landscape are drought tolerant. Recycled water is used to water the campus.\n\n\nIn 2011, Apple hired an arborist, Dave Muffly, to cultivate California's natural environment around Apple Park.[73] Apple's headhunters tracked down Muffly in 2010 after Jobs recognized the quality of the oak trees near the Stanford Dish and asked staff to find the arborist who was caring for them.[73]\n\n\nThere are 9,000 trees on the Apple Park campus, of 309 varieties of indigenous species.[2][11] The planted trees are Oak savanna, Oak wood, and fruit trees including apple, apricot, plum, cherry, and persimmon. An additional 15 acres (6\u00a0ha) are used for a native California grassland.[74] Among the apple varieties represented are Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Gravenstein, and Pink Lady, but the McIntosh is notably absent, due to its incompatibility with the area's climate.[73]\n\n\nAfter he began work in earnest, Muffly realized that fewer than a hundred of the 4,000 existing trees were usable.[73] This meant he had to procure from scratch almost all of the 9,000 planned trees.[73] His team went so far as to search abandoned Christmas tree farms, and Apple bought one at Yermo in the Mojave Desert.[73]\n\n\n\n### Historic barn[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Glendenning Barn as seen from the sidewalk next to Apple Park\nThe land that Apple purchased for the campus came with an old barn that was built in 1916 by John Leonard using redwood planks. Leonard married into the Glendenning Family, who immigrated to the United States from Scotland and settled in the area in the 1850s. After Apple purchased the property, there were discussions between Apple, the Cupertino Historical Society, and the city of Cupertino as to the fate of the barn. The city's interest in the barn stemmed from its 2004 declaration as a historical site.[75]\n\n\nEventually, Apple agreed to keep the barn on the property and is using it to \"store maintenance tools and other landscaping materials\". The barn was disassembled during the campus construction and then reassembled in a different location from where it was originally located.[76][77]\n\n\n\n### Inner courtyard[edit]\n\n\nThe inner courtyard is 30 acres (12\u00a0ha), and lush with fruit trees alongside an artificial pond and a caf\u00e9. In the center, there is a rectangular field with several arches that resemble a rainbow when seen from a distance.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Apple Park aerial view near sunset, November 2023\nThe design of the Apple Park campus has been called the \"ultimate example\" of suburban office parks, which have been in decline as companies seek to relocate to urban areas with better transit, bicycle, and pedestrian access.[78] Kaid Benfield of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a non-profit environmental advocacy group, criticized the proposed campus for contributing to existing suburban sprawl, with car-dependent features and waste of expensive real estate that could have been used for affordable housing.[79]\n\n\nThe headquarters also gained unfavorable attention when it emerged in 2018 that two workers had been injured and required hospital treatment after walking into the building's clear glass walls and doors.[80]\n\n\nApple received some criticism for the perceived extravagance of its new headquarters, as well as its perfectionist approach to its design and construction. The use of special wood as a construction material was reported to be the subject of a 30-page guideline.[38] The design of door handles was reported to be the subject of a one-and-a-half-year debate, involving several revisions before the Apple management gave its approval.[81] Apple's desire for custom signage put the company at odds with the Santa Clara County Fire Department, requiring several rounds of negotiations due to fears it could compromise safety in case of emergencies.[82]\n\n\nIn her book *Brotopia*, writer Emily Chang criticized Apple Park for having no daycare facilities for employees' children, despite it ostensibly serving the needs of every individual.[83]\n\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Trademark/Service Mark Application, Principal Register\".

Microsoft initially moved onto the grounds of the campus on February 26, 1986, shortly before going public on March 13. The headquarters has undergone multiple expansions since its establishment and is presently estimated to encompass over 8\u00a0million square feet (740,000\u00a0m2) of office space and have over 50,000 employees.[3]\n\n\nAs of November 2018, the campus holds 83 buildings.[4][5] Additional offices in the Eastside suburbs of Seattle are located in Bellevue and Issaquah. Building 92 on the campus contains a visitor center (with interactive exhibits) and store that are open to the public.\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nMicrosoft chose to move its headquarters from Bellevue to nearby Redmond in January 1985, selecting a 29-acre (12\u00a0ha) plot of land that would be developed by Wright Runstad & Company.[6] Construction began on August 9, and Microsoft moved into the $25 million facility on February 26, 1986, several weeks before the company's initial public offering.[7][8] The move generated some concerns about increased traffic congestion on the unfinished State Route 520 freeway between Bellevue and Redmond;[9] a new freeway interchange at Northeast 40th Street would later be built in 2000 to service the campus, after lobbying and partial funding from Microsoft.[10][11]\n\n\nThe initial campus was situated on a 30-acre (12\u00a0ha) lot with six buildings and was able to accommodate 800 employees, growing to 1,400 by 1988.[12] The site was once home to chicken farms in the 1920s that were ultimately demolished.[13] The campus was originally leased to Microsoft from the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, a pension fund manager, until it was bought back in 1992.[14] The original buildings were given sequential numbers, with the exception of 7 due to a delay in permitting that became indefinite.[13] A pond between the original buildings was nicknamed \"Lake Bill\" for Bill Gates and was used for post-project celebrations, namely managers being thrown in after a successful launch.[13]\n\n\nThe first major expansion of the campus came in 1992, bringing the total amount of office space to 1.7\u00a0million square feet (160,000\u00a0m2) across 260 acres (110\u00a0ha) of land. Microsoft also announced its intention to contain most of its future growth within Redmond, while retaining some offices in Downtown Bellevue and its Factoria district.[15] The Redmond campus was plagued by hundreds of rabbits who spread around the area in the late 1990s.[16]\n\n\nIn January 2006, Microsoft announced the purchase of Safeco's Redmond campus after the company had begun consolidating its offices at the Safeco Tower in Seattle's University District a year earlier.[17] The following month, Microsoft announced that it intended to expand its Redmond campus by 1,100,000 square feet (100,000\u00a0m2) at a cost of $1\u00a0billion and said that this would create space for between 7,000 and 15,000 new employees over the following three years.[18] The campus expansion also included more prominent branding and additional recreation areas.[19]\n\n\nIn 2009, a shopping mall called \"The Commons\" was completed on the campus, bringing 1.4\u00a0million square feet (130,000\u00a0m2) of retail space as well as restaurants, a soccer field and a pub, to the West Campus.[20]\n\n\n\n### Latest expansion\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2015, *The Seattle Times* reported that Microsoft had hired architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to begin a multibillion-dollar redesign of the Redmond campus, using an additional 1.4\u00a0million square feet (130,000\u00a0m2) permitted by an agreement with the City of Redmond.[2] The City of Redmond had also approved a rezone in February that year to raise the height limit for buildings on the campus from six stories to ten.[21]\n\n\n\n![A small treehouse on a elevated wooden walkway.](image)One of the two treehouses built by Pete Nelson, near Building 31.\nIn 2017, Microsoft unveiled multiple initiatives to overhaul its Redmond campus. This included treehouses built by American treehouse builder Pete Nelson, as well as an elevated outdoor lounge named the Crow's Nest.[22][23] The company also announced plans to demolish 12 buildings on the older East Campus and replace them with 18 new buildings, housing 8,000 additional employees and raising the total number of buildings on the campus to 131.[24] The newer buildings would be arranged like an urban neighborhood, centered around a 2-acre (0.81\u00a0ha) open space with sports fields (including a cricket pitch), retail space, and hiking trails.[25][26][27] Demolition of the original buildings, including all of the original X-shaped offices built in the 1980s, began in January 2019 and was completed that September.[28][29]\n\n\nThe expanded campus, scheduled to open in 2023, will have 17 office buildings and four floors of underground parking with capacity for 6,500 vehicles.[30] A 1,100-foot (340\u00a0m) pedestrian bridge will connect the new campus buildings to the Redmond Technology light rail station and the West Campus site.[31] A set of 875 wells to harness geothermal energy will provide heating and cooling to buildings on the campus through 220 miles (350\u00a0km) of water pipes that comprise a geoexchange system.[32]\n\n\n\n## Transportation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe campus is located on both sides of the State Route 520 freeway, which connects it to the cities of Bellevue and Seattle as well as Redmond city center. Microsoft partially covered the cost for an overpass over the freeway at NE 36th Street to relieve congestion on other cross-streets in the area.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Redmond Technology station, which replaces the old Overlake Transit Center, under construction in September 2019.\nThe campus is served by Seattle-area buses that make stops along State Route 520\u2014and, in the future, at Redmond Technology station\u2014operated by Sound Transit and King County Metro. The RapidRide B Line also runs through the campus, connecting to downtown Bellevue and Redmond.[34] The transit center opened in 2002 and will be the eastern terminus of the East Link light rail extension, scheduled to open in 2023.[35][36] Microsoft partnered with Sound Transit and the City of Redmond to fund a pedestrian bridge connecting the light rail station to both sides of its campus planned to open in 2020, providing $33.3 million of the cost.[37][38]\n\n\nFor employees, Microsoft also operates a commuter bus service called \"The Connector\" that provides non-stop service from the Redmond campus to neighborhoods in Seattle, the Eastside, and Snohomish County.[39] The shuttles, which began operating in 2007, were targeted in early 2014 as a symbol of gentrification in similar fashion to the San Francisco tech bus protests that same year.[40][41][42] The company also runs a shuttle bus service, called the \"Shuttle Connect\", between buildings on the campus.[43]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Facts About Microsoft\".\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Yu, Hui-yong; Bass, Dina (September 4, 2015). \"Microsoft considers multibillion-dollar overhaul to Redmond campus\". *The Seattle Times*.

The headquarters complex is called Meta Platforms and was previously known as Facebook's headquarters.\n\n2. Amazon - Headquartered in Seattle, Washington and Arlington County, Virginia. The company's main headquarters building in Seattle is called the Doppler building.\n\n3. Apple - Apple Park at 1 Apple Park Way in Cupertino, California. This is their new headquarters campus that opened in 2017, featuring a distinctive ring-shaped main building often called \"the spaceship.\" It replaced their original Apple Campus as the company's headquarters.\n\n4. Microsoft - Microsoft campus in Redmond, Washington. The campus spans 502 acres and has 83 buildings. It has been Microsoft's headquarters since 1986.\n\n5. Alphabet (Google) - While I wasn't able to directly search for Google's headquarters, it is located at the Googleplex in Mountain View, California.\n\nThe headquarters of these companies are all major corporate campuses that house thousands of employees and have become landmarks in their respective regions. Most are located in the San Francisco Bay Area (Meta, Apple, and Google) while Amazon and Microsoft are based in the Seattle metropolitan area, with Amazon also having a second headquarters location in Virginia.",
