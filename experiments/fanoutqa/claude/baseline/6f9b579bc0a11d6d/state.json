The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football.\n\n\nFounded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title *real* is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 83,186-capacity Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (*socios*) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[6] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world, and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023[7][8] and was estimated to be worth $5.1\u00a0billion in 2022, making it the world's most valuable football club.[9] In 2023, it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of \u20ac713.8\u00a0million.[10]\n\n\nBeing one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably *El Cl\u00e1sico* with Barcelona and *El Derbi Madrile\u00f1o* with Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning twelve league titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all time.[11][12] Real Madrid is known for its *Gal\u00e1cticos* policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[13] The term 'Gal\u00e1cticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino P\u00e9rez's presidency of the club (2000-2006 and 2009-2018), however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the *Gal\u00e1cticos* legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also suffered under the policy.[14] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record breaking \u00a380 million (\u20ac94 million);[15] he became both the club and history's all-time top goalscorer.[16][17][18][19] Madrid have recently relaxed the Gal\u00e1cticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham.[20]\n\n\nIn domestic football, the club has won 69 trophies; a record 35 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[21] In European football, Real Madrid have won a record 21 trophies;[note 1] a record 14 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, two UEFA Cups, and a record[note 2] five UEFA Super Cups. In worldwide competitions, they have achieved a record eight club world championships.[note 3] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[27] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[28][29]\n\n\nReal Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[30] whilst also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[31] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (42),[32] tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[33] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (*three-peat*) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955\u201356, 1956\u201357, and 1957\u201358, and second in 2015\u201316, 2016\u201317 and 2017\u201318. In May 2022, they won a record-extending fourteenth Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognized as such by the Guinness World Records.[34] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[35] As of March\u00a02023,[update] Real Madrid are ranked fifth in the UEFA club rankings and first in last ten-years (2013\u20132023) overall.[36][37]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Real Madrid CF\n\nSee also: List of Real Madrid CF seasons\n\n### Early years (1902\u20131943)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Juli\u00e1n Palacios, the first president of the club in 1900\u20131902\nReal Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the *Instituci\u00f3n Libre de Ense\u00f1anza*, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded *(Sociedad) Sky Football* in 1897, commonly known as *La Sociedad* (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, *Nueva Sociedad de Football* (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from *Sky Football*. Among the dissenters were Juli\u00e1n Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padr\u00f3s and Carlos Padr\u00f3s, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, *Sky* was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[38][39][40] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padr\u00f3s had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[4] The Padr\u00f3s brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of *Al Capricho*, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honor of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padr\u00f3s had met on one of his trips.[41][42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Madrid FC team in 1906\nThree years after its founding, in 1905, *Madrid FC* won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Mel\u00e9ndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the *Campo de O'Donnell* in 1912.[43] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[44]\n\n\nIn 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[45] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931\u201332 season and retained it the following year.[46]\n\n\nOn 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11\u20131 in the second leg of the Copa del General\u00edsimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honor of General Franco.[note 4][47] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3\u20130. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fern\u00e1ndez had allowed for Barcelona,[48] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper *Ya* reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[49] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Lluis Mir\u00f3 rarely approached his line\u2014when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: *Reds! Separatists!*... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[50]\n\n\nReal Madrid went 2\u20130 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito Garc\u00eda after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's Jos\u00e9 Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while \u00c1ngel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[51] Madrid made it 8\u20130 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[52] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11\u20131 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[48] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[53]\n\n\n\n### Santiago Bernab\u00e9u and unprecedented success (1943\u20131978)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano led the club to win five consecutive European Cups (currently the Champions League).\nSantiago Bernab\u00e9u became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[54] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol (now known as the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former *Real Madrid Amateurs* player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"*cantera*,\" known today as La F\u00e1brica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Amancio Amaro, captain of the Y\u00e9-y\u00e9 team of the 1960s\nIn 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of *L'\u00c9quipe*, Bernab\u00e9u, Bedrignan and Guszt\u00e1v Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[56] It was under Bernab\u00e9u's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7\u20133 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[55] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honor.[57] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953\u201354 to 1968\u201369, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961\u201365, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[58]\n\n\nThe club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2\u20131 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[59] This team became known as the Y\u00e9-y\u00e9. The name \"Y\u00e9-y\u00e9\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for *Marca* and impersonated the Beatles.[60] The Y\u00e9-y\u00e9 generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[61] and 1964.[59] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[62] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970\u201371 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2\u20131 in a replay.[63] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernab\u00e9u died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honor him during the tournament.[64] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in memory of its former president.\n\n\nBernab\u00e9u had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[65]\n\n\n\n\n### Quinta del Buitre and sustained success (1980\u20132000)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Casillas**\n**Helguera**\n**Karanka**\n**Campo**\n**Salgado**\n**Roberto Carlos**\n**McManaman**\n**Redondo (C)**\n**Anelka**\n**Ra\u00fal**\n**Morientes**\n2000 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nIn the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[66][67] Spanish sport journalist Julio C\u00e9sar Iglesias gave to this generation the name *La Quinta del Buitre* (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butrague\u00f1o. The other four members were Manolo Sanch\u00eds, Mart\u00edn V\u00e1zquez, M\u00edchel and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[66][67] With *La Quinta del Buitre* (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porl\u00e1n *Chendo* and Mexican striker Hugo S\u00e1nchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[66][67] In the early 1990s, *La Quinta del Buitre* split up after Mart\u00edn V\u00e1zquez, Emilio Butrague\u00f1o and M\u00edchel left the club.\n\n\nIn 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[68] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatovi\u0107, Davor \u0160uker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Ra\u00fal, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1\u20130 in the final with a goal from Mijatovi\u0107.[69]\n\n\nIn November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999\u20132000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Ra\u00fal. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents M\u00edchel Salgado and Iv\u00e1n Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3\u20130 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Ra\u00fal.[70] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[71]\n\n\n\n### Florentino P\u00e9rez era (2000\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Gal\u00e1cticos\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**C\u00e9sar**\n**Hierro (c)**\n**Helguera**\n**Salgado**\n**Roberto Carlos**\n**Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9**\n**Figo**\n**Solari**\n**Zidane**\n**Ra\u00fal**\n**Morientes**\n2002 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nIn July 2000, Florentino P\u00e9rez was elected club president.[72] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's \u20ac270\u00a0million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled P\u00e9rez to victory was the signing of Lu\u00eds Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[73] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the *Gal\u00e1cticos* team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Lu\u00eds Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[74] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the field, the *Zidanes y Pavones* policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Beckham and Zidane were considered *Gal\u00e1cticos*.\nThe few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when P\u00e9rez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[76] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[77] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[78] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[78]\n\n\nThe 2005\u201306 season began with the promise of several new signings: J\u00falio Baptista (\u20ac24\u00a0million), Robinho (\u20ac30\u00a0million), and Sergio Ramos (\u20ac27\u00a0million).[79] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0\u20133 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in November 2005.[80] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez Caro.[81] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6\u20131 to Real Zaragoza,[82] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4\u20130 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino P\u00e9rez resigned.[83]\n\n\n\n### Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n era (2006\u20132009)[edit]\n\n\nRam\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[84] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernab\u00e9u while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0\u20131 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0\u20133 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3\u20131 win and their first league title since 2003.[85] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007\u201308, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0\u20135 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u with a humiliating 2\u20136 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Bar\u00e7a that went on to win the treble.[86]\n\n\n\n### Second Florentino P\u00e9rez era (2009\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cristiano Ronaldo was the club's most expensive signing when he joined in 2009, costing \u20ac94 million.\n![](image)Match between Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a and Real Madrid in the 2015\u201316 season.\nOn 1 June 2009, Florentino P\u00e9rez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[87][88] P\u00e9rez continued with the *Gal\u00e1cticos* policy pursued in his first term, buying Kak\u00e1 from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of \u00a356\u00a0million,[89] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for \u00a380\u00a0million.[90] Real Madrid spent in excess of \u20ac261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the *Second Gal\u00e1cticos*.[91] The 2009\u201310 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[92] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018\u201319.[93][94]\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[95][96] In the 2010\u201311 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Bar\u00e7a in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002\u201303. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four *Cl\u00e1sicos* were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1\u20131 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1\u20130 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second *Gal\u00e1ctico* era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[97][98] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2\u20130 away victory and a 1\u20131 home draw).[99] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe.\n\n\nIn the 2011\u201312 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[100] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[101] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3\u20133 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3\u20134 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[102][103]\n\n\nReal Madrid started the 2012\u201313 season by winning the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Bar\u00e7a in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3\u20134 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 1\u20132 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the *Blaugrana* six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modri\u0107 from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of \u00a333\u00a0million.[104] After a loss to Atl\u00e9tico in the Copa del Rey final, P\u00e9rez announced the departure of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[105]\n\n\n\n#### *La D\u00e9cima* and Champions League dominance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Casillas (C)**\n**Ramos**\n**Varane**\n**Carvajal**\n**Coentr\u00e3o**\n**Khedira**\n**Modri\u0107**\n**Di Mar\u00eda**\n**Bale**\n**Ronaldo**\n**Benzema**\n2014 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup, with a front three of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo (dubbed BBC)\n\n![](image)Real Madrid players celebrate the club's historic tenth European Cup / Champions League win (*La D\u00e9cima*) in 2014.\nOn 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[106] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at \u20ac100\u00a0million.[107] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[108] By that time, *Los Blancos* had already secured the Copa del Rey \u2013 against rivals Barcelona \u2013 in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[109] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5\u20130 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[110] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 4\u20131 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"*La D\u00e9cima*\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la \u02c8\u00f0e\u03b8ima]).[111] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[112]\n\n\nAfter winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodr\u00edguez.[113] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[114] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[115]\n\n\nAfter a slow start to the 2014\u201315 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Bar\u00e7a in the 2005\u201306 season.[116] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2\u20130 in the final.[117] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[118] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the very end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2\u20133 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[119] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011\u201312.[120] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[121] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[122][123]\n\n\nOn 3 June 2015, Rafael Ben\u00edtez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015\u201316 season, signing a three-year contract.[124] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3\u20132 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0\u20134 home loss in the first *Cl\u00e1sico* of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6\u20130 vs Espanyol, 8\u20130 vs Malm\u00f6, 10\u20132 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3\u20131 first leg win at C\u00e1diz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president P\u00e9rez.[125][126][127] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Ben\u00edtez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to get good results against top teams.[128] Ben\u00edtez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[129] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favor, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2\u20131 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0\u20132, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3\u20130 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[130] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5\u20133 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid after a 1\u20131 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"*La Und\u00e9cima*\".[131][132][133]\n\n\n\n![](image)2016\u201317 La Liga champions Real Madrid celebrate the title with Community of Madrid President Cristina Cifuentes.\nReal Madrid began their 2016\u201317 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[134] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[135] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4\u20132 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[136] With a 3\u20133 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6\u20133 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[137] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1\u20132 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[138] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3\u20134 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[139] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[140][141] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"*La Duod\u00e9cima*\".[142] The 2016\u201317 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017\u201318 season.[143]\n\n\nReal kicked off the 2017\u201318 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2\u20131 victory against Manchester United.[144] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3\u20131 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a and then defeated Bar\u00e7a 2\u20130 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in *El Cl\u00e1sico* matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[145] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Gr\u00eamio 1\u20130 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[146] In the 2017\u201318 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3\u20131 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[147][148] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the *Second Gal\u00e1ctico Era* that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the *Blaugrana* boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[149] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[150] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Following Ronaldo's departure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of Real Madrid's league performance 1929\u20132023\nOn 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[151][152] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported \u20ac117 million.[153] Madrid began their 2018\u201319 campaign by losing to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 2\u20134 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1\u20135 loss to Barcelona in *El Cl\u00e1sico* on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[154] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4\u20131 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[155] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1\u20134 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1\u20134 (3\u20135 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[156] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001\u201302 and 1999\u20132000 respectively.[157]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jovi\u0107, \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than \u20ac350 million.[158] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a final to win their eleventh title.[159] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[160] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020\u201321 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u underwent extensive renovations.[161][162]\n\n\n\n#### Further domestic success and *La Decimocuarta*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Real Madrid players celebrating the double on 29 May 2022, the day after their Champions League victory\n![](image)\n\n\n\n**Courtois**\n**Milit\u00e3o**\n**Alaba**\n**Carvajal**\n**Mendy**\n**Casemiro**\n**Modri\u0107**\n**Kroos**\n**Valverde**\n**Vin\u00edcius Jr.**\n**Benzema (C)**\n2022 UEFA Champions League Final starting lineup\n\nZidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[163] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021\u201322 season.[164] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a.[165][166][167] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[168] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[169] defeating pre-tournament favorites Paris Saint-Germain,[170][171] defending champions and favorites Chelsea,[172] Premier League champions and heavy favorites Manchester City,[173] all in dramatic fashion,[174] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favorites,[175] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vin\u00edcius goal sealed the 14th European Cup for *Los Blancos*, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[176][177] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956\u201357, 1957\u201358, and 2016\u201317). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favored to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[178]\n\n\n\n## Crests and colours[edit]\n\n\n### Crests[edit]\n\n\n* ![1902](image)\n\n1902\n* ![1908](image)\n\n1908\n* ![1920](image)\n\n1920\n* ![1931](image)\n\n1931\n* ![1941](image)\n\n1941\n* ![2001](image)\n\n2001\n\n\nThe first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol, in dark blue on a white shirt.\nThe first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[179] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[180] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself *Real Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol*.[179]\n\n\nWith the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[46] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[181][54] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name *Real Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol*.[179] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[179]\n\n\n\n### Colours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Real Madrid CF kits (1902\u20132000).\n ![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Real Madrid CF kits (2000\u2013present).\n\n![](image)Real Madrid in 1964. Nicknamed *Los Blancos* (The Whites), the club has worn an all-white home kit except for one season in 1925.\nReal Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padr\u00f3s in honor of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[182] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1\u20135 defeat in Madrid and a 2\u20130 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 5] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[54] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[183]\n\n\nReal's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[184][185] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982\u201383, 1983\u201384 and 1984\u201385 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[186][187] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[188] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[189][190] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth \u20ac70 million per year.[191] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[192] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of \u00a3850 million (\u20ac1 billion), with the club earning \u00a359 million (\u20ac64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[193]\n\n\n\n#### Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Real Madrid's jersey (worn by Luka Modri\u0107 in 2015) is manufactured by Adidas, with Emirates the shirt sponsor.\n\n\n| Period\n | Kit manufacturer\n | Shirt sponsor\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980\u20131982\n | Adidas | \u2014\n |\n| 1982\u20131985\n | Zanussi |\n| 1985\u20131989\n | Hummel | Parmalat |\n| 1989\u20131991\n | Reny Picot\n |\n| 1991\u20131992\n | Otaysa\n |\n| 1992\u20131994\n | Teka |\n| 1994\u20131998\n | Kelme |\n| 1998\u20132001\n | Adidas\n |\n| 2001\u20132002\n | Realmadrid.com[note 6] |\n| 2002\u20132005\n | Siemens mobile |\n| 2005\u20132006\n | Siemens |\n| 2006\u20132007\n | BenQ-Siemens |\n| 2007\u20132013\n | bwin |\n| 2013\u20130000 | Emirates |\n\n\n#### Kit deal[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier | Period | Contractannouncement | Contractduration | Value | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Adidas\n | 1998\u2013present\n |\n| Undisclosed\n | 2015\u20132020 (6 years)\n | Total \u20ac1 billion[194] |  |\n| 8 May 2019\n | 2020\u20132028 (8 years)[195] | Total \u20ac1.1 billion[196] |  |\n\n\n*Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance.*\n\n\n\n## Grounds[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Estadio Chamart\u00edn, Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium, and Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano Stadium\n\n\n\nSantiago Bernab\u00e9u| ![](image) |\n| Capacity | 81,044 |\n| Field size | 107\u00a0m \u00d7\u00a072\u00a0m (351\u00a0ft \u00d7\u00a0236\u00a0ft)[197] |\n| Construction |\n| Broke ground | 27 October 1944 |\n| Opened | 14 December 1947 |\n| Architect | Manuel Mu\u00f1oz Monasterio, Luis Alemany Soler, Antonio Lamela |\n\n\nAfter moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[43] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000\u00a0spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamart\u00edn, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[198] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500\u00a0spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[45] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernab\u00e9u decided that the Chamart\u00edn was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[54][199] Initially knows as *Nuevo Chamart\u00edn*, the stadium was renamed in honor of Bernab\u00e9u in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[55] The first match at the Bernab\u00e9u was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with *Los Blancos* winning 3\u20131 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[54]\n\n\nThe capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[200] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998\u201399 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[200] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[201][202][203][204]\n\n\nThe Bernab\u00e9u has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[205] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[206] On 14 November 2007, the Bernab\u00e9u was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[207]\n\n\nOn 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6\u20131, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[208] For the latter part of the 2019\u201320 season and throughout the 2020\u201321 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u.[209][210]\n\n\nThe latest renovation of the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to just over the 85,000 mark.[211][212] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[213][214] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[215][216]\n\n\n\n## Records and statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Real Madrid CF records and statistics\n\nSee also: Real Madrid CF in international football\n\n![](image)Ra\u00fal is Real Madrid's all-time leader in appearances.\nRa\u00fal holds the record for most Real Madrid appearances, having played 741\u00a0first-team matches from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725\u00a0appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis, Jr., having played 710\u00a0times.[217] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725\u00a0appearances. With\u00a0200 caps, Cristiano Ronaldo is Real's most capped international player. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cristiano Ronaldo is Real Madrid's record goalscorer and the first player ever to score against every team in a single La Liga season.\nCristiano Ronaldo (2009\u20132018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[218][219] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano (1953\u20131964), Santillana (1971\u20131988), Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s (1958\u20131966), Hugo S\u00e1nchez (1985\u20131992), Karim Benzema (2009\u20132023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Ra\u00fal (1994\u20132010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014\u201315), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di St\u00e9fano's 49\u00a0goals in 58\u00a0matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Ra\u00fal in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iv\u00e1n Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[220]\n\n\nOfficially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 83,329, which was for a Copa del Rey match in 2006. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u is 81,044.[221] The club's average attendance in the 2007\u201308 season was 76,234, the highest in European leagues.[222] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (35 as of 2021\u201322) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960\u201365 and 1985\u201390).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[223]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gareth Bale is the club's joint record signing, costing \u20ac100 million in 2013.\nThe club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fourteen times[224] and for the most semi-finals appearances (32). As of June 2023, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers)\u00a0goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955\u201356 to 1969\u201370.[225] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014\u201315 season, a Spanish record and fourth worldwide.[226] The same season, the team tied the record winning streak in the Champions League, with ten games.[227] In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pel\u00e9, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game.[228]\n\n\nIn June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for \u20ac94 million (\u00a380 million).[229][230] The fee of \u20ac77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kak\u00e1 from Milan for \u20ac67 million (\u00a365 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around \u20ac100 million.[107] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of \u20ac100,759,418.[231] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported \u20ac115 million.[232] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for \u20ac117 million.[233]\n\n\n\n## Support[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The number of season tickets at the Bernab\u00e9u is capped at 65,000, with the remaining seats made available to the general public.\nDuring most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[234] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a *socio*, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800\u00a0*pe\u00f1as* (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernab\u00e9u. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[235][236]\n\n\nReal Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called *Ultras Sur* supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio *Irriducibili* fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[237][238] Florentino P\u00e9rez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernab\u00e9u and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernab\u00e9u faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[239][240] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernab\u00e9u and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[241]\n\n\nQuestioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[242] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio Garc\u00eda, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Cl\u00e1sico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[243]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### El Cl\u00e1sico[edit]\n\n\nMain article: El Cl\u00e1sico\n\n![](image)Scene from a 2011 *El Cl\u00e1sico* at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium\nThere is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (*El Cl\u00e1sico*). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[244] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 100 victories for Madrid, 97 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.[245]\n\n\n\n![](image)Real Madrid fans displaying the white of their club before *El Cl\u00e1sico*. Real Madrid fans also often wave Spanish flags at *El Cl\u00e1sico* games.[246]\nAs early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[247][248] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto *M\u00e9s que un club* (*English: More than a club*) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[249]\n\n\nThere is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939\u201375) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del General\u00edsimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del General\u00edsimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11\u20131 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del General\u00edsimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernab\u00e9u's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernab\u00e9u, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[250] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del General\u00edsimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del General\u00edsimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[251][181]\n\n\nThe rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano. Di St\u00e9fano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millionarios in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di St\u00e9fano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Mu\u00f1oz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di St\u00e9fano play the 1953\u201354 and 1955\u201356 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954\u201355 and 1956\u201357 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di St\u00e9fano moved to *Los Blancos*, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di St\u00e9fano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[252]\n\n\nDi St\u00e9fano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[253] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959\u201360 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960\u201361. Ahead of the 1973\u201374 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record \u00a3920,000 from Ajax.[254] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[255] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[256] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[257] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Ra\u00fal silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[257][258] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernab\u00e9u.[257] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[257] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernab\u00e9u by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans \u2013 with his name and number facing them.[257] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Bar\u00e7a's fans with his name and number facing them.[259]\n\n\n\n### El Derbi madrile\u00f1o[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Madrid derby\n\n![](image)Real Madrid supporters during the 2006 *El Derbi madrile\u00f1o* match held at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u\nThe club's nearest neighbour is Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atl\u00e9tico was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2\u20131. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamart\u00edn. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2\u20131.[45] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atl\u00e9tico became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atl\u00e9tico Aviaci\u00f3n), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atl\u00e9tico became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[181] Thus, Atl\u00e9tico fans regularly chanted that Real were *\"El equipo del gobierno, la verg\u00fcenza del pa\u00eds\"* \u2013 \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" \u2013 and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[260][261]\n\n\nThe rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2\u20131 at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, while Atl\u00e9tico won 1\u20130 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2\u20131. Atl\u00e9tico, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach Jos\u00e9 Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del General\u00edsimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[262] In the 1970s, Atl\u00e9tico again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atl\u00e9tico calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[263] It is worth noting that by then, Real Madrid was not very keen on signing non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernab\u00e9u even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, *\"Mientras yo viva, aqu\u00ed no jugar\u00e1 ning\u00fan negro ni un blanco con bigote\"* (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[264] Atl\u00e9tico's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calder\u00f3n (the stadium that Atl\u00e9tico Madrid used until the 2016\u201317 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atl\u00e9tico have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[265][266] In fact, the Atl\u00e9tico crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region).\n\n\nBetween 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atl\u00e9tico offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atl\u00e9tico became the first team to beat Real at the Bernab\u00e9u in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atl\u00e9tico in more recent times is very favorable.[267] A high point came in the 2002\u201303 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4\u20130 victory at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n. Atl\u00e9tico's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013\u201314, Real and Atl\u00e9tico were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4\u20131 comeback victory in extra time.[268] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n, a 4\u20130 loss.[269] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atl\u00e9tico again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[270]\n\n\n\n### El Viejo Cl\u00e1sico[edit]\n\n\nMain article: El Viejo Cl\u00e1sico\n\n![](image)Real Madrid's Guti (left) and Athletic Bilbao's Javi Mart\u00ednez (centre) and Amorebieta (right) during a match at the Bernab\u00e9u, 2010\nA further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Cl\u00e1sico (*the old classic*),[271] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[272][273] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by *El Cl\u00e1sico*.[274]\n\n\nAthletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[275] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the *Lions* have collected no major trophies since 1984 and won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005\u201306 to 2016\u201317.[271][276][277] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[278][261][279]\n\n\n\n### European rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Real Madrid CF in international football \u00a7\u00a0European Cup / UEFA Champions League\n\n#### Bayern Munich[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bayern Munich\u2013Real Madrid rivalry\n\n![](image)Real Madrid players celebrating a goal against Bayern Munich in 2007\nReal Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning fourteen times and Bayern winning six times.[280][281] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[282] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[283][284][285] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\").\n\n\nDuring the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011\u201312 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3\u20133 on aggregate (Bayern won 3\u20131 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium), and then at the same stage in the 2013\u201314 edition with Real Madrid winning 5\u20130 on aggregate on their way to winning the competition.[286] They were also drawn together in the 2016\u201317 quarter-finals; Real Madrid won 6\u20133 on aggregate after extra time and subsequently lifted the trophy.[282] The following year, they met in the semi-finals, with Real Madrid again progressing 4\u20133.[287] Until the 2018\u201319 season, when they were twice defeated in Madrid by three-goal margins,[288][289] Real's biggest loss at home in the Champions League had been at the hands of Bayern on 29 February 2000, 2\u20134.[290]\n\n\n\n#### Juventus[edit]\n\n\nAnother match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[291][292][293]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pre-match display at the 2017 Champions League final between Real Madrid and Juventus\nTheir first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961\u201362 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3\u20131 in a replay held in Paris.[292] At the quarter-final stage in 1995\u201396, Juventus prevailed 2\u20131 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[292] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1\u20130.[292][294] They met again in the 2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4\u20133 on aggregate.[292] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the *Bianconeri* in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record \u20ac77 million deal.[295]\n\n\nThe teams met again in the 2013\u201314 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2\u20131 at home and drawing 2\u20132 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player \u00c1lvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3\u20132 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[292] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4\u20131.[292][296][297]\n\n\nThe latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017\u201318 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4\u20133 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3\u20130 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[298][299] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[300] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[301] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a \u20ac117 million fee.[302]\n\n\n\n## Finances and ownership[edit]\n\n\nIt was under Florentino P\u00e9rez's first presidency (2000\u20132006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[303] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovil\u00edstica de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Lu\u00eds Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[75] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[304]\n\n\nThe sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of \u20ac270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[305] Although P\u00e9rez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[78]\n\n\nBy September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at \u20ac951 million (\u00a3640\u00a0million / $1.285\u00a0billion),[306] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at \u20ac1.333 billion (\u00a3900 million).[307] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[308] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[309]\n\n\nA study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[310] In 2010, *Forbes* evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around \u20ac992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008\u201309 season.[311][312] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of \u20ac401 million in the same period, ranking first.[313]\n\n\nAlong with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[314] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[315] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[316] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 *socios*.[317] At the end of the 2009\u201310 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of \u20ac244.6 million, \u20ac82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of \u20ac170 million after the 2010\u201311 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of \u20ac190 million.[318][319]\n\n\nDuring the 2009\u201310 season, Real Madrid made \u20ac150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[318] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[318] For the 2010\u201311 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled \u20ac169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[320] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, *Forbes* listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3\u00a0billion.[321] Real Madrid was valued at \u20ac3.47\u00a0billion ($4.1\u00a0billion) in 2018, and in the 2016\u201317 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of \u20ac674.6\u00a0million.[10] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was \u00a38.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[322][323] In 2022, *Forbes* listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[9]\n\n\n\n## Popular culture[edit]\n\n\nReal Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the *Goal!* football movie trilogy, *Goal! 2: Living the Dream...* (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Mu\u00f1ez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005\u201306 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Mu\u00f1ez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Ra\u00fal, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, M\u00edchel Salgado, J\u00falio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iv\u00e1n Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Santiago Ca\u00f1izares. In the film, both Florentino P\u00e9rez and Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano presented the fictional player Mu\u00f1ez to the club after his signing.[324]\n\n\n*Real, The Movie* is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on *gal\u00e1cticos* such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Ra\u00fal, Lu\u00eds Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase.\n\n\nThe book *White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid* by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled *Legends*, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[325]\n\n\n\n### Real Madrid TV[edit]\n\n\nReal Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre.\n\n\n\n### *Hala Madrid*[edit]\n\n\n\"Hala Madrid\" redirects here. For the club's anthem, see Hala Madrid y nada m\u00e1s.\n\n*Hala Madrid* is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the *Madridistas Fan Club* card holders.[326] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[327] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[326]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nReal Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times.\n\n\nIn 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being *Real Madrid: The Game*, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay.\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nFor a comprehensive listing of Real Madrid honours, see List of Real Madrid CF records and statistics \u00a7\u00a0Honours.\n\n\n\nReal Madrid CF honours\n| Type\n | Competition\n | Titles\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Domestic** | La Liga[22] | **35** | 1931\u201332, 1932\u201333, 1953\u201354, 1954\u201355, 1956\u201357, 1957\u201358, 1960\u201361, 1961\u201362, 1962\u201363, 1963\u201364, 1964\u201365, 1966\u201367, 1967\u201368, 1968\u201369, 1971\u201372, 1974\u201375, 1975\u201376, 1977\u201378, 1978\u201379, 1979\u201380, 1985\u201386, 1986\u201387, 1987\u201388, 1988\u201389, 1989\u201390, 1994\u201395, 1996\u201397, 2000\u201301, 2002\u201303, 2006\u201307, 2007\u201308, 2011\u201312, 2016\u201317, 2019\u201320, 2021\u201322 |\n| Copa del Rey[22][328] | **20** | 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1917, 1934, 1936, 1946, 1947, 1961\u201362, 1969\u201370, 1973\u201374, 1974\u201375, 1979\u201380, 1981\u201382, 1988\u201389, 1992\u201393, 2010\u201311, 2013\u201314, 2022\u201323 |\n| Copa de la Liga[22] | **1** | 1985 |\n| Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a[22][329] | **12** | 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2017, 2019\u201320, 2021\u201322 |\n| Copa Eva Duarte | **1** | 1947 |\n| **Continental** | European Cup/UEFA Champions League[22] | **14** | 1955\u201356, 1956\u201357, 1957\u201358, 1958\u201359, 1959\u201360, 1965\u201366, 1997\u201398, 1999\u20132000, 2001\u201302, 2013\u201314, 2015\u201316, 2016\u201317, 2017\u201318, 2021\u201322 |\n| UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League[22][330] | **2** | 1984\u201385, 1985\u201386 |\n| UEFA Super Cup[22] | **5**s | 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2022 |\n| Latin Cup[22][23] | **2**s | 1955, 1957 |\n| **Worldwide** | FIFA Club World Cup[22] | **5** | 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2022 |\n| Intercontinental Cup[22][331] | **3**s | 1960, 1998, 2002 |\n| Ibero-American Cup[25][26] | **1** | 1994 |\n| **Regional** | Campeonato de Madrid/Campeonato Regional Centro[22] | **23** | 1903, 1904\u201305, 1905\u201306, 1906\u201307, 1907\u201308, 1912\u201313, 1915\u201316, 1916\u201317, 1917\u201318, 1919\u201320, 1921\u201322, 1922\u201323, 1923\u201324, 1925\u201326, 1926\u201327, 1928\u201329, 1929\u201330, 1930\u201331, 1931\u201332, 1932\u201333, 1933\u201334, 1934\u201335, 1935\u201336\n |\n| Copa Federaci\u00f3n Centro | **4** | 1923, 1928, 1943, 1945\n |\n\n\n* record\n* s shared record\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Real Madrid CF players\n\nFor a list of all former and current Real Madrid CF players with a Wikipedia article, see Category:Real Madrid CF players.\n\nSpanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship.

Likewise, the inclusion of non-UEFA organized Latin Cup would give them a total of 26 titles.[22][23]\n2. **^** A joint record shared with Milan and Barcelona.\n3. **^** Real Madrid have won five FIFA Club World Cup and three Intercontinental Cup titles for a total of eight.[24] Additionally, Real Madrid won a one-off Ibero-American Cup (contested by Copa de Oro and Copa del Rey winners) in 1994.[25][26]\n4. **^** The Copa del Rey, as it was known for the most part of its history, was renamed to *Copa del Presidente de la Rep\u00fablica* by the Second Spanish Republic in 1932 and then to *Copa del General\u00edsimo* by the Francoist government in 1939.\n5. **^** Real Madrid home kit in 1905 was all-white, so the supporters began referring to the players as *Los Blancos.*\n6. **^** Realmadrid.com appeared as shirt sponsor to promote the club's new website.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Real Madrid Club de F\u00fatbol\" (in Spanish).

About 5 km north-west of the city centre, it borders the districts of Lampugnano, QT8, FieraMilano, and Trenno.\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nUntil the 19th century, San Siro was a small settlement, on the banks of the Olona river; its centre was in the surroundings of what is now Piazzale Lotto.[*citation needed*] The area has been radically transformed in the 20th century.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSan Siro is a very diverse district, with wide green areas and cemented neighbourhoods, low-income and high-income housing, villas and apartment blocks.[*citation needed*] Most of the buildings in the area date back to the mid 20th century.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe district is also characterized by prominent sports structures, most notably the Giuseppe Meazza football stadium, home of A.C. Milan and Inter Milan. It also houses the most important Milanese hippodrome, as well as other horse racing-related structures. The Palasport di San Siro arena, mainly used for basketball and volleyball games, was also in this district; it was closed in 1985 when its roof collapsed after a large snowfall.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Coat of arms of Milan](image) Zones and quarters of Milan ![Coat of arms of Milan](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| Zone 1 | * Brera\n* Centro Storico\n* Conca del Naviglio\n* Guastalla\n* Porta Sempione\n* Porta Tenaglia\n |\n| Zone 2 | * Adriano\n* Crescenzago\n* Gorla\n* Greco\n* Loreto\n* Maggiolina\n* Mandello\n* Mirabello\n* Ponte Seveso\n* Porta Nuova\n* Precotto\n* Stazione Centrale\n* Turro\n* Villaggio dei Giornalisti\n |\n| Zone 3 | * Casoretto\n* Cimiano\n* Citt\u00e0 Studi\n* Dosso\n* Lambrate\n* Ortica\n* Porta Monforte\n* Porta Venezia\n* Quartiere Feltre\n* Rottole\n |\n| Zone 4 | * Acquabella\n* Calvairate\n* Castagnedo\n* Cavriano\n* Forlanini\n* Gamboloita\n* La Trecca\n* Monlu\u00e8\n* Morsenchio\n* Nosedo\n* Omero\n* Ponte Lambro\n* Porta Vittoria\n* Porta Romana\n* Rogoredo\n* San Luigi\n* Santa Giulia\n* Taliedo\n* Triulzo Superiore\n |\n| Zone 5 | * Basmetto\n* Cantalupa\n* Case Nuove\n* Chiaravalle\n* Chiesa Rossa\n* Conca Fallata\n* Fatima\n* Gratosoglio\n* Le Terrazze\n* Macconago\n* Missaglia\n* Morivione\n* Porta Lodovica\n* Porta Vigentina\n* Quintosole\n* Ronchetto delle Rane\n* San Gottardo\n* Selvanesco\n* Stadera\n* Torretta\n* Vaiano Valle\n* Vigentino\n |\n| Zone 6 | * Arzaga\n* Barona\n* Boffalora\n* Cascina Bianca\n* Conchetta\n* Creta\n* Foppette\n* Giambellino-Lorenteggio\n* Lodovico il Moro\n* Moncucco\n* Porta Genova\n* Porta Ticinese\n* Ronchetto sul Naviglio\n* San Cristoforo\n* Sant'Ambrogio\n* Teramo\n* Villa Magentino\n* Villaggio dei Fiori\n |\n| Zone 7 | * Assiano\n* Baggio\n* Figino\n* Fopponino\n* Forze Armate\n* Harar\n* La Maddalena\n* Muggiano\n* Porta Magenta\n* Quartiere degli Olmi\n* Quarto Cagnino\n* Quinto Romano\n* San Siro\n* Valsesia\n* Vercellese\n |\n| Zone 8 | * Boldinasco\n* Bullona\n* Cagnola\n* Campo dei Fiori\n* Cascina Triulza\n* Comina\n* Fiera\n* Gallaratese\n* Garegnano\n* Ghisolfa\n* Lampugnano\n* Musocco\n* Porta Volta\n* Portello\n* Quarto Oggiaro\n* QT8\n* Roserio\n* San Leonardo\n* Trenno\n* Varesina\n* Vialba\n* Villapizzone\n |\n| Zone 9 | * Affori\n* Bicocca\n* Bovisa\n* Bovisasca\n* Bruzzano\n* Ca' Granda\n* Centro Direzionale\n* Comasina\n* Dergano\n* Fulvio Testi\n* Isola\n* La Fontana\n* Montalbino\n* Niguarda\n* Porta Garibaldi\n* Porta Nuova\n* Prato Centenaro\n* Segnano\n |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Stub icon](image) | This article on a location in the Province of Milan is a stub.

Widely known for its exterior of inflated ETFE plastic panels, it is the first stadium in the world with a full colour changing exterior. Located at 25 Werner-Heisenberg-Allee at the northern edge of Munich's Schwabing-Freimann borough on the Fr\u00f6ttmaning Heath, it is the second-largest arena in Germany behind Westfalenstadion in Dortmund.\n\n\nFC Bayern Munich has played its home games at the Allianz Arena since the start of the 2005\u201306 season. The club had previously played their home games at the Munich Olympic Stadium since 1972. 1860 Munich previously had a 50 per cent share in the stadium, but Bayern Munich purchased their shares for \u20ac11 million in April 2006 due to 1860 Munich suffering from financial issues. The arrangement allowed 1860 Munich to play at the stadium while retaining no ownership until 2025.[4] However, in July 2017 Bayern terminated the rental contract with 1860, making themselves the sole tenants of the stadium.[5]\n\n\nThe large locally based financial services provider Allianz purchased the naming rights to the stadium for 30 years. However, this name cannot be used when hosting FIFA and UEFA events, since these governing bodies have policies forbidding corporate sponsorship from companies that are not official tournament partners. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was referred to as FIFA WM-Stadion M\u00fcnchen (FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich). In UEFA club and Nations League matches, it is known as the Fu\u00dfball Arena M\u00fcnchen [\u02c8fu\u02d0sbal \u0294a\u02cc\u0281e\u02d0na \u02c8m\u028fn\u00e7n\u0329] (Football Arena Munich), and it hosted the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final[6] and will host the upcoming 2025 final, moved from 2023.[7] Since 2012 the museum of Bayern Munich, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, has been located inside the Allianz Arena.\n\n\nIn 2022, it hosted the first-ever regular season National Football League (NFL) American football game played in Germany as part of the NFL International Series.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Part of Allianz Arena roof's sun-shade blinds rolled open\n![](image)Illumination during the UEFA Champions League final 2011\u201312\n![](image)Allianz Arena with the Holy Cross Church, the oldest church of Munich\n\n## Design[edit]\n\n\n### Capacity[edit]\n\n\nEffective with the city's approval of modifications that was granted 16 January 2006, the legal capacity of the stadium increased from 69,000 to 71,000 spectators (including standing room). The lower tier can seat up to 20,000, the middle tier up to 24,000, and the upper tier up to 22,000. 10,400 of the seats in the lower tier corners can be converted to standing room to allow an additional 3,120 spectators. The total capacity includes 2,000 business seats, 400 seats for the press, 106 luxury boxes with seating for up to 174, and 165 berths for wheelchairs and the like. From the second half of the 2005\u201306 Bundesliga season, the arena is able to accommodate 69,901 spectators at league and DFB-Pokal games, but because of UEFA regulations, the capacity remained at 66,000 seats for UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup games. Bayern Munich limited capacity during their league and cup games to 69,000. The partial roof covers all seats, although winds can still blow rain onto some of them. Prior to the 2012\u201313 season, Bayern Munich announced that capacity had been increased to 71,000 for domestic matches and 68,000 for UEFA matches, with the addition of 2,000 seats in the upper tier of the arena.[9]\n\n\nAllianz Arena also offers three-day-care centers and a fan shop, the FC Bayern Munich Megastore. Merchandise is offered at stands all along the inside of the exterior wall inside the area behind the seats. Numerous restaurants and fast-food establishments are also located around the stadium.\n\n\nThere are four team locker rooms (one each for the two home teams and their respective opponents), four coaches' locker rooms, and two locker rooms for referees. Two areas are provided where athletes can warm up (approx. 110 m2 each). There are also 550 toilets and 190 monitors in the arena.\n\n\nOn 28 April 2013, FC Bayern announced to sell 300 more tickets in the S\u00fcdkurve starting with the 2013\u201314 Bundesliga season.[10]\n\n\nOn 21 January 2014, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge declared that FC Bayern discusses a further expansion of the Allianz Arena.[11] About 2,000 new seats to be installed in the upper tier and about 2,000 more tickets are to be sold in the Nord- and S\u00fcdkurve. In August 2014, it was reported that the capacity expansion was completed leading to a new maximum capacity of 75,024 in the Bundesliga and 69,334 in international matches.[12] An expansion was approved in January 2015 to expand the stadium's capacity to 75,000 for Bundesliga Games and 70,000 for games in the Champions League.[13]\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Allianz Arena under construction (August 2004)\nThe stadium construction began on 21 October 2002 and was officially opened on 30 May 2005. The primary designers are architects Herzog & de Meuron. The stadium is designed so that the main entrance to the stadium would be from an elevated esplanade separated from the parking space consisting of Europe's biggest underground car park.[14] The roof of the stadium has built-in roller blinds which may be drawn back and forth during games to provide protection from the sun.\n\n\n\n* Total concrete used during stadium construction: 120,000 m\u00b3\n* Total concrete used for the parking garage: 85,000 m\u00b3\n* Total steel used during stadium construction: 22,000 tonnes\n* Total steel used for the parking garage: 14,000 tonnes\n\n\n### Luminous exterior[edit]\n\n\nThe arena facade is constructed of 2,874 ETFE-foil air panels that are kept inflated with dry air to a differential pressure of 3.5 Pa.[15] The panels appear white from far away but when examined closely, there are little dots on the panels. When viewed from far away, the eye combines the dots and sees white. When viewed close up however, it is possible to see through the foil. The foil has a thickness of 0.2\u00a0mm. Each panel can be independently lit with white, red, or blue light. The panels are lit for each game with the colours of the respective home team\u2014red for Bayern Munich, blue for TSV and white for the Germany national team. White is also used when the stadium is a neutral venue, like the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final. Other colours or multicolour or interchanging lighting schemes are theoretically possible, but the Munich Police strongly insists on using a single-colour lighting scheme due to several car accidents on the nearby A9 Autobahn with drivers being distracted by the changing lights.\n\n\nAllianz Arena's innovative stadium-facade lighting concept has been subsequently adopted in other recently built venues, like MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which lights up in blue for the National Football League's Giants and green for the Jets. With electricity costs for the light of about \u20ac50 (USD$75) per hour, the construction emits enough light that, on clear nights, the stadium can easily be spotted from Austrian mountain tops, e.g. from a distance of 50 miles (80\u00a0km).\n\n\n\n![](image)Allianz Arena\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nPatrons may park their cars in Europe's largest parking structure, comprising four four-story parking garages with 9,800 parking places. In addition, 1,200 places were built into the first two tiers of the arena, 350 places are available for buses (240 at the north end, and 110 at the south entrance), and 130 more spots are reserved for those with disabilities.\n\n\nThe stadium is located next to the Fr\u00f6ttmaning U-Bahn station. This is on the U6 line of the Munich U-Bahn.\n\n\n\n### Surroundings[edit]\n\n\nFrom the subway station just south of the arena, visitors approach the stadium through a park that was designed to disentangle and guide them to the entrance. An esplanade rises gradually from ground level at the subway station entrance, practically building the parking garage's cover, to the entrance level of the stadium. On the other side of the Autobahn, the Fr\u00f6ttmaning Hill with its windmill affords a marvellous view on the stadium. Also the Romanesque Heilig-Kreuz-Kirche, the oldest structure on the area of the City of Munich designed to serve religious purposes, is located there together with its copy, an artwork in concrete as a reminder for the village of Fr\u00f6ttmaning which disappeared with the construction of the Autobahn.\n\n\n\n### Owners[edit]\n\n\nThe arena was commissioned by the Allianz Arena M\u00fcnchen Stadion GmbH, founded in 2001, and was owned in equal parts by the two football clubs that called it home. The GmbH's CEO was Karl-Heinz Wildmoser Jr. until the unraveling of the stadium corruption affair (see below). Since then, Bernd Rauch, Peter Kerspe, and Walter Leidecker have led the company. In April 2006, FC Bayern Munich bought out TSV 1860 Munich's 50 per cent share in the arena for a reported \u20ac11\u00a0million. 1860 managing director Stefan Ziffzer stated that the deal prevented insolvency for the club. The terms of the agreement gave 1860 the right to buy back their 50 per cent share of the arena for the price of sale plus interest anytime before June 2010. In November 2007, 1860 Munich resigned that right. In advance, the income of two friendly-games both clubs shared equally instead of having that money going to Allianz Arena GmbH. Due to 1860 Munich's financial turbulence, Bayern Munich took over all the shares and owns 100 per cent of the Allianz Arena.\n\n\n\n### Name[edit]\n\n\nAllianz paid significant sums for the right to lend its name to the stadium for a duration of 30 years. However, as Allianz was not a sponsor of the 2006 World Cup and is not an official UEFA sponsor, the Allianz logo had to be removed during the World Cup and is covered during Champions League games.\n\n\n\n### Cost[edit]\n\n\nThe cost of the construction itself ran to \u20ac286\u00a0million but financing costs raised that figure to a total of \u20ac340\u00a0million. In addition, the city and State incurred approximately \u20ac210\u00a0million for area development and infrastructure improvements.\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial photo of Allianz Arena with surrounding area shortly before construction was complete (January 2005)\nOn 14 November 2005 at the annual general meeting, many FC Bayern Munich club members complained about the uncomfortable draft inside the arena. As a result, closable doors were installed and spectators now enjoy watching the games in greater comfort.\n\n\nThe Ultras and many other fans protested at several home games against the seats and some of the rules of the arena which they perceive as \"fan unfriendly.\" For example, a spectator may not enter with a megaphone or a pennant that a single person cannot carry unfurled, and pennant poles with a length of over one metre are prohibited. The complaint is that these rules and the designer seats put a damper on the fan experience. The presence of a large fence and safety nets in front of the southern curve (seat bloc reserved for fans of FC Bayern Munich) are also often criticized.\n\n\nThese complaints have had some success. From the 2006\u201307 season, blocks 112 and 113 have been converted into terracing, in the usual German style so that seats can be installed for UEFA and international matches, whose regulations demand seating for all spectators.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seating area of the Allianz Arena\nOn 21 October 2002, voters went to the polls to determine whether a new stadium should be built in this location and whether the city of Munich should provide the necessary infrastructure. About two-thirds of the voters decided in favor of the proposition. An alternative to constructing the new arena had been a major reconstruction of the Olympic Stadium but this option had been refused by its architect G\u00fcnther Behnisch.\n\n\nSwiss architect firm Herzog & de Meuron then developed the concept of the stadium with a see-through exterior made of ETFE-foil panels that can be lit from the inside and are self-cleaning. Construction started in late 2002 and was completed by the end of April 2005.\n\n\nThe Fr\u00f6ttmaning and Marienplatz stations of the subway line U6 were expanded and improved in conjunction with the arena construction. The Fr\u00f6ttmaning subway stations platforms were moved slightly southwards and expanded from two to four tracks, while the Marienplatz U-Bahn station was outfitted with additional pedestrian connector tunnels running parallel to the subway tracks, which lead towards the S-Bahn portion of the station, lessening congestion among passengers making connections to the Munich S-Bahn. To be able to handle the additional traffic load, the Autobahn A9 was expanded to three and four lanes in each direction and another exit was added to the A99 north of the arena.\n\n\nOn 19 May 2012, the 2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League final was held at the Allianz Arena. Bayern Munich, who were drawn as home team, was set to play against Chelsea. Chelsea won on penalties after the game had tied 1\u20131 after regulation and extra time. Bastian Schweinsteiger's penalty hit Petr \u010cech's left post, and Didier Drogba scored the winning penalty. On 25 May 2012, Bayern opened a museum about its history, FC Bayern Erlebniswelt, inside the Allianz Arena.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)The stadium's interior following the so-called \"Bayernization\" in 2018\nFollowing the departure of TSV 1860 Munich from the stadium due to its relegation to 3. Liga in 2016\u201317, Bayern Munich went on to give Allianz Arena a significant facelift a year later, replacing old grey seats with new ones that create a combination of red and white, the colors of the club. The stadium now presents FC Bayern crest on the stand, the \"FC Bayern M\u00fcnchen\" writing on one side and the \"Mia San Mia\" \u2013 the club's motto \u2013 on the other. Furthermore, several other modifications have also been made, including decorating walls with images of the club's history, bringing a larger quantity of red, and the opening of the FC Bayern store.[17]\n\n\n\n### Stadium corruption affair[edit]\n\n\nBetween March 2004 and August 2006, a corruption affair relating to the stadium occupied the football world and German courts. On 9 March 2004, Karl-Heinz Wildmoser Sr., president of TSV 1860 Munich, his son Karl-Heinz Wildmoser Jr., chief executive officer of Allianz Arena M\u00fcnchen Stadion GmbH, and two others were charged with corruption in connection with the award of arena construction contracts and taken into custody. On 12 March, Wildmoser Sr. struck a plea bargain and was released. As part of the plea bargain, he relinquished the presidency of the club three days later, and on 18 May, the investigation into his conduct was closed.\n\n\nHis son, Karl-Heinz Wildmoser Jr., remained in custody. At a bail hearing on 29 June, the judge refused bail on the grounds of danger of flight and obstruction of justice. The District Attorney filed charges on 23 August 2004, accusing him of fraud, corruption and tax evasion. The case was that Wildmoser Jr. had awarded the construction contract at an inflated price, provided the Austrian builder Alpine with inside information that enabled the builder to win the contract, and in return received \u20ac2.8 million.\n\n\nOn 13 May 2005, Karl-Heinz Wildmoser Jr. was convicted and sentenced by a Munich court to four and a half years in prison. He was released on bail pending his appeal. The Federal Court of Justice rejected the appeal in August 2006.\n\n\n\n![](image)Allianz Arena during a match in November 2014\n### Opening day[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Test illumination in March 2005\nOn 30 May 2005, 1860 Munich played an exhibition game against 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg and won, 3\u20132. The next day, the record German champions Bayern Munich played a game against the Germany national team.[18] Both games had been sold out since early March 2005. Patrick Milchraum of TSV 1860 scored the first official goal at the stadium.\n\n\nOn 2 June 2005, in response to high demand, the first \"arena derby\" took place between the two tenants. That game was won by TSV 1860 with the help of a goal by Paul Agostino.\n\n\nPrior to opening day, the alumni teams of both clubs played each other in an exhibition game in front of a crowd of 30,000. During the game, all stadium functions were thoroughly tested.\n\n\nThe stadium's first goal in a competitive game went to Roy Makaay of FC Bayern in the semi-finals of 2005 DFL-Ligapokal on 26 July 2005. In the same game, Thomas Hitzlsperger of VfB Stuttgart scored the first goal in an official game by a visiting team. The game ended with a 2\u20131 win for Stuttgart.\n\n\nThe first goal in a league game was scored by Owen Hargreaves of FC Bayern when the home team won 3\u20130 in its 2005\u201306 Bundesliga season opener against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach on 5 August 2005. The first goal in a league game by a visiting team was scored by Dynamo Dresden on 9 September 2005 in the 2. Bundesliga match against 1860 Munich. That game ended in a score of 1\u20132 in front of a full house which included approximately 20,000 \u2013 22,000 fans who had traveled to Munich from Dresden for the game. Dresden thus became the first visiting team to win a league game at Allianz Arena.\n\n\nThe first goal against FC Bayern Munich in a league game at Allianz Arena was scored by Miroslav Klose of Werder Bremen on 5 November 2005 in the first minute of play. This was to remain the visitors' only goal that day, as the game went to the FC Bayern with a final score of 3\u20131.\n\n\nFC Bayern broke its consecutive sell-out record by selling out each of its first ten home games at Allianz Arena.\n\n\n\n![](image)Inside Allianz Arena during a match between Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich, 10 June 2005\n## International tournament matches[edit]\n\n\n### 2006 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

It was originally the home of Everton from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park after a dispute with the club president.[3]\n\n\nThe stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End.[4] The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952.[5] The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity.\n\n\nTwo gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. Both managers have been honoured with statues outside the stadium: Shankly's unveiled in 1997 by the Kop Stand and Paisley's in 2020 by the Main Stand. The ground is 2 miles (3\u00a0km) from Liverpool Lime Street railway station.\n\n\nIt was proposed in 2002 for the club to relocate to a new stadium in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen, with the decision being taken to expand Anfield instead. Construction for an extension to the main stand began on 8 December 2014.[6] This extension, one of the largest all-seater single stands in European football, opened to the public on 9 September 2016, increasing the stadium capacity to 53,394.[7]\nThe Anfield Road Stand is currently being redeveloped to bring the stadium capacity to 61,000. It is due to be completed within the 2023\u201324 season.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial to John Houlding (1833\u20131902) outside Anfield on the 125th anniversary of Liverpool F.C.\nThe stadium is named after the surrounding area, Anfield. The word originated in the combination of Old and Middle English words, which mean \"a field on a slope\". Anfield, and its deviations, has been associated with the area since at least 1642.[9][10] It has been suggested that the name is linked to the influx of Irish people into the spreading city in the 1850s, and was associated with Annefield, outside New Ross, County Wexford, Ireland.[11][12] Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally owned by John Orrell, a minor land owner who was a friend of Everton F.C. member John Houlding.[13] Everton, who previously played at Priory Road, were in need of a new venue owing to the noise produced by the crowd on match days.[14] Orrell lent the pitch to the club in exchange for a small rent. The first match at the ground was between Everton and Earlestown on 28 September 1884, which Everton won 5\u20130.[15] During Everton's tenure at the stadium, stands were erected for some of the 8,000-plus spectators regularly attending matches, although the ground was capable of holding around 20,000 spectators and occasionally did. The ground was considered of international standard at the time, playing host to the British Home Championship match between England and Ireland in 1889. Anfield's first league match was played on 8 September 1888, between Everton and Accrington F.C. Everton quickly improved as a team, and became Anfield's first league champions in the 1890\u201391 season.[16]\n\n\nIn 1892, negotiations to purchase the land at Anfield from Orrell escalated into a dispute between Houlding and the Everton F.C. committee over how the club was run. Events culminated in Everton's move to Goodison Park.[14] Houlding was left with an empty stadium, and decided to form a new club to occupy it. The new team was called Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd, and the club's first match at Anfield was a friendly played in front of 200 people on 1 September 1892, against Rotherham Town. Liverpool won 7\u20131.[17]\n\n\n\n![A white flagpole in front of football ground](image)The topmast rescued from the SS\u00a0*Great Eastern*\nLiverpool's first Football League match at Anfield was played on 9 September 1893, against Lincoln City. Liverpool won 4\u20130 in front of 5,000\u00a0spectators.[18] A new stand capable of holding 3,000\u00a0spectators was constructed in 1895 on the site of the present Main Stand. Designed by architect Archibald Leitch,[19] the stand had a distinctive red and white gable, and was similar to the main stand at Newcastle United's ground St James' Park.[17] Another stand was constructed at the Anfield Road end in 1903, built from timber and corrugated iron. After Liverpool had won their second League championship in 1906, a new stand was built along the Walton Breck Road. Local journalist Ernest Edwards, who was the sports editor of newspapers the *Liverpool Daily Post* and *Echo*, named it the Spion Kop; it was named after a famous hill in South Africa where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the Boer War in 1900. More than 300\u00a0men had died, many of them from Liverpool, as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop. Around the same period a stand was also built along Kemlyn Road.[20]\n\n\nThe ground remained much the same until 1928, when the Kop was redesigned and extended to hold 30,000\u00a0spectators, all standing. A roof was erected as well.[21] Many stadia in England had stands named after the Spion Kop. Anfield's was the largest Kop in the country at the time\u2014it was able to hold more supporters than some entire football grounds.[22] In the same year the topmast of the SS\u00a0*Great Eastern*, one of the first iron ships, was rescued from the ship breaking yard at nearby Rock Ferry, and was hauled up Everton Valley by a team of horses, to be erected alongside the new Kop. It still stands there, serving as a flag pole.[20]\n\n\n\n![Photograph of a stand full of people. In front of the stand is a field and a goal.](image)The Kop in 1974, before the Taylor Report recommended standing areas in football grounds be outlawed following the Hillsborough disaster in 1989.\nFloodlights were installed at a cost of \u00a312,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Liverpool County Football Association.[22] In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a cantilevered stand, built at a cost of \u00a3350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators.[23] Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973.[23] In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie unlocked them for the first time on 26 August 1982.[20] Across the Shankly Gates are the words *You'll Never Walk Alone*, the title of the hit song by Gerry and the Pacemakers adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem during Shankly's time as manager.[24]\n\n\nColoured seats and a police room were added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1987. After the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 when Police mismanagement led to overcrowding and the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans, the Taylor Report recommended that all grounds in the country should be converted into all-seater grounds by May 1994.[25] A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1992, turning it into a double-decker layout. It included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11,000\u00a0seating spaces. Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s, and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 because two sisters,[26] Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house. When the club reached an agreement with the sisters in 1990, the expansion plans were put into action.[27] The stand\u2014renamed the Centenary Stand\u2014was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by UEFA president Lennart Johansson. The Kop was rebuilt in 1994 after the recommendations of the Taylor Report and became all seated; it is still a single tier, and the capacity was significantly reduced to 12,390.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982 in tribute to Bill Shankly (1913\u20131981)\nOn 4 December 1997, a bronze statue of Bill Shankly was unveiled at the visitors' centre in front of the Kop. Standing at over 8 feet (2.4\u00a0m) tall, the statue depicts Shankly with a fan's scarf around his neck, in a familiar pose he adopted when receiving applause from fans. Inscribed on the statue are the words \"Bill Shankly \u2013 He Made The People Happy\".[28] The Hillsborough memorial was situated alongside the Shankly Gates before it was moved next to 97 Avenue in front of the redeveloped main stand in 2016.[29] The memorial is always decorated with flowers and tributes to the 97\u00a0people who died as a result of the disaster. At the centre of the memorial is an eternal flame, signifying that those who died will never be forgotten.[29]\n\n\nIn 1998 a new two-tier Anfield Road end was opened. The stand has encountered a number of problems since its redevelopment; at the beginning of the 1999\u20132000 season, a series of support poles and stanchions had to be brought in to give extra stability to the top tier of the stand. During Ronnie Moran's testimonial match against Celtic, many fans complained of movement of the top tier. At the same time that the stanchions were inserted, the executive seating area was expanded by two rows in the main stand, lowering the seating capacity in the paddock.[30]\n\n\nOn 30 January 2020, a bronze statue of Bob Paisley was unveiled outside the Main Stand in Paisley Square. The statue was commissioned and donated by the club's main sponsor, Standard Chartered, to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the relationship with the club.[31] The statue is 8\u00a0ft (2.4\u00a0m) tall and depicts an iconic image of the club's history, Paisley carrying future club captain Emlyn Hughes off the field during a match against Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield in April 1968.[32]\n\n\n\n## Structures and facilities[edit]\n\n\n![diagram of a stadium](image)Outline of Anfield pre-2015 redevelopment; The Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand (top), The Kop (right), Main Stand (bottom) and Anfield Road stand (left)\nAnfield comprises 53,394 seats split between four stands: the Anfield Road end, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop, and the Main Stand. The Anfield Road end and Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand are two-tiered, while the Kop is single-tiered and the Main Stand three-tiered.[33] Entry to the stadium is gained by radio-frequency identification (RFID) smart cards rather than the traditional staffed turnstile. This system, used in all 80\u00a0turnstiles around Anfield, was introduced in 2005.[34]\n\n\nPlans to replace Anfield with a new 60,000-capacity stadium in adjacent Stanley Park were initiated in 2002.[35] The plans were revisited under the ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillett.[36] Following the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group (Then known as New England Sports Ventures (NESV)) in 2010, the owners have abandoned the proposed new stadium in Stanley Park, preferring instead to redevelop and expand Anfield,[37] thus echoing their decision to renovate Fenway Park.\nThe Kop is a large single-tiered stand. Originally a large terraced banking providing accommodation for more than 30,000\u00a0spectators, the current incarnation was constructed in 1994\u201395 and is single-tiered with no executive boxes. The Kop houses the club's museum, the Reducate centre and the official club shop.[38] The Kop is the most-renowned stand at Anfield among home and away supporters, with the people who occupy the stand referred to as *kopites*. Such is the reputation of the stand that it was claimed that the crowd in the Kop could suck the ball into the goal.[39] Traditionally, Liverpool's most vocal supporters congregate in this stand.[40]\n\n\n\n![steps leading down to tunnel, above the tunnel is a sign with This Is Anfield in white letters on a red background, with a crest on it](image)The old tunnel to the pitch at Anfield. The \"This is Anfield\" sign was installed by former manager Bill Shankly to instill fear into the opposition.\nThe oldest stand at Anfield is the Main Stand, taking 76 years to complete. The stand was completed in 2016, however, the lower section dates from 1906. The bottom tier of the stand houses the directors' box. The directors' VIP box is located at the rear of the lower tier of the stand. The old large roof was supported by two thin central uprights, with a large suspended television camera gantry which has moved to the front of the third tier.[41] The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match are in the middle of the stand at pitch level. Above the stairs leading down to the pitch hung a sign stating \"THIS IS ANFIELD\". Its purpose was to both intimidate the opposition and to bring the Liverpool players who touch it good luck. Accordingly, Liverpool players and coaching staff traditionally reached up and placed one or both hands on it as they passed underneath.[42]\n\n\nThe sign was temporarily removed during the most recent reconstruction of the Main Stand; it was placed at the exit from the new Main Stand tunnel to the pitch in advance of Liverpool's 2016\u201317 home opener.[43] Current Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp had banned players from touching the restored sign until the team had won at least one major trophy.[44] After winning the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final players are now allowed to do so again.[45] Praising the impact the Anfield atmosphere has on the home team and the effect it has on the away team, opposition manager Pep Guardiola states, \"The motto 'This is Anfield' is no marketing spin. There's something about it that you will find in no other stadium in the world.\"[46] Following the 2005 Champions League semi-final second leg at Anfield which Liverpool won 1\u20130, defeated Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho recognised the role Liverpool fans played on the match: \"I felt the power of Anfield, it was magnificent.\"[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Paisley Gateway was erected outside the Kop in 1999 in tribute to former manager Bob Paisley (1918\u20131996). It includes a depiction of the three European Cups he won during his tenure.\nThe Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand is a two-tiered stand. Originally a single-tiered stand called the Kemlyn Road Stand, the second tier was added in 1992 to coincide with the club's centenary.[48] It is located opposite the Main Stand and houses directors' boxes, which are between the two tiers. The stand also houses the ground's police station.[33] On 3 May 2017, Liverpool announced the Centenary Stand would be renamed the Kenny Dalglish Stand in honour of the club's greatest servant, former player and manager Kenny Dalglish.[49]\n\n\nThe Anfield Road stand, on the left side of the Main Stand, houses the away fans during matches. The Anfield Road End was rebuilt in 1965, and multi-coloured seats were added in 1982. Originally a single-tier stand, a further revamp, which was completed in 1998, gave the stand a second-tier providing additional seating.[48]\n\n\nThere are 59\u00a0spaces available in the stadium to accommodate wheelchair users who have season tickets; a further 33 spaces are available for general sale and 8 are allocated to away supporters. These spaces are located in the Main Stand, Anfield Road Stand and The Kop. There are 38\u00a0spaces available for the visually impaired, which are situated in the old paddock area of the Main Stand, with space for one personal assistant each. A headset with full commentary is provided.[50]\n\n\nThe stadium features tributes to two of the club's most successful managers. The Paisley Gateway is a tribute to Bob Paisley, who guided Liverpool to three European Cups and six League Championships in the 1970s, and 1980s. The gates were erected at the Kop; their design includes representations of the three European Cups Paisley won during his tenure, the crest of his birthplace in Hetton-le-Hole, and the crest of Liverpool F.C.[51] The Shankly Gates, in tribute of Bill Shankly, Paisley's predecessor between 1959 and 1974, are at the Anfield Road end. Their design includes a Scottish flag, a Scottish thistle, the Liverpool badge, and the words \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of Anfield from the Anfield Road Stand, showing from left to right the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop Stand and the former Main Stand in 2012\n\n## Redevelopment[edit]\n\n\n### Abandoned new stadium plans[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stanley Park Stadium\n\n![A stand which is full of people standing to support their team. There are a number of flags, scarfs, and banners in the crowd.](image)*The Kop*; the atmosphere generated by the crowd in the stand led owner John W. Henry to reconsider the construction of a new stadium.\nPlans to replace Anfield were originally started by Liverpool F.C. in May 2002.[53] The proposed capacity was 55,000, but it was later changed to 61,000, with 1,000\u00a0seats given for segregation between home and away fans. Several attempts were made between 2003 and 2007 by the Liverpool City Council to instigate a groundshare of the proposed stadium with local rivals Everton, but this move was rejected, as neither club favoured it.[54] On 30 July 2004 Liverpool was granted planning permission to build a new stadium 300 yards (270\u00a0m) away from Anfield at Stanley Park.[55] On 8 September 2006 Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool F.C. a 999-year lease of the land on the proposed site.[56]\n\n\nFollowing the takeover of Liverpool F.C. on 6 February 2007 by George Gillett and Tom Hicks, the proposed stadium was redesigned. In November 2007 the redesigned layout was approved by the council, and construction was due to start in early 2008.[57] The new stadium, provisionally called Stanley Park Stadium, was to be built by HKS, Inc. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60,000.[58] If the new stadium had been built, Anfield would have been demolished. The land would have become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development, which would have included a hotel, restaurants, and offices.[59] However, the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession, which directly affected the then American owners. The situation was worsened because the club was bought with borrowed money, not the owners' capital, and interest rates were higher than expected.[60] Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60\u00a0days of acquisition of the club, but had trouble financing the estimated \u00a3500\u00a0million needed for the Stanley Park development. The deadline passed and the plan was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group, as their preference was to re-develop Anfield.[61]\n\n\n\n### Anfield redevelopment[edit]\n\n\nThe acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in October 2010 put into question whether Liverpool would leave Anfield. In February 2011 the new club owner, John W. Henry, stated he had a preference for staying at Anfield and expanding the capacity. After attending a number of games at Anfield, Henry stated that \"the Kop is unrivalled\", adding \"it would be hard to replicate that feeling anywhere else\".[61]\nOn 15 October 2012, Liverpool City Council announced plans to regenerate the Anfield area after securing a \u00a325m grant, with a housing association also set to invest.[62][63]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Main Stand redevelopment in March 2016\nOn 23 August 2013 Anfield was listed as an Asset of Community Value by Liverpool City Council.[64] On 11 September, current owner, John W. Henry announced that they had the funds to afford the expansion but they are waiting for the City Council to finalise the purchase of houses in the area before they commit to plans to expand the Main Stand and the Anfield Road end of the ground.[65]\nIn April 2014 Liverpool F.C. signed a legal agreement with Liverpool City Council and Your Housing Group to redevelop the surrounding Anfield area. This was seen as a significant step towards the renovation of the stadium. The redevelopment was worth around \u00a3260\u00a0million.[66]\n\n\n\n#### Phase one (2015\u201316): Main Stand redevelopment[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2014, Liverpool F.C. revealed plans for an expansion of the Main Stand, which involved adding a new third tier, new matchday facilities and enhanced corporate facilities. The new stand would add 8,500 seats and take the capacity of the stadium to 54,742.[67][68] Construction of the new Main Stand was made possible by the complete demolition of all the houses in Lothair Road as well as some of those on neighbouring Alroy Road and Anfield Road.[69] Liverpool F.C. had started to purchase housing immediately surrounding Anfield in 2000.[70] The houses were left empty, including at least 22 in the roads backing onto the main stand, and Liverpool were accused of deliberately allowing the area to become blighted, thus depressing the property prices.[70][69]\n\n\n\n![](image)Exterior of the completed Main Stand (pictured from Stanley Park)\nWork began on 8 December 2014, with the club aiming for the new stand to be match-ready and operational for the start of the 2016\u201317 season. The work was undertaken by Carillion. The structure of new stand was uniquely constructed around the existing main stand to enable the existing stand to continue to be used at full operational capacity during the 2015\u201316 season.[71] Demolition of the existing stand took place in summer 2016, allowing for the construction of the lower tiers of the new stand during the off-season. Consisting of 1.8\u00a0million bricks and blocks and over 5000 tonnes of steel, the stand was opened on schedule on 9 September 2016 for the first home game of the 2016\u201317 season, a 4\u20131 victory over Leicester City. Further internal construction work including new changing rooms and media facilities continued until April 2017.[72][73]\n\n\n\n#### New club superstore and matchday experience enhancements (2016\u201317)[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2016, outline planning permission was granted by Liverpool council for the construction of a new 1,800 sq m club superstore development, situated on Walton Breck Road on the corner of the Kop and the new Main Stand. Construction began in December 2016, with the store opening early in the 2017\u201318 season.[74] The space between the new store and the stadium was developed into a \"fan zone\", with new catering outlets and pre-match entertainment.[75]\n\n\n\n#### Phase two (2021\u201323): Anfield Road End redevelopment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The redeveloped Anfield Road End (right) nearing completion in July 2023\nThe second phase of Anfield's redevelopment is to redevelop the Anfield Road stand. The club received initial outline planning permission in 2014 for the redevelopment, with seating to be increased by 4,825, giving Anfield a total capacity of 58,000.[76] However, in August 2019, Liverpool allowed the planning permission associated with the original 2014 designs to lapse, confirming their intention to submit \"ambitious new plans\" for the Anfield Road End redevelopment which are believed to increase the capacity further to take the overall capacity of Anfield to comfortably above 60,000.[77] The redevelopment will focus on the upper tier of the stand, with the lower tier remaining unchanged. Construction work will be completed behind the existing stand and then connected to the lower tier, which was expected to be in the 2022 off-season. Therefore, Anfield's capacity is not expected to be affected throughout the duration of the works.[78]\n\n\nThe club spent the second half of 2019 finalising plans and consulting local residents, planning officials and other stakeholders with a view to submitting the new plans for approval in early 2020.[79][80] However, in March 2020 Liverpool delayed submitting a planning application for the project in light of financial uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[81][82] In December 2020, Liverpool announced that they would be moving forward with the project by submitting final planning application for the redevelopment, with the delay pushing back the initial completion date for Phase Two redevelopment from summer 2022 to summer 2023 at the earliest.[82][83] The plans were approved by the Liverpool City Council in June 2021. The expansion is expected to cost \u00a360\u00a0million and will allow Anfield Road stand to seat 7,000 more people, giving the stadium a total capacity of 61,000.[84]\n\n\nWork by contractor Buckingham Group officially commenced on 30 September 2021, with the first sod being turned by manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp.[85] The stand was expected to be completed during the 2023\u201324 season and will also see the relocation of the Family Park to a covered position.[8] However, in August 2023, Buckingham announced it would be filing for administration, jeopardising timely completion of the new \u00a380 million stand.[86][87] On 7 September 2023, the club took control of the project, appointing Rayner Rowen Construction to complete the stand using as many of the original subcontractors as possible.[88] In October 2023, Liverpool announced that the upper part of the new developed stand will not be open to the public \"until the end of 2023\".[89]\n\n\n\n## Other uses[edit]\n\n\n### International football and Liverpool FC Women[edit]\n\n\nAnfield has hosted numerous international matches, and was one of the venues used during UEFA Euro 1996; the ground hosted three group games and a quarter-final.[90] The first international match hosted at Anfield was between England and Ireland, in 1889. England won the match 6\u20131. Anfield was also the home venue for several of England's international football matches in the early 1900s, and for the Welsh national team in the later part of that century.[91][92] Anfield has also played host to five FA Cup semi-finals, the last of which was in 1929.[91] The most recent international to be hosted at Anfield was England's 2\u20131 victory over Uruguay on 1 March 2006.[93] The close proximity of the stands to the pitch prevents the club from extending the pitch to suit UEFA's parameter requirements; since 2006, the stadium has been ineligible to host England games, Champions League and Europa League finals, and UEFA tournaments (UEFA Euro 2028).[94]\n\n\nEngland has played two testimonial matches against Liverpool at Anfield. The first was in 1983, when England faced Liverpool for Phil Thompson's testimonial. Then, in 1988, England visited again for Alan Hansen's testimonial.[95] Liverpool's arch rival Manchester United played their first home game of the 1971\u201372 season at Anfield as they were banned from playing their first two home league matches at Old Trafford after an incident of hooliganism. United beat Arsenal 3\u20131.[96]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Anfield hosted a Women's Super League fixture for the first time, with the 6th matchday of the 2019\u201320 season featuring the Merseyside Derby between Liverpool FC Women and local rivals Everton FC Women.[97] On 25 September 2022, Anfield played host to second Merseyside Derby between two women's first teams in the Women's Super League. Played before a record attendance of 27,574 for a Liverpool game for their women\u2019s first team, it was also the first women's Merseyside Derby to be televised. This attendance would go on to become the 7th highest attendance of the 2022\u201323 season.[98] On 22 August 2023, it was announced that Anfield will host a third women's Merseyside Derby on 15 October 2023.[99]\n\n\n\n### Rugby league[edit]\n\n\n![](image)London Broncos kicking off at Anfield during Magic Weekend 2019\nThe stadium has hosted five rugby league matches: the 1989 Charity Shield between Widnes and Wigan;[100] the 1991 World Club Challenge between Wigan, winners of the RFL Championship, and Penrith Panthers, winners of the Australian NSWRL Premiership, with an attendance of 20,152;[101] a 1997 St. Helens Super League home game against Castleford Tigers, with an attendance of 12,329;[101] and the 2016 Rugby League Four Nations Final, in front of 40,042 people.[101]\n\n\nAnfield was chosen as the venue for the 2019 Magic Weekend after two test matches were played there in 2016 and 2018. After previously choosing games that were local derbies or competitive games, in 2019 the fixtures were determined by the previous seasons league position. Robert Elstone, Super League Chief Executive, said \u201cOn behalf of the Super League clubs, we\u2019re delighted to be taking the Dacia Magic Weekend to one of the most famous stadiums in the world.[102]\n\n\n\n### Other sports[edit]\n\n\nAnfield has been the venue for many other events. During the mid-twenties, Anfield was the finishing line for the city marathon. Liverpool held an annual race which started from St George's plateau in the city centre and finished with a lap of Anfield.[91] Boxing matches were regularly held at Anfield during the inter-war years, including a number of British boxing championships; on 12 June 1934 Nel Tarleton beat Freddie Miller for the World Featherweight title. Professional tennis was played at Anfield on boards on the pitch. US Open champion, Bill Tilden, and Wimbledon champion, Fred Perry, entertained the crowds in an exhibition match. In 1958, an exhibition basketball match featuring the Harlem Globetrotters was held at the ground.[103]\n\n\n\n### Non sporting events[edit]\n\n\nAside from sporting uses, Anfield has been a venue for musicians of different genres as well as evangelical preachers. One week in July 1984, the American evangelist Billy Graham preached at Anfield, attracting crowds of over 30,000 each night.[91] Anfield was featured in Liverpool's 2008 European Capital of Culture celebrations: 36,000 people attended a concert on 1 June 2008, featuring The Zutons, Kaiser Chiefs, and Paul McCartney.[104] Live concerts made a return to Anfield in the Summer of 2019, with Take That, Bon Jovi and Pink performing. Take That lead singer Gary Barlow, a Liverpool fan, brought out a guest vocalist, Gerry Marsden, and they sang the club's anthem \u201cYou'll Never Walk Alone\u201d.[105] Artists who played at the stadium in Summer 2022 include Elton John, The Rolling Stones, and The Eagles.[106][107][108] Taylor Swift will play three consecutive dates at the stadium, featuring Paramore as special guests, from the 13th to the 15th of June 2024 as part of her Eras Tour.[109]\n\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\n![graph showing troughs and peaks of attendance at Anfield](image)The average attendance at Anfield from 1946\u20132007\nThe highest attendance recorded at Anfield is 61,905, for Liverpool's match against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup fifth round, on 2 February 1952.[110] The lowest attendance recorded at Anfield was 1,000 for a match against Loughborough on 7 December 1895.[111] The highest average attendance of 53,112 was set for the 2016\u201317 season.[48]\n\n\nLiverpool did not lose a league match at Anfield during the 1893\u201394, 1970\u201371, 1976\u201377, 1978\u201379, 1979\u201380, 1987\u201388, 2008\u201309, 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319, 2019\u201320 and 2021\u201322 seasons. Liverpool's longest unbeaten streak at home extended from January 1978 to January 1981, a period encompassing 85 games, in which Liverpool scored 212 goals and conceded 35.[110] The club's longest unbeaten home run in the league is 68 games, which occurred from April 2017 to January 2021.[112] Liverpool's worst losing streak at Anfield is six games in 2020\u20132021 with games played behind closed doors during the COVID-19 pandemic.[113] The most consecutive league wins at Anfield is 24, this is the longest run in English top-flight history. It was accomplished across the 2018\u201319 and 2019\u201320 seasons.[114]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium is about 2 miles (3\u00a0km) from Lime Street Station,[115] which lies on a branch of the West Coast Main Line from London Euston. Kirkdale Station, about 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) from the stadium, is the nearest station to Anfield. Fans travelling by train for matches may book direct to Anfield or Goodison Park, changing to the Peoplesbus Soccerbus service at Sandhills Station on the Merseyrail Northern Line.[116] The stadium has no parking facilities for supporters, and the streets around the ground allow parking only for residents with permits, although there are a small number of passes that can be allocated to over-65s. There are proposals under consideration for reinstating passenger traffic on the Bootle Branch, which would cut the distance from the nearest railway station to about 0.5 miles (1\u00a0km).[117]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The Liverpool Sound\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tarkett Sports (11 July 2017). \"Tarkett Sports: Liverpool FC Opt Again for 'Hybrid' GrassMaster Pitch at Anfield\".\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Anfield Stadium\".

With a current seating capacity of 99,354,[8] it is the stadium with the largest capacity in Spain and Europe, and the fifth largest football stadium in the world.[9][10]\n\n\nIt has hosted two European Cup/Champions League finals in 1989 and 1999, two European Cup Winners' Cup finals, four Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final games, five UEFA Super Cup games, four Copa del Rey finals, two Copa de la Liga finals and twenty-one Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a finals. It also hosted five matches in the 1982 FIFA World Cup (including the opening game), two out of four matches at the 1964 European Nations' Cup and the football tournament's final at the 1992 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nOn 15 March 2022, it was announced that music streaming service Spotify had reached a deal with Barcelona to acquire the naming rights to the stadium in a deal worth $310 million. Following the approval of the sponsorship agreement with Spotify by Barcelona's Extraordinary Assembly of Delegate Members on 3 April 2022, the stadium was officially renamed on 1 July 2022 as Spotify Camp Nou.[11]\n\n\nIn April 2022, it was announced that renovation of the stadium would commence in June 2023 after the season's end. It is expected to be completed during the 2025\u201326 season.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the stands displaying Barcelona's motto, *M\u00e9s que un club*, meaning \"More than a club\"\n![](image)A view of the supporters' side during a match, showing the FC Barcelona colours\n![](image)Main stand external view of the stadium\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\nThe construction of the Camp Nou started on 28 March 1954 as Barcelona's previous stadium, Camp de Les Corts, had no room for expansion. Although originally planned to be called the Estadi del FC Barcelona, the more popular name Camp Nou (\"new field\") was used.[13] The June 1950 signing of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kubala, regarded as one of Barcelona's greatest players, provided further impetus to the construction of a larger stadium.[14][15][16]\n\n\nOn 14 November 1950, the president Agust\u00ed Montal i Galobart obtained the favourable agreement of an assembly of members[17] to acquire land for the construction of a new stadium, located in Hospitalet de Llobregat, which was later exchanged with the Barcelona City Council for other land in the neighbourhood of Les Corts. The stadium is located at the end of Travessera de les Corts, next to the Cementiri and the Maternitat. The commission dedicated to the project recommended another location in February 1951. The official purchase took place two years later.[17]\n\n\nThe appointment of Francesc Mir\u00f3-Sans as president of Barcelona, on 14 November 1953, was to relaunch the project. Invested in February of the following year, Mir\u00f3-Sans decided in favour of the land acquired in 1950, and the first stone of the stadium was laid on 28 March 1954.[18] A procession of several thousands of people made the journey from the Camp de Les Corts to La Masia de Can Planes, where the ceremony of laying the first stone was held, a solemn ceremony in the presence of Mir\u00f3-Sans, the head of the Civil Government of Barcelona and the archbishop of Barcelona, Gregorio Modrego.[18]\n\n\nThe project was completed one year later, when the club entrusted the construction to the building company Ingar SA. The work was supposed to last eight months, but the costs were more than four times higher than expected, reaching 288 million pesetas. Through mortgages and loans, the club managed to finish the project, borrowing heavily for several years. The club hoped to cover the cost with the sale of the land at Les Corts, but the Barcelona City Council took five years to requalify it, giving rise to a period of certain economic hardship, Finally, the head of state and of the Spanish government at the time, the dictator Francisco Franco, authorised the requalification of the land at Les Corts and put an end to the crisis of the Barcelona club.[19][20] During the course of the Camp Nou construction work, La Masia served as a workshop for making the models and a workplace for architects and builders.\n\n\nThe architects were Francesc Mitjans and Josep Soteras, with the collaboration of Lorenzo Garc\u00eda-Barb\u00f3n.[21]\n\n\nFinally, on 24 September 1957, the feast of La Merc\u00e8, the Camp Nou was inaugurated.[22] A solemn mass presided over by the archbishop, who welcomed the finished stadium, preceded the Hallelujah from Handel's Messiah. Dignitaries of the Franco regime and of the city gathered in the presidential tribune, and some 90,000 people attended the opening ceremony in the stands of the huge stadium. During the event, football clubs from all over Catalonia paraded on the field, as well as members of the different sections of Bar\u00e7a, the penyes and the different Barcelona teams.[22][23]\n\n\nJust like Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium of Real Madrid, the stadium was inspired by De Kuip, home of Feyenoord Rotterdam, which was built in 1937, and featured oval rings around the pitch, resulting in continuous stands without open corners.\n\n\n\n### Early years and the 1982 World Cup[edit]\n\n\nIn May 1972, the Camp Nou hosted its first European Cup Winners' Cup final between Rangers and Dynamo Moscow. Rangers won the match with a score of 3\u20132. Electronic scoreboards were installed 1975 in the stadium.[24]\n\n\nThe stadium underwent an expansion in 1980, in anticipation of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, which added boxes, VIP lounges, a new press area, new markers and the construction of the third tier, which was smaller in height than the original design by 6 metres (46.60 metres compared to the original design of 52.50 metres). The expansion of the stadium added 22,150 new seats,[25] taking the total seating capacity to 71,731, and the standing capacity was expanded by 16,500 to 49,670, taking the total stadium capacity (seated and standing combined) to 121,401.[26] Barcelona's record attendance was set on 5 March 1986 in the European Cup quarter-final against Juventus in front of 120,000 spectators, just 1,401 shy of the stadium's capacity.[27][28]\n\n\nThe Camp Nou was one of several stadiums used throughout the 1982 World Cup, hosting the inauguration ceremony on 13 June.[29][30] It also hosted more matches in that tournament than any of the 16 other stadiums used all over Spain, including the opening match, where the traditional opening ceremonies took place (including the releasing of a dove). In front of 95,000, Belgium upset the defending champions Argentina 1\u20130 in that opening match.[31][32] It then hosted three round-robin matches between the Soviet Union, Poland and Belgium, which Poland ended up winning and qualifying from to reach the semi-finals, where they played Italy at the Camp Nou, losing 2\u20130; Italy went on to win the final match, which was played at Real Madrid's Santiago Bernab\u00e9u in Madrid.[33]\n\n\nThe Camp Nou also hosted the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester United and Bayern Munich, with both teams in contention to complete league title/domestic cup/European Cup trebles. Bayern led early through Mario Basler's goal in the sixth minute and kept the lead as the clock reached 90 minutes, but United came back to win with injury time goals from Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r.[34]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Interior of the stadium with its current capacity of 99,354 during a UEFA Champions League game between Barcelona and Inter Milan in 2019\nThe stadium's capacity has varied greatly over the years, opening at 106,146, and growing to 121,401 for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\nAs well as hosting Barcelona, the Camp Nou is home to the Catalan team.[35] The stadium is frequently used for other football events. The European Cup final between Milan and Steaua Bucure\u0219ti was held on 24 May 1989, with the Italian club winning 4\u20130.[36] The Camp Nou hosted part of the football competition, including the final, in the 1992 Summer Olympics.[37] In preparation for these matches, two additional tiers of seating were installed over the previous roof-line.[38]\n\n\nThe Camp Nou underwent little change after 1982, except for the opening of the club museum in 1984. The stadium was renovated in 1993\u201394, in which the pitch was lowered by 2.5\u00a0metres (8\u00a0feet), the security gap that separated the lawn from the galleries was removed, and standing room was eliminated in favour of individual seating. A new press box, renovation of the presidential grandstand and boxes, new parking under the main grandstand and new lighting and sound systems were completed in time for the 1998\u201399 season.[1] During 1998\u201399, UEFA rated Camp Nou a five-star stadium for its services and functionalities.[39] Although popularly called Camp Nou, the stadium\u2019s official name was actually \u201cEstadi del FC Barcelona\u201d since its completion, and it was not until the 2000-01 season that club members voted to officially rename the stadium to its popular nickname.[40]\n\n\nThe facilities now include a memorabilia shop, mini-pitches for training matches and a chapel for the players. The stadium also houses the second-most visited museum in Catalonia, the Barcelona Museum, which receives more than 1.2 million visitors per year.[41]\n\n\nOn 1 October 2017, Barcelona's league match against Las Palmas was played in an empty Camp Nou due to political turmoil in the region.[42]\n\n\n\n## Renovation and expansion[edit]\n\n\nThe club issued an international tender to remodel the stadium as a celebration of the stadium's fiftieth anniversary. The objective was to make the facility an integrated and highly visible urban environment. The club sought to increase the seating capacity by 13,500, with at least half of the total seating to be under cover.[*clarification needed*] The intention was to make it the third-largest stadium in the world in terms of seating capacity, after the Narendra Modi Stadium in India (132,000 capacity) and Rungrado 1st of May Stadium in North Korea (114,000 capacity).\n\n\nOn 18 September 2007, the British architect Norman Foster and his company were selected to \"restructure\" the Camp Nou. The plan included the addition of roughly 6,000 seats, for a maximum capacity of 105,000, at an estimated cost of \u20ac250 million.[43] The Barcelona board approved the sale of their former training ground (the Mini Estadi) against significant opposition in order to finance the remodeling. The project was planned to begin in 2009 and to be finished for the 2011\u201312 season.[44] However, due to the 2008 financial crisis, the sale of the training ground was postponed, and likewise the remodeling project. In May 2010, Sandro Rosell, then a candidate for president of Barcelona, dismissed the possibility of selling the Mini Estadi, saying it would be indefensible to \"sell the crown jewels\", and his election on 30 June 2010 effectively halted the plan to remodel the Camp Nou.[45][46]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Barcelona's board of directors rejected the option of building a new stadium due to financial constraints, and instead opted to remodel the Camp Nou to bring the capacity up to 105,000.[47] The project was expected to run from 2017 to early 2021, with a cost of around \u00a3495 million (\u20ac600 million), making it one of the most expensive expansions on a per-seat basis.[48][49] A refined plan was released in May 2015 showing plans to add a canopy over the stands and showing the plans for seating expansion in greater detail.[50] Construction was planned in 2019 to begin in summer 2020 and to be completed in 2024.[51]\n\n\nOn 28 April 2022, after several delays, the City Council of Barcelona granted a licence for the renovation after the 2021\u201322 season.[12] Renovation work on the stadium began on 1 June 2023.[52] The focus of the renovation will be the first and second tier technology aspects. The third tier is scheduled to be demolished in mid-2023 and the renovation is expected to be completed during the 2025\u201326 season. During the time of the renovation, Barcelona will move to Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys in Montju\u00efc.\n\n\n\n## Other uses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic photograph of the stadium\n\nCamp Nou has been used for various purposes other than football, often hosting major concerts. Some notable high-profile appearances include:\n\n\n\n* Pope John Paul II celebrated Mass for a congregation of over 121,500 at Camp Nou on 17 November 1982, on the occasion being made an honorary citizen of Barcelona.[53]\n* Julio Iglesias appeared in concert here on 5 September 1983 and on 8 September 1988.\n* Bruce Springsteen performed here on 3 August 1988 during his Tunnel of Love Express Tour in front of 90,000 fans. He was back on 19 and 20 July 2008 during his Magic Tour. He returned to the stadium on 16 May 2016 during The River Tour.\n* On 9 August 1988, Michael Jackson appeared at the stadium in front of 95,000 fans during his Bad World Tour.[54]\n* On 10 September 1988, the Human Rights Now! charity concert organised by Amnesty International to support human rights featured, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Youssou N'Dour, Tracy Chapman, and El \u00daltimo de la Fila.\n\n\n![](image)Camp Nou was host when U2 played in Barcelona on their 360\u00b0 Tour.\n* A concert by the Three Tenors \u2013 Josep Carreras, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti \u2013 was held on 13 July 1997.\n* U2 performed at the stadium three times: the first one was on 7 August 2005 during their Vertigo Tour, in front of a sold-out crowd of 81,269 people. The second and the third were on 30 June and 2 July 2009 during their U2 360\u00b0 Tour, in front of a total crowd of 182,055 people. The encore performance of \"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\" from the second 2009 show was filmed for the music video of the single.\n\n\nOn 4 November 2014, Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), which operates France's professional rugby union leagues, announced that the 2015\u201316 Top 14 final would be held at the Camp Nou on 24 June 2016.[55] The Top 14 final is traditionally held at the Stade de France in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. However, the scheduling of the 2015 Rugby World Cup caused the 2015\u201316 French season to be shifted by several weeks, in turn causing the Stade de France to be unavailable because it would be a major venue for UEFA Euro 2016.[56] The match ultimately drew a crowd of 99,124, setting a new record for attendance at a domestic rugby union match.[57]\n\n\nOn 18 May 2019, the first Super League game was hosted in Spain at Camp Nou as Catalans Dragons defeated Wigan Warriors 33\u201316. This match set the Super League attendance record for a non-Magic Weekend, regular season fixture, attracting 31,555 fans.\n\n\nIn 2022, Barcelona had the largest known attendances for women's football since the 1971 Women's World Cup final,[58][59] Mexico\u2013Denmark (110,000), at the Azteca Stadium.[60][61] Real Madrid and Wolfsburg were the visiting teams at Camp Nou in the Women's Champions League (91,553 and 91,648).[59][60]\n\n\n\n## Transport connections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Avinguda de Xile Station\nThe stadium is accessible from the Barcelona Metro with the closest stations to Camp Nou are Palau Reial, Maria Cristina and Les Corts, on L3; Badal on L5 and Collblanc on L5 or L9.[62] All are 500 to 1,000 metres (0.31 to 0.62\u00a0mi) from Camp Nou, depending on which of the gates (accesses) to Camp Nou are used. Usually metro services are increased when there is a match, which causes significant passenger congestion.\n\n\nA new station, named Avinguda de Xile / Camp Nou, is under construction and will be served by L9 and L10.[63][64]\n\n\nApproximately 680 metres (0.42\u00a0mi) from Camp Nou there is the Trambaix Avinguda de Xile station (lines T1, T2 and T3).\n\n\nCamp Nou is also served by several TMB bus routes, an AMB line, and four Nitbus services. Apart from regular routes, there are two special lines to Moss\u00e8n Jacint Verdaguer Square and to Catalonia Square on days with matches.\n\n\nThe stadium is located 13.7 kilometres (8.5\u00a0mi) from the El Prat International Airport. It is connected by L9 from the airport directly to Collblanc, which is a short walk from the stadium.\n\n\n\n## 1982 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium was one of the 17 venues of the 1982 FIFA World Cup, and held the following matches:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Team No. 1\n | Result\n | Team No. 2\n | Round\n | Attendance\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 13 June 1982 | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | 0\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | Group 3 (first round, opening match) | 95,000\n |\n| 28 June 1982 | ![](image)\u00a0Poland | 3\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | Group A (second round) | 65,000\n |\n| 1 July 1982 | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 0\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union | 45,000\n |\n| 4 July 1982 | ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union | 0\u20130 | ![](image)\u00a0Poland | 65,000\n |\n| 8 July 1982 | ![](image)\u00a0Poland | 0\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Italy | Semi-finals | 50,000\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Information\".
