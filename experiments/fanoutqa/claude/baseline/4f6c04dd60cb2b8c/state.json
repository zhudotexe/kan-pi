All statistics are according to the ATP Tour website.[1][2] To date, Nadal has won 92 ATP singles titles, including 22 Grand Slam men's singles titles and 36 ATP Tour Masters 1000 titles. He is one of two men to achieve the Career Golden Slam in men's singles, with titles at all four majors and the Olympic singles gold. He is the first man in history to win Grand Slam singles titles on three different surfaces in a calendar year (Surface Slam) and is the youngest (24) in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam. Following his triumph at the 2022 Australian Open, he became the fourth man in history to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles, after Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Novak Djokovic. He is the first man to win multiple majors and rank world No. 1 in three different decades.[3] Representing Spain, Nadal has won two Olympic gold medals including a singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and a doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics. In the process, he became the first male player in history to complete the Career Grand Slam and win Olympic gold medals in both singles and doubles. Nadal is the only Spanish player, male or female, to win all four majors twice, to rank world No. 1 for more than 200 weeks, and to win more than 20 majors. He has led Spain to five Davis Cup titles in 2004, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2019. At the international level, he has won the 2017 and 2019 editions of the Laver Cup with Team Europe.\n\n\n\n\n## Historic achievements[edit]\n\n\nNadal has been the most successful player in history on clay courts. He has a 63\u20138 record in clay court tournament finals and has lost only three times in best-of-five-set matches on clay.[4] He has won 14 French Open titles (unbeaten in finals), 12 Barcelona Open titles (unbeaten in finals), 11 Monte-Carlo Masters titles, and 10 Rome Masters titles, and has won at least one of the three clay-court Masters 1000 tournaments every year between 2005 and 2014. His 9th French Open crown in 2014 made him the first man in the Open Era to win a single tournament 9 times, breaking a 32-year record held by Guillermo Vilas, who won the Buenos Aires title 8 times. He subsequently won his 9th title at three more tournaments; 2016 Monte Carlo, 2016 Barcelona, and the 2019 Italian Open. In 2018, he became the sole record-holder for most titles at the ATP 500 (Barcelona), Masters 1000 (Monte Carlo), and Grand Slam (French Open) levels.\n\n\nHe also holds the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era, having won 81 consecutive matches on clay between April 2005 and May 2007.[5] Nadal has never been taken to five sets in 14 French Open finals, and has never lost consecutive matches on clay since the start of his professional career.[6] Many tennis critics and top players regard him as the greatest clay-court player of all time.[7][8][9] Nadal's 14 French Open titles are a record for one player (male or female) at a single major, surpassing the old record of 11 Australian Open titles won by Margaret Court. Nadal is the only player to defeat Roger Federer in the finals of three different Grand Slam tournaments as well as on three different surfaces (2009 Australian Open on hard court, 2006 French Open on clay court, and 2008 Wimbledon on grass court). He has won 6 hard-court majors (2 Australian Open & 4 US Open titles), tied with Andre Agassi for fourth-most behind Pete Sampras (7), Federer (11) and Novak Djokovic (14) in the Open Era.\n\n\nNadal is the first player to win four Grand Slam titles without dropping a set (2008, 2010, 2017 and 2020 French Opens) surpassing the old record of three titles held by Bj\u00f6rn Borg. He is also the first player, male or female, to win 100 matches at the French Open and holds the all-time record for the most match wins at a single major, with 112 at the French Open.[10] He is the only player, male or female, to record three streaks of four or more consecutive titles at a single major in their career (2005\u20132008, 2010\u20132014 and 2017\u20132020 French Open), surpassing the old record of 3 consecutive Wimbledon titles won by Sampras twice (1993\u20131995, 1997\u20132000). Nadal is the only player to bagel both Federer (2008 French Open) and Djokovic (2020 French Open) and defeat both in straight sets in Grand Slam finals. He has won the most ATP titles (30 titles) without dropping a set, with 26 of these titles won on clay courts and 4 on hard courts.[11]\n\n\nNadal is the sixth player to be ranked ATP world No. 1 for more than 200 weeks. Nadal has qualified for the ATP Finals for a record 16 consecutive years (2005\u20132020).[12]\n\n\nNadal is the third male player to win over US$100 million in prize money after Djokovic and Federer.\n\n\nNadal is the one of three male players in history to have won at least two Grand Slam titles each on grass (2), hard courts (6) and clay (14), alongside Mats Wilander and Djokovic.\n\n\nNadal won five straight French Open singles titles from 2010 to 2014 to become the only player in the tournament's history to win 5 consecutive singles titles, breaking the previous record of 4 titles held by Paul Aym\u00e9 and Borg. In 2017, by winning his 10th French Open title, Nadal became the first man to win a milestone 10 titles at the same major. He has played 32 matches against his primary rivals \u2014 Federer and Djokovic \u2014 in majors and leads 21\u201311 (10\u20134 vs Federer and 11\u20137 vs Djokovic). He is 14\u20132 on clay and 7\u20139 off clay against them.\n\n\nIn 2018, Nadal became the first player, male or female, to amass 450+ match wins on both hard and clay courts, with 514 and 474 wins respectively. His 500+ hard court wins rank him No. 4 on the Open Era list, and his 1000+ total match wins have only been achieved by four other players in the Open Era.[13] He holds the record for winning at least one Grand Slam title in 10 consecutive years (2005\u201314) breaking the previous record of 8 consecutive years held by Borg, Sampras and Federer. He also holds the record for most years (15) winning at least one Grand Slam title (2005\u201314, 2017\u201320, 2022).\n\n\nIn 2008, Nadal became the second Spanish man to win Wimbledon. Nadal is one of only two male players in history to have won the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year at least twice, after Rod Laver and Borg. In 2009, Nadal became the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open.[14]\n\n\nHe is also the first of two male players to win three consecutive Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces (clay, grass, and hard courts) in the same year (2010), a feat later achieved by Djokovic (2021).[15] By winning the 2010 US Open, Nadal completed a men's singles Career Grand Slam at the age of 24, making him the youngest in the Open Era to do so. He is the 7th male player in history to achieve this feat. In addition, Nadal has completed the Career Golden Slam and is only the second male player in history to attain this after Andre Agassi. By winning the 2022 Australian Open, he became the fourth man in history (joining Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Djokovic) to complete the Double Career Grand Slam, by winning each Grand Slam title at least two times. Nadal has won ATP tournaments in 19 countries throughout his career.\n\n\nHe is the only male player to win the French Open and the US Open in the same year four times (2010, 2013, 2017, 2019). Both Ivan Lendl (1986, 1987) and Laver (1962, 1969) achieved this feat twice.\n\n\nNadal has won 36 ATP Masters 1000 titles, four behind Djokovic's 40, and reached 53 finals, a record 76 semi-finals, and a record 99 quarter-finals.\n\n\n\n## Performance timelines[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** | \u00a0F\u00a0\n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | P#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | Z#\n | PO\n | **G** | S\n | B\n | NMS\n | NTI\n | P\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (P#) preliminary round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (Z#) Davis/Fed Cup Zonal Group (with number indication) or (PO) play-off; (G) gold, (S) silver or (B) bronze Olympic/Paralympic medal; (NMS) not a Masters tournament; (NTI) not a Tier I tournament; (P) postponed; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W\u2013L) win\u2013loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Davis Cup, Laver Cup, ATP Cup, United Cup and World Team Cup matches are included in the statistics.

Nadal broke John McEnroe's Open Era record of 49 consecutive sets won in 1984 (on carpet) with his 50th set win against Diego Schwartzman. He lost the next day in the quarterfinals to Dominic Thiem.[27] Nadal also broke a 15-year-old record of Guillermo Coria achieved in 2003, where he won 35 consecutive sets on clay. This is followed by Ilie N\u0103stase's 34 consecutive clay sets won in 1973.

He also won 31 consecutive sets in matches, starting with the final two sets of the 2006 final and ending with the loss of the second set in the 2009 final; this included all ten sets in 2007 and 2008. He then won the next 18 sets in succession, including winning all ten sets in 2010. During the 2010 event, Nadal lost only 14 games in five matches, while losing only one game in three of those matches, including in the final against Fernando Verdasco.\n\n\n| No.\n | Round\n |

This is the all-time record for most consecutive semifinal wins on a single surface. He went 45\u20137 in the finals during this time. The streak was ended by Fabio Fognini at the 2015 Rio Open.[31]\nMemorable matches in this streak include the 2005 French Open semifinal against Roger Federer (the first ever Grand Slam meeting between the two), the 2009 Madrid Open semifinal and 2013 French Open semifinal against Novak Djokovic, the 2007 Italian Open semifinal against Nikolay Davydenko, the 2007 German Open semifinal against Lleyton Hewitt, and the 2005 Italian Open semifinal against David Ferrer. Nadal won 20 consecutive semifinals against Top 10 players and 12 consecutive against Top 5 players on clay.\n\n\n| No.\n | Tournament\n | Opponent\n | Nation\n | Rank\n | Result\n | Score\n | Final
