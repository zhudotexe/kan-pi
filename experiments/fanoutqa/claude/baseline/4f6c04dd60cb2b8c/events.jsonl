All statistics are according to the ATP Tour website.[1][2] To date, Nadal has won 92 ATP singles titles, including 22 Grand Slam men's singles titles and 36 ATP Tour Masters 1000 titles. He is one of two men to achieve the Career Golden Slam in men's singles, with titles at all four majors and the Olympic singles gold. He is the first man in history to win Grand Slam singles titles on three different surfaces in a calendar year (Surface Slam) and is the youngest (24) in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam. Following his triumph at the 2022 Australian Open, he became the fourth man in history to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles, after Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Novak Djokovic. He is the first man to win multiple majors and rank world No. 1 in three different decades.[3] Representing Spain, Nadal has won two Olympic gold medals including a singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and a doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics. In the process, he became the first male player in history to complete the Career Grand Slam and win Olympic gold medals in both singles and doubles. Nadal is the only Spanish player, male or female, to win all four majors twice, to rank world No. 1 for more than 200 weeks, and to win more than 20 majors. He has led Spain to five Davis Cup titles in 2004, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2019. At the international level, he has won the 2017 and 2019 editions of the Laver Cup with Team Europe.\n\n\n\n\n## Historic achievements[edit]\n\n\nNadal has been the most successful player in history on clay courts. He has a 63–8 record in clay court tournament finals and has lost only three times in best-of-five-set matches on clay.[4] He has won 14 French Open titles (unbeaten in finals), 12 Barcelona Open titles (unbeaten in finals), 11 Monte-Carlo Masters titles, and 10 Rome Masters titles, and has won at least one of the three clay-court Masters 1000 tournaments every year between 2005 and 2014. His 9th French Open crown in 2014 made him the first man in the Open Era to win a single tournament 9 times, breaking a 32-year record held by Guillermo Vilas, who won the Buenos Aires title 8 times. He subsequently won his 9th title at three more tournaments; 2016 Monte Carlo, 2016 Barcelona, and the 2019 Italian Open. In 2018, he became the sole record-holder for most titles at the ATP 500 (Barcelona), Masters 1000 (Monte Carlo), and Grand Slam (French Open) levels.\n\n\nHe also holds the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era, having won 81 consecutive matches on clay between April 2005 and May 2007.[5] Nadal has never been taken to five sets in 14 French Open finals, and has never lost consecutive matches on clay since the start of his professional career.[6] Many tennis critics and top players regard him as the greatest clay-court player of all time.[7][8][9] Nadal's 14 French Open titles are a record for one player (male or female) at a single major, surpassing the old record of 11 Australian Open titles won by Margaret Court. Nadal is the only player to defeat Roger Federer in the finals of three different Grand Slam tournaments as well as on three different surfaces (2009 Australian Open on hard court, 2006 French Open on clay court, and 2008 Wimbledon on grass court). He has won 6 hard-court majors (2 Australian Open & 4 US Open titles), tied with Andre Agassi for fourth-most behind Pete Sampras (7), Federer (11) and Novak Djokovic (14) in the Open Era.\n\n\nNadal is the first player to win four Grand Slam titles without dropping a set (2008, 2010, 2017 and 2020 French Opens) surpassing the old record of three titles held by Björn Borg. He is also the first player, male or female, to win 100 matches at the French Open and holds the all-time record for the most match wins at a single major, with 112 at the French Open.[10] He is the only player, male or female, to record three streaks of four or more consecutive titles at a single major in their career (2005–2008, 2010–2014 and 2017–2020 French Open), surpassing the old record of 3 consecutive Wimbledon titles won by Sampras twice (1993–1995, 1997–2000). Nadal is the only player to bagel both Federer (2008 French Open) and Djokovic (2020 French Open) and defeat both in straight sets in Grand Slam finals. He has won the most ATP titles (30 titles) without dropping a set, with 26 of these titles won on clay courts and 4 on hard courts.[11]\n\n\nNadal is the sixth player to be ranked ATP world No. 1 for more than 200 weeks. Nadal has qualified for the ATP Finals for a record 16 consecutive years (2005–2020).[12]\n\n\nNadal is the third male player to win over US$100 million in prize money after Djokovic and Federer.\n\n\nNadal is the one of three male players in history to have won at least two Grand Slam titles each on grass (2), hard courts (6) and clay (14), alongside Mats Wilander and Djokovic.\n\n\nNadal won five straight French Open singles titles from 2010 to 2014 to become the only player in the tournament's history to win 5 consecutive singles titles, breaking the previous record of 4 titles held by Paul Aymé and Borg. In 2017, by winning his 10th French Open title, Nadal became the first man to win a milestone 10 titles at the same major. He has played 32 matches against his primary rivals — Federer and Djokovic — in majors and leads 21–11 (10–4 vs Federer and 11–7 vs Djokovic). He is 14–2 on clay and 7–9 off clay against them.\n\n\nIn 2018, Nadal became the first player, male or female, to amass 450+ match wins on both hard and clay courts, with 514 and 474 wins respectively. His 500+ hard court wins rank him No. 4 on the Open Era list, and his 1000+ total match wins have only been achieved by four other players in the Open Era.[13] He holds the record for winning at least one Grand Slam title in 10 consecutive years (2005–14) breaking the previous record of 8 consecutive years held by Borg, Sampras and Federer. He also holds the record for most years (15) winning at least one Grand Slam title (2005–14, 2017–20, 2022).\n\n\nIn 2008, Nadal became the second Spanish man to win Wimbledon. Nadal is one of only two male players in history to have won the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year at least twice, after Rod Laver and Borg. In 2009, Nadal became the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open.[14]\n\n\nHe is also the first of two male players to win three consecutive Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces (clay, grass, and hard courts) in the same year (2010), a feat later achieved by Djokovic (2021).[15] By winning the 2010 US Open, Nadal completed a men's singles Career Grand Slam at the age of 24, making him the youngest in the Open Era to do so. He is the 7th male player in history to achieve this feat. In addition, Nadal has completed the Career Golden Slam and is only the second male player in history to attain this after Andre Agassi. By winning the 2022 Australian Open, he became the fourth man in history (joining Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Djokovic) to complete the Double Career Grand Slam, by winning each Grand Slam title at least two times. Nadal has won ATP tournaments in 19 countries throughout his career.\n\n\nHe is the only male player to win the French Open and the US Open in the same year four times (2010, 2013, 2017, 2019). Both Ivan Lendl (1986, 1987) and Laver (1962, 1969) achieved this feat twice.\n\n\nNadal has won 36 ATP Masters 1000 titles, four behind Djokovic's 40, and reached 53 finals, a record 76 semi-finals, and a record 99 quarter-finals.\n\n\n\n## Performance timelines[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | P#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | Z#\n | PO\n | **G** | S\n | B\n | NMS\n | NTI\n | P\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (P#) preliminary round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (Z#) Davis/Fed Cup Zonal Group (with number indication) or (PO) play-off; (G) gold, (S) silver or (B) bronze Olympic/Paralympic medal; (NMS) not a Masters tournament; (NTI) not a Tier I tournament; (P) postponed; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Davis Cup, Laver Cup, ATP Cup, United Cup and World Team Cup matches are included in the statistics.

He also won 31 consecutive sets in matches, starting with the final two sets of the 2006 final and ending with the loss of the second set in the 2009 final; this included all ten sets in 2007 and 2008. He then won the next 18 sets in succession, including winning all ten sets in 2010.

This is the all-time record for most consecutive semifinal wins on a single surface. He went 45–7 in the finals during this time. The streak was ended by Fabio Fognini at the 2015 Rio Open.[31]\nMemorable matches in this streak include the 2005 French Open semifinal against Roger Federer (the first ever Grand Slam meeting between the two), the 2009 Madrid Open semifinal and 2013 French Open semifinal against Novak Djokovic, the 2007 Italian Open semifinal against Nikolay Davydenko, the 2007 German Open semifinal against Lleyton Hewitt, and the 2005 Italian Open semifinal against David Ferrer.

He became the first man to win 21 consecutive Grand Slam matches in a single calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. The streak was ended by compatriot David Ferrer in the 2011 Australian Open.

All statistics are according to the ATP Tour website.[1][2] To date, Nadal has won 92 ATP singles titles, including 22 Grand Slam men's singles titles and 36 ATP Tour Masters 1000 titles. He is one of two men to achieve the Career Golden Slam in men's singles, with titles at all four majors and the Olympic singles gold. He is the first man in history to win Grand Slam singles titles on three different surfaces in a calendar year (Surface Slam) and is the youngest (24) in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam. Following his triumph at the 2022 Australian Open, he became the fourth man in history to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles, after Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Novak Djokovic. He is the first man to win multiple majors and rank world No. 1 in three different decades.[3] Representing Spain, Nadal has won two Olympic gold medals including a singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and a doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics. In the process, he became the first male player in history to complete the Career Grand Slam and win Olympic gold medals in both singles and doubles. Nadal is the only Spanish player, male or female, to win all four majors twice, to rank world No. 1 for more than 200 weeks, and to win more than 20 majors. He has led Spain to five Davis Cup titles in 2004, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2019. At the international level, he has won the 2017 and 2019 editions of the Laver Cup with Team Europe.\n\n\n\n\n## Historic achievements[edit]\n\n\nNadal has been the most successful player in history on clay courts. He has a 63–8 record in clay court tournament finals and has lost only three times in best-of-five-set matches on clay.[4] He has won 14 French Open titles (unbeaten in finals), 12 Barcelona Open titles (unbeaten in finals), 11 Monte-Carlo Masters titles, and 10 Rome Masters titles, and has won at least one of the three clay-court Masters 1000 tournaments every year between 2005 and 2014. His 9th French Open crown in 2014 made him the first man in the Open Era to win a single tournament 9 times, breaking a 32-year record held by Guillermo Vilas, who won the Buenos Aires title 8 times. He subsequently won his 9th title at three more tournaments; 2016 Monte Carlo, 2016 Barcelona, and the 2019 Italian Open. In 2018, he became the sole record-holder for most titles at the ATP 500 (Barcelona), Masters 1000 (Monte Carlo), and Grand Slam (French Open) levels.\n\n\nHe also holds the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era, having won 81 consecutive matches on clay between April 2005 and May 2007.[5] Nadal has never been taken to five sets in 14 French Open finals, and has never lost consecutive matches on clay since the start of his professional career.[6] Many tennis critics and top players regard him as the greatest clay-court player of all time.[7][8][9] Nadal's 14 French Open titles are a record for one player (male or female) at a single major, surpassing the old record of 11 Australian Open titles won by Margaret Court. Nadal is the only player to defeat Roger Federer in the finals of three different Grand Slam tournaments as well as on three different surfaces (2009 Australian Open on hard court, 2006 French Open on clay court, and 2008 Wimbledon on grass court). He has won 6 hard-court majors (2 Australian Open & 4 US Open titles), tied with Andre Agassi for fourth-most behind Pete Sampras (7), Federer (11) and Novak Djokovic (14) in the Open Era.\n\n\nNadal is the first player to win four Grand Slam titles without dropping a set (2008, 2010, 2017 and 2020 French Opens) surpassing the old record of three titles held by Björn Borg. He is also the first player, male or female, to win 100 matches at the French Open and holds the all-time record for the most match wins at a single major, with 112 at the French Open.[10] He is the only player, male or female, to record three streaks of four or more consecutive titles at a single major in their career (2005–2008, 2010–2014 and 2017–2020 French Open), surpassing the old record of 3 consecutive Wimbledon titles won by Sampras twice (1993–1995, 1997–2000). Nadal is the only player to bagel both Federer (2008 French Open) and Djokovic (2020 French Open) and defeat both in straight sets in Grand Slam finals. He has won the most ATP titles (30 titles) without dropping a set, with 26 of these titles won on clay courts and 4 on hard courts.[11]\n\n\nNadal is the sixth player to be ranked ATP world No. 1 for more than 200 weeks. Nadal has qualified for the ATP Finals for a record 16 consecutive years (2005–2020).[12]\n\n\nNadal is the third male player to win over US$100 million in prize money after Djokovic and Federer.\n\n\nNadal is the one of three male players in history to have won at least two Grand Slam titles each on grass (2), hard courts (6) and clay (14), alongside Mats Wilander and Djokovic.\n\n\nNadal won five straight French Open singles titles from 2010 to 2014 to become the only player in the tournament's history to win 5 consecutive singles titles, breaking the previous record of 4 titles held by Paul Aymé and Borg. In 2017, by winning his 10th French Open title, Nadal became the first man to win a milestone 10 titles at the same major. He has played 32 matches against his primary rivals — Federer and Djokovic — in majors and leads 21–11 (10–4 vs Federer and 11–7 vs Djokovic). He is 14–2 on clay and 7–9 off clay against them.\n\n\nIn 2018, Nadal became the first player, male or female, to amass 450+ match wins on both hard and clay courts, with 514 and 474 wins respectively. His 500+ hard court wins rank him No. 4 on the Open Era list, and his 1000+ total match wins have only been achieved by four other players in the Open Era.[13] He holds the record for winning at least one Grand Slam title in 10 consecutive years (2005–14) breaking the previous record of 8 consecutive years held by Borg, Sampras and Federer. He also holds the record for most years (15) winning at least one Grand Slam title (2005–14, 2017–20, 2022).\n\n\nIn 2008, Nadal became the second Spanish man to win Wimbledon. Nadal is one of only two male players in history to have won the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year at least twice, after Rod Laver and Borg. In 2009, Nadal became the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open.[14]\n\n\nHe is also the first of two male players to win three consecutive Grand Slam tournaments on three different surfaces (clay, grass, and hard courts) in the same year (2010), a feat later achieved by Djokovic (2021).[15] By winning the 2010 US Open, Nadal completed a men's singles Career Grand Slam at the age of 24, making him the youngest in the Open Era to do so. He is the 7th male player in history to achieve this feat. In addition, Nadal has completed the Career Golden Slam and is only the second male player in history to attain this after Andre Agassi. By winning the 2022 Australian Open, he became the fourth man in history (joining Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Djokovic) to complete the Double Career Grand Slam, by winning each Grand Slam title at least two times. Nadal has won ATP tournaments in 19 countries throughout his career.\n\n\nHe is the only male player to win the French Open and the US Open in the same year four times (2010, 2013, 2017, 2019). Both Ivan Lendl (1986, 1987) and Laver (1962, 1969) achieved this feat twice.\n\n\nNadal has won 36 ATP Masters 1000 titles, four behind Djokovic's 40, and reached 53 finals, a record 76 semi-finals, and a record 99 quarter-finals.\n\n\n\n## Performance timelines[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | P#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | Z#\n | PO\n | **G** | S\n | B\n | NMS\n | NTI\n | P\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (P#) preliminary round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (Z#) Davis/Fed Cup Zonal Group (with number indication) or (PO) play-off; (G) gold, (S) silver or (B) bronze Olympic/Paralympic medal; (NMS) not a Masters tournament; (NTI) not a Tier I tournament; (P) postponed; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Davis Cup, Laver Cup, ATP Cup, United Cup and World Team Cup matches are included in the statistics.

He lost the next day in the quarterfinals to Dominic Thiem.[27] Nadal also broke a 15-year-old record of Guillermo Coria achieved in 2003, where he won 35 consecutive sets on clay. This is followed by Ilie Năstase's 34 consecutive clay sets won in 1973. Nadal has also logged streaks of 32, 31, and two streaks of 30 consecutive clay sets won.[28]\nBreakdown: 6–0 (6), 6–1 (12), 6–2 (10), 6–3 (10), 6–4 (10), 7–5 (1), RET (1).\n\n\n| No.\n | Tournament\n | Start date(tournament)\n | **Rd** | Opponent\n | Rank\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| –\n | Rome Masters, Italy\n | 15 May 2017\n | QF\n | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem | 7\n | 4–6, 3–6\n |\n| 1–3\n | French Open, France\n | 29 May 2017\n | 1R\n | ![France](image) Benoît Paire | 45\n | 6–1, 6–4, 6–1\n |\n| 4–6\n | 2R\n | ![Netherlands](image) Robin Haase | 46\n | 6–1, 6–4, 6–3\n |\n| 7–9\n | 3R\n | ![Georgia (country)](image) Nikoloz Basilashvili | 63\n | 6–0, 6–1, 6–0\n |\n| 10–12\n | 4R\n | ![Spain](image) Roberto Bautista Agut | 18\n | 6–1, 6–2, 6–2\n |\n| 13–14\n | QF\n | ![Spain](image) Pablo Carreño Busta | 21\n | 6–2, 2–0 ret\n |\n| 15–17\n | SF\n | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem | 7\n | 6–3, 6–4, 6–0\n |\n| 18–20\n | F\n | ![Switzerland](image) Stan Wawrinka | 3\n | 6–2, 6–3, 6–1\n |\n| 21–23\n | Davis Cup, Valencia, Spain\n | 2 April 2018\n | RR\n | ![Germany](image) Philipp Kohlschreiber | 34\n | 6–2, 6–2, 6–3\n |\n| 24–26\n | RR\n | ![Germany](image) Alexander Zverev | 4\n | 6–1, 6–4, 6–4\n |\n|  | Monte Carlo Masters, Monaco\n | 16 April 2018\n | Bye\n |  |  |  |\n| 27–28\n | 2R\n | ![Slovenia](image) Aljaž Bedene | 58\n | 6–1, 6–3\n |\n| 29–30\n | 3R\n | ![Russia](image) Karen Khachanov | 38\n | 6–3, 6–2\n |\n| 31–32\n | QF\n | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem (2) | 7\n | 6–0, 6–2\n |\n| 33–34\n | SF\n | ![Bulgaria](image) Grigor Dimitrov | 5\n | 6–4, 6–1\n |\n| 35–36\n | F\n | ![Japan](image) Kei Nishikori | 36\n | 6–3, 6–2\n |\n|  | Barcelona Open, Spain\n | 23 April 2018\n | Bye\n |  |  |  |\n| 37–38\n | 2R\n | ![Spain](image) Roberto Carballés Baena | 77\n | 6–4, 6–4\n |\n| 39–40\n | 3R\n | ![Spain](image) Guillermo García López | 69\n | 6–1, 6–3\n |\n| 41–42\n | QF\n | ![Slovakia](image) Martin Kližan | 140\n | 6–0, 7–5\n |\n| 43–44\n | SF\n | ![Belgium](image) David Goffin | 10\n | 6–4, 6–0\n |\n| 45–46\n | F\n | ![Greece](image) Stefanos Tsitsipas | 63\n | 6–2, 6–1\n |\n|  | Madrid Masters, Spain\n | 7 May 2018\n | Bye\n |  |  |  |\n| 47–48\n | 2R\n | ![France](image) Gaël Monfils | 41\n | 6–3, 6–1\n |\n| 49–50\n | 3R\n | ![Argentina](image) Diego Schwartzman | 16\n | 6–3, 6–4\n |\n| –\n | QF\n | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem\n | 7\n | 5–7, 3–6\n |\n\n81 match win streak on clay courts[edit]\nNadal's 81 clay-court match win streak in 2005–07 is the longest on a single surface in the Open Era in men's singles.

He also won 31 consecutive sets in matches, starting with the final two sets of the 2006 final and ending with the loss of the second set in the 2009 final; this included all ten sets in 2007 and 2008. He then won the next 18 sets in succession, including winning all ten sets in 2010. During the 2010 event, Nadal lost only 14 games in five matches, while losing only one game in three of those matches, including in the final against Fernando Verdasco.\n\n\n| No.\n | Round\n | Opponent\n | Nation\n | Rank\n | Result\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **2005**\n |\n| 1\n | 1R\n | Gaël Monfils | ![](image) France\n | 106\n | Win\n | 6–3, 6–2\n |\n| 2\n | 2R\n | Xavier Malisse | ![](image) Belgium\n | 38\n | Win\n | 6–0, 6–3\n |\n| 3\n | 3R\n | Olivier Rochus | ![](image) Belgium\n | 42\n | Win\n | 6–1, 6–2\n |\n| 4\n | QF\n | Gastón Gaudio | ![](image) Argentina | 6\n | Win\n | 6–3, 6–0\n |\n| 5\n | SF\n | Richard Gasquet | ![](image) France\n | 101\n | Win\n | 6–7(6–8), 6–4, 6–3\n |\n| 6\n | F\n | Guillermo Coria | ![](image) Argentina | 9\n | Win\n | 6–3, 6–1, 0–6, 7–5\n |\n| **2006**\n |\n| 7\n | 1R\n | Arnaud Clément | ![](image) France\n | 56\n | Win\n | 6–4, 6–4\n |\n| 8\n | 2R\n | Jean-René Lisnard | ![](image) Monaco | 154\n | Win\n | 6–4, 6–1\n |\n| 9\n | 3R\n | Kristof Vliegen | ![](image) Belgium\n | 57\n | Win\n | 6–3, 6–3\n |\n| 10\n | QF\n | Guillermo Coria | ![](image) Argentina | 9\n | Win\n | 6–2, 6–1\n |\n| 11\n | SF\n | Gastón Gaudio | ![](image) Argentina | 8\n | Win\n | 5–7, 6–1, 6–1\n |\n| 12\n | F\n | Roger Federer | ![](image)  Switzerland\n | 1\n | Win\n | 6–2, 6–7(2–7), 6–3, 7–6(7–5) |\n| **2007**\n |\n| 13\n | 2R\n | Juan Ignacio Chela | ![](image) Argentina | 22\n | Win\n | 6–3, 6–1\n |\n| 14\n | 3R\n | Kristof Vliegen | ![](image) Belgium\n | 52\n | Win\n | 6–1, 6–1\n |\n| 15\n | QF\n | Philipp Kohlschreiber | ![](image) Germany\n | 59\n | Win\n | 6–3, 6–3\n |\n| 16\n | SF\n | Tomáš Berdych | ![](image) Czech Republic | 14\n | Win\n | 6–0, 7–5\n |\n| 17\n | F\n | Roger Federer | ![](image)  Switzerland\n | 1\n | Win\n | 6–4, 6–4\n |\n| **2008**\n |\n| 18\n | 2R\n | Mario Ančić | ![](image) Croatia | 55\n | Win\n | 6–0, 6–3\n |\n| 19\n | 3R\n | Juan Carlos Ferrero | ![](image) Spain\n | 24\n | Win\n | 6–4, 6–1\n |\n| 20\n | QF\n | David Ferrer | ![](image) Spain\n | 5\n | Win\n | 6–1, 7–5\n |\n| 21\n | SF\n | Nikolay Davydenko | ![](image) Russia\n | 4\n | Win\n | 6–3, 6–2\n |\n| 22\n | F\n | Roger Federer | ![](image)  Switzerland\n | 1\n | Win\n | 7–5, 7–5\n |\n| **2009**\n |\n| 23\n | 2R\n | Juan Ignacio Chela | ![](image) Argentina | 167\n | Win\n | 6–2, 6–3\n |\n| 24\n | 3R\n | Nicolás Lapentti | ![](image) Ecuador | 98\n | Win\n | 6–3, 6–0\n |\n| 25\n | QF\n | Ivan Ljubičić | ![](image) Croatia | 66\n | Win\n | 6–3, 6–3\n |\n| 26\n | SF\n | Andy Murray | ![](image) Great Britain\n | 4\n | Win\n | 6–2, 7–6(7–4) |\n| 27\n | F\n | Novak Djokovic | ![](image) Serbia | 3\n | Win\n | 6–3, 2–6, 6–1\n |\n| **2010**\n |\n| 28\n | 2R\n | Thiemo de Bakker | ![](image) Netherlands\n | 77\n | Win\n | 6–1, 6–0\n |\n| 29\n | 3R\n | Michael Berrer | ![](image) Germany\n | 51\n | Win\n | 6–0, 6–1\n |\n| 30\n | QF\n | Juan Carlos Ferrero | ![](image) Spain\n | 16\n | Win\n | 6–4, 6–2\n |\n| 31\n | SF\n | David Ferrer | ![](image) Spain\n | 17\n | Win\n | 6–2, 6–3\n |\n| 32\n | F\n | Fernando Verdasco | ![](image) Spain\n | 12\n | Win\n | 6–0, 6–1\n |\n| **2011**\n |\n| 33\n | 2R\n | Jarkko Nieminen | ![](image) Finland | 59\n | Win\n | 6–2, 6–2\n |\n| 34\n | 3R\n | Richard Gasquet | ![](image) France\n | 18\n | Win\n | 6–2, 6–4\n |\n| 35\n | QF\n | Ivan Ljubičić | ![](image) Croatia | 40\n | Win\n | 6–1, 6–3\n |\n| 36\n | SF\n | Andy Murray | ![](image) Great Britain\n | 4\n | Win\n | 6–4, 2–6, 6–1\n |\n| 37\n | F\n | David Ferrer | ![](image) Spain\n | 6\n | Win\n | 6–4, 7–5\n |\n| **2012**\n |\n| 38\n | 2R\n | Jarkko Nieminen | ![](image) Finland | 48\n | Win\n | 6–4, 6–3\n |\n| 39\n | 3R\n | Mikhail Kukushkin | ![](image) Kazakhstan | 68\n | Win\n | 6–1, 6–1\n |\n| 40\n | QF\n | Stanislas Wawrinka | ![](image)  Switzerland\n | 26\n | Win\n | 7–5, 6–4\n |\n| 41\n | SF\n | Gilles Simon | ![](image) France\n | 15\n | Win\n | 6–3, 6–4\n |\n| 42\n | F\n | Novak Djokovic | ![](image) Serbia | 1\n | Win\n | 6–3, 6–1\n |\n| **2013**\n |\n| 43\n | 2R\n | Marinko Matosevic | ![](image) Australia\n | 54\n | Win\n | 6–1, 6–2\n |\n| 44\n | 3R\n | Philipp Kohlschreiber | ![](image) Germany\n | 21\n | Win\n | 6–2, 6–4\n |\n| 45\n | QF\n | Grigor Dimitrov | ![](image) Bulgaria | 34\n | Win\n | 6–2, 2–6, 6–4\n |\n| 46\n | SF\n | Jo-Wilfried Tsonga | ![](image) France\n | 8\n | Win\n | 6–3, 7–6(7–3) |\n|  | F\n | Novak Djokovic | ![](image) Serbia | 1\n | Loss\n | 2–6, 6–7(1–7) |\n\n52 consecutive wins in semifinal matches on clay[edit]\nFrom 2004 to 2014, Nadal went 52–0 in semifinals on clay.

He became the first man to win 21 consecutive Grand Slam matches in a single calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969. The streak was ended by compatriot David Ferrer in the 2011 Australian Open. Prior to 2010, Roger Federer achieved two streaks of three consecutive major titles (winning at least 21 matches) but never within the same calendar year, as Federer's streaks always ended at the French Open to Nadal in the middle of the calendar year.\n\n\n| No.\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Start date\n | Rd\n | Opponent\n | Rank\n | Res\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| –\n | 2010 Australian Open | Hard\n | 18 January 2010\n | QF\n | ![United Kingdom](image) Andy Murray | #4\n | L\n | 3–6, 6–7(2–7), 0–3 retired\n |\n| 1\n | 2010 French Open | Clay\n | 24 May 2010\n | R1\n | ![France](image) Gianni Mina | #655\n | W\n | 6–2, 6–2, 6–2\n |\n| 2\n | R2\n | ![Argentina](image) Horacio Zeballos | #44\n | W\n | 6–2, 6–2, 6–3\n |\n| 3\n | R3\n | ![Australia](image) Lleyton Hewitt | #33\n | W\n | 6–3, 6–4, 6–3\n |\n| 4\n | R4\n | ![Brazil](image) Thomaz Bellucci | #29\n | W\n | 6–2, 7–5, 6–4\n |\n| 5\n | QF\n | ![Spain](image) Nicolás Almagro | #21\n | W\n | 7–6(7–2), 7–6(7–3), 6–4\n |\n| 6\n | SF\n | ![Austria](image) Jürgen Melzer | #27\n | W\n | 6–2, 6–3, 7–6(8–6) |\n| 7\n | F\n | ![Sweden](image) Robin Söderling | #7\n | W\n | 6–4, 6–2, 6–4\n |\n| 8\n | 2010 Wimbledon | Grass\n | 21 June 2010\n | R1\n | ![Japan](image) Kei Nishikori | #189\n | W\n | 6–4, 6–2, 6–4\n |\n| 9\n | R2\n | ![Netherlands](image) Robin Haase | #151\n | W\n | 5–7, 6–2, 3–6, 6–0, 6–3\n |\n| 10\n | R3\n | ![Germany](image) Philipp Petzschner | #41\n | W\n | 6–4, 4–6, 6–7(2–7), 6–2, 6–3\n |\n| 11\n | R4\n | ![France](image) Paul-Henri Mathieu | #66\n | W\n | 6–4, 6–2, 6–4\n |\n| 12\n | QF\n | ![Sweden](image) Robin Söderling | #6\n | W\n | 3–6, 6–3, 7–6(7–4), 6–1\n |\n| 13\n | SF\n | ![United Kingdom](image) Andy Murray | #4\n | W\n | 6–4, 7–6(8–6), 6–4\n |\n| 14\n | F\n | ![Czech Republic](image) Tomáš Berdych | #13\n | W\n | 6–3, 7–5, 6–4\n |\n| 15\n | 2010 US Open | Hard\n | 30 August 2010\n | R1\n | ![Russia](image) Teymuraz Gabashvili | #93\n | W\n | 7–6(7–4), 7–6(7–4), 6–3\n |\n| 16\n | R2\n | ![Uzbekistan](image) Denis Istomin | #39\n | W\n | 6–2, 7–6(7–5), 7–5\n |\n| 17\n | R3\n | ![France](image) Gilles Simon | #42\n | W\n | 6–4, 6–4, 6–2\n |\n| 18\n | R4\n | ![Spain](image) Feliciano López | #25\n | W\n | 6–3, 6–4, 6–4\n |\n| 19\n | QF\n | ![Spain](image) Fernando Verdasco | #8\n | W\n | 7–5, 6–3, 6–4\n |\n| 20\n | SF\n | ![Russia](image) Mikhail Youzhny | #14\n | W\n | 6–2, 6–3, 6–4\n |\n| 21\n | F\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | #3\n | W\n | 6–4, 5–7, 6–4, 6–2\n |\n| 22\n | 2011 Australian Open | Hard\n | 17 January 2011\n | R1\n | ![Brazil](image) Marcos Daniel | #93\n | W\n | 6–0, 5–0 retired\n |\n| 23\n | R2\n | ![United States](image) Ryan Sweeting | #116\n | W\n | 6–2, 6–1, 6–1\n |\n| 24\n | R3\n | ![Australia](image) Bernard Tomic | #199\n | W\n | 6–2, 7–5, 6–3\n |\n| 25\n | R4\n | ![Croatia](image) Marin Čilić | #15\n | W\n | 6–2, 6–4, 6–3\n |\n| –\n | QF\n | ![Spain](image) David Ferrer | #7\n | L\n | 4–6, 2–6, 3–6\n |\n\n14 French Open and 12 Barcelona Open final win streaks[edit]\nSince 2005, Nadal has remained undefeated in each of the 14 French Open and 12 Barcelona Open finals he has contested in his career – both tournaments in which he is the all-time title leader.
