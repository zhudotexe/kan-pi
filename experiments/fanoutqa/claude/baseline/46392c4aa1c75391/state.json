The extreme weather of the interior contrasts to the relatively mild conditions on the Antarctic Peninsula and the subantarctic islands, which have warmer temperatures and more liquid water. Much of the ocean around the mainland is covered by sea ice. The oceans themselves are a more stable environment for life, both in the water column and on the seabed.\n\n\nThere is relatively little diversity in Antarctica compared to much of the rest of the world. Terrestrial life is concentrated in areas near the coast. Flying birds nest on the milder shores of the Peninsula and the subantarctic islands. Eight species of penguins inhabit Antarctica and its offshore islands. They share these areas with seven pinniped species. The Southern Ocean around Antarctica is home to 10 cetaceans, many of them migratory. There are very few terrestrial invertebrates on the mainland, although the species that do live there have high population densities. High densities of invertebrates also live in the ocean, with Antarctic krill forming dense and widespread swarms during the summer. Benthic animal communities also exist around the continent.\n\n\nOver 1000 fungi species have been found on and around Antarctica. Larger species are restricted to the subantarctic islands, and the majority of species discovered have been terrestrial. Plants are similarly restricted mostly to the subantarctic islands, and the western edge of the Peninsula. Some mosses and lichens however can be found even in the dry interior. Many algae are found around Antarctica, especially phytoplankton, which form the basis of many of Antarctica's food webs.\n\n\nHuman activity has caused introduced species to gain a foothold in the area, threatening the native wildlife. A history of overfishing and hunting has left many species with greatly reduced numbers. Pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change pose great risks to the environment. The Antarctic Treaty System is a global treaty designed to preserve Antarctica as a place of research, and measures from this system are used to regulate human activity in Antarctica.\n\n\n\n\n## Environmental conditions\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Antarctic realm and Climate of Antarctica\n\n![](image)Elevation of the Antarctic terrain\nAround 98% of continental Antarctica is covered in ice up to 4.7 kilometres (2.9\u00a0mi) thick.[1] Antarctica's icy deserts have extremely low temperatures, high solar radiation, and extreme dryness.[2] Any precipitation that does fall usually falls as snow, and is restricted to a band around 300 kilometres (186\u00a0mi) from the coast. Some areas receive as little as 50\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in) of precipitation annually. The coldest temperature recorded on Earth was \u221289.4\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212128.9\u00a0\u00b0F) at Vostok Station on the Antarctic Plateau.[1] Organisms that survive in Antarctica are often extremophiles.[2]\n\n\nThe dry interior of the continent is climatically different from the western Antarctic Peninsula and the subantarctic islands. The Peninsula and the islands are far more habitable; some areas of the peninsula can receive 900\u00a0mm (35.4\u00a0in) of precipitation a year, including rain, and the northern Peninsula is the only area on the mainland where temperatures are expected to go above 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer.[1] The subantarctic islands have a milder temperature and more water, and so are more conducive to life.[3]\n\n\nThe surface temperature of the Southern Ocean varies very little, ranging from 1\u00a0\u00b0C (33.8\u00a0\u00b0F) to 1.8\u00a0\u00b0C (35.2\u00a0\u00b0F).[4] During the summer sea ice covers 4,000,000 square kilometres (1,500,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of ocean.[5] The continental shelf surrounding the mainland is 60 to 240 kilometres (37 to 149\u00a0mi) wide. The depth of the seafloor in this area ranges from 50 to 800 metres (164 to 2,625\u00a0ft), with an average of 500 metres (1,640\u00a0ft). After the shelf, the continental slope descends to abyssal plains at 3,500\u20135,000 metres (11,483\u201316,404\u00a0ft) deep. In all these areas, 90% of the seafloor is made up of soft sediments, such as sand, mud, and gravel.[6]\n\n\n\n## Animals\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*) are a keystone species, forming an important part of the Antarctic food web.\nAt least 235 marine species are found in both Antarctica and the Arctic, ranging in size from whales and birds to small marine snails, sea cucumbers, and mud-dwelling worms. The large animals often migrate between the two, and smaller animals are expected to be able to spread via underwater currents.[7] However, among smaller marine animals generally assumed to be the same in the Antarctica and the Arctic, more detailed studies of each population have often\u2014but not always\u2014revealed differences, showing that they are closely related cryptic species rather than a single bipolar species.[8][9][10] Antarctic animals have adapted to reduce heat loss, with mammals developing warm windproof coats and layers of blubber.[11]\n\n\nAntarctica's cold deserts have some of the least diverse fauna in the world. Terrestrial vertebrates are limited to subantarctic islands, and even then they are limited in number.[12] Antarctica, including the subantarctic islands, has no natural fully terrestrial mammals, reptiles, or amphibians. Human activity has however led to the introduction in some areas of foreign species, such as rats, mice, chickens, rabbits, cats, pigs, sheep, cattle, reindeer, and various fish.[12] Invertebrates, such as beetle species, have also been introduced.[13]\n\n\nThe benthic communities of the seafloor are diverse and dense, with up to 155,000 animals found in 1 square metre (10.8\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). As the seafloor environment is very similar all around the Antarctic, hundreds of species can be found all the way around the mainland, which is a uniquely wide distribution for such a large community. Polar and deep-sea gigantism, where invertebrates are considerably larger than their warmer-water relatives, is common in this habitat.[6][14][15] These two similar types of gigantism are believed to be related to the cold water, which can contain high levels of oxygen, combined with the low metabolic rates (\"slow life\") of animals living in such cold environments.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### Birds\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of birds of Antarctica\n\n![](image)A wandering albatross (*Diomedea exulans*) on South Georgia\nThe rocky shores of mainland Antarctica and its offshore islands provide nesting space for over 100 million birds every spring. These nesters include species of albatrosses, petrels, skuas, gulls and terns.[16] The insectivorous South Georgia pipit is endemic to South Georgia and some smaller surrounding islands. Ducks, the South Georgia pintail and Eaton's pintail, inhabit South Georgia, Kerguelen and Crozet.[12]\n\n\nThe flightless penguins are almost all located in the Southern Hemisphere (the only exception is the equatorial Galapagos penguin), with the greatest concentration located on and around Antarctica. Four of the 18 penguin species live and breed on the mainland and its close offshore islands. Another four species live on the subantarctic islands.[17] Emperor penguins have four overlapping layers of feathers, keeping them warm. They are the only Antarctic animal to breed during the winter.[11]\n\n\n\n### Fish\n\n[edit]\n\nCompared to other major oceans, there are few fish species in few families in the Southern Ocean.[18] The most species-rich family are the snailfish (Liparidae), followed by the cod icefish (Nototheniidae)[19] and eelpouts (Zoarcidae). Together the snailfish, eelpouts and notothenioids (which includes cod icefish and several other families) account for almost 9\u204410 of the more than 320 described fish species in the Southern Ocean. Tens of undescribed species also occur in the region, especially among the snailfish. If strictly counting fish species of the Antarctic continental shelf and upper slope, there are more than 220 species and notothenioids dominate, both in number of species (more than 100) and biomass (more than 90%).[18] Southern Ocean snailfish and eelpouts are generally found in deep waters, while the icefish also are common in shallower waters.[19][20] In addition to the relatively species-rich families, the region is home to a few species from other families: hagfish (Myxinidae), lamprey (Petromyzontidae), skates (Rajidae), pearlfish (Carapidae), morid cods (Moridae), eel cods (Muraenolepididae), gadid cods (Gadidae), horsefish (Congiopodidae), Antarctic sculpins (Bathylutichthyidae), triplefins (Tripterygiidae) and southern flounders (Achiropsettidae). Among fish found south of the Antarctic Convergence, almost 90% of the species are endemic to the region.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Icefish\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Antarctic fishes\n\n![](image)Fish of the Notothenioidei suborder, such as this young icefish, are mostly restricted to the Antarctic and Subantarctic\nCod icefish (Nototheniidae), as well as several other families, are part of the Notothenioidei suborder, collectively sometimes referred to as icefish. The suborder contains many species with antifreeze proteins in their blood and tissue, allowing them to live in water that is around or slightly below 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F).[21][22] Antifreeze proteins are also known from Southern Ocean snailfish and eelpouts.[23][24]\n\n\nThere are two icefish species from the genus *Dissostichus*, the Antarctic toothfish (*D. mawsoni*) and the Patagonian toothfish (*D. eleginoides*), which by far are the largest fish in the Southern Ocean. These two species live on the seafloor from relatively shallow water to depths of 3,000\u00a0m (9,800\u00a0ft), and can grow to around 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) long weighing up to 100\u00a0kg (220\u00a0lb), living up to 45 years.[21][25] The Antarctic toothfish lives close to the Antarctic mainland, whereas the Patagonian toothfish lives in the relatively warmer subantarctic waters. Toothfish are commercially fished, and illegal overfishing has reduced toothfish populations.[21]\n\n\nAnother abundant icefish group is the genus *Notothenia*, which like the Antarctic toothfish have antifreeze in their bodies.[21]\n\n\nAn unusual species of icefish is the Antarctic silverfish (*Pleuragramma antarcticum*), which is the only truly pelagic fish in the waters near Antarctica.[26]\n\n\n\n### Mammals\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of mammals of Antarctica\n\n![](image)Weddell seals (*Leptonychotes weddellii*) are the most southerly of Antarctic mammals.\nSix pinniped species inhabit Antarctica. The largest, the Southern elephant seal (*Mirounga leonina*), can reach up to 4,000 kilograms (8,818\u00a0lb)[4] and over 6 metres (20\u00a0ft) long,[27] while females of the smallest, the Antarctic fur seal (*Arctophoca* *gazella*), reach only 150 kilograms (331\u00a0lb). These two species live north of the sea ice, and breed in harems on beaches. The other four species can live on the sea ice. Crabeater seals (*Lobodon carcinophagus*) and Weddell seals (*Leptonychotes weddellii*) form breeding colonies, whereas leopard seals (*Hydrurga leptonyx*) and Ross seals (*Ommatophoca rossii*) live solitary lives. Although these species hunt underwater, they breed on land or ice and spend a great deal of time there, as they have no terrestrial predators.[4]\n\n\nThe four species that inhabit sea ice are thought to make up 50% of the total biomass of the world's seals.[28] Crabeater seals have a population of around 15 million, making them one of the most numerous large animals on the planet.[29] The New Zealand sea lion (*Phocarctos hookeri*), one of the rarest and most localised pinnipeds, breeds almost exclusively on the subantarctic Auckland Islands, although historically it had a wider range.[30] Out of all permanent mammalian residents, the Weddell seals live the furthest south.[31]\n\n\nThere are 10 cetacean species found in the Southern Ocean; six baleen whales, and four toothed whales. The largest of these, the blue whale (*Balaenoptera musculus*), grows to 24 metres (79\u00a0ft) long weighing 84 tonnes. Many of these species are migratory, and travel to tropical waters during the Antarctic winter.[32] Orcas, which do not migrate, nonetheless regularly travel to warmer waters, possibly to relieve the stress the temperature has on their skin.[33]\n\n\n\n### Land invertebrates\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)A pair of *Belgica antarctica*, the only insect on mainland Antarctica.\nMost terrestrial invertebrates are restricted to the subantarctic islands. Although there are very few species, those that do inhabit Antarctica have high population densities. In the more extreme areas of the mainland, such as the cold deserts, food webs are sometimes restricted to three nematode species, only one of which is a predator.[12] Many invertebrates on the subantarctic islands can live in subzero temperatures without freezing, whereas those on the mainland can survive being frozen.[13]\n\n\nMites and springtails make up most terrestrial arthropod species, although various spiders, beetles, and flies can be found.[12] Several thousand individuals from various mite and springtail species can be found in 1 square metre (10.8\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). Beetles and flies are the most species rich insect groups on the islands. Insects play an important role in recycling dead plant material.[13]\n\n\nThe mainland of Antarctica has no macro-arthropods. Micro-arthropods are restricted to areas with vegetation and nutrients provided by the presence of vertebrates,[12] and where liquid water can be found.[13] *Belgica antarctica*, a wingless midge, is the only true insect found on the mainland. With sizes ranging from 2\u20136\u00a0mm (0.08\u20130.24\u00a0in), it is the mainland's largest terrestrial animal.[34]\n\n\nMany terrestrial earthworms and molluscs, along with micro-invertebrates, such as nematodes, tardigrades, and rotifers, are also found.[12] Earthworms, along with insects, are important decomposers.[13]\n\n\nThe springtail *Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni* is endemic and restricted to southern Victoria Land between Mt. George Murray (75\u00b055\u2032S) and Minna Bluff (78\u00b028\u2032S) and to the adjacent nearshore islands.[35] Insects endemic to Antarctica include:\n\n\n\n* *Belgica albipes*, a midge\n* *Belgica antarctica*, a midge\n* *Siphlopteryx antarctica*, a fly\n\n\nSpringtail species identified in recent research:[36]\n\n\n\n* *Antarcticinella monoculata*\n* *Cryptopygus antarcticus*\n* *Desoria klovstadi*\n* *Friesea grisea*\n* *Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni*\n* *Gressittacantha terranova*\n* *Neocryptopygus nivicolus*\n\nMite species identified in recent research:[36]\n\n\n\n* *Coccorhagidia keithi*\n* *Nanorchestes antarcticus*\n* *Stereotydeus mollis*\n* *Tydeus setsukoae*\n\n### Marine invertebrates\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Arthropods\n\n[edit]\n\nFive species of krill, small free-swimming crustaceans, are found in the Southern Ocean.[37] The Antarctic krill (*Euphausia superba*) is one of the most abundant animal species on earth, with a biomass of around 500 million tonnes. Each individual is 6 centimetres (2.4\u00a0in) long and weighs over 1 gram (0.035\u00a0oz).[38] The swarms that form can stretch for kilometres, with up to 30,000 individuals per 1 cubic metre (35\u00a0cu\u00a0ft), turning the water red.[37] Swarms usually remain in deep water during the day, ascending during the night to feed on plankton. Many larger animals depend on krill for their own survival.[38] During the winter when food is scarce, adult Antarctic krill can revert to a smaller juvenile stage, using their own body as nutrition.[37]\n\n\nMany benthic crustaceans have a non-seasonal breeding cycle, and some raise their eggs and young in a brood pouch (they lack a pelagic larvae stage).[39][40] *Glyptonotus antarcticus* at up to 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in) in length and 70 grams (2.5\u00a0oz) in weight, and *Ceratoserolis trilobitoides* at up to 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in) in length are unusually large benthic isopods and examples of Polar gigantism.[41][42] Amphipods are abundant in soft sediments, eating a range of items, from algae to other animals.[6] The amphipods are highly diverse with more than 600 recognized species found south of the Antarctic Convergence and there are indications that many undescribed species remain. Among these are several \"giants\", such as the iconic epimeriids that are up to 8\u00a0cm (3.1\u00a0in) long.[43]\n\n\nCrabs have traditionally not been recognized as part of the fauna in the Antarctic region, but studies in the last few decades have found a few species (mostly king crabs) in deep water. This initially led to fears (frequently quoted in the mainstream media) that they were invading from more northern regions because of global warming and possibly could cause serious damage to the native fauna, but more recent studies show they too are native and formerly simply had been overlooked.[44] Nevertheless, many species from these southern oceans are extremely vulnerable to temperature changes, being unable to survive even a small warming of the water.[44][45] Although a few specimens of the non-native great spider crab (*Hyas araneus*) were captured at the South Shetland Islands in 1986, there have been no further records from the region.[44]\n\n\nSlow moving sea spiders are common, sometimes growing up to about 35\u00a0cm (1\u00a0ft) in leg span (another example of Polar gigantism).[46] Roughly 20% of the sea spider species in the world are from Antarctic waters.[47] They feed on the corals, sponges, and bryozoans that litter the seabed.[6]\n\n\n\n#### Molluscs\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)A female warty squid (*Moroteuthis ingens*)\nMany aquatic molluscs are present in Antarctica. Bivalves such as *Adamussium colbecki* move around on the seafloor, while others such as *Laternula elliptica* live in burrows filtering the water above.[6] There are around 70 cephalopod species in the Southern Ocean,[48] the largest of which is the colossal squid (*Mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni*), which at up to 14 metres (46\u00a0ft) is among the largest invertebrates in the world.[49] Squid make up most of the diet of some animals, such as grey-headed albatrosses and sperm whales, and the warty squid (*Moroteuthis ingens*) is one of the subantarctic's most preyed upon species by vertebrates.[48]\n\n\n\n#### Other marine invertebrates\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Underwater in McMurdo Sound, including the sea urchin *Sterechinus neumayeri*, brittle star *Ophionotus victoriae*, scallop *Adamussium colbecki* and other animals\nThe red Antarctic sea urchin (*Sterechinus neumayeri*) has been used in several studies and has become a model organism.[50] This is by far the best-known sea urchin of the region, but not the only species. Among others, the Southern Ocean is also home to the genus *Abatus* that burrow through the sediment eating the nutrients they find in it.[6] Several species of brittle stars and sea stars live in Antarctic waters, including the ecologically important *Odontaster validus* and the long-armed *Labidiaster annulatus*.[51][52]\n\n\nTwo species of salps are common in Antarctic waters, *Salpa thompsoni* and *Ihlea racovitzai*. *Salpa thompsoni* is found in ice-free areas, whereas *Ihlea racovitzai* is found in the high latitude areas near ice. Due to their low nutritional value, they are normally only eaten by fish, with larger animals such as birds and marine mammals only eating them when other food is scarce.[53]\n\n\nSeveral species of marine worms are found in the Southern Ocean, including *Parborlasia corrugatus* and *Eulagisca gigantea*, which at lengths up to 2\u00a0m (6.6\u00a0ft) and 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in) respectively are examples of Polar gigantism.[54][55]\n\n\nLike several other marine species of the region, Antarctic sponges are long-lived. They are sensitive to environmental changes due to the specificity of the symbiotic microbial communities within them. As a result, they function as indicators of environmental health.[56] The largest is the whitish or dull yellowish *Anoxycalyx joubini*, sometimes called the giant volcano sponge in reference to its shape. It can reach a height of 2\u00a0m (6.5\u00a0ft) and is an important habitat for several smaller organisms. Long-term observation of individuals of this locally common glass sponge revealed no growth, leading to suggestions of a huge age, perhaps up to 15,000 years (making it one of the longest-lived organisms).[57][58] However, more recent observations have revealed a highly variable growth rate where individuals seemingly could lack any visible growth for decades, but another was observed to increase its size by almost 30% in only two years and one reached a weight of 76\u00a0kg (168\u00a0lb) in about 20 years or less.[58]\n\n\nJellyfish are also found there, with 2 examples being the Ross Sea jellyfish and the cobweb jellyfish or giant Antarctic jellyfish. The former is small, at 16\u00a0cm (6.3\u00a0in) in diameter, while the latter can have 1 metre bell diameter and 5-metre-long tentacles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Fungi\n\n[edit]\n\nFungal diversity in Antarctica is lower than in the rest of the world. Individual niches, determined by environmental factors, are filled by very few species.[59] Roughly 1150 fungi species have been identified. Lichens account for 400 of these,[3] while 750 are non-lichenised.[59] Only around 20 species of fungi are macroscopic.[3]\n\n\nThe non-lichenised species come from 416 different genera, representing all major fungi phyla. The first fungi identified from the subantarctic islands was *Peziza kerguelensis*, which was described in 1847. In 1898 the first species from the mainland, *Sclerotium antarcticum*, was sampled. Far more terrestrial species have been identified than marine species. Larger species are restricted to the subantarctic islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. Parasitic species have been found in ecological situations different from the one they are associated with elsewhere, such as infecting a different type of host. Less than 2-3% of species are thought to be endemic. Many species are shared with areas of the Arctic. Most fungi are thought to have arrived in Antarctica via airborne currents or birds.[59] The genus *Thelebolus* for example, arrived on birds some times ago, but have since evolved local strains.[60] Of the non-lichenised species of fungi and closer relatives of fungi discovered, 63% are ascomycota, 23% are basidiomycota, 5% are zygomycota, and 3% are chytridiomycota. The myxomycota and oomycota make up 1% each, although they are not true fungi.[59]\n\n\nThe desert surface is hostile to microscopic fungi due to large fluctuations in temperature on the surface of rocks, which range from 2\u00a0\u00b0C below the air temperature in the winter to 20\u00a0\u00b0C above air temperature in the summer. However, the more stable nanoenvironments inside the rocks allow microbial populations to develop. Most communities consist of only a few species. The most studied community occurs in sandstone, and different species arrange themselves in bands at different depths from the rock surface. Microscopic fungi, especially yeasts, have been found in all Antarctic environments.[2]\n\n\nAntarctica has around 400 lichen species, plants and fungi living symbiotically.[3] They are highly adapted, and can be divided into three main types; crustose lichens, forming thin crusts on the surface, foliose lichens, forming leaf-like lobes, and fruticose lichens, which grow like shrubs. Species are generally divided between those found on the subantarctic islands, those found on the Peninsula, those found elsewhere on the mainland, and those with disjointed distribution. The furthest south a lichen has been identified is 86\u00b030'. Growth rates range from 1 centimetre (0.4\u00a0in) every 100 years in the more favourable areas to 1 centimetre (0.4\u00a0in) every 1000 years in the more inhospitable areas, and usually occurs when the lichen are protected from the elements with a thin layer of snow, which they can often absorb water vapour from.[61]\n\n\n\n### Lichens\n\n[edit]\n\nMacrolichens (e.g., *Usnea sphacelata*, *U. antarctica*, *Umbilicaria decussate*, and *U. aprina*) and communities of weakly or non-nitrophilous lichens (e.g., *Pseudephebe minuscula*, *Rhizocarpon superficial*, and *R. geographicum*, and several species of *Acarospora* and *Buellia*) are relatively widespread in coastal ice-free areas.[36] Sites with substrates influenced by seabirds are colonized by well-developed communities of nitrophilous lichen species such as *Caloplaca athallina*, *C. citrina*, *Candelariella flava*, *Lecanora expectans*, *Physcia caesia*, *Rhizoplaca melanophthalma*, *Xanthoria elegans*, and *X. mawsonii*.[36] In the Dry Valleys the normally epilithic lichen species (*Acarospora gwynnii*, *Buellia frigida*, *B. grisea*, *B. pallida*, *Carbonea vorticosa*, *Lecanora fuscobrunnea*, *L. cancriformis*, and *Lecidella siplei*) are found primarily in protected niches beneath the rock surface occupying a cryptoendolithic ecological niche.[36]\nLichen species identified in recent research:[36]\n\n\n\n* *Acarospora* spp.\n\t+ *Acarospora gwynnii*\n* *Buellia* spp.\n\t+ *Buellia frigida*\n\t+ *Buellia grisea*\n\t+ *Buellia pallida*\n* *Caloplaca athallina*\n* *Caloplaca citrina*\n* *Candelariella flava*\n* *Carbonea vorticosa* (form. *Carbonea capsulata*)\n* *Lecanora cancriformis*\n* *Lecanora expectans*\n* *Lecanora fuscobrunnea*\n* *Lecidella siplei* (form. *Lecidea siplei*)\n* *Physcia caesia*\n* *Pseudephebe minuscula*\n* *Rhizocarpon geographicum*\n* *Rhizocarpon superficial*\n* *Rhizoplaca melanophthalma*\n* *Umbilicaria aprina*\n* *Umbilicaria decussate*\n* *Usnea antarctica*\n* *Usnea sphacelata*\n* *Xanthoria elegans*\n* *Xanthoria mawsonii*\n\n## Plants\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Antarctic flora\n\n![](image)The widespread *Ceratodon purpureus* is a moss that inhabits areas around the globe, and reaches as far south as 84\u00b030'.\nThe greatest plant diversity is found on the western edge of the Antarctic Peninsula.[3] Coastal algal blooms can cover up to 2 square kilometres (0.77\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of the peninsula.[62] Well-adapted moss and lichen can be found in rocks throughout the continent. The subantarctic islands are a more favourable environment for plant growth than the mainland. Human activities, especially whaling and sealing, have caused many introduced species to gain a foothold on the islands, some quite successfully.[3]\n\n\nSome plant communities exist around fumaroles, vents emitting steam and gas that can reach 60\u00a0\u00b0C (140\u00a0\u00b0F) at around 10 centimetres (3.9\u00a0in) below the surface. This produces a warmer environment with liquid water due to melting snow and ice. The active volcano Mount Erebus and the dormant Mount Melbourne, both in the continent's interior, each host a fumarole. Two fumaroles also exist on the subantarctic islands, one caused by a dormant volcano on Deception Island in the South Shetland Islands and one on the South Sandwich Islands. The fumarole on Deception Island also supports moss species found nowhere else in Antarctica.[1]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Antarctic pearlwort (*Colobanthus quitensis*), one of two flowering plant species in Antarctica.\nThe bryophytes of Antarctica consist of 100 species of mosses, and about 25 species of liverworts.[3] While not being as widespread as lichens, they remain ubiquitous wherever plants can grow, with *Ceratodon purpureus* being found as far south as 84\u00b030' on Mount Kyffin. Unlike most bryophytes, a majority of Antarctic bryophytes do not enter a diploid sporophyte stage, instead they reproduce asexually or have sex organs on their gametophyte stage. Only 30% of bryophytes on the Peninsular and subantarctic islands have a sporophyte stage, and only 25% of those on the rest of the mainland produce sporophytes.[63] The Mount Melbourne fumarole supports the only Antarctic population of *Campylopus pyriformis*, which is otherwise found in Europe and South Africa.[1]\n\n\nSubantarctic flora is dominated by the coastal tussock grass, that can grow up to 2 metres (7\u00a0ft). Only two flowering plants inhabit continental Antarctica, the Antarctic hair grass (*Deschampsia antarctica*) and the Antarctic pearlwort (*Colobanthus quitensis*). Both are found only on the western edge of the Antarctic Peninsula and on two nearby island groups, the South Orkney Islands and the South Shetland Islands.[3]\n\n\n\n### Mosses\n\n[edit]\n\nThe moss species *Campylopus pyriformis* is restricted to geothermal sites.[36]\n\n\nMoss species identified in recent research:[36]\n\n\n\n* *Anomobryum subrotundifolium*\n* *Bryoerythrophyllum recurvirostre*\n* *Bryum anomobryum*\n* *Bryum pseudotriquetrum*\n* *Campylopus pyriformis*\n* *Cephaloziella varians*\n* *Ceratodon purpureus*\n* *Didymodon brachyphyllus*\n* *Grimmia plagiopodia*\n* *Hennediella heimii*\n* *Pohlia nutans*\n* *Sarconeurum glaciale*\n* *Schistidium antarctici* (form. *Grimmia antarctici*)\n* *Syntrichia princeps*\n\n## Others\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Antarctic microorganism\n\nBacteria have been revived from Antarctic snow hundreds of years old.[64] They have also been found deep under the ice, in Lake Whillans, part of a network of subglacial lakes that sunlight does not reach.[65]\n\n\nA wide variety of algae are found in Antarctica, often forming the base of food webs.[66] About 400 species of single-celled phytoplankton that float in the water column of the Southern Ocean have been identified. These plankton bloom annually in the spring and summer as day length increases and sea ice retreats, before lowering in number during the winter.[64]\n\n\nOther algae live in or on the sea ice, often on its underside, or on the seabed in shallow areas. Over 700 seaweed species have been identified, of which 35% are endemic. Outside of the ocean many algae are found in freshwater both on the continent and on the subantarctic islands. Terrestrial algae, such as snow algae, have been found living in soil as far south as 86\u00b0 29'. Most are single-celled. In summer algal blooms can cause snow and ice to appear red, green, orange, or grey.[66] These blooms can reach about 106 cells per mL. The dominant group of snow algae is chlamydomonas , a type of green algae.[67]\n\n\nThe largest marine algae are kelp species, which include bull kelp (*Durvillaea antarctica*), which can reach over 20 metres (66\u00a0ft) long and is thought to be the strongest kelp in the world. As many as 47 individual plants can live on 1 square metre (10.8\u00a0sq\u00a0ft), and they can grow at 60 centimetres (24\u00a0in) a day. Kelp that is broken off its anchor provides a valuable food source for many animals, as well as providing a method of oceanic dispersal for animals such as invertebrates to travel across the Southern Ocean by riding floating kelp.[68]\n\n\n\n## Conservation\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora, Antarctic Specially Protected Area, and Antarctic Specially Managed Area\n\n![](image)An individual with velvet-covered antlers from the southern herd of the introduced reindeer in South Georgia.\nHuman activity poses significant risk for Antarctic wildlife, causing problems such as pollution, habitat destruction, and wildlife disturbance. These problems are especially acute around research stations.[69] Climate change and its associated effects pose significant risk to the future of Antarctica's natural environment.[70]\n\n\nDue to the historical isolation of Antarctic wildlife, they are easily outcompeted and threatened by introduced species, also brought by human activity.[71] Many introduced species have already established themselves,[12] with rats a particular threat, especially to nesting seabirds whose eggs they eat.[71] Illegal fishing remains an issue,[21] as overfishing poses a great threat to krill and toothfish populations. Toothfish, slow-growing, long-lived fish that have previously suffered from overfishing, are particularly at risk. Illegal fishing also brings further risks through the use of techniques banned in regulated fishing, such as gillnetting[72] and longline fishing. These methods increase the bycatch of animals such as albatrosses.[71]\n\n\nSubantarctic islands fall under the jurisdiction of national governments, with environmental regulation following the laws of those countries. Some islands are in addition protected through obtaining the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[69] The Antarctic Treaty System regulates all activity in latitudes south of 60\u00b0S, and designates Antarctica as a natural reserve for science.[73] Under this system all activity must be assessed for its environmental impact. Part of this system, the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, regulates fishing and protects marine areas.[69]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Australian Antarctic Division. \"Plants\".

The region is covered with glaciers, snow, and bare rock in a harshly cold environment. The temperature does rise above freezing for short periods in the summer, so some ice melt occurs, and the area supports colonies of sea birds and mammals.[1] It has an area of 161,400 square kilometres (62,300\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[2][3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Location and description\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ecoregion stretches 2,000\u00a0km west-to-east, and 1,000\u00a0km north-to-south, across the Arctic Ocean north of Norway and Russia. It covers the island groups of Svalbard (Norway), Franz Josef Land (Russia), Severny Island (Russia), and Severnaya Zemlya (Russia).\n\n\n\n## Climate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe region has a Tundra (Koppen classification ET). This climate is characterized by long, cold winters and very short summers with at least one month averaging over 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) so that snow or ice might melt, but no month averages over 10\u00a0\u00b0C (50\u00a0\u00b0F). Mean precipitation at the Ernst Krenkel Observatory in Franz Josef Land has, since 1961, averaged 294\u00a0mm/year, with mean temperatures of \u221225.6\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221214.1\u00a0\u00b0F) in January, and 0.8\u00a0\u00b0C (33.4\u00a0\u00b0F) in July.[5]\n\n\n\n## Flora and fauna\n\n[edit]\n\nPlant life is scarce due to the cold climate, but there is moss and lichen vegetation on 5-10% of the territory at low elevations and where bare rock or soil exists. The largest colonies of Ivory gull are found in the region, as well as Atlantic walrus and Polar bear.\n\n\n\n## Protections\n\n[edit]\n\nOver 36% of the ecoregion is in an officially protected area,[4] including all or a portion of:\n\n\n\n* Forlandet National Park (Norway), covering Prins Karls Forland (island).\n* Nordaust-Svalbard Nature Reserve (Norway), covering many islands in the Svalbard archipelago, much of which is glaciated,\n* Nordvest-Spitsbergen National Park (Norway), covering the northwestern portion of Spitsbergen island.\n* Nordre Isfjorden National Park (Norway), covering a fjord in central Spitzbergen\n* Russian Arctic National Park (Russia), covering Franz Josef Land, the northern tip of Severnaya Zemly, and other islands.\n* S\u00f8r-Spitsbergen National Park (Norway), covering the southern portion of Spitsbergen island.\n* S\u00f8raust-Svalbard Nature Reserve (Norway), covering the southeastern portion of the Svalbard archipelago.\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of ecoregions in Russia\n* List of ecoregions in Europe\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Russian Arctic National Park\" (in Russian).

With an area of 9,200,000 square kilometres (3,600,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), it is the largest hot desert in the world and the third-largest desert overall, smaller only than the deserts of Antarctica and the northern Arctic.[1][2][3]\n\n\nThe name \"Sahara\" is derived from the Arabic word for \"desert\" in the feminine irregular form, the singular *\u1e63a\u1e25ra'* (\u0635\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0621 /\u02c8s\u02e4a\u0127ra/), plural *\u1e63a\u1e25\u0101r\u0101* (\u0635\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064e\u0649 /\u02c8s\u02e4a\u0127a\u02d0ra\u02d0/),[4][5][6][7] *\u1e63a\u1e25\u0101r* (\u0635\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0631), *\u1e63a\u1e25r\u0101w\u0101t* (\u0635\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0648\u064e\u0627\u062a), *\u1e63a\u1e25\u0101riy* (\u0635\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u064a).\n\n\nThe desert covers much of North Africa, excluding the fertile region on the Mediterranean Sea coast, the Atlas Mountains of the Maghreb, and the Nile Valley in Egypt and the Sudan.[8]\n\n\nIt stretches from the Red Sea in the east and the Mediterranean in the north to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, where the landscape gradually changes from desert to coastal plains. To the south it is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of semi-arid tropical savanna around the Niger River valley and the Sudan region of sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions, including the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the A\u00efr Mountains, the T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 desert, and the Libyan Desert.\n\n\nFor several hundred thousand years, the Sahara has alternated between desert and savanna grassland in a 20,000-year cycle[9] caused by the precession of Earth's axis (about 26,000 years) as it rotates around the Sun, which changes the location of the North African monsoon.\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The main biomes in Africa\n![](image)A satellite image of the Sahara by NASA WorldWind\nThe Sahara covers large parts of Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Western Sahara, Sudan and Tunisia. It covers 9\u00a0million square kilometres (3,500,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), amounting to 31% of Africa. If all areas with a mean annual precipitation of less than 250\u00a0mm (9.8\u00a0in) were included, the Sahara would be 11\u00a0million square kilometres (4,200,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It is one of three distinct physiographic provinces of the African massive physiographic division. Sahara is so large and bright that, in theory, it could be detected from other stars as a surface feature of Earth, with near-current technology.[10]\n\n\nThe Sahara is mainly rocky hamada (stone plateaus); ergs (sand seas \u2013 large areas covered with sand dunes) form only a minor part, but many of the sand dunes are over 180 metres (590\u00a0ft) high.[11] Wind or rare rainfall shape the desert features: sand dunes, dune fields, sand seas, stone plateaus, gravel plains (*reg*), dry valleys (*wadi*), dry lakes (*oued*), and salt flats (*shatt* or *chott*).[12] Unusual landforms include the Richat Structure in Mauritania.\n\n\nSeveral deeply dissected mountains, many volcanic, rise from the desert, including the A\u00efr Mountains, Ahaggar Mountains, Saharan Atlas, Tibesti Mountains, Adrar des Iforas, and the Red Sea Hills. The highest peak in the Sahara is Emi Koussi, a shield volcano in the Tibesti range of northern Chad.\n\n\nThe central Sahara is hyperarid, with sparse vegetation. The northern and southern reaches of the desert, along with the highlands, have areas of sparse grassland and desert shrub, with trees and taller shrubs in wadis, where moisture collects. In the central, hyperarid region, there are many subdivisions of the great desert: Tanezrouft, the T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9, the Libyan Desert, the Eastern Desert, the Nubian Desert and others. These extremely arid areas often receive no rain for years.\n\n\nTo the north, the Sahara skirts the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt and portions of Libya, but in Cyrenaica and the Maghreb, the Sahara borders the Mediterranean forest, woodland, and scrub eco-regions of northern Africa, all of which have a Mediterranean climate characterized by hot summers and cool and rainy winters. According to the botanical criteria of Frank White[13] and geographer Robert Capot-Rey,[14][15] the northern limit of the Sahara corresponds to the northern limit of date palm cultivation and the southern limit of the range of esparto, a grass typical of the Mediterranean climate portion of the Maghreb and Iberia. The northern limit also corresponds to the 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in) isohyet of annual precipitation.[16]\n\n\nTo the south, the Sahara is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of dry tropical savanna with a summer rainy season that extends across Africa from east to west. The southern limit of the Sahara is indicated botanically by the southern limit of *Cornulaca monacantha* (a drought-tolerant member of the Chenopodiaceae), or northern limit of *Cenchrus biflorus*, a grass typical of the Sahel.[14][15] According to climatic criteria, the southern limit of the Sahara corresponds to the 150\u00a0mm (5.9\u00a0in) isohyet of annual precipitation (this is a long-term average, since precipitation varies annually).[16]\n\n\nImportant cities located in the Sahara include Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania; Tamanrasset, Ouargla, B\u00e9char, Hassi Messaoud, Gharda\u00efa, and El Oued in Algeria; Timbuktu in Mali; Agadez in Niger; Ghat in Libya; and Faya-Largeau in Chad.\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An oasis in the Ahaggar Mountains. Oases support some life forms in extremely arid deserts.\nThe Sahara is the world's largest hot desert.[17][18] It is located in the horse latitudes under the subtropical ridge, a significant belt of semi-permanent subtropical warm-core high pressure where the air from the upper troposphere usually descends, warming and drying the lower troposphere and preventing cloud formation.\n\n\nThe permanent absence of clouds allows unhindered light and thermal radiation. The stability of the atmosphere above the desert prevents any convective overturning, thus making rainfall virtually non-existent. As a consequence, the weather tends to be sunny, dry and stable with a minimal chance of rainfall. Subsiding, diverging, dry air masses associated with subtropical high-pressure systems are extremely unfavorable for the development of convectional showers. The subtropical ridge is the predominant factor that explains the hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *BWh*) of this vast region. The descending airflow is the strongest and the most effective over the eastern part of the Great Desert, in the Libyan Desert: this is the sunniest, driest and the most nearly \"rainless\" place on the planet, rivaling the Atacama Desert, lying in Chile and Peru.\n\n\nThe rainfall inhibition and the dissipation of cloud cover are most accentuated over the eastern section of the Sahara rather than the western. The prevailing air mass lying above the Sahara is the continental tropical (cT) air mass, which is hot and dry. Hot, dry air masses primarily form over the North-African desert from the heating of the vast continental land area, and it affects the whole desert during most of the year. Because of this extreme heating process, a thermal low is usually noticed near the surface, and is the strongest and the most developed during the summertime. The Sahara High represents the eastern continental extension of the Azores High,[*citation needed*] centered over the North Atlantic Ocean. The subsidence of the Sahara High nearly reaches the ground during the coolest part of the year, while it is confined to the upper troposphere during the hottest periods.\n\n\nThe effects of local surface low pressure are extremely limited because upper-level subsidence still continues to block any form of air ascent. Also, to be protected against rain-bearing weather systems by the atmospheric circulation itself, the desert is made even drier by its geographical configuration and location. Indeed, the extreme aridity of the Sahara is not only explained by the subtropical high pressure: the Atlas Mountains of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia also help to enhance the aridity of the northern part of the desert. These major mountain ranges act as a barrier, causing a strong rain shadow effect on the leeward side by dropping much of the humidity brought by atmospheric disturbances along the polar front which affects the surrounding Mediterranean climates.\n\n\nThe primary source of rain in the Sahara is the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a continuous belt of low-pressure systems near the equator which bring the brief, short and irregular rainy season to the Sahel and southern Sahara. Rainfall in this giant desert has to overcome the physical and atmospheric barriers that normally prevent the production of precipitation. The harsh climate of the Sahara is characterized by: extremely low, unreliable, highly erratic rainfall; extremely high sunshine duration values; high temperatures year-round; negligible rates of relative humidity; a significant diurnal temperature variation; and extremely high levels of potential evaporation which are the highest recorded worldwide.[19]\n\n\n\n### Temperature[edit]\n\n\nThe sky is usually clear above the desert, and the sunshine duration is extremely high everywhere in the Sahara. Most of the desert has more than 3,600 hours of bright sunshine per year (over 82% of daylight hours), and a wide area in the eastern part has over 4,000 hours of bright sunshine per year (over 91% of daylight hours). The highest values are very close to the theoretical maximum value. A value of 4300 hours (98%) of the time would be[*clarification needed*] recorded in Upper Egypt (Aswan, Luxor) and in the Nubian Desert (Wadi Halfa).[20] The annual average direct solar irradiation is around 2,800 kWh/(m2 year) in the Great Desert. The Sahara has a huge potential for solar energy production.\n\n![](image)Sand dunes in the Algerian Sahara\nThe high position of the Sun, the extremely low relative humidity, and the lack of vegetation and rainfall make the Great Desert the hottest large region in the world, and the hottest place on Earth during summer in some spots. The average high temperature exceeds 38 to 40\u00a0\u00b0C (100.4 to 104.0\u00a0\u00b0F) during the hottest month nearly everywhere in the desert except at very high altitudes. The world's highest officially recorded average daily high temperature[*clarification needed*] was 47\u00a0\u00b0C (116.6\u00a0\u00b0F) in a remote desert town in the Algerian Desert called Bou Bernous, at an elevation of 378 metres (1,240\u00a0ft) above sea level,[20] and only Death Valley, California rivals it.[21]\n\n\nOther hot spots in Algeria such as Adrar, Timimoun, In Salah, Ouallene, Aoulef, Reggane with an elevation between 200 and 400 metres (660 and 1,310\u00a0ft) above sea level get slightly lower summer average highs, around 46\u00a0\u00b0C (114.8\u00a0\u00b0F) during the hottest months of the year. Salah, well known in Algeria for its extreme heat, has average high temperatures of 43.8\u00a0\u00b0C (110.8\u00a0\u00b0F), 46.4\u00a0\u00b0C (115.5\u00a0\u00b0F), 45.5\u00a0\u00b0C (113.9\u00a0\u00b0F) and 41.9\u00a0\u00b0C (107.4\u00a0\u00b0F) in June, July, August and September respectively. There are even hotter spots in the Sahara, but they are located in extremely remote areas, especially in the Azalai, lying in northern Mali. The major part of the desert experiences around three to five months when the average high strictly[*clarification needed*] exceeds 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F); while in the southern central part of the desert, there are up to six or seven months when the average high temperature strictly[*clarification needed*] exceeds 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F). Some examples of this are Bilma, Niger and Faya-Largeau, Chad. The annual average daily temperature exceeds 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) everywhere and can approach 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) in the hottest regions year-round. However, most of the desert has a value in excess of 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F).\n\n\n\n![](image)Sunset in the Sahara\nSand and ground temperatures are even more extreme. During daytime, the sand temperature is extremely high: it can easily reach 80\u00a0\u00b0C (176\u00a0\u00b0F) or more.[22] A sand temperature of 83.5\u00a0\u00b0C (182.3\u00a0\u00b0F) has been recorded in Port Sudan.[22] Ground temperatures of 72\u00a0\u00b0C (161.6\u00a0\u00b0F) have been recorded in the Adrar of Mauritania and a value of 75\u00a0\u00b0C (167\u00a0\u00b0F) has been measured in Borkou, northern Chad.[22]\n\n\nDue to lack of cloud cover and very low humidity, the desert usually has high diurnal temperature variations between days and nights. However, it is a myth that the nights are especially cold after extremely hot days in the Sahara.[*citation needed*] On average, nighttime temperatures tend to be 13\u201320\u00a0\u00b0C (23\u201336\u00a0\u00b0F) cooler than in the daytime. The smallest variations are found along the coastal regions due to high humidity and are often even lower than a 10\u00a0\u00b0C (18\u00a0\u00b0F) difference, while the largest variations are found in inland desert areas where the humidity is the lowest, mainly in the southern Sahara. Still, it is true that winter nights can be cold, as it can drop to the freezing point and even below, especially in high-elevation areas.[*clarification needed*] The frequency of subfreezing winter nights in the Sahara is strongly influenced by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), with warmer winter temperatures during negative NAO events and cooler winters with more frosts when the NAO is positive.[23] This is because the weaker clockwise flow around the eastern side of the subtropical anticyclone during negative NAO winters, although too dry to produce more than negligible precipitation, does reduce the flow of dry, cold air from higher latitudes of Eurasia into the Sahara significantly.[24]\n\n\n\n### Precipitation[edit]\n\n\nThe average annual rainfall ranges from very low in the northern and southern fringes of the desert to nearly non-existent over the central and the eastern part. The thin northern fringe of the desert receives more winter cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of low pressure systems over the Mediterranean Sea along the polar front, although very attenuated by the rain shadow effects of the mountains and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 millimetres (4\u00a0in) to 250 millimetres (10\u00a0in). For example, Biskra, Algeria, and Ouarzazate, Morocco, are found in this zone. The southern fringe of the desert along the border with the Sahel receives summer cloudiness and rainfall due to the arrival of the Intertropical Convergence Zone from the south and the annual average rainfall ranges from 100 millimetres (4\u00a0in) to 250 millimetres (10\u00a0in). For example, Timbuktu, Mali and Agadez, Niger are found in this zone. \n\n\nThe vast central hyper-arid core of the desert is virtually never affected by northerly or southerly atmospheric disturbances and permanently remains under the influence of the strongest anticyclonic weather regime, and the annual average rainfall can drop to less than 1 millimetre (0.04\u00a0in). In fact, most of the Sahara receives less than 20 millimetres (0.8\u00a0in). Of the 9,000,000 square kilometres (3,500,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of desert land in the Sahara, an area of about 2,800,000 square kilometres (1,100,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (about 31% of the total area) receives an annual average rainfall amount of 10 millimetres (0.4\u00a0in) or less, while some 1,500,000 square kilometres (580,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (about 17% of the total area) receives an average of 5 millimetres (0.2\u00a0in) or less.[25]\n\n\nThe annual average rainfall is virtually zero over a wide area of some 1,000,000 square kilometres (390,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the eastern Sahara comprising deserts of: Libya, Egypt and Sudan (Tazirbu, Kufra, Dakhla, Kharga, Farafra, Siwa, Asyut, Sohag, Luxor, Aswan, Abu Simbel, Wadi Halfa) where the long-term mean approximates 0.5 millimetres (0.02\u00a0in) per year.[25] Rainfall is very unreliable and erratic in the Sahara as it may vary considerably year by year. In full contrast to the negligible annual rainfall amounts, the annual rates of potential evaporation are extraordinarily high, roughly ranging from 2,500 millimetres (100\u00a0in) per year to more than 6,000 millimetres (240\u00a0in) per year in the whole desert.[26] Nowhere else on Earth has air been found as dry and evaporative as in the Sahara region. However, at least two instances of snowfall have been recorded in Sahara, in February 1979 and December 2016, both in the town of Ain Sefra.[27]\n\n\n\n### Desertification and prehistoric climate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sahara pump theory, African humid period, Prehistoric North Africa, and North African climate cycles\n\n![](image)Vegetation and water bodies in the Eemian (bottom) and early Holocene (top)\nOne theory for the formation of the Sahara is that the monsoon in Northern Africa was weakened because of glaciation during the Quaternary period, starting two or three million years ago. Another theory is that the monsoon was weakened when the ancient Tethys Sea dried up during the Tortonian period around 7 million years ago.[28]\n\n\nThe climate of the Sahara has undergone enormous variations between wet and dry over the last few hundred thousand years,[29] believed to be caused by long-term changes in the North African climate cycle that alters the path of the North African Monsoon \u2013 usually southward. The cycle is caused by a 41,000-year cycle in which the tilt of the earth changes between 22\u00b0 and 24.5\u00b0.[25] At present, we are in a dry period, but it is expected that the Sahara will become green again in 15,000 years. When the North African monsoon is at its strongest, annual precipitation and subsequent vegetation in the Sahara region increase, resulting in conditions commonly referred to as the \"green Sahara\". For a relatively weak North African monsoon, the opposite is true, with decreased annual precipitation and less vegetation resulting in a phase of the Sahara climate cycle known as the \"desert Sahara\".[30]\n\n\nThe idea that changes in insolation (solar heating) caused by long-term changes in Earth's orbit are a controlling factor for the long-term variations in the strength of monsoon patterns across the globe was first suggested by Rudolf Spitaler in the late nineteenth century,[31] The hypothesis was later formally proposed and tested by the meteorologist John Kutzbach in 1981.[32] Kutzbach's ideas about the impacts of insolation on global monsoonal patterns have become widely accepted today as the underlying driver of long-term monsoonal cycles. Kutzbach never formally named his hypothesis and as such it is referred to here as the \"Orbital Monsoon Hypothesis\" as suggested by Ruddiman in 2001.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sahel region of Mali\nDuring the last glacial period, the Sahara was much larger than it is today, extending south beyond its current boundaries.[33] The end of the glacial period brought more rain to the Sahara, from about 8000 BCE to 6000 BCE, perhaps because of low pressure areas over the collapsing ice sheets to the north.[34] Once the ice sheets were gone, the northern Sahara dried out. In the southern Sahara, the drying trend was initially counteracted by the monsoon, which brought rain further north than it does today. By around 4200 BCE, however, the monsoon retreated south to approximately where it is today,[35] leading to the gradual desertification of the Sahara.[36] The Sahara is now as dry as it was about 13,000 years ago.[29]\n\n\nLake Chad is the remnant of a former inland sea, paleolake Mega-Chad, which existed during the African humid period. At its largest extent, sometime before 5000 BCE, Lake Mega-Chad was the largest of four Saharan paleolakes, and is estimated to have covered an area of 350,000\u00a0km2.[37]\n\n\nThe Sahara pump theory describes this cycle. During periods of a wet or \"Green Sahara\", the Sahara becomes a savanna grassland and various flora and fauna become more common. Following inter-pluvial arid periods, the Sahara area then reverts to desert conditions and the flora and fauna are forced to retreat northwards to the Atlas Mountains, southwards into West Africa, or eastwards into the Nile Valley. This separates populations of some of the species in areas with different climates, forcing them to adapt, possibly giving rise to allopatric speciation.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Great Green Wall, participating countries and Sahel. In September 2020, it was reported that the GGW had only covered 4% of the planned area.[38]\nIt is also proposed that humans accelerated the drying-out period from 6000 to 2500 BCE by pastoralists overgrazing available grassland.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Evidence for cycles[edit]\n\n\nThe growth of speleothems (which requires rainwater) was detected in Hol-Zakh, Ashalim, Even-Sid, Ma'ale-ha-Meyshar, Ktora Cracks, Nagev Tzavoa Cave, and elsewhere, and has allowed tracking of prehistoric rainfall. The Red Sea coastal route was extremely arid before 140 and after 115 kya (thousands of years ago). Slightly wetter conditions appear at 90\u201387 kya, but it still was just one tenth the rainfall around 125 kya. In the southern Negev Desert speleothems did not grow between 185 and 140 kya (MIS 6), 110\u201390 (MIS 5.4\u20135.2), nor after 85 kya nor during most of the interglacial period (MIS 5.1), the glacial period and Holocene. This suggests that the southern Negev was arid-to-hyper-arid in these periods.[40]\n\n\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) the Sahara was more extensive than it is now with the extent of the tropical forests being greatly reduced,[41] and the lower temperatures reduced the strength of the Hadley Cell. This is a climate cell which causes rising tropical air of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) to bring rain to the tropics, while dry descending air, at about 20 degrees north, flows back to the equator and brings desert conditions to this region. It is associated with high rates of wind-blown mineral dust, and these dust levels are found as expected in marine cores from the north tropical Atlantic. But around 12,500 BCE the amount of dust in the cores in the B\u00f8lling/Aller\u00f8d phase suddenly plummets and shows a period of much wetter conditions in the Sahara, indicating a Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) event (a sudden warming followed by a slower cooling of the climate). The moister Saharan conditions had begun about 12,500 BCE, with the extension of the ITCZ northward in the northern hemisphere summer, bringing moist wet conditions and a savanna climate to the Sahara, which (apart from a short dry spell associated with the Younger Dryas) peaked during the Holocene thermal maximum climatic phase at 4000 BCE when mid-latitude temperatures seem to have been between 2 and 3 degrees warmer than in the recent past. Analysis of Nile River deposited sediments in the delta also shows this period had a higher proportion of sediments coming from the Blue Nile, suggesting higher rainfall also in the Ethiopian Highlands. This was caused principally by a stronger monsoonal circulation throughout the sub-tropical regions, affecting India, Arabia and the Sahara.[*citation needed*] Lake Victoria only recently became the source of the White Nile and dried out almost completely around 15 kya.[42]\n\n\nThe sudden subsequent movement of the ITCZ southwards with a Heinrich event (a sudden cooling followed by a slower warming), linked to changes with the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation cycle, led to a rapid drying out of the Saharan and Arabian regions, which quickly became desert. This is linked to a marked decline in the scale of the Nile floods between 2700 and 2100 BCE.[43]\n\n\n\n## Ecoregions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The major topographic features of the Saharan region\nThe Sahara comprises several distinct ecoregions. With their variations in temperature, rainfall, elevation, and soil, these regions harbor distinct communities of plants and animals.\n\n\n\n* The Atlantic coastal desert is a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast where fog generated offshore by the cool Canary Current provides sufficient moisture to sustain a variety of lichens, succulents, and shrubs. It covers an area of 39,900 square kilometers (15,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the south of Morocco and Mauritania.[44]\n* The North Saharan steppe and woodlands is along the northern desert, next to the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions of the northern Maghreb and Cyrenaica. Winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the Mediterranean climate regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara proper to the south. It covers 1,675,300 square kilometers (646,840\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia.[45]\n* The Sahara desert ecoregion covers the hyper-arid central portion of the Sahara where rainfall is minimal and sporadic. Vegetation is rare, and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes (*erg, chech, raoui*), stone plateaus (*hamadas*), gravel plains (*reg*), dry valleys (*wadis*), and salt flats. It covers 4,639,900 square kilometres (1,791,500\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of: Algeria, Chad, Egypt, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Sudan.[12]\n* The South Saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion is a narrow band running east and west between the hyper-arid Sahara and the Sahel savannas to the south. Movements of the equatorial Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) bring summer rains during July and August which average 100 to 200\u00a0mm (4 to 8\u00a0in) but vary greatly from year to year. These rains sustain summer pastures of grasses and herbs, with dry woodlands and shrublands along seasonal watercourses. This ecoregion covers 1,101,700 square kilometres (425,400\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in Algeria, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Sudan.[46]\n* In the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands, several volcanic highlands provide a cooler, moister environment that supports Saharo-Mediterranean woodlands and shrublands. The ecoregion covers 258,100 square kilometres (99,650\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), mostly in the Tassili n'Ajjer of Algeria, with smaller enclaves in the A\u00efr of Niger, the Adrar Plateau of Mauritania, and the Adrar des Iforas of Mali and Algeria.[47]\n* The Tibesti-Jebel Uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion consists of the Tibesti and Jebel Uweinat highlands. Higher and more regular rainfall and cooler temperatures support woodlands and shrublands of date palm, acacias, myrtle, oleander, tamarix, and several rare and endemic plants. The ecoregion covers 82,200 square kilometres (31,700\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the Tibesti of Chad and Libya, and Jebel Uweinat on the border of Egypt, Libya, and Sudan.[48]\n* The Saharan halophytics is an area of seasonally flooded saline depressions which is home to halophytic (salt-adapted) plant communities. The Saharan halophytics cover 54,000 square kilometres (21,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) including: the Qattara and Siwa depressions in northern Egypt, the Tunisian salt lakes of central Tunisia, Chott Melghir in Algeria, and smaller areas of Algeria, Mauritania, and the southern part of Morocco.[49]\n* The Tanezrouft is one of the Sahara's most arid regions, with no vegetation and very little life. A barren, flat gravel plain, it extends south of Reggane in Algeria towards the Adrar des Ifoghas highlands in northern Mali.\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nThe flora of the Sahara is highly diversified based on the bio-geographical characteristics of this vast desert. Floristically, the Sahara has three zones based on the amount of rainfall received \u2013 the Northern (Mediterranean), Central and Southern Zones. There are two transitional zones \u2013 the Mediterranean-Sahara transition and the Sahel transition zone.[50]\n\n\nThe Saharan flora comprises around 2800 species of vascular plants. Approximately a quarter of these are endemic. About half of these species are common to the flora of the Arabian deserts.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Camels in the Guelta d'Archei, in north-eastern Chad\nThe central Sahara is estimated to include five hundred species of plants, which is extremely low considering the huge extent of the area. Plants such as acacia trees, palms, succulents, spiny shrubs, and grasses have adapted to the arid conditions, by growing lower to avoid water loss by strong winds, by storing water in their thick stems to use it in dry periods, by having long roots that travel horizontally to reach the maximum area of water and to find any surface moisture, and by having small thick leaves or needles to prevent water loss by evapotranspiration. Plant leaves may dry out totally and then recover.\n\n\nSeveral species of fox live in the Sahara including: the fennec fox, pale fox and R\u00fcppell's fox. The addax, a large white antelope, can go nearly a year in the desert without drinking. The dorcas gazelle is a north African gazelle that can also go for a long time without water. Other notable gazelles include the rhim gazelle and dama gazelle.\n\n\nThe Saharan cheetah (northwest African cheetah) lives in Algeria, Togo, Niger, Mali, Benin, and Burkina Faso. There remain fewer than 250 mature cheetahs, which are very cautious, fleeing any human presence. The cheetah avoids the sun from April to October, seeking the shelter of shrubs such as balanites and acacias. They are unusually pale.[52][53] The other cheetah subspecies (northeast African cheetah) lives in Chad, Sudan and the eastern region of Niger. However, it is currently extinct in the wild in Egypt and Libya. There are approximately 2000 mature individuals left in the wild.\n\n\n\n![](image)An Idehan Ubari oasis lake, with native grasses and date palms\nOther animals include the monitor lizards, hyrax, sand vipers, and small populations of African wild dog,[54] in perhaps only 14 countries[55] and red-necked ostrich. Other animals exist in the Sahara (birds in particular) such as African silverbill and black-faced firefinch, among others. There are also small desert crocodiles in Mauritania and the Ennedi Plateau of Chad.[56]\n\n\nThe deathstalker scorpion can be 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) long. Its venom contains large amounts of agitoxin and scyllatoxin and is very dangerous; however, a sting from this scorpion rarely kills a healthy adult. The Saharan silver ant is unique in that due to the extreme high temperatures of their habitat, and the threat of predators, the ants are active outside their nest for only about ten minutes per day.[57]\n\n\nDromedary camels and goats are the domesticated animals most commonly found in the Sahara. Because of its qualities of endurance and speed, the dromedary is the favourite animal used by nomads.\n\n\nHuman activities are more likely to affect the habitat in areas of permanent water (oases) or where water comes close to the surface. Here, the local pressure on natural resources can be intense. The remaining populations of large mammals have been greatly reduced by hunting for food and recreation. In recent years development projects have started in the deserts of Algeria and Tunisia using irrigated water pumped from underground aquifers. These schemes often lead to soil degradation and salinization.\n\n\nResearchers from Hacettepe University have reported that Saharan soil may have bio-available iron and also some essential macro and micro nutrient elements suitable for use as fertilizer for growing wheat.[58]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saharan rock art in the Fezzan\nPeople lived on the edge of the desert thousands of years ago,[59] since the end of the last glacial period. In the Central Sahara, engraved and painted rock art were created perhaps as early as 10,000 years ago, spanning the Bubaline Period, Kel Essuf Period, Round Head Period, Pastoral Period, Caballine Period, and Cameline Period.[60] The Sahara was then a much wetter place than it is today. Over 30,000 petroglyphs of river animals such as crocodiles[61] survive, with half found in the Tassili n'Ajjer in southeast Algeria. Fossils of dinosaurs,[62] including *Afrovenator*, *Jobaria* and *Ouranosaurus*, have also been found here. The modern Sahara, though, is not lush in vegetation, except in the Nile Valley, at a few oases, and in the northern highlands, where Mediterranean plants such as the olive tree are found to grow. It was long believed that the region had been this way since about 1600 BCE, after shifts in Earth's axis increased temperatures and decreased precipitation, which led to the abrupt desertification of North Africa about 5,400 years ago.[35]\n\n\n\n### Kiffians[edit]\n\n\nThe Kiffian culture is a prehistoric industry, or domain, that existed between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago in the Sahara, during the Neolithic Subpluvial. Human remains from this culture were found in 2000 at a site known as Gobero, located in Niger in the T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 Desert.[63] The site is known as the largest and earliest grave of Stone Age people in the Sahara.[64] The Kiffians were skilled hunters. Bones of many large savannah animals that were discovered in the same area suggest that they lived on the shores of a lake that was present during the Holocene Wet Phase, a period when the Sahara was verdant and wet.[64] The Kiffian people were tall, standing over six feet in height.[63] Craniometric analysis indicates that this early Holocene population was closely related to the Late Pleistocene Iberomaurusians and early Holocene Capsians of the Maghreb, as well as mid-Holocene Mechta groups.[65] Traces of the Kiffian culture do not exist after 8,000 years ago, as the Sahara went through a dry period for the next thousand years.[66] After this time, the Tenerian culture colonized the area.\n\n\n\n### Tenerians[edit]\n\n\nGobero was discovered in 2000 during an archaeological expedition led by Paul Sereno, which sought dinosaur remains. Two distinct prehistoric cultures were discovered at the site: the early Holocene Kiffian culture, and the middle Holocene Tenerian culture. The post-Kiffian desiccation lasted until around 4600 BCE, when the earliest artefacts associated with the Tenerians have been dated to. Some 200 skeletons have been discovered at Gobero. The Tenerians were considerably shorter in height and less robust than the earlier Kiffians. Craniometric analysis also indicates that they were osteologically distinct. The Kiffian skulls are akin to those of the Late Pleistocene Iberomaurusians, early Holocene Capsians, and mid-Holocene Mechta groups, whereas the Tenerian crania are more like those of Mediterranean groups.[67][68] Graves show that the Tenerians observed spiritual traditions, as they were buried with artifacts such as jewelry made of hippo tusks and clay pots. The most interesting find is a triple burial, dated to 5300 years ago, of an adult female and two children, estimated through their teeth as being five and eight years old, hugging each other. Pollen residue indicates they were buried on a bed of flowers. The three are assumed to have died within 24 hours of each other, but as their skeletons hold no apparent trauma (they did not die violently) and they have been buried so elaborately \u2013 unlikely if they had died of a plague \u2013 the cause of their deaths is a mystery.\n\n\n\n![](image)Oued Zouzfana and village of Taghit\n### Tashwinat Mummy[edit]\n\n\nUan Muhuggiag appears to have been inhabited from at least the 6th millennium BCE to about 2700 BCE, although not necessarily continuously.[69] The most noteworthy find at Uan Muhuggiag is the well-preserved mummy of a young boy of approximately 2+1\u20442 years old. The child was in a fetal position, then embalmed, then placed in a sack made of antelope skin, which was insulated by a layer of leaves.[70] The boy's organs were removed, as evidenced by incisions in his stomach and thorax, and an organic preservative was inserted to stop his body from decomposing.[71] An ostrich eggshell necklace was also found around his neck.[69] Radiocarbon dating determined the age of the mummy to be approximately 5600 years old, which makes it about 1000 years older than the earliest previously recorded mummy in ancient Egypt.[72] In 1958\u201359, an archaeological expedition led by Antonio Ascenzi conducted anthropological, radiological, histological and chemical analyses on the Uan Muhuggiag mummy. The team claimed that the mummy was a 30-month-old child of uncertain sex who possessed Negroid features.[73][74] A long incision on the specimen's abdominal wall also indicated that the body had been initially mummified by evisceration and later underwent natural desiccation.[75] A more recent publication referenced a laboratory examination of the cutaneous features of the child mummy in which the results verified that the child possessed a dark skin complexion.[76] One other individual, an adult, was found at Uan Muhuggiag, buried in a crouched position.[69] However, the body showed no evidence of evisceration or any other method of preservation. The body was estimated to date from about 7500 BP.[77]\n\n\n\n### Nubians[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Sahara pump theory and Neolithic Subpluvial\n\n![](image)Beni Isguen, a holy city surrounded by thick walls in the Algerian Sahara\nDuring the Neolithic Era, before the onset of desertification around 9500 BCE, the central Sudan had been a rich environment supporting a large population ranging across what is now barren desert, like the Wadi el-Qa'ab. By the 5th millennium BCE, the people who inhabited what is now called Nubia were full participants in the \"agricultural revolution\", living a settled lifestyle with domesticated plants and animals. Saharan rock art of cattle and herdsmen suggests the presence of a cattle cult like those found in Sudan and other pastoral societies in Africa today.[78] Megaliths found at Nabta Playa are overt examples of probably the world's first known archaeoastronomy devices, predating Stonehenge by some 2,000 years.[79] This complexity, as observed at Nabta Playa, and as expressed by different levels of authority within the society there, likely formed the basis for the structure of both the Neolithic society at Nabta and the Old Kingdom of Egypt.[80]\nArchaeological evidence has attested that population settlements occurred in Nubia as early as the Late Pleistocene era and from the 5th millennium BC onwards, whereas there is \"no or scanty evidence\" of human presence in the Egyptian Nile Valley during these periods, which may be due to problems in site preservation.[81]\n\n\n\n### Egyptians[edit]\n\n\nBy 6000 BCE predynastic Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and constructing large buildings. Subsistence in organized and permanent settlements in predynastic Egypt by the middle of the 6th millennium BCE centered predominantly on cereal and animal agriculture: cattle, goats, pigs and sheep. Metal objects replaced prior ones of stone. Tanning of animal skins, pottery and weaving were commonplace in this era also. There are indications of seasonal or only temporary occupation of the Al Fayyum in the 6th millennium BCE, with food activities centering on fishing, hunting and food-gathering. Stone arrowheads, knives and scrapers from the era are commonly found.[82] Burial items included pottery, jewelry, farming and hunting equipment, and assorted foods including dried meat and fruit. Burial in desert environments appears to enhance Egyptian preservation rites, and the dead were buried facing due west.[83] Several scholars have argued that the African origins of the Egyptian civilisation derived from pastoral communities which emerged in both the Egyptian and Sudanese regions of the Nile Valley in the fifth millennium BCE.[84]\n\n\nBy 3400 BCE, the Sahara was as dry as it is today, due to reduced precipitation and higher temperatures resulting from a shift in Earth's orbit.[35] As a result of this aridification, it became a largely impenetrable barrier to humans, with the remaining settlements mainly being concentrated around the numerous oases that dot the landscape. Little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods, the only major exception being the Nile Valley. The Nile, however, was impassable at several cataracts, making trade and contact by boat difficult.\n\n\n\n### Tichitt culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tichitt culture\n\nIn 4000 BCE, the start of sophisticated social structure (e.g., trade of cattle as valued assets) developed among herders amid the Pastoral Period of the Sahara.[85] Saharan pastoral culture (e.g., fields of tumuli, lustrous stone rings, axes) was intricate.[86] By 1800 BCE, Saharan pastoral culture expanded throughout the Saharan and Sahelian regions.[85] The initial stages of sophisticated social structure among Saharan herders served as the segue for the development of sophisticated hierarchies found in African settlements, such as Dhar Tichitt.[85] After migrating from the Central Sahara, proto-Mande peoples established their civilization in the Tichitt region[87] of the Western Sahara[88] The Tichitt Tradition of eastern Mauritania dates from 2200 BCE[89][90] to 200 BCE.[91][92] Tichitt culture, at Dhar N\u00e9ma, Dhar Tagant, Dhar Tichitt, and Dhar Walata, included a four-tiered hierarchal social structure, farming of cereals, metallurgy, numerous funerary tombs, and a rock art tradition[93] At Dhar Tichitt and Dhar Walata, pearl millet may have also been independently tamed amid the Neolithic.[94] Dhar Tichitt, which includes Dakhlet el Atrouss, may have served as the primary regional center for the multi-tiered hierarchical social structure of the Tichitt Tradition,[95] and the Malian Lakes Region, which includes Tondidarou, may have served as a second regional center of the Tichitt Tradition.[96] The urban[88] Tichitt Tradition may have been the earliest large-scale, complexly organized society in West Africa,[97] and an early civilization of the Sahara,[87][89] which may have served as the segue for state formation in West Africa.[86]\n\n\nAs areas where the Tichitt cultural tradition were present, Dhar Tichitt and Dhar Walata were occupied more frequently than Dhar N\u00e9ma.[97] Farming of crops (e.g., millet) may have been a feature of the Tichitt cultural tradition as early as 3rd millennium BCE in Dhar Tichitt.[97]\n\n\nAs part of a broader trend of iron metallurgy developed in the West African Sahel amid 1st millennium BCE, iron items (350 BCE \u2013 100 CE) were found at Dhar Tagant, iron metalworking and/or items (800 BCE \u2013 400 BCE) were found at Dia Shoma and Walald\u00e9, and the iron remnants (760 BCE \u2013 400 BCE) found at Bou Khzama and Djiganyai.[97] The iron materials that were found are evidence of iron metalworking at Dhar Tagant.[92] In the late period of the Tichitt Tradition at Dhar N\u00e9ma, tamed pearl millet was used to temper the tuyeres of a oval-shaped low shaft furnace; this furnace was one out of 16 iron furnaces located on elevated ground.[91] Iron metallurgy may have developed before the second half of 1st millennium BCE, as indicated by pottery dated between 800 BCE and 200 BCE.[91] At Dhar Walata and Dhar Tichitt, copper was also used.[88]\n\n\nAfter its decline in Mauritania, the Tichitt Tradition spread to the Middle Niger region (e.g., M\u00e9ma, Macina, Dia Shoma, Jenne Jeno) of Mali where it developed into and persisted as Fa\u00efta Facies ceramics between 1300 BCE and 400 BCE among rammed earth architecture and iron metallurgy (which had developed after 900 BCE).[98] Thereafter, the Ghana Empire developed in the 1st millennium CE.[98]\n\n\n\n### Phoenicians[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of Western Sahara\n\n![](image)Azalai salt caravan. The French reported that the 1906 caravan numbered 20,000 camels.\nThe people of Phoenicia, who flourished from 1200 to 800 BCE, created a chain of settlements along the coast of North Africa and traded extensively with its inhabitants. This put them in contact with the people of ancient Libya, who were the ancestors of people who speak Berber languages in North Africa and the Sahara today.\n\n\nThe Libyco-Berber alphabet of the ancient Libyans of north Africa seems to have been based on Phoenician, and its descendant Tifinagh is still used today by the (Berber) Tuareg of the central Sahara.\n\n\nThe Periplus of the Phoenician navigator Hanno, who lived sometime in the 5th century BC, claims that he founded settlements along the Atlantic coast of Africa, possibly including the Western Sahara. The identification of the places discussed is controversial, and archeological confirmation is lacking.\n\n\n\n### Greeks[edit]\n\n\nBy 500 BCE, Greeks arrived in the desert. Greek traders spread along the eastern coast of the desert, establishing trading colonies along the Red Sea. The Carthaginians explored the Atlantic coast of the desert, but the turbulence of the waters and the lack of markets caused a lack of presence further south than modern Morocco. Centralized states thus surrounded the desert on the north and east; it remained outside the control of these states. Raids from the nomadic Berber people of the desert were of constant concern to those living on the edge of the desert.\n\n\n\n### Garamantes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Market on the main square of Gharda\u00efa (1971)\nAn urban civilization, the Garamantes, arose around 500 BCE in the heart of the Sahara, in a valley that is now called the Wadi al-Ajal in Fezzan, Libya.[29] The Garamantes built a prosperous empire in the heart of the desert.[99] The Garamantes achieved this development by digging tunnels far into the mountains flanking the valley to tap fossil water and bring it to their fields. The Garamantes grew populous and strong, conquering their neighbors, and capturing and enslaving many individuals who were forced to work by extending the tunnels. The ancient Greeks and the Romans knew of the Garamantes and regarded them as uncivilized nomads. However, they traded with them, and a Roman bath has been found in the Garamantes' capital of Garama. Archaeologists have found eight major towns and many other important settlements in the Garamantes' territory. The Garamantes' civilization eventually collapsed after they had depleted available water in the aquifers and could no longer sustain the effort to extend the tunnels further into the mountains.[100]\n\n\nBetween the first century BCE and the fourth century CE, several Roman expeditions into the Sahara were conducted by groups of military and commercial units of Romans.\n\n\n\n### Islamic and Arabic expansion[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Trans-Saharan trade and Islamization of Sudan\n\nThe Byzantine Empire ruled the northern shores of the Sahara from the 5th to the 7th centuries. After the Muslim conquest of Arabia, specifically the Arabian peninsula, the Muslim conquest of North Africa began in the mid-7th to early 8th centuries and Islamic influence expanded rapidly on the Sahara. By the end of 641 all of Egypt was in Muslim hands. Trade across the desert intensified, and a significant slave trade crossed the desert. It has been estimated that from the 10th to 19th centuries some 6,000 to 7,000 slaves were transported north each year.[101]\n\n\nThe Beni \u1e24ass\u0101n and other nomadic Arab tribes dominated the Sanhaja Berber tribes of the western Sahara after the Char Bouba war of the 17th century. As a result, Arabian culture and language came to dominate, and the Berber tribes underwent some Arabization.\n\n\n\n### Ottoman Turkish era[edit]\n\n\nIn the 16th century the northern fringe of the Sahara, such as coastal regencies in present-day Algeria and Tunisia, as well as some parts of present-day Libya, together with the semi-autonomous kingdom of Egypt, were occupied by the Ottoman Empire. From 1517 Egypt was a valued part of the Ottoman Empire, ownership of which provided the Ottomans with control over the Nile Valley, the east Mediterranean and North Africa. The benefit of the Ottoman Empire was the freedom of movement for citizens and goods. Traders exploited the Ottoman land routes to handle the spices, gold and silk from the East, manufactured goods from Europe, and the slave and gold traffic from Africa. Arabic continued as the local language and Islamic culture was much reinforced. The Sahel and southern Sahara regions were home to several independent states or to roaming Tuareg clans.\n\n\n\n### European colonialism[edit]\n\n\nEuropean colonialism in the Sahara began in the 19th century. France conquered the regency of Algiers from the Ottomans in 1830, and French rule spread south from French Algeria and eastwards from Senegal into the upper Niger to include present-day Algeria, Chad, Mali then French Sudan including Timbuktu (1893), Mauritania, Morocco (1912), Niger, and Tunisia (1881). By the beginning of the 20th century, the trans-Saharan trade had clearly declined because goods were moved through more modern and efficient means, such as airplanes, rather than across the desert.[102]\n\n\nThe French took advantage of long-standing animosity between the Chaamba Arabs and the Tuareg. The newly raised *M\u00e9hariste* camel corps were originally recruited mainly from the Chaamba nomadic tribe. In 1902, the French penetrated the Hoggar mountains and defeated Ahaggar Tuareg in the battle of Tit.\n\n\n\n![](image)The French colonial empire (blue) was the dominant presence in the Sahara.\nThe French Colonial Empire was the dominant presence in the Sahara. It established regular air links from Toulouse (HQ of famed A\u00e9ropostale), to Oran and over the Hoggar to Timbuktu and West to Bamako and Dakar, as well as trans-Sahara bus services run by La Compagnie Transsaharienne (est. 1927).[103] A remarkable film shot by famous aviator Captain Ren\u00e9 Wauthier in 1933 documents the first crossing by a large truck convoy from Algiers to Tchad, across the Sahara.[104]\n\n\nEgypt, under Muhammad Ali and his successors, conquered Nubia in 1820\u201322, founded Khartoum in 1823, and conquered Darfur in 1874. Egypt, including Sudan, became a British protectorate in 1882. Egypt and Britain lost control of the Sudan from 1882 to 1898 as a result of the Mahdist War. After its capture by British troops in 1898, the Sudan became an Anglo-Egyptian condominium.\n\n\nSpain captured present-day Western Sahara after 1874, although Rio del Oro remained largely under Sahrawi influence. In 1912, Italy captured parts of what was to be named Libya from the Ottomans. To promote the Roman Catholic religion in the desert, Pope Pius IX appointed a delegate Apostolic of the Sahara and the Sudan in 1868; later in the 19th century his jurisdiction was reorganized into the Vicariate Apostolic of Sahara.\n\n\n\n### Breakup of the empires and afterwards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A natural rock arch in south western Libya\n![](image)The Sahara today\nEgypt became independent of Britain in 1936, although the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936 allowed Britain to keep troops in Egypt and to maintain the British-Egyptian condominium in the Sudan. British military forces were withdrawn in 1954.\n\n\nMost of the Saharan states achieved independence after World War II: Libya in 1951; Morocco, Sudan, and Tunisia in 1956; Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger in 1960; and Algeria in 1962. Spain withdrew from Western Sahara in 1975, and it was partitioned between Mauritania and Morocco. Mauritania withdrew in 1979; Morocco continues to hold the territory (see Western Sahara conflict).[105]\n\n\nTuareg people in Mali rebelled several times during the 20th century before finally forcing the Malian armed forces to withdraw below the line demarcating Azawad from southern Mali during the 2012 rebellion.[106] Islamist rebels in the Sahara calling themselves al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb have stepped up their violence in recent years.[107]\n\n\nIn the post\u2013World War II era, several mines and communities have developed to use the desert's natural resources. These include large deposits of oil and natural gas in Algeria and Libya, and large deposits of phosphates in Morocco and Western Sahara.[108] Libya's Great Man-Made River is the world's largest irrigation project.[109] The project uses a pipeline system that pumps fossil water from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System to cities in the populous Libyan northern Mediterranean coast including Tripoli and Benghazi.[110]\n\n\nA number of Trans-African highways have been proposed across the Sahara, including the Cairo\u2013Dakar Highway along the Atlantic coast, the Trans-Sahara Highway from Algiers on the Mediterranean to Kano in Nigeria, the Tripoli \u2013 Cape Town Highway from Tripoli in Libya to N'Djamena in Chad, and the Cairo \u2013 Cape Town Highway which follows the Nile. Each of these highways is partially complete, with significant gaps and unpaved sections.\n\n\n\n## People, culture, and languages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Saharan languages, Saharan rock art, and Rock art \u00a7\u00a0Sahara\n\n![](image)A 19th-century engraving of an Arab slave-trading caravan transporting black African slaves across the Sahara\nThe people of the Sahara are of various origins. Among them the Amazigh including the Tuareg, various Arabized Amazi\u0263 groups such as the Hassaniya-speaking Sahrawis, whose populations include the Znaga, a tribe whose name is a remnant of the pre-historic Zenaga language. Other major groups of people include the: Toubou, Nubians, Zaghawa, Kanuri, Hausa, Songhai, Beja, and Fula/Fulani (French: *Peul*; Fula: *Ful\u0253e*). The archaeological evidence from the Holocene period has shown that Nilo-Saharan speaking groups had populated the central and southern Sahara before the influx of Berber and Arabic speakers, around 1500 years ago, who now largely populate the Sahara in the modern era.[111]\n\n\nArabic dialects are the most widely spoken languages in the Sahara. Arabic, Berber and its variants now regrouped under the term Amazigh (which includes the Guanche language spoken by the original Berber inhabitants of the Canary Islands) and Beja languages are part of the Afro-Asiatic or Hamito-Semitic family.[*citation needed*] Unlike neighboring West Africa and the central governments of the states that comprise the Sahara, the French language bears little relevance to inter-personal discourse and commerce within the region, its people retaining staunch ethnic and political affiliations with Tuareg and Berber leaders and culture.[112] The legacy of the French colonial era administration is primarily manifested in the territorial reorganization enacted by the Third and Fourth republics, which engendered artificial political divisions within a hitherto isolated and porous region.[113] Diplomacy with local clients was conducted primarily in Arabic, which was the traditional language of bureaucratic affairs. Mediation of disputes and inter-agency communication was served by interpreters contracted by the French government, who, according to Keenan, \"documented a space of intercultural mediation,\" contributing much to preserving the indigenous cultural identities in the region.[114]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* African humid period\u00a0\u2013 Holocene climate period during which northern Africa was wetter than today\n* Arid Lands Information Network\n* List of deserts\n* List of deserts by area\u00a0\u2013 List of the largest deserts in the world by area\n* List of Saharan explorers\n* Sahara Conservation Fund\u00a0\u2013 International conservation organization\n* Sahara Sea\u00a0\u2013 Engineering project to flood parts of the Sahara Desert with sea water\n* Trans-Saharan slave trade\u00a0\u2013 Slave trade\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Cook, Kerry H.; Vizy, Edward K.

The desert in western Australia is well explained by the little evaporation of the cold sea current of the West Australian Current, of polar origin, which prevents significant rainfall in the interior of the continent.[3] About 40% of Australia is covered by dunes.[5] Australia is the driest inhabited continent,[6][7] with the least fertile soils.[8][9]\n\n\nIn addition to being mostly uninhabited, the Great Australian Desert is diverse, where it consists of semi-desert grassy or mountainous landscapes, xeric shrubs, salt pans, gibber (stony) deserts, red sand dunes, sandstone mesas, rocky plains, open tree savannahs and bushland with a few rivers and salt lakes, which are mostly seasonally dry and often have no outflow in the east. The 3 million km2 desert is among the least modified in the world.[10] The Australian desert has the largest population of feral camels in the world.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### Geological\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Wolfe Creek Crater in Western Australia\nThe area's geology spans a geological time period of over 3.8 billion years, therefore featuring some of the oldest rocks on earth. There are three main cratonic shields of recognised Archaean age within the Australian landmass: The Yilgarn, the Pilbara and the Gawler cratons. Several other Archaean-Proterozoic orogenic belts exist, usually sandwiched around the edges of these major cratonic shields. The history of the Archaean cratons is extremely complex and protracted. The cratons appear to have been accumulated to form the greater Australian landmass in the late Archaean to meso-Proterozoic, (~2400 Ma to 1,600 Ma).\n\n\nChiefly the Capricorn Orogeny is partly responsible for the assembly of the West Australian landmass by connecting the Yilgarn and Pilbara cratons. The Capricorn Orogeny is exposed in the rocks of the Bangemall Basin, Gascoyne Complex granite-gneisses and the Glengarry, Yerrida and Padbury basins. Unknown Proterozoic orogenic belts, possibly similar to the Albany Complex in southern Western Australia and the Musgrave Block, represent the Proterozoic link between the Yilgarn and Gawler cratons, covered by the Proterozoic-Palaeozoic Officer and Amadeus basins.[13]\n\n\n\n### Aboriginal\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Pictographs known as Wandjina in the Wunnumurra Gorge, Barnett River, Kimberley, Western Australia \nIndigenous Australians have lived in the desert for at least 50,000 years[14] and occupied all Outback regions, including the driest deserts, when Europeans first entered central Australia in the 1800s. Many Indigenous Australians retain strong physical and cultural links to their traditional country and are legally recognised as the traditional owners of large parts of the Outback under Commonwealth Native Title legislation.\n\n\nAboriginal tribes and clans have been nomadic in the desert areas for thousands of years. They subsisted on the local flora and fauna, now known as bush food, and made sure that their sources of drinking water remained intact. The nomads moved in clearly demarcated tribal areas. For example, important tribes living in the desert areas include the Arrernte, Luritja and Pitjantjatjara. The latter tribe's sphere of influence extended from Ulu\u1e5fu to the Nullarbor Plain. The Dieri tribe lives in a large area of the Simpson, Strzelecki and Tirari deserts.[15]\n\n\nThe rock art and archaeological site at Karnatukul was, until recently, estimated to have been inhabited for up to 25,000 years, and known as the site of the oldest continuous recorded occupation in the Western Desert cultural region.[16] Karnakatul shows one of the earliest uses of firewood, and habitation continued through times of extreme climate change, when the desertification occurred as the polar ice sheets expanded.[17] The oldest examples of rock art, in Western Australia's Pilbara region and the Olary district of South Australia, are estimated to be up to around 40,000 years old.[18] The oldest firmly dated evidence of rock art painting in Australia is a charcoal drawing on a small rock fragment found during the excavation of the Narwala Gabarnmang rock shelter in south-western Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory.\n\n\nThe isolated desert areas remained undeveloped for a long time. For example, the Spinifex People first had contact with whites in the 1950s, when they were expelled from their tribal lands because of nuclear weapons testing (1950\u20131963) by the British and Australian governments. The Pintupi Nine, a group of nine Aboriginal people of the Pintupi tribe, lived in the Stone Age area of the Gibson Desert until October 1984, when they first encountered whites as they left the desert. Both discoveries were sensations at the time.[19]\n\n\nLarge parts of the Australian desert areas are part of the Desert Cultural Area. For Aboriginal people, the Ulu\u1e5fu in the desert area and the Kata Tju\u1e6fa with their Dreamtime stories have great cultural significance. Aboriginal Australians of the desert produced many important artists, one of the first and most famous being Albert Namatjira, who was born in Hermannsburg in the Great Sandy Desert.[20] About a third of Australia's deserts are now Aboriginal lands. A very large part of it is managed by them as a nature reserve. A number of tribes have land use rights for almost all other desert regions. Today, numerous Aboriginal peoples live in settlements in the deserts.[21]\n\n\n\n### European\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Strzelecki Desert in South Australia\nThe Strzelecki Desert was named in 1845 by explorer Charles Sturt after Polish explorer Paul Edmund Strzelecki.[22]\n\n\nThe first European to cross the Great Sandy Desert was Peter Egerton Warburton. He arrived on the Western Australian coast badly exhausted and blind in one eye. He owed his survival to Charley, an Aboriginal tracker. The British explorer Ernest Giles, who crossed the desert in 1875, gave it the name Great Victoria Desert. It is dedicated to Queen Victoria.[23] From 1858 onwards, the so-called \"Afghan\" cameleers and their beasts played an instrumental role in opening up the Outback and helping to build infrastructure.[24]\n\n\nThe Sturt Stony Desert was named by Charles Sturt in 1844, while he was trying to find the inland sea which he believed lay at the centre of Australia.[25] In 1866 Peter Egerton Warburton's expedition reached the Tirari desert from the west.[26] The Overland Telegraph line was constructed in the 1870s[27] along the route identified by Stuart. In 1865 the surveyor George Goyder, using changes in vegetation patterns, mapped a line in South Australia, north of which he considered rainfall to be too unreliable to support agriculture. British explorer Ernest Giles named the Gibson Desert in memory of Alfred Gibson, who went missing during an 1873\u201374 expedition.[28]\n\n\nThe Tanami Desert was named by explorer and prospector Allan Davidson. He only assigned the name on his second expedition to this desert region, which ended in 1900. \"Tanami\" was the original Aboriginal name for two rock caves with clear drinking water.[29][30][31]\n\n\nThe Simpson Desert got its name from Allen Simpson, a geographer who ventured into this desert in 1845. The name was suggested by explorer and geologist Cecil Madigan. In 1936, Edmund Colson became the first white man to cross the Simpson Desert. Before that, the great Australian explorers Charles Sturt and David Lindsay had failed.[32][33] While the early explorers used horses to cross the Outback, the first woman to make the journey riding a horse was Anna Hingley, who rode from Broome to Cairns in 2006.[34] \nThe nuclear weapons trials carried out by the United Kingdom at Maralinga and Emu Field in the 1950s and early 1960s have left areas contaminated with plutonium-239 and other radioactive material.\n\n\n\n## Regions\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Deserts of Australia (in red), overlaid with internal boundaries and Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia biogeographic regions\n![](image)Undesignated areas surrounding the labeled desert regions are still predominantly arid.\nA large contiguous desert area is formed by the Tanami, Greater Sands, Lesser Sands, Gibson and Greater Victoria Sands in western Australia and a smaller one by the Simpson, Sturt, Strzelecki and Tirari Deserts in the east. Spatially isolated between Great Victoria Sand and Simpson lies the small Pedirka Desert, which spreads out over the geological Pedirka Sedimentary Basin. The Small Sandy Desert connects to the Great Sandy Desert and is similar in terms of landscape and vegetation. The Western Desert, which describes a cultural region of Australia's indigenous people, includes the Gibson, Great Victoria, Great Sand and Small Sand deserts in the states of Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia.[35]\n\n\nMost of the inhabitants of the area are Indigenous Australians. There are other areas in Australia designated as desert that are not related to the Australian deserts mentioned above. On Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia is an area of two square kilometers called the Little Sahara, a formation of several sand dunes on its south coast. In Victoria, about 375\u00a0km west of Melbourne, there is still the Little Desert National Park. The Painted Desert is 121 kilometers northwest of Coober Pedy in South Australia.\n\n\nThe almost treeless Nullarbor Plain in southern Australia, made of limestone, are also known as the Nullarbor Desert.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Desert\n | State/Territory\n | Area (km2)\n | Area (miles2)\n | Area rank\n | % of Australia\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Great Victoria Desert | South AustraliaWestern Australia | 348,750\u00a0km2 | 134,650\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 1\n | 4.5%\n |\n| Great Sandy Desert | Northern TerritoryWestern Australia\n | 267,250\u00a0km2 | 103,190\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 2\n | 3.5%\n |\n| Tanami Desert | Northern TerritoryWestern Australia\n | 184,500\u00a0km2 | 71,200\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 3\n | 2.4%\n |\n| Simpson Desert | Northern TerritoryQueenslandSouth Australia\n | 176,500\u00a0km2 | 68,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 4\n | 2.3%\n |\n| Gibson Desert | Western Australia\n | 156,000\u00a0km2 | 60,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 5\n | 2.0%\n |\n| Little Sandy Desert | Western Australia\n | 111,500\u00a0km2 | 43,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 6\n | 1.5%\n |\n| Strzelecki Desert | New South WalesQueenslandSouth Australia\n | 80,250\u00a0km2 | 30,980\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 7\n | 1.0%\n |\n| Sturt Stony Desert | QueenslandSouth Australia\n | 29,750\u00a0km2 | 11,490\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 8\n | 0.3%\n |\n| Tirari Desert | South Australia\n | 15,250\u00a0km2 | 5,890\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 9\n | 0.2%\n |\n| Pedirka Desert | South Australia\n | 1,250\u00a0km2 | 480\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 10\n | 0.016%\n |\n\n\n## Geography\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Generally flat lands of the Australian desert (Coober Pedy)\n![](image)Menindee Lakes in NSW\n![](image)Lake Gairdner, South Australia\n![](image)Lake Frome salt flats\n![](image)Darling River pictured from the International Space Station\nThere are four known types of terrestrial deserts:\n\n\n\n* continental (or remote) deserts\n* tropical (or zonal) deserts\n* shelter deserts\n* coastal deserts\n\n\nAustralian deserts generally meet the first three criteria, although some coastal desert areas exist in Western Australia. The great ocean circulation in the south of the continent and the cold sea currents in the southern zone play the fourth crucial role, indirectly at the origin of the long periods of continental drought by imposing high atmospheric pressures. As for the fifth hypothesis of cold or frozen deserts, as absurd as this assertion may appear in present-day Australia, they existed several million years ago. Geomorphologists thus explain a number of spectacular rock formations, from the Mount Olga or Uluru to the over-deepened wave of the wind rocks, by involving a thaw of (peri)glacial formations followed by wind action over a long period. The sand ridges have a trend of SSE-NNW and continue parallel for great distances.[36]\n\n\nAreas of the formerly desert outback, deserts such as the Simpson Desert from west to east or mountainous regions such as the Arckaringa Hills are characterized by ocean landscapes of charred rocks, called gibberss. As noted by early Australian explorers such as Ernest Giles[28] large portions of the desert are characterized by gravel-covered terrains covered in thin desert grasses and it also contains extensive areas of undulating red sand plains and dunefields, low rocky/gravelly ridges and substantial upland portions with a high degree of laterite formation. The sandy soil of the lateritic *buckshot* plains is rich in iron in the Gibson Desert. Several isolated salt-water lakes occur in the centre of the region and to the southwest a system of small lakes follow paleo-drainage features. The desert proper is uninhabitable and the environment remains unmarred, while the greener fringe is used for sheep grazing.[37]\n\n\n\n### Waterbodies\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This list is incomplete; you can help by adding missing items. *(August 2022)*\n |\n\n\nLakes in the regions (most of which are dried up saline lakes), include:\n\n\n\n* Menindee Lakes\n* Willandra Lakes Region\n* Lake Mungo\n* Peery Lake\n* Lake Amadeus\n* Lake Mackay\n* Lake Neale\n* Numby Numby\n* Lake Sylvester\n* Tarrabool Lake\n* Lake Woods\n* Lake Yamma Yamma\n* Lake Bumbunga\n* Lake Dey Dey\n* Lake Dutton\n* Kati Thanda\u2013Lake Eyre\n* Lake Frome\n* Lake Gairdner\n* Lake Gilles\n* Goyder Lagoon\n* Lake Gregory\n* Lake Hope\n* Sleaford Mere\n* Lake Torrens\n* Serpentine Lakes\n* Lake Maitland\n* Lake Carnegie\n* Lake Way\n* Lake Macleod\n* Lake Anneen\n* Lake Barlee\n* Lake Breaden\n* Lake Burnside\n* Lake Carey\n* Lake Dora\n* Dumbleyung Lake\n* Lake Nabberu\n* Serpentine Lakes\n* Kumpupintil Lake\n* Lake Ballard\n* Lake Lefroy\n* Lake Gregory\n\nRivers and creeks, which are sparse and generally ephemeral, in the Australian desert include:\n\n\n\n* Darling River\n* Alberga River\n* Finke River\n* Georgina River\n* Hale River\n* Alligator Rivers\n* Mary River\n* Todd River\n* Diamantina River\n* Gawler River\n* Macumba River\n* Warburton River\n* Fitzroy River\n* Leichhardt River\n\n## Biodiversity\n\n[edit]\n\n### Vegetation\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)A view of Mount Conner with typical tussock vegetation in the foreground\nTwo types of semi-desert, referred to as \"grassland\" in Australia, occur in the Australian deserts: Tussock \u2013 or Mitchell grasslands are found in the desert areas of the Northern Territory, South Australia and western Queensland. The annual precipitation that falls on these marl and alluvial soils covered with grasses of the Astrebla genus ranges from 150 to 500\u00a0mm. Trees cannot take root on the heavy clay soils, and they are riddled with bushfires. Spinifex or hummock semi-desert grows spiny- headed grasses (Spinifex) in clumps, next to free areas as green Triodia pungens and blue-grey Triodia basedowii. Zygochloa dominates on the sand dunes of the Simpson, Strzelecki and Tirari deserts. In large areas of desert, semi-desert grasslands with mulga bushes (Acacia aneura) predominate.[38]\n\n\nSemi-desert savannas with low-growing acacia species cover large areas in the south of the arid zone, where 200 to 500\u00a0mm of precipitation falls in winter and summer. The acacia species, called mulga, grow on the plains, mountain slopes and hills of the deserts. In connection with the bushfires, which are mainly ignited by the spinifex grasses, the non-resistant mulga bushes burn, which then no longer grow back. There is evidence that Aboriginal people did not start bushfires in mulga landscapes. The desert areas covered by mulga are also threatened by deforestation, extensive livestock farming and fuel wood production. At the eastern end of the arid zone is the so-called Witchetty Bush. This area is home to the endemic species of acacia, Acacia kempeana, which feeds the wood borer larva, the witchetty maggot, up to three inches in size. It is high in protein and was an important part of the Aboriginal diet.[39]\n\n\nEucalyptus woodland thrives along the dry riverbeds. Grasses grow on the soil under the eucalypts. Chenopodiaceae shrubs, which usually do not exceed 1.5 meters in height, are found in the southern desert areas. They are salt plants that grow on both dry and saline soils. In the deserts there are permanent or percolating patches of freshwater formed in rocky areas or in sandstone canyons. Bluebush and saltbush species grow in heavier soils. Between the sand ridges, the areas of wooded steppe consist of *Eucalyptus gongylocarpa*, *Eucalyptus youngiana*, and *Acacia aneura* (mulga) shrubs scattered over areas of resilient spinifex grasses, particularly *Triodia basedowii*. Most of the area is covered by hummock grasslands (Triodia spp.), with a few eucalypts, acacias, grevilleas, and bloodwoods (*Corymbia chippendalei* and *Corymbia opaca*) are found on sand hills. The vegetation of the dunefields of the Tirari Desert is dominated by either Sandhill Wattle (*Acacia ligulata*) or Sandhill Cane-grass (*Zygochloa paradoxa*) which occur on the crests and slopes of dunes. Tall, open shrubland also occurs on the slopes.[40]\n\n\nIn drier areas, species including Old Man Saltbush (*Atriplex nummularia*), Cottonbush (*Maireana aphylla*) and Queensland Bluebush (*Chenopodium auricomum*) form a sparse, open shrubland, whereas swamps and depressions are frequently associated with Swamp Cane-grass (*Eragrostis australasica*) and Lignum (*Muehlenbeckia florulenta*). The intermittent watercourses and permanent waterholes associated with tributaries of Cooper Creek support woodland dominated by River Red Gum (*Eucalyptus camaldulensis*) and Coolibah (*Eucalyptus coolabah*).[41] Numerous salt lakes form after heavy rainfall and at times fill the underlying salt flats. The salt lakes occupy relatively small areas in the desert areas. For example, a major salt lake is Lake Eyre, which spans areas of the Gibson and Tirari deserts and fills up completely and then dries up about once every 25 years. Seventeen headwaters have formed in the deserts as a result of the subsurface Great Artesian Basin, one of the largest freshwater basins in the world. The water coming out of the springs is rich in minerals. The springs partially form the habitat of endemic fish and the spring area is overgrown with rare plants. Numerous springs have dried up due to extensive agricultural use in the last 100 years. Threats to biodiversity include wildfires, feral animals, weeds, and uncontrolled grazing.\n\n\n\n* ![Great Sandy Desert from space](image)\n\nGreat Sandy Desert from space\n* ![Tussock grass in Gibson Desert](image)\n\nTussock grass in Gibson Desert\n* ![Kangaroo in Nambung National Park](image)\n\nKangaroo in Nambung National Park\n* ![Simpson Desert near Bedourie](image)\n\nSimpson Desert near Bedourie\n* ![Red dune in Simpson Desert](image)\n\nRed dune in Simpson Desert\n* ![Dismantled railway line near Lake Eyre South, South Australia](image)\n\nDismantled railway line near Lake Eyre South, South Australia\n* ![Desert savannah near Birdsville, Queensland](image)\n\nDesert savannah near Birdsville, Queensland\n* ![Desert flowers near Uluru](image)\n\nDesert flowers near Uluru\n\n\n### Wildlife\n\n[edit]\n\nSignificantly fewer animals live in the Australian deserts than in the Australian coastal regions. The most common creatures in Australia's arid regions are insects, such as termites and ants, which are of great importance to the ecology. Animals in the desert include feral camels, dingoes, goannas (including the large perentie) and numerous species of lizards and birds. Mammals include bilbies, mulgara, common brushtail possum, rufous hare-wallaby, burrowing bettong, the black-flanked rock-wallaby, marsupial moles, rufous hare-wallabies, yellow-footed rock wallaby, western grey kangaroos, and red kangaroos. Some of the bird-life found within the desert include the rare Alexandra's parrot, wedge-tailed eagles, Australian bustard, the mulga parrot, the scarlet-chested parrot and the chestnut-breasted whiteface (*Aphelocephala pectoralis*) found on the eastern edge of the Great Victoria Desert and the malleefowl of Mamungari Conservation Park.\n\n\nAbout 103 species of mammals lived there at the time of European colonization, of which 19 are extinct, such as the desert bandicoot (Perameles eremiana), the numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus) and the long-tailed bouncy mouse (Notomys longicaudatus).[42] The main survivors are small rodents, insectivorous bats, marsupials, kangaroos and wallabies. A major threat to vegetation are the free-roaming camels in the desert. Over 300 species of birds live in the desert areas, including emus, ratites, parrots, cockatoos, owls and raptors. The desert includes many types of lizards, including the vulnerable great desert skink (*Egernia kintorei*), the Central Ranges taipan (discovered in 2007), and a number of small marsupials, including the endangered sandhill dunnart *(Sminthopsis psammophila)* and the crest-tailed mulgara *(Dasycercus cristicauda)*. One way to survive here is to burrow into the sands, as a number of the desert's animals, including the southern marsupial mole *(Notoryctes typhlops)*, and the water-holding frog do.\n\n\nReptiles live in large numbers in the deserts, for example the woma python, thorny devil, bearded dragon, monitor lizard, frilled dragon and geckos. Frog species that have adapted to drought, such as the Desert Trilling Frog (Neobatrachus centralis) and the Desert Tree Frog (Litoria rubella), can also occur. The most numerous species of lizards in the world can be found in the Australian desert, there are over 40 species of them there. In addition to fish, the few permanent freshwater holes are also home to mussels, crustaceans and insects. 34 species of fish occur in Lake Eyre and others at the artesian springs (e.g. at Dalhousie Springs in South Australia). Over 40 species of frogs have been observed after heavy rains.\n\n\nThe Dingo Fence was built to restrict movements of dingoes and wild dogs[43][44] into agricultural areas towards the south east of the continent. Predators of the desert include the dingo (as the desert is north of the Dingo Fence) and two large monitor lizards, the perentie *(Varanus giganteus)* and the sand goanna *(Varanus gouldii)*. Many introduced species have affected the fauna and flora of Australia's desert regions. The Australian feral camel affects native vegetation, partly because Australian desert vegetation evolved without any major herbivores present.[5] Uncontrolled access to more sensitive areas by four-wheel-drive vehicles is also an issue. Feral cats have reduced the populations of bilbies and mulgara.\n\n\n\n* ![The marsupial mole prefers an underground life](image)\n\nThe marsupial mole prefers an underground life\n* ![A thorny devil in the Northern Territory](image)\n\nA thorny devil in the Northern Territory\n* ![The Gould's monitor lizard is a large species of lizard found in the Australian desert](image)\n\nThe Gould's monitor lizard is a large species of lizard found in the Australian desert\n* ![The galah lives in tree-covered savannas and open grasslands](image)\n\nThe galah lives in tree-covered savannas and open grasslands\n* ![Desert goby](image)\n\nDesert goby\n* ![Feral camels in Central Australia](image)\n\nFeral camels in Central Australia\n* ![Emu in South Australia](image)\n\nEmu in South Australia\n* ![Frilled-neck lizard](image)\n\nFrilled-neck lizard\n* ![Camel farm in Uluru](image)\n\nCamel farm in Uluru\n\n\n## Climate\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Dust storm (haboob) over southwestern Queensland in 2010\nAustralia's climate is mostly determined by the hot, sinking air of the subtropical high-pressure belt (i.e. Australian High).[5] Dry conditions are associated with an El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation in Australia. Vegetation in arid areas is primarily dependent upon soil type.[5]\n\n\nThe average annual rainfall in the Australian desert ranges from 81 to 250\u00a0mm (3 to 10 in), which would make it a semi-arid climate. But a massive evaporation rate makes up for the higher than normal desert rainfall. Central Australia is arid, with the driest areas averaging 150\u00a0mm (5.91\u00a0in) of rainfall each year. Thunderstorms are relatively common in the region, with an annual average of 15 to 20 thunderstorms. Summer daytime temperatures range from 32 to 40\u00a0\u00b0C (90 to 104\u00a0\u00b0F); winter maximum temperatures average between 18 and 23\u00a0\u00b0C (64 to 73\u00a0\u00b0F), though will be more warmer in the north.[45]\n\n\nExtensive areas are covered by longitudinal dunes.[5] The northwestern region of the desert is one which gives rise to the heat lows which help drive the NW monsoon. There, almost all rain comes from monsoon thunderstorms or the occasional tropical cyclone rain depression.[46] Frost does not occur in most of the area in the far north. The regions bordering the Gibson Desert in the far southeast may record a light frost or two every year, with frost being more prevalent in the Tanami region.[47] Away from the coast winter nights can still be chilly in comparison to the warm days. Minimum winter temperatures dip to 6\u00a0\u00b0C (43\u00a0\u00b0F) in most parts of the desert.[48]\n\n\n\n* ![Climate zones in Australia with deserts in orange and semi-deserts in yellow](image)\n\nClimate zones in Australia with deserts in orange and semi-deserts in yellow\n* ![Annual rain days in the desert range from less than 20 to no more than 80 days (on the 0.2\u00a0mm threshold)](image)\n\nAnnual rain days in the desert range from less than 20 to no more than 80 days (on the 0.2\u00a0mm threshold)\n\n\n## Tourism\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Devils Marbles\nTourism is a major industry across the Great Australian desert, and commonwealth and state tourism agencies explicitly target Outback Australia as a sought after destination for domestic and international travelers. Tourism Australia explicitly markets nature-based and Indigenous-led experiences to tourists.[49] In the 2015\u20132016 financial year, 815,000 visitors spent $988 million while on holidays in the Northern Territory alone. At Katjarra, there are two camping spots, with shed tanks and long-drop toilets, and Indigenous rangers are available to show tourists the part of the range that is open to the public.[50]\n\n\nRiversleigh, in Queensland, is one of Australia's most renowned fossil sites and was recorded as a World Heritage site in 1994. The 100\u00a0km2 (39 sq mi) area contains fossil remains of ancient mammals, birds and reptiles of Oligocene and Miocene age.[51]\n\n\nThere are several popular tourist attractions in the desert, which include:\n\n\n\n* Arkaroola and Wilpena Pound in the Flinders Ranges\n* Australian Stockman's Hall of Fame\n* Devils Marbles\n* Kakadu National Park\n* Kata Tjuta (The Olgas)\n* Katherine Gorge\n* Kings Canyon (Watarrka)\n* MacDonnell Ranges\n* Monkey Mia\n* Mount Augustus National Park\n* Uluru (Ayers Rock)\n* Willandra Lakes Region\n* Lake Mungo\n* Gawler Ranges National Park\n* Gawler Ranges Conservation Park\n* Great Victoria Desert Nature Reserve\n* Lake Gairdner National Park\n* Mamungari Conservation Park\n* Munga-Thirri National Park\n* Karlamilyi National Park\n* Mount Willoughby Indigenous Protected Area\n* Nullarbor Regional Reserve\n* Pureba Conservation Park\n* Queen Victoria Spring Nature Reserve\n* Tallaringa Conservation Park\n* Watarru Indigenous Protected Area\n* Yellabinna Regional Reserve\n* Yellabinna Wilderness Protection Area\n* Yumbarra Conservation Park\n* Black Rock Conservation Park\n* Bon Bon Station Conservation Reserve\n* Bunkers Conservation Reserve\n* Caroona Creek Conservation Park\n* Coongie Lakes Ramsar Site\n* Danggali Wilderness Protection Area\n* Ediacara Conservation Park\n* Elliot Price Conservation Park\n* Gawler Ranges National Park\n* Hiltaba Nature Reserve\n* Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park\n* Ironstone Hill Conservation Park\n* Kanku-Breakaways Conservation Park\n* Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre National Park\n* Kinchega National Park\n* Lake Frome Regional Reserve\n* Lake Gairdner National Park\n* Lake Gilles Conservation Park\n* Lake Torrens National Park\n* Mount Brown Conservation Park\n* Mount Willoughby Indigenous Protected Area\n* Munyaroo Conservation Park\n* Mutawintji National Park\n* Nantawarrina Indigenous Protected Area\n* Pandappa Conservation Park\n* Pinkawillinie Conservation Park\n* Pualco Range Conservation Park\n* Simpson Desert Regional Reserve\n* Strzelecki Regional Reserve\n* Sturt National Park\n* The Dutchmans Stern Conservation Park\n* Vulkathunha-Gammon Ranges National Park\n* Wabma Kadarbu Mound Springs Conservation Park\n* Whyalla Conservation Park\n* Winninowie Conservation Park\n* Witchelina Nature Reserve\n* Witjira National Park\n* Yalpara Conservation Park\n* Yellabinna Regional Reserve\n* Yellabinna Wilderness Protection Area\n* Yumbarra Conservation Park\n\n* ![MacDonnell National Park](image)\n\nMacDonnell National Park\n* ![Lake Mungo National Park](image)\n\nLake Mungo National Park\n* ![Uluru / Ayers Rock](image)\n\nUluru / Ayers Rock\n* ![Millstream-Chichester National Park in Pilbara](image)\n\nMillstream-Chichester National Park in Pilbara\n* ![Munga-Thirri National Park in Queensland](image)\n\nMunga-Thirri National Park in Queensland\n* ![Sturt National Park](image)\n\nSturt National Park\n* ![King's Canyon](image)\n\nKing's Canyon\n* ![Mount Augustus National Park](image)\n\nMount Augustus National Park\n* ![Mutawintji National Park](image)\n\nMutawintji National Park\n\n\n## Mining\n\n[edit]\n\nOther than agriculture and tourism, the primary economic activity in the vast and sparsely settled desert is mining. Owing to the almost complete absence of mountain building and glaciation since the Permian (in many areas since the Cambrian) ages, the outback is extremely rich in iron, aluminum, manganese and uranium ores, and also contains major deposits of gold, nickel, copper, lead and zinc ores. Because of its size, the value of grazing and mining is considerable. Major mines and mining areas in the Outback include opals at Coober Pedy, Lightning Ridge and White Cliffs, metals at Broken Hill, Tennant Creek, Olympic Dam and the remote Challenger Mine. Oil and gas are extracted in the Cooper Basin around Moomba. The Tanami Desert features The Granites gold mine and Coyote Gold Mine.\n\n\nIn Western Australia the Argyle diamond mine in the Kimberley is the world's biggest producer of natural diamonds and contributes approximately one-third of the world's natural supply. The Pilbara region's economy is dominated by mining and petroleum industries.[52] Most of Australia's iron ore is also mined in the Pilbara and it also has one of the world's major manganese mines.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nView of dunefields and mesa, Central Australia\n\n## Transport\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)A roadway within the red desert.\nThe outback is reticulated by historic tracks with excellent bitumen surface and well-maintained dirt roads. The Stuart Highway runs from north to south through the centre of the continent, roughly paralleled by the Tarcoola-Darwin railway line. There is a proposal to develop some of the roads running from the south-west to the north-east to create an all-weather road named the Outback Highway, crossing the continent diagonally from Laverton, Western Australia (north of Kalgoorlie), through the Northern Territory to Winton, in Queensland. Air transport is relied on for mail delivery in some areas, owing to sparse settlement and wet-season road closures. Most outback mines have an airstrip and many have a fly-in fly-out workforce.\n\n\nRoads in the desert include:\n\n\n\n* Birdsville Track\n* Burke Developmental Road\n* Canning Stock Route\n* Colson Track\n* Connie Sue Highway\n* French Line\n* Gary Highway\n* Gibb River Road\n* Great Central Road\n* Gunbarrel Highway\n* Kalumburu Road\n* Kidman Way\n* Lasseter Highway\n* Oodnadatta Track\n* Peninsula Developmental Road\n* Plenty Highway\n* Sandover Highway\n* Strzelecki Track\n* Talawana Track\n* Tanami Track\n\n## Towns\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough the desert covers about three-quarters of the continent, it only supports around 800,000 residents \u2013 less than 5% of the Australian population. In addition, there are approximately 1,200 small Indigenous communities, of which almost half have a population of fewer than 100 people. The Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) started service in 1928 and helps people who live in the outback of Australia. In former times, serious injuries or illnesses often meant death due to the lack of proper medical facilities and trained personnel. Young Indigenous adults from the Gibson Desert region work in the Wilurarra Creative programs to maintain and develop their culture. Indigenous Australians in the desert regions include the Kogara, the Mirning and the Pitjantjatjara. Aboriginal populations have been increasing in this region.[53]\n\n\n\n* ![Alice Springs is a large town situated roughly in Australia's geographic red centre.](image)\n\nAlice Springs is a large town situated roughly in Australia's geographic red centre.\n* ![Port Hedland is a coastal, tourist town in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.](image)\n\nPort Hedland is a coastal, tourist town in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.\n* ![Broken Hill is a mining city in New South Wales that is known as the \"Capital of the Outback\".](image)\n\nBroken Hill is a mining city in New South Wales that is known as the \"Capital of the Outback\".\n* ![Port Augusta is a small desert city located on the Spencer Gulf.](image)\n\nPort Augusta is a small desert city located on the Spencer Gulf.\n\n\nInhabited areas within the Great Australian desert include many towns and as well as some cities, such as:\n\n\n\nNorthern Territory\n* Yulara\n* Alice Springs\n* Elliot\n* Tennant Creek\n\nNew South Wales/Victoria\n* Broken Hill\n* Cobar\n* Wilcannia\n* Bourke\n* Mildura\n* Wentworth\n* Tibooburra\n\nWestern Australia\n* Dampier\n* Kalgoorlie\n* Wiluna\n* Carnarvon\n* Karratha\n* Paraburdoo\n* Port Hedland\n* Halls Creek\n* Fitzroy Crossing\n* Newman\n* Exmouth\n* Meekatharra\n* Eucla\n* Wyndham\n\nQueensland\n* Mount Isa\n* Cloncurry\n* Cunnamulla\n* Longreach\n\nSouth Australia\n* Whyalla\n* Coober Pedy\n* Ceduna\n* Renmark\n* Port Augusta\n* Port Pirie\n* Oodnadatta\n* Roxby Downs\n* Andamooka\n\n## Languages and people\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Indigenous Australian languages\n\nThe Aboriginal languages with the most speakers today in the desert include Upper Arrernte, Walmajarri, Warlpiri, and the Western Desert languages within the Western Desert cultural bloc, such as the Wati languages, the Panyjima language, Wangkatha, Noongar language, the Yankunytjatjara dialect and the Pitjantjatjara dialect. There is also the Adnyamathanha language in South Australia. Other (extant) language clusters include the Kalkatungic languages, Ngarna languages Arandic languages, Ngumpin\u2013Yapa languages, Warumungu languages, Ngayarda languages, Kanyara-Mantharta languages and Thura-Yura languages. Most of these languages belong in the Pama\u2013Nyungan language family.[54][55]\n\n\nEthnic groups include the Kartudjara, Warumungu people, Pitjantjatjara, Panyjima people, Kuyani, Yankunytjatjara, Kunapa, Manjiljarra, Ayerrereng, Yuruwinga, Yulparija and the Maduwongga.[56]\n\n\n\n* ![Cape Dombey people in Northern Territory, circa 1905](image)\n\nCape Dombey people in Northern Territory, circa 1905\n* ![Aboriginal tribe in NT](image)\n\nAboriginal tribe in NT\n* ![Luritja people](image)\n\nLuritja people\n* ![Frederic Bonney with an Aboriginal tribe](image)\n\nFrederic Bonney with an Aboriginal tribe\n* ![Eastern Arrernte people, Arltunga district, Northern Territory](image)\n\nEastern Arrernte people, Arltunga district, Northern Territory\n* ![Arrernte boy, South Australia](image)\n\nArrernte boy, South Australia\n\n\n## Popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nPopular movies set or filmed in the Australian desert include:\n\n\n\n* Kangaroo (1952)\n* Wake in Fright (1971)\n* Walkabout (1971)\n* Mad Max (1979)\n* The Road Warrior (1981)\n* Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)\n* Crocodile Dundee (1986)\n* Crocodile Dundee II (1988)\n* Evil Angels (1988)\n* Quigley Down Under (1990)\n* The Rescuers Down Under (1990)\n* The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994)\n* Napoleon (1995)\n* Welcome to Woop Woop (1997)\n* Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002)\n* The Tracker (2002)\n* Kangaroo Jack (2003)\n* Wolf Creek (2005)\n* The Proposition (2005)\n* Rogue (2007)\n* Australia (2008)\n* Bran Nue Dae (2009)\n* Last Ride (2009)\n* Samson and Delilah (2009)\n* Red Dog (2012)\n* Satellite Boy (2012)\n* Blinky Bill the Movie (2015)\n* Sweet Country (2017)\n* Bilby (2018)\n* High Ground (2020)\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![flag](image)Australia portal\n\n\n* Bushland\n* Irrigation in Australia\n* Outback\n* The bush\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Deserts by Geoscience Australia\n2. **^** Geosciences Australia \u2013Deserts\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Aleshire, Peter; Geoffrey H.

Antarctic Desert (5.5 million sq miles/14.2 million sq km)\n- Dominant animal life: Penguins (especially Emperor penguins) are the main terrestrial animals, along with various seabirds. The surrounding waters host seals, whales, and large populations of krill. Very few land animals can survive the extreme cold, making marine life the dominant form.\n\n2. Arctic Desert (5.4 million sq miles/13.9 million sq km)\n- Dominant animal life: While the search results don't provide detailed information about Arctic Desert wildlife, this polar desert is known to support animals adapted to extreme cold like polar bears, Arctic foxes, caribou, and various seabirds.\n\n3. Sahara Desert (3.6 million sq miles/9.2 million sq km)\n- Dominant animal life: The main animals include various desert foxes (fennec, pale, and R\u00fcppell's), gazelles (dorcas and dama), addax antelope, and the critically endangered Saharan cheetah. The desert is also home to numerous reptiles, including monitor lizards and sand vipers, as well as many bird species.\n\n4. Great Australian Desert (1 million sq miles/2.7 million sq km)\n- Dominant animal life: The dominant animals include kangaroos (especially red and western grey species), various lizards (including goannas and the thorny devil), dingoes, and numerous bird species like emus and parrots. The desert also has a significant population of feral camels, which though introduced, have become a notable presence in the ecosystem.\n\nThese deserts are characterized by different types of extreme conditions - the polar deserts (Antarctic and Arctic) are defined by extreme cold, while the Sahara and Australian deserts are hot deserts. This results in very different types of animal life adapted to these specific environmental challenges.",
