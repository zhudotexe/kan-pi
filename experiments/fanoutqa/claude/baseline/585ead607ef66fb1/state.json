For other uses, see EGOT (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n**EGOT**, an acronym for the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards, is the designation given to people who have won all four of the major American art awards.[1][2] Respectively, these awards honor outstanding achievements in television, recording, film, and Broadway theatre.[3] Achieving the EGOT has been referred to as the \"grand slam\" of show business.[1][4] As of 2023,[update] 18 people have won a competitive EGOT, and 6 others have earned the distinction with honorary or special awards.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe EGOT acronym was coined by actor Philip Michael Thomas in late 1984, when his role on *Miami Vice* brought him instant fame, and he stated a desire to achieve the EGOT within five years.[6][7] The acronym gained wider recognition following a 2009 episode of *30 Rock* that introduced EGOT status as a recurring plotline.[8] In 2023, *TheaterMania* writer Zachary Stewart criticized the practice of \"selling\" producer credits for shows favored to win a Tony as a \"shortcut\" to EGOT status. He drew a distinction between the producers who actually do the work of organizing the production of a show and investing producers who merely help finance it, often late in the award season.[9]\n\n\n\n## EGOT winners[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Emmy\n | Grammy\n | Oscar\n | Tony\n | EGOT completed\n | Year span\n | Age at completion\n | Category(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Richard Rodgers | 1962\n | 1960[n 1] | 1946\n | 1950[n 1][n 2] | 1962\n | 16\n | 59\u00a0years, 10\u00a0months\n | Composer, producer\n |\n| Helen Hayes[n 3] | 1953\n | 1977\n | 1932[n 1] | 1947[n 1][n 2] | 1977\n | 45\n | 76\u00a0years, 4\u00a0months\n | Actress\n |\n| Rita Moreno[n 3] | 1977[n 1] | 1972\n | 1962\n | 1975\n | 1977\n | 15\n | 45\u00a0years, 9\u00a0months\n | Actress, singer, dancer\n |\n| John Gielgud | 1991\n | 1979\n | 1982\n | 1961[n 1],[n 2] | 1991\n | 29\n | 87\u00a0years, 4\u00a0months\n | Actor, director\n |\n| Audrey Hepburn | 1993[n 4] | 1994[n 4] | 1954[n 2] | 1954[n 2] | 1994\n | 40\n | 63\u00a0years, 8\u00a0months[n 4] | Actress\n |\n| Marvin Hamlisch | 1995[n 1] | 1974[n 1] | 1974[n 1] | 1976\n | 1995\n | 21\n | 51\u00a0years, 3\u00a0months\n | Composer\n |\n| Jonathan Tunick | 1982\n | 1988\n | 1978\n | 1997\n | 1997\n | 19\n | 59\u00a0years, 1\u00a0month\n | Orchestrator, music arranger, composer, conductor\n |\n| Mel Brooks | 1967[n 1] | 1998[n 1] | 1969\n | 2001[n 1] | 2001\n | 34\n | 74\u00a0years, 11\u00a0months\n | Writer, director, songwriter, actor\n |\n| Mike Nichols | 2001[n 1] | 1961\n | 1968\n | 1964[n 1] | 2001\n | 40\n | 69\u00a0years, 11\u00a0months\n | Director, comedian\n |\n| Whoopi Goldberg | 2002[n 1][n 5] | 1986\n | 1991\n | 2002\n | 2002\n | 16\n | 46\u00a0years, 6\u00a0months\n | Comedian, actress, host, producer, author\n |\n| Scott Rudin | 1984\n | 2012\n | 2008\n | 1994[n 1] | 2012\n | 28\n | 53\u00a0years, 6\u00a0months\n | Producer\n |\n| Robert Lopez[n 6] | 2008[n 1][n 7] | 2012[n 1] | 2014[n 1] | 2004[n 1] | 2014\n | 10\n | 39\u00a0years\n | Composer\n |\n| Andrew Lloyd Webber | 2018[n 8] | 1980[n 1][n 2] | 1997\n | 1980[n 1][n 2] | 2018\n | 38\n | 70\u00a0years, 5\u00a0months\n | Composer, producer\n |\n| Tim Rice | 2018[n 8] | 1980[n 1] | 1993[n 1] | 1980[n 1] | 2018\n | 38\n | 73\u00a0years, 9\u00a0months\n | Lyricist, librettist, producer\n |\n| John Legend | 2018[n 8] | 2006[n 1] | 2015\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 12\n | 39\u00a0years, 8\u00a0months\n | Singer, composer, producer\n |\n| Alan Menken | 2020[n 5][n 2] | 1991[n 1] | 1990[n 1] | 2012\n | 2020\n | 30\n | 70\u00a0years, 11\u00a0months\n | Composer, producer\n |\n| Jennifer Hudson | 2021[n 5] | 2009\n | 2007\n | 2022\n | 2022\n | 15\n | 40\u00a0years, 9\u00a0months\n | Singer, actress, producer, talk show host\n |\n| Viola Davis[n 3] | 2015\n | 2023\n | 2017\n | 2001[n 1] | 2023[11] | 22\n | 57\u00a0years, 5\u00a0months\n | Actress, producer\n |\n\n\n### Non-competitive EGOT[edit]\n\n\nSix additional artists have received all four awards, though one was bestowed for an honorary or similar non-competitive distinction: Barbra Streisand has no competitive Tony, Liza Minnelli has no competitive Grammy, and Harry Belafonte, James Earl Jones, Quincy Jones, and Frank Marshall have no competitive Oscar.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Artist\n | 1st Award\n | 2nd Award\n | 3rd Award\n | 4th Award\n | Year span\n | Category(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Barbra Streisand | 1964\n | Grammy\n | 1965\n | Emmy\n | 1969\n | Oscar\n | 1970\n | Special Tony Award | 6\n | Actress and singer\n |\n| Liza Minnelli | 1965\n | Tony\n | 1973\n | Oscar\n | 1973\n | Emmy\n | 1990\n | Grammy Legend Award | 25\n | Actress and singer\n |\n| James Earl Jones | 1969\n | Tony\n | 1977\n | Grammy\n | 1991\n | Emmy\n | 2011\n | Academy Honorary Award (Oscar)\n | 42\n | Actor and voice actor\n |\n| Harry Belafonte | 1954\n | Tony\n | 1960\n | Emmy\n | 1961\n | Grammy\n | 2014\n | Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (Oscar)\n | 60\n | Activist, actor and singer\n |\n| Quincy Jones | 1964\n | Grammy\n | 1977\n | Emmy\n | 1994\n | Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (Oscar)\n | 2016\n | Tony\n | 52\n | Activist, arranger, composer, conductor, musician, and record producer\n |\n| Frank Marshall | 2019\n | Irving G.

Some say the \"P\" refers to the Peabody Award,[30] others say it is the Pulitzer Prize.[31][32][33] As of 2019[update], Mike Nichols, Rita Moreno, and Barbra Streisand (if her Special Tony Award is considered) have achieved this status by winning the Peabody;[34] while Richard Rodgers and Marvin Hamlisch have achieved it by winning the Pulitzer.[35]\n\n\nEGOT winners who also won a Peabody Award:\n\n\n\n1. Barbra Streisand[30][note 1]\n2. Mike Nichols\u2020[30]\n3. Rita Moreno[32]\n\n\nEGOT winners who also won a Pulitzer Prize:\n\n\n\n1. Richard Rodgers\u2020[31]\n2. Marvin Hamlisch\u2020[31]\n\n\nPeople who won a Peabody, lacking only one EGOT award:\n\n\n\n1. Carol Burnett[note 2] (missing an Oscar)\n2. Martin Charnin\u2020 (missing an Oscar)\n3. Rob Epstein (missing a Tony)\n4. Anne Garefino (missing an Oscar)\n5. James Moll (missing a Tony)\n6. Trey Parker (missing an Oscar)\n7. Matt Stone (missing an Oscar)\n8. Charles Strouse (missing an Oscar)\n9. Lily Tomlin (missing an Oscar)\n10. Cicely Tyson\u2020[note 3] (missing a Grammy)\n11. Oprah Winfrey[note 4] (missing a Grammy)\n\n\nParker and Tomlin were nominated for a 1999 Oscar for Best Original Song and 1975 Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, respectively, but did not win.\n\n\nPeople who won a Pulitzer, lacking only one EGOT award:\n\n\n\n1. Jerry Bock\u2020 (missing an Oscar)\n2. Oscar Hammerstein II\u2020 (missing an Emmy)\n3. Tom Kitt (missing an Oscar)\n4. Frank Loesser\u2020 (missing an Emmy)\n5. Lin-Manuel Miranda (missing an Oscar)\n6. Stephen Sondheim\u2020 (missing an Emmy)\n\n\nMiranda was nominated for the Oscar for Best Original Song in both 2017 and 2022 but did not win either.[31]\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\u2020 \u2013 Person is deceased.\n\n\n\n\n1. **^** Streisand's Tony Award was non-competitive.\n2. **^** Burnett's Tony Award was non-competitive.\n3. **^** Tyson's Academy Award was non-competitive.\n4. **^** Winfrey's Academy Award was non-competitive.\n\n### REGOT[edit]\n\n\nAnother variation is the **REGOT**, which includes being awarded a Razzie.[36][37] Alan Menken has a REGOT due to his Razzie win with Jack Feldman for Worst Original Song for \"High Times, Hard Times\" from *Newsies*.[38] With her Razzie win for Worst Actress for *Rent-a-Cop* and *Arthur 2: On the Rocks*, Liza Minnelli has a REGOT if her non-competitive Grammy Legend Award is considered.[39]\n\n\n\n## Equivalent honours outside the United States[edit]\n\n\nThe Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards are presided over by industry bodies based in the United States, and as of 2023, 14 out of the 18 EGOT winners were American nationals. The remaining four \u2015 John Gielgud, Audrey Hepburn, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Tim Rice \u2015 were British. Many countries hold their own equivalent awards ceremonies honouring their own television, music, film, and theatre industries. In some cases, commentators in other countries have derived their own acronyms for individuals who have won at all four ceremonies.\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Leah Collins of CBC Arts proposed a Canadian equivalent of the EGOT: the Canadian Screen Awards (and their predecessors, the Gemini and Genie Awards) for film and television, the Juno Awards for music, and the Dora Mavor Moore Awards for theatre.[40] Toronto-based game show Trivia Club referred to this combination as the \"Two-Can-Ju-Do\".[41] No individual has won in all four categories.\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, Caitlin Welsh of Nova Entertainment proposed the \"LAHA\" as an Australian equivalent: the Logie Awards for television, the ARIA Music Awards for music, the Helpmann Awards for theatre, and the AACTA Awards for film.[42] She also could not identify any winners of all four awards, although Noni Hazlehurst has received nominations in all four.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Academy Awards\n* Emmy Awards\n\t+ Children's and Family Emmy Awards\n\t+ Daytime Emmy Awards\n\t+ International Emmy Awards\n\t+ News and Documentary Emmy Awards\n\t+ Primetime Emmy Awards\n\t+ Sports Emmy Awards\n\t+ Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards\n* Grammy Awards\n* Tony Awards\n* Triple Crown of Acting\n* British Triple Crown\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Quinn, Dave (January 24, 2017). \"What Is an EGOT?

Audrey Hepburn (UK) - 40 years between first and fourth award (1954-1994)\n\nWhen counting all awards won (not just the first of each type), Mike Nichols (USA) has the longest timespan of awards among EGOT winners at 51 years, but his initial EGOT completion took 40 years (1961-2001).\n\nSo there are two people who took more than 40 years to complete their initial EGOT:\n- Helen Hayes from the United States (45 years)\n- Audrey Hepburn from the United Kingdom (40 years)",
