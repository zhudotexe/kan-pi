Riot specified that it should weigh 70 pounds (about 32 kilograms), though the actual weight of the finished cup was reduced so it would not be too heavy to lift in victory.\nThe World Championship Cups for 2012 and for 2014 were created by Thomas Lyte.[82]\n\n\nIn 2022, Riot Games announced the formation of a multi-year partnership with American jewelry brand Tiffany & Co., producing a newly designed Summoner's Cup with a weight of 44 pounds (about 20 kilograms).[83]\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Location\n | Final\n | No. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Champion\n | Score\n | Runner-up\n |\n| 2011 | Jönköping | Fnatic | 2\n | 1\n | against All authority\n | 8\n |\n| 2012 | Los Angeles | Taipei Assassins | 3\n | 1\n | Azubu Frost | 12\n |\n| 2013 | Culver City Los Angeles\n | SK Telecom T1 | 3\n | 0\n | Royal Club | 14\n |\n| 2014 | Singapore Taipei BusanSeoul | Samsung White | 3\n | 1\n | Star Horn Royal Club\n | 16\n |\n| 2015 | Paris London Brussels Berlin | SK Telecom T1\n | 3\n | 1\n | KOO Tigers | 16\n |\n| 2016 | San Francisco Chicago New York Los Angeles\n | SK Telecom T1\n | 3\n | 2\n | Samsung Galaxy | 16\n |\n| 2017 | Wuhan Guangzhou Shanghai Beijing | Samsung Galaxy\n | 3\n | 0\n | SK Telecom T1\n | 24\n |\n| 2018 | Seoul Busan Gwangju Incheon | Invictus Gaming | 3\n | 0\n | Fnatic\n | 24\n |\n| 2019 | Berlin Madrid Paris\n | FunPlus Phoenix | 3\n | 0\n | G2 Esports | 24\n |\n| 2020 | Shanghai\n | Damwon Gaming | 3\n | 1\n | Suning | 22\n |\n| 2021 | Reykjavík | Edward Gaming | 3\n | 2\n | DWG KIA\n | 22\n |\n| 2022 | Mexico CityNew YorkAtlantaSan Francisco\n | DRX | 3\n | 2\n | T1\n | 24\n |\n| 2023 | BusanSeoul\n | T1\n | 3\n | 0\n | Weibo Gaming\n | 22\n |\n| 2024 | London\n |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n### By region[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Region\n | Titles\n | Runner-up\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| South Korea (LCK)\n | 8\n | 6\n | 14\n |\n| China (LPL)\n | 3\n | 4\n | 7\n |\n| EMEA (LEC)\n | 1\n | 3\n | 4\n |\n| Asia-Pacific (PCS)[b] | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n\n\n### By team[edit]\n\n\n*Italics* indicates a team/organization has been disbanded, acquired or no longer participates in the regional league.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Region\n | Champions\n | Runners-up\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| T1[c] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 4\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Gen.G[d] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 2[e] | 1[e] | 3\n |\n| Fnatic | EMEA (LEC)\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n |\n| Dplus KIA[f] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n |\n| Invictus Gaming | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| J Team[g] | Asia-Pacific (PCS)\n | 1[h] | 0\n | 1\n |\n| FunPlus Phoenix | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Edward Gaming | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| DRX | South Korea (LCK)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Royal Never Give Up[i] | China (LPL)\n | 0\n | 2\n | 2\n |\n| Weibo Gaming[j] | China (LPL)\n | 0\n | 2[k] | 2\n |\n| G2 Esports | EMEA (LEC)\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |\n| Hanwha Life Esports[l] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 0\n | 1[m] | 1\n |\n| *against All authority* | EMEA (LEC)\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |\n| *CJ Entus* | South Korea (LCK)\n | 0\n | 1[n] | 1\n |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The qualifier was available only for Philippines and Singapore.

In the final, DRX defeated T1 3–2 in a close series, becoming the first team to win the championship after starting from the play-in stage.[69][70] DRX's top laner, Hwang \"Kingen\" Seong-hoon, was named the MVP of the series.[71] Their victory was considered a Cinderella and underdog success story, as they had come from the play-in stage as Korea's fourth seed representative, and had beaten some of the more favored and accomplished teams along the way, including the previous worlds champions Edward Gaming in a 3–2 reverse sweep in the quarterfinals, and defeating the LCK Summer Split champions Gen.G 3–1 in the semifinals.[72]\n\n\n\n### 2023[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 League of Legends World Championship\n\nThe 2023 World Championship was held from 10 October to 19 November 2023, with the event taking place in two cities across South Korea: Seoul and Busan. Twenty-two teams qualified to participate at the World Championship based on placement within their own regional leagues and previous regional results in international play.[73] Albeit, one team qualified for the event through the newly-inaugurated Worlds Qualifying Series between the fourth-seeded teams from the LEC and LCS.[74]\n\n\nThe format for the event differed to the previous editions, with the introduction of a play-in stage, consisting of eight teams who are split into two double elimination brackets. There, three teams qualified to the second stage of the event where the qualifying teams, along with thirteen other teams, faced off in a swiss-system tournament to determine the qualifiers to the knockout stage, with the eventual champions being crowned at the conclusion of the single-elimination knockout stage.[75]\n\n\nThe finals was played at the Gocheok Sky Dome on 19 November, 2023 between Weibo Gaming from the League of Legends Pro League (LPL), and previous years' finalist T1 from the League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK).[76] In the final, T1 defeated Weibo Gaming 3–0, extending their record for the most world championships won by single team with four titles.[77] T1's top laner, Choi \"Zeus\" Woo-je, was named the MVP of the series, while fellow teammate Lee \"Faker\" Sang-hyeok became the first player to win four World Championships.[78][79]\n\n\n\n### 2024[edit]\n\n\nDuring the finals' broadcast of the 2023 World Championship, it was announced that the 2024 World Championship final will take place in London at The O2 Arena on 2 November 2024.[80][81]\n\n\n\n## Trophy[edit]\n\n\nRiot Games, which owns *League of Legends*, commissioned the winner's trophy as the Summoner's Cup. Riot specified that it should weigh 70 pounds (about 32 kilograms), though the actual weight of the finished cup was reduced so it would not be too heavy to lift in victory.\nThe World Championship Cups for 2012 and for 2014 were created by Thomas Lyte.[82]\n\n\nIn 2022, Riot Games announced the formation of a multi-year partnership with American jewelry brand Tiffany & Co., producing a newly designed Summoner's Cup with a weight of 44 pounds (about 20 kilograms).[83]\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Location\n | Final\n | No. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Champion\n | Score\n | Runner-up\n |\n| 2011 | Jönköping | Fnatic | 2\n | 1\n | against All authority\n | 8\n |\n| 2012 | Los Angeles | Taipei Assassins | 3\n | 1\n | Azubu Frost | 12\n |\n| 2013 | Culver City Los Angeles\n | SK Telecom T1 | 3\n | 0\n | Royal Club | 14\n |\n| 2014 | Singapore Taipei BusanSeoul | Samsung White | 3\n | 1\n | Star Horn Royal Club\n | 16\n |\n| 2015 | Paris London Brussels Berlin | SK Telecom T1\n | 3\n | 1\n | KOO Tigers | 16\n |\n| 2016 | San Francisco Chicago New York Los Angeles\n | SK Telecom T1\n | 3\n | 2\n | Samsung Galaxy | 16\n |\n| 2017 | Wuhan Guangzhou Shanghai Beijing | Samsung Galaxy\n | 3\n | 0\n | SK Telecom T1\n | 24\n |\n| 2018 | Seoul Busan Gwangju Incheon | Invictus Gaming | 3\n | 0\n | Fnatic\n | 24\n |\n| 2019 | Berlin Madrid Paris\n | FunPlus Phoenix | 3\n | 0\n | G2 Esports | 24\n |\n| 2020 | Shanghai\n | Damwon Gaming | 3\n | 1\n | Suning | 22\n |\n| 2021 | Reykjavík | Edward Gaming | 3\n | 2\n | DWG KIA\n | 22\n |\n| 2022 | Mexico CityNew YorkAtlantaSan Francisco\n | DRX | 3\n | 2\n | T1\n | 24\n |\n| 2023 | BusanSeoul\n | T1\n | 3\n | 0\n | Weibo Gaming\n | 22\n |\n| 2024 | London\n |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n### By region[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Region\n | Titles\n | Runner-up\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| South Korea (LCK)\n | 8\n | 6\n | 14\n |\n| China (LPL)\n | 3\n | 4\n | 7\n |\n| EMEA (LEC)\n | 1\n | 3\n | 4\n |\n| Asia-Pacific (PCS)[b] | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n\n\n### By team[edit]\n\n\n*Italics* indicates a team/organization has been disbanded, acquired or no longer participates in the regional league.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | Region\n | Champions\n | Runners-up\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| T1[c] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 4\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Gen.G[d] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 2[e] | 1[e] | 3\n |\n| Fnatic | EMEA (LEC)\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n |\n| Dplus KIA[f] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 1\n | 1\n | 2\n |\n| Invictus Gaming | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| J Team[g] | Asia-Pacific (PCS)\n | 1[h] | 0\n | 1\n |\n| FunPlus Phoenix | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Edward Gaming | China (LPL)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| DRX | South Korea (LCK)\n | 1\n | 0\n | 1\n |\n| Royal Never Give Up[i] | China (LPL)\n | 0\n | 2\n | 2\n |\n| Weibo Gaming[j] | China (LPL)\n | 0\n | 2[k] | 2\n |\n| G2 Esports | EMEA (LEC)\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |\n| Hanwha Life Esports[l] | South Korea (LCK)\n | 0\n | 1[m] | 1\n |\n| *against All authority* | EMEA (LEC)\n | 0\n | 1\n | 1\n |\n| *CJ Entus* | South Korea (LCK)\n | 0\n | 1[n] | 1\n |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The qualifier was available only for Philippines and Singapore.
