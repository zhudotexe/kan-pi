Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.\n\n\nModi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight. His account of helping his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably corroborated. At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.[c]\n\n\nIn 2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat and elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[d] and has been criticised for its management of the crisis. A little over 1,000 people were killed, according to official records, three-quarters of whom were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly Muslim.[10] A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against him.[e] While his policies as chief minister, which were credited for encouraging economic growth, were praised, Modi's administration was criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.[f] In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary majority, the first for a party since 1984. His administration increased direct foreign investment, and it reduced spending on healthcare, education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated the 2016 demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and introduced the Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.\n\n\nModi's administration launched the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[13][14] and the deaths of six Indian personnel to friendly fire was later revealed: but the action had nationalist appeal.[15] Modi's party comfortably won the 2019 general election which followed.[16] In its second term, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, an Indian-administred portion of the disputed Kashmir region,[17][18] and introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020 Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu mobs,[19][20][21] sometimes with the complicity of police forces controlled by the Modi administration.[22][23] Three controversial farm laws, led to sit-ins by farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which 4.7 million Indians died, according to the World Health Organization's estimates.[24][25]\n\n\nUnder Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding, or the weakening of democratic institutions, individual rights, and freedom of expression.[26][27][g] As prime minister, he has received consistently high approval ratings.[33][34][35] Modi has been described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics. He remains a controversial figure domestically and internationally, over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, which have been cited as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[h]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nNarendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a Gujarati Hindu family of grocers in Vadnagar, Mehsana district, Bombay State (present-day Gujarat). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c.\u20091915\u20131989) and Hiraben Modi (1923\u20132022).[42][b][43]\n\n\nAccording to Modi, as a child, he had to work in his father's tea shop on the platform of Vadnagar railway station,[44] but the evidence of his neighbours does not entirely corroborate this statement.[45][46] During a protest against the government, his brother, Prahlad Modi, contradicted that he ever sold tea. According to him, his father had brought up six of his children by selling tea and people were making a big mistake by calling the Prime Minister a \"chai wala\" (tea seller).[47]\n\n\nModi completed his higher secondary education in Vadnagar in 1967; his teachers described him as an average student and a keen, gifted debater with an interest in theatre.[48] He preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.[49][50]\n\n\nWhen Modi was eight years old, he was introduced to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and began attending its local *shakhas* (training sessions). There, he met Lakshmanrao Inamdar, who inducted Modi as a *balswayamsevak* (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor.[51] While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, Bharatiya Jana Sangh leaders who in 1980 helped found the BJP's Gujarat unit.[52]\n\n\nIn a custom traditional to Narendra Modi's caste, his family arranged a betrothal to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, leading to their marriage when she was 17 and he was 18.[53][54] Soon afterwards, he abandoned his wife,[55] and left home. The couple never divorced but the marriage was not in his public pronouncements for many decades.[54] In April 2014, shortly before the national election in which he gained power, Modi publicly affirmed he was married and that his spouse was Jashodaben.[56] The marriage was unconsummated and Modi kept it secret because he would not have been able to become a *pracharak* in the puritanical RSS.[57][58]\n\n\nModi spent the following two years travelling across northern and north-eastern India.[59] In interviews, he has described visiting Hindu ashrams founded by Swami Vivekananda: the Belur Math near Kolkata, the Advaita Ashrama in Almora and the Ramakrishna Mission in Rajkot. His stays at each ashram were brief because he lacked the required college education.[60] Vivekananda has had a large influence in Modi's life.[61]\n\n\nIn mid 1968, Modi reached Belur Math but was turned away, after which he visited Calcutta, West Bengal and Assam, stopping in Siliguri and Guwahati. He then went to the Ramakrishna Ashram in Almora, where he was again rejected, before returning to Gujarat via Delhi and Rajasthan in 1968 to 1969. In either late 1969 or early 1970, he returned to Vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for Ahmedabad,[62][63] where he lived with his uncle and worked in his uncle's canteen at Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation.[64]\n\n\nIn Ahmedabad, Modi renewed his acquaintance with Inamdar, who was based at the Hedgewar Bhavan (RSS headquarters) in the city.[65][66][67] Modi's first-known political activity as an adult was in 1971 when he joined a Jana Sangh Satyagraha in Delhi led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to enlist to fight in the Bangladesh Liberation War.[68][69] The Indira Gandhi-led central government prohibited open support for the Mukti Bahini; according to Modi, he was briefly held in Tihar Jail.[70][71][72] After the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Modi left his uncle's employ and became a full-time *pracharak* (campaigner) for the RSS,[73] working under Inamdar.[74] Shortly before the war, Modi took part in a non-violent protest in New Delhi against the Indian government, for which he was arrested; because of this arrest, Inamdar decided to mentor Modi.[74] According to Modi, he was part of a Satyagraha that led to a political war.[71][i]\n\n\nIn 1978, Modi received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in political science from the School of Open Learning[77] at the Delhi University.[57][78] In 1983, he received a Master of Arts (MA) degree in political science from Gujarat University, graduating with a first class[79][80] as an external distance learning student.[81] There is a controversy surrounding the authenticity of his BA and MA degrees.[82][83][j]\n\n\n\n## Early political career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India that lasted until 1977. During this period, known as \"the Emergency\", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.[87][88] Modi was appointed general secretary of the \"Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti\", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.[89] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once as a Sikh.[90] He became involved in the printing of pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.[91][92] He was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals who were wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.[93] During this period, Modi wrote a Gujarati-language book titled *Sangharsh Ma Gujarat* (*In the Struggles of Gujarat*), which describes events during the Emergency.[94][95] While in this role, Modi met trade unionist and socialist activist George Fernandes and several other national political figures.[96]\n\n\nModi became an RSS *sambhag pracharak* (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing activities in Surat and Vadodara, and in 1979, he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he researched and wrote the RSS's history of the Emergency. Shortly after, he returned to Gujarat and in 1985, the RSS assigned him to the BJP. In 1987, Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the party won comfortably; according to biographers, Modi's planning was responsible for the win.[97][98] After L. K. Advani became president of the BJP in 1986, the RSS decided to place its members in important positions within the party; Modi's work during the Ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role. Modi was elected organising secretary of the BJP's Gujarat unit later in 1987.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi with Atal Bihari Vajpayee in c.\u20092001\nModi rose within the party and was named a member of its National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise Advani's Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991\u20131992 *Ekta Yatra* (Journey for Unity).[48][100][101] Modi took a brief break from politics in 1992 to establish a school in Ahmedabad, and due to friction with Shankersinh Vaghela, a BJP MP from Gujarat.[101] Modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of Advani; as party secretary, Modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the BJP victory in the 1995 state assembly election.[102][103] In November of that year, Modi was appointed BJP national secretary and transferred to New Delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh.[104] The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha election.[48] Modi, who was on the selection committee for the 1998 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. His strategy was credited as central to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 election,[105] and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.[106]\n\n\n\n## Chief Minister of Gujarat\n\n[edit]\n\n### Taking office\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Keshubhai Patel's health was failing and the BJP lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. Allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and Patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in Bhuj in 2001.[105][107][108] The BJP national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and Modi, who had expressed misgivings about Patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement.[48] Advani did not want to ostracise Patel and was concerned about Modi's lack of experience in government. Modi declined an offer to become Patel's deputy chief minister, telling Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee he was \"going to be fully responsible for Gujarat or not at all\". On 3 October 2001, Modi replaced Patel as Chief Minister of Gujarat with the responsibility of preparing the BJP for the upcoming December 2002 election.[109] On 7 October, Modi was sworn in[110] and he entered the Gujarat state legislature on 24 February 2002 after winning a by-election in Rajkot II constituency, defeating Ashwin Mehta of the INC.[111]\n\n\n\n### 2002 Gujarat riots\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2002 Gujarat riots\n\nOn 27 February 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near Godhra, killing approximately 60 people.[k][114] The train carried a large number of Hindu pilgrims who were returning from Ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished Babri Masjid.[115][116] In a public statement, Modi said local Muslims were responsible for the incident.[7][115][117] The next day, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called for a *bandh* (general strike) across the state.[118][119] Riots began during the *bandh* and anti-Muslim violence spread through Gujarat.[115][118][119] The government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from Godhra to Ahmedabad further inflamed the violence.[115][120] The state government later stated 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed during the riots;[116] independent sources put the death toll at over 2,000,[115][114][121] the vast majority of them Muslims.[114] Approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps.[122] Numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilation of women.[6][123]\n\n\nScholars consider the Government of Gujarat to have been complicit in the riots,[7][124] and it has received much criticism for its handling of the situation;[125] some scholars explicitly blame Modi.[6][126][127] The Modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets; these measures failed to prevent the violence from escalating.[118][119] The president of the state unit of the BJP expressed support for the *bandh* despite such actions being illegal at the time.[7] State officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, which were often unable to meet the needs of those living there.[128] Muslim victims of the riots were subjected to further discrimination when the state government announced their compensation would be half that offered to Hindu victims; this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court.[129] During the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able.[6][117][130] Several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom and others have called it an example of state terrorism.[131][132][133] According to Martha Nussbaum, \"There is by now a broad consensus that the Gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law\".[6]\n\n\nModi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. During the riots, he said, \"What is happening is a chain of action and reaction\".[6] Later in 2002, Modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode.[134] In March 2008, the Supreme Court of India reopened several cases related to the riots, including that of the Gulbarg Society massacre, and established a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the issue.[125][135][136] In response to a petition from Zakia Jafri, the widow of Ehsan Jafri, who was killed in the Gulbarg Society massacre, in April 2009, the court also asked the SIT to investigate Modi's complicity in the killings.[135] The SIT questioned Modi in March 2010; in May, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him.[135][137] In July 2011, the court-appointed *amicus curiae* Raju Ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. Contrary to the SIT's position, Ramachandran said Modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence.[138][139] The Supreme Court sent the matter to the magistrate's court. The SIT examined Ramachandran's report, and in March 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. Zakia Jafri filed a protest petition in response. In December 2013, the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the SIT's finding there was no evidence against Modi.[140] In 2022, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition by Zakia Jafri in which she challenged the clean chit given to Modi in the riots by the SIT, and upheld previous rulings that no evidence against him was found.[141][142][143]\n\n\n\n### Later terms as Chief Minister\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2002 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election\n\nFollowing the violence, calls for Modi to resign as chief minister were made from politicians within and outside the state, including leaders of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party\u2014partners in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition\u2014and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue.[144] Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa but it was not accepted.[145] Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002.[146] In the election, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly.[147] Modi made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign,[148][149][150][151] and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among voters.[146] Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride,[5][148] a strategy that led to the BJP winning 127 of the 182[147] seats\u2014a two-thirds majority\u2014in the state assembly.[5][148] He won Maninagar constituency, defeating Congress candidate Yatin Oza.[152] On 22 December 2002, Modi was sworn in for a second term.[153]\n\n\nDuring Modi's second term, the government's rhetoric shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development.[107][5][148] He curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP).[154] When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration, Modi ordered the BKS's eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP.[154][155] Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. He wrote a foreword to a 2014 textbook by Dinanath Batra, which made the unscientific claim that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.[156][157]\n\n\nModi's relationship with Muslims continued to attract criticism. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee distanced himself, reaching out to North Indian Muslims before the 2004 Indian general election, following which, Vajpayee called the violence in Gujarat a reason for the BJP's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave Modi in office after the riots.[158][159] Western nations also raised questions about Modi's relationship with Muslims: the US State Department barred him from entering the United States in accordance with the recommendations of that country's Commission on International Religious Freedom,[160][161] the only person to be denied a US visa under this law.[160] The UK and the European Union (EU) refused to admit Modi because of what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK[162] and the EU[163] lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister in 2014, the US lifted its ban and invited him to Washington, D.C.[164][165]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi meeting with then-Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh in 2004\nDuring the run-up to the 2007 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election and the 2009 Indian general election, the BJP intensified its rhetoric on terrorism.[166] Modi criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \"for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation\" such as the 2002 Prevention of Terrorism Act.[167] In 2007, Modi wrote *Karmayog*, a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. In it, he said scavenging is a \"spiritual experience\" for Valmiks, a sub-caste of Dalits.[168][169] The book was not circulated at that time because of the election code of conduct.[170] After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Gujarat government authorised the deployment of 30 high-speed boats for coastal surveillance.[171] In July 2007, Modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of Gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post.[172] The BJP won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.[173]\n\n\nDespite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's campaigns in 2007 and 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections contained elements of Hindu nationalism. He attended only Hindu religious ceremonies and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign, Modi twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.[148] He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra.[148] Modi's 2012 campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including Afzal Guru and the death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the 2012 assembly election.[148] During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.[148] While campaigning for the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies, allowing him to reach a large number of people,[146] something he repeated in the 2014 general election. Modi won the constituency of Maninagar, defeating Shweta Bhatt of the INC.[174] The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure.[175] After his election as Prime Minister of India, Modi resigned as the Gujarat chief minister and as MLA for Maninagar. Anandiben Patel succeeded Modi as chief minister.[176]\n\n\n\n### Development projects\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Sardar Sarovar Dam during a 2006 height increase\nAs chief minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, which is usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. Modi's policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in Gujarat. He established financial and technology parks in the state and during the 2007 Vibrant Gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth \u20b96.6 trillion (equivalent to \u20b920\u00a0trillion or US$240\u00a0billion in 2023) were signed.[107]\n\n\nThe governments led by Patel and Modi supported NGOs and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them.[177] Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010.[178] As a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in India.[177] The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use[179] led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007.[180] Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project irrigated only 4\u20136% of the area intended.[177] In 2008, Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano car after popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Following Tata, several other companies relocated to Gujarat.[181]\n\n\nThe Modi government finished the process of taking electricity to every village in Gujarat its predecessor had almost completed.[182] Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. Early protests by farmers ended when those who benefitted found their electricity supply had stabilised[177] but, according to an assessment study, corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.[183]\n\n\n\n### Development debate\n\n[edit]\n\n![Modi speaking at flower-decked podium](image)Modi addressing graduates of the Gujarat National Law University in 2012 \nA contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat's economic development during Modi's tenure as chief minister.[184] The state's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate averaged 10% during his tenure, a rate similar to those of other highly industrialised states, and above that of India as a whole.[181] Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office; some scholars have stated growth did not much accelerate during his tenure.[185] Under Modi, Gujarat topped the World Bank's \"ease of doing business\" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.[186] In 2013, a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights, and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states, ranked Gujarat first among Indian states for \"economic freedom\".[181][187] In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.[5] Tax breaks and land for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states. Modi's policies of making Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of Special Economic Zones in which labour laws were greatly weakened.[148]\n\n\nDespite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in India with respect to rates of poverty, and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the \"alarming\" category on the India State Hunger Index.[188][189] A study by UNICEF and the Indian government found Gujarat under Modi had a poor record in immunisation of children.[190]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.[129] It showed a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.[129] The quality of education in government schools in Gujarat ranked below that of many Indian states.[129] The state government's social policies generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities.[129] Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas and those from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013, the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the Human Development Index.[9] Under Modi, the state government spent less than the national average on education and healthcare.[129]\n\n\n\n### Allegations of bribery\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring its raids in 2013 and 2014, the CBI seized some diaries from two big Indian companies, Sahara Group and Aditya Birla Group. These diaries contained references of alleged payments made to leaders belonging to as many as 18 political parties including BJP, Congress, JDU, BJD etc.[191][192] Among these were some entries mentioning \"Gujarat CM\" and \"Ahmadabad Modiji\".[193][194][192] Citing these entries, on 21 December 2016, the opposition leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that Modi received cash bribes worth \u20b965 crore from Sahara Group and Aditya Birla Group when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.[195][196] In November 2016, advocate Prashant Bhushan had filed a plea in the Supreme Court of India asking for investigation of the alleged bribe payments made to some senior public servants including Modi.[197][198] A Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Arun Kumar Mishra dismissed the plea in January 2017 stating that the evidence provided was insufficient.[199][200] Later on, Justice Mishra was criticised by a section of advocates and activists for siding with the Modi government in multiple judgements during his tenure at the Supreme Court.[201][202] *The Wire* questioned the manner in which the Supreme Court buried the Sahara-Birla diaries' investigation.[203]\n\n\n\n## Premiership campaigns\n\n[edit]\n\n### 2014 Indian general election\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2014 Indian general election\n\n![](image)Narendra Modi hands over his resignation as Maninagar MLA to the Speaker of the Gujarat Vidhan Sabha.\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) BJP announces Shri Narendra Modi as its Prime Ministerial candidate for Loksabha Elections. Bharatiya Janata Party on YouTube, 13 September 2013 |\n\n\nIn September 2013, Modi was named the BJP's candidate for prime minister ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha election.[204][205] Several BJP leaders,[206] including BJP founding member L. K. Advani who cited concern with leaders who were \"concerned with their personal agendas\", expressed opposition to Modi's candidature.[207] Modi played a dominant role in the BJP's 2009 general election campaign.[208][209] Several people who voted for the BJP stated they would have voted for another party if Modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate.[204][210][211] The focus on Modi as an individual was unusual for a BJP election campaign.[206][212] The election was described as a referendum on Narendra Modi.[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi meets his mother after winning the 2014 Indian general election\nDuring the campaign, Modi focused on corruption scandals under the previous Congress government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of GDP growth in Gujarat.[206] He projected himself as a person who could bring about \"development\" without focusing on specific policies.[206] His message found support among young and middle-class people. The BJP under Modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and Modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism.[209] Prior to the election, Modi's media image had centred around his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots but during the campaign, the BJP focused on Modi's neoliberal ideology and the Gujarat model of development.[209] The BJP sought to identify itself with political leaders who publicly opposed Hindu nationalism, including B. R. Ambedkar, Subhas Chandra Bose and Ram Manohar Lohia.[157] Hindutva remained a part of the campaign; BJP leaders used Hindutva-based rhetoric in several states.[213][206][210][38] Communal tensions were played upon, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Northeast India.[213] A proposal for the controversial Uniform Civil Code was a part of the BJP's election manifesto.[38]\nThe BJP's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media.[189] Modi's campaign blitz cost around \u20b950 billion (US$600\u00a0million)[184] and the BJP received extensive financial support from corporate donors.[214] In addition to more-conventional campaign methods, Modi made extensive use of social media[184][206] and addressed more than 1,000 rallies via hologram appearances.[38]\n\n\nThe BJP won 31 percent of the vote,[37] and more-than-doubled its number of seats in the Lok Sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984.[209][210] Voter dissatisfaction with the Congress and with regional parties in North India, and support from the RSS were reasons for the BJP's success.[210][206] In states such as Uttar Pradesh, where the BJP performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste Hindus, and its Muslim vote increased to 10 percent. The BJP performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between Hindus and Muslims.[210] The magnitude of the BJP's victory led many commentators to say the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties towards the right-wing.[38][184][210][215][216] Modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and Hindu cultural nationalism.[217]\n\n\nModi was a candidate for the Lok Sabha constituencies Varanasi and Vadodara.[218] He won in both constituencies, defeating Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal in Varanasi by 371,784 votes and Madhusudan Mistry of the Congress in Vadodara by 570,128 votes.[219] India's president appointed Modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the BJP, Prime Minister of India.[220][221] To comply with the law prohibiting MPs from representing more than one constituency, he vacated the Vadodara seat.[222]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Indian general election\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bharatiya Janata Party campaign for the 2019 Indian general election\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) BJP announced manifesto and Shri Narendra Modi as prime minister candidate. Bharatiya Janata Party on YouTube, 8 April 2019. |\n\n\nOn 13 October 2018, Modi was named the BJP candidate for prime minister in the 2019 general election.[223] The BJP's chief campaigner was its president Amit Shah. Modi launched the party's *Main Bhi Chowkidar* (\"I too am a watchman\") campaign ahead of the general election, against the INC's campaign slogan *Chowkidar Chor Hai* (\"The watchman is a thief\").[224] In 2018, the Telugu Desam Party split from the NDA over the campaign for special status for Andhra Pradesh.[225]\n\n\nAmit Shah launched the BJP's election campaign on 8 April 2019. In the campaign, the opposition targeted Modi on allegations of corruption over the Rafale deal with the Government of France, highlighting the controversy surrounding the deal.[226] Modi's campaign focused on defence and national security, especially after the Pulwama attack and the retaliatory Balakot airstrike, which was counted as an achievement of his administration.[16][227] Other topics in the campaign were development and good foreign relations in the first premiership.[228]\n\n\nModi contested the Lok Sabha election as a candidate for Varanasi; he won the seat by a margin of 479,505 votes, defeating Shalini Yadav of the Samajwadi Party (SP), who stood as a candidate for the SP-BSP alliance.[229][230] Modi was unanimously appointed prime minister for a second time by the National Democratic Alliance[231] after the alliance won the election for the second time with 353 seats in the Lok Sabha; the BJP alone won 303 seats.[232][233]\n\n\n\n## Prime Minister\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Premiership of Narendra Modi\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the premiership of Narendra Modi.\n![](image)Modi taking the oath of office as the Prime Minister of India, with President Pranab Mukherjee administering the oath\n![](image)Modi taking the oath of office as the Prime Minister of India for the second time, with President Ram Nath Kovind administering the oath\nAfter the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a landslide in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, Modi was sworn in as Prime Minister (PM) of India on 26 May 2014, becoming the first Indian PM to be born after the country's independence from the British Empire in 1947.[234] Modi's second term as PM began in 2019 following the NDA's 2019 Lok Sabha election win. On 6 December 2020, he became the fourth-longest-serving Prime Minister of India and the longest-serving non-Congress prime minister.[235]\n\n\n\n### Governance and other initiatives\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Prime Minister Modi walking towards the dais to address the Nation at Red Fort, on the occasion of 75th Independence Day, in Delhi on 15 August 2021\nModi's first year as PM saw significant centralisation of power.[157][236] Modi, who initially lacked a majority in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of Indian Parliament, passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power.[237] His administration enacted a bill to increase its control over the appointment of judges and reducing that of the judiciary.[37] In December 2014, he abolished the Planning Commission, replacing it with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog),[238][239] concentrating the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the PM.[237][238][239][240][241] The Planning Commission had in previous years been criticised for creating inefficiency in the government and of not fulfilling its role of improving social welfare but since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.[239]\n\n\nIn its first year of administration, the Modi government launched investigations through the Intelligence Bureau into numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the grounds these organisations were slowing economic growth. The investigations were criticised as a witch hunt. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres, and environmental nonprofit organisation Sierra Club and Avaaz were among the groups that were investigated.[157][240] Cases of sedition and terrorism laws were filed against individuals who criticised the government.[157][242] This led to discontent within the BJP about his style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.[157][237]\n\n\nModi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments in the previous 64 years.[243][244][245] Modi launched the Digital India programme with the goal of ensuring government services are available electronically, build infrastructure to provide high-speed Internet access to rural areas, boost manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promote digital literacy.[246][247]\n\n\nIn 2019, a law to reserve 10 percent of educational admission and government jobs for economically disadvantaged individuals was passed.[248][249] In 2016, Modi's administration launched the Ujjwala scheme to provide free liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) connections to rural households. The scheme led to an additional 24% of Indian households having access to LPG in 2019 as compared to 2014.[250] In 2022, the government eliminated LPG subsidies for all citizens except those covered by the Ujjwala program.[251]\n\n\nSince May 2023, ethnic tensions between some groups have resulted in violent clashes in Manipur. After 1 month of the violence, nearly 100 were killed and more than 36,000 people were displaced.[252] Narendra Modi has been criticised for his lack of reaction towards the violence.[253]\n\n\n\n### Hindutva\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Hindutva\n\n![](image)Modi pays obeisance at Tirumala Temple in Andhra Pradesh. \nThe activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after Modi's appointment as prime minister, sometimes with the government's support.[254][255] These activities included a Hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the supposed Islamic practice of \"Love Jihad\" and attempts to celebrate Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, by members of the right-wing organisation Hindu Mahasabha.[256][257] Government officials, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion programmes.[213]\n\n\nLinks between the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) grew stronger under Modi. The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP's electoral campaigns while the Modi administration appointed RSS-affiliated individuals to prominent government positions.[258] In 2014, Yellapragada Sudershan Rao, who had previously been associated with the RSS, became the chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR).[38] Historians and former members of the ICHR, including those sympathetic to the BJP, questioned Rao's credentials as a historian and stated the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism.[38][259][260] During its first term, the Modi administration appointed other RSS members to lead universities and research institutions, and recruitment of faculty members favouring the RSS increased. According to scholars Nandini Sundar and Kiran Bhatty, many of these appointees did not possess the qualifications for their positions.[261] The Modi administration also made numerous changes in government-approved history textbooks that de-emphasised the role of Jawaharlal Nehru and glorified that of Modi while also portraying Indian society as harmonious, and without conflict and inequity.[261][262]\n\n\nIn 2019, the Modi administration passed a citizenship law that provides a route to Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians,[263][264] but does not grant eligibility to Muslims.[265][266][267] This was first time religion had been overtly used as a criterion for citizenship under Indian law; it attracted global criticism and prompted widespread protests that were halted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[261][267][268] Counter-demonstrations against the protests developed into the 2020 Delhi riots, caused chiefly by Hindu mobs attacking Muslims.[269][270] Fifty-three people were killed in the protests, two-thirds of whom were Muslim.[271][272][273][274][275] On 5 August 2020, Modi visited Ayodhya after the Supreme Court in 2019 ordered contested land in Ayodhya to be handed to a trust to build a Hindu temple and ordered the government to give alternative 5 acres (2.0\u00a0ha) of land to the Sunni Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque.[276] Modi became the first PM to visit temples at Ram Janmabhoomi and Hanuman Garhi.[277]\n\n\nSoon after Modi returned to power in 2019, he took three actions the RSS had long called for.[261] The practice of Triple Talaq was made illegal and became a punishable act from 1 August 2019.[278][279][280] The administration repealed Article 370 of the Indian constitution that granted autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir, and also abrogated its statehood, reorganising it into the union territories Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.[261][281] The region was placed under a lockdown and internet services were suspended and were not completely restored until February 2021.[282] Thousands of people, including hundreds of political leaders, were detained.[283][284][285][286] The Supreme Court of India did not hear constitutional challenges to the reorganisation or the Citizenship Amendment Act. According to Bhatty and Sundar, this is an example of the subversion of the Supreme Court and other major institutions, which were filled with appointees favouring the BJP.[261]\n\n\n\n### Economy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)BRICS leaders in 2019. Left to right: Xi (China), Putin (Russia), Bolsonaro (Brazil), Modi and Ramaphosa (South Africa) \nThe Modi government's economic policies focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, and were based on a neoliberal framework.[240][287] Modi liberalised India's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including defence and railways.[240][288][289] Other proposed reforms included making the forming of unions more difficult for workers, and making recruitment and dismissal easier for employers;[287] some of these proposals were abandoned after protests.[290] The reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 September 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions\u2014including one affiliated with the BJP\u2014struck.[287] The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (Indian Workers Union), a constituent of the Sangh Parivar (Family of the RSS), stated the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers.[240]\n\n\nThe funds dedicated to poverty-reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly reduced by Modi's administration.[157] The money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6 percent of GDP during the previous Congress government to 12.6 percent during Modi's first year in office, and spending on health and family welfare declined by 15 percent.[240] The government lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold and jewellery.[240] In October 2014, the Modi government deregulated diesel prices.[291] During Modi's first term, his government reduced spending on education as share of the budget: over five years, education spending dropped from 0.7 percent of GDP to 0.5 percent.[292][293][294] The percentage of the budget spent on children's nutrition, education, health, and associated programmes was almost halved between 2014 and 2022.[295] Capital expenditure on transport infrastructure significantly rose, increasing from less than 0.4 percent of GDP in 2014 to 1.7 percent in 2023.[296]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Modi introduced the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub.[240][297] Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative but critics said it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market.[240] Modi's administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it.[298] The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in Parliament but was eventually allowed to lapse.[237] Modi's government passed the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence, subsuming around 17 taxes and became effective on 1 July 2017.[299]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi at the launch of the Make in India programme\nIn his first cabinet decision, Modi set up a team to investigate black money.[300] On 9 November 2016, the government demonetised \u20b9500 and \u20b91000 banknotes with the intention of curbing corruption, black money, terrorism and the use of counterfeit currency.[301] The move led to severe cash shortages,[302][303][304] and a steep decline in the Indian stock indices BSE SENSEX and NIFTY 50,[305] and sparked widespread protests throughout the country.[306] It is estimated 1.5 million jobs were lost and that one percent of the country's GDP was wiped out.[307] Several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash.[308][309] In the subsequent year, the number of income tax returns filed for individuals rose by 25 percent and the number of digital transactions steeply increased.[310][311]\n\n\nModi's administration has observed a decline in GDP growth and increasing joblessness compared to the previous administration under Manmohan Singh.[312] During the first eight years of Modi's premiership, India's GDP grew at an average rate of 5.5% percent compared tho the rate of 7.03 percent under the previous government.[313] Income inequality increased.[314] An internal government report said in 2017, unemployment increased to its highest level in 45 years. The loss of jobs was attributed to the 2016 banknote demonetisation, and the effects of the Goods and Services Tax.[315][316] GDP growth was 6.12 percent in the 2018\u201319 financial year, with an inflation rate of 3.4 percent.[317] In the year 2019\u201320, the GDP growth rate slowed to 4.18 percent, while inflation increased to 4.7 percent.[318] The Indian economy shrunk by 6.6 percent during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020\u201321, and was estimated to grow at 8.2 percent the following financial year.[319]\n\n\n\n### Health and sanitation\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Swachh Bharat Mission\n\nIn his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the central government's healthcare spending.[190] In January 2015, the Modi government launched its New Health Policy (NHP), which did not increase the government's spending on healthcare but emphasised the role of private healthcare organisations. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including a reduction in child and maternal mortality rates.[320] The National Health Mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices, received nearly 20 percent less funding[321][322] in 2015 than in the previous year. The Modi administration reduced the healthcare budget by a further 15% in its second year.[323] The healthcare budget for the following year rose by 19%; private insurance providers positively viewed the budget but public health experts criticised its emphasis on the role of private healthcare providers and said it represented a shift away from public health facilities.[324] The healthcare budget rose by 11.5% in 2018; the change included an allocation of \u20b920 billion (US$240\u00a0million) for a government-funded health insurance program and a decrease in the budget of the National Health Mission.[325]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi discussing the COVID-19 pandemic with Chief Ministers via videoconferencing in June 2020\nModi emphasised his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health.[320] On 2 October 2014, Modi launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (\"Clean India\") campaign. The campaign's stated goals included the elimination of open defecation and manual scavenging within five years.[326][327] As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them.[328][329][330] The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants,[331] and planned to construct 60\u00a0million toilets by 2019. The construction projects faced allegations of corruption and severe difficulty in getting people to use the newly constructed toilets.[327][328][329] Sanitation cover in India increased from 38.7% in October 2014 to 84.1% in May 2018 but use of the new sanitary facilities was lower than the government's targets.[332] In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated at least 180,000 diarrhoeal deaths in rural India were averted after the launch of the sanitation effort.[333]\n\n\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modi administration invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005.[334][335] The same month, all commercial domestic and international flights were suspended.[336] Modi announced a 14-hour curfew on 22 March,[337] and followed with a three-week \"total lockdown\" two days later.[338][339] Restrictions were gradually lifted beginning in April, and were completely revoked in November 2020.[336][340][341] A second wave of the pandemic that began in March 2021 was significantly more devastating than the first; some parts of India experienced shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medical supplies.[342] In late April India reported over 400,000 cases in a 24-hour period, the first country to do so.[343] India began its vaccination programme in January 2021;[344][345] in January 2022, India announced it had administered about 1.7 billion doses of vaccines and that more than 720 million people were fully vaccinated.[346] In May 2022, the WHO estimated 4.7 million people had died of COVID-19 in India, mostly during the second wave in mid 2021\u2014almost 10 times the Indian government's estimate. The Modi administration rejected the WHO's estimate.[24][25] India's death toll was thus the highest worldwide, accounting for more than 20% of all Covid deaths.[347]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Foreign policy of Narendra Modi and trips as prime minister\n\n![](image)Modi with U.S. President Donald Trump at Namaste Trump rally in Ahmedabad, India\nForeign policy played a small role in Modi's election campaign and did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto.[348] Modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding Congress government, focused on improving economic ties, security and regional relations.[348] Modi continued Manmohan Singh's policy of \"multi-alignment\".[348] The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially East Asia, with the use of slogans such as \"Make in India\" and \"Digital India\". The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel.[l]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi meeting Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi in New Delhi in January 2018 \nIndia's relationship with the United States improved after Narendra Modi became PM.[350] During the run-up to the general election, there was wide-ranging scepticism about future of the strategic bilateral relationship under Modi's premiership; in 2005, while Chief Minister of Gujarat, Modi was denied a US visa during the presidency of George W. Bush for his poor human-rights record.[160][161] Sensing Modi's victory well before the election, US Ambassador to India Nancy Powell contacted Modi as part of greater *rapprochement* from the West. Following Modi's 2014 appointment as India's PM, President Obama congratulated him over the telephone and invited Modi to visit the US.[351] The Modi government enjoyed a positive relationship with the US during the presidencies of Barack Obama and his successor Donald Trump.[352][353]\n\n\n\n![](image)Modi with Australian PM Anthony Albanese during the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event.\nDuring the first few months after his appointment as PM, Modi visited a number of countries in support of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN and G20 summits.[348] One of Modi's first visits as PM was to Nepal, during which he promised one billion US dollars in aid.[354] Modi also made several visits to the US;[355] this was described as an unexpected development because of the US's earlier denial of a US travel visa to Modi over his role in the 2002 Gujarat riots. The visits were expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.[355]\n\n\nIn 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land-exchange deal with Bangladesh in the India\u2013Bangladesh enclaves, which the government of Manmohan Singh had initiated.[237] Modi's administration brought renewed attention to India's \"Look East Policy\", which was instituted in 1991. The policy, which was renamed the \"Act East Policy\", involved directing Indian foreign policy towards East Asia and Southeast Asia.[356] The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with Myanmar through the Indian state of Manipur; this represented a break with India's historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade.[356] China\u2013India relations rapidly deteriorated following the 2020 China\u2013India skirmishes.[357] Modi pledged aid of $900 million to Afghanistan, which he visited twice and was honoured with Afghanistan's highest civilian honour in 2016.[358][359] In September 2022, Modi appeared to have developed a strong personal relationship with Russia's President Vladimir Putin.[360][361][362]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Modi excercised Cricket Diplomacy by hosting his counterpart Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese for a **Friendship through Cricket** event to celebrate 75 years of diplomatic ties at the 75 Years of Friendship through Cricket Event at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. [363]\n\n\n\n#### G20 Presidency\n\n[edit]\n\nIndia hosted the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit, during which the African Union joined the G20 as a permanent member.[364] In an interview on 26 August 2023, Prime Minister Modi expressed optimism about the G20 countries' evolving agenda under India's presidency, shifting toward a human-centric development approach that aligns with the concerns of the Global South, including addressing climate change, debt restructuring through the G20's Common Framework for Debt, and a strategy for regulation of global cryptocurrencies.[365][366][367]\n\n\nNews sources CNN, Reuters and the *Washington Post* reported that in the lead up to the G20 meeting, the Indian authorities, including the Archaeological Survey of India embarked on a mass demolition drive against homeless shelters and slum neighborhoods across New Delhi resulting in the eviction of its marginalized residents[368][369][370] The Indian government's press agency Press Information Bureau rejected the claims, and said that they were done as per the Supreme court of India orders and not linked to the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit.[371]\n\n\n\n### Defence\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Benjamin Netanyahu, at the time Prime Minister of Israel, and Modi visiting the Technology Exhibition, at Tel Aviv, Israel in 2017\nIndia's nominal military spending steadily increased under Modi.[372] During Modi's tenure, the military budget declined, both as a fraction of GDP and when adjusted for inflation.[373][374] A substantial portion of the military budget was devoted to personnel costs commentators wrote the budget was constraining Indian military modernisation.[373][375][374]\n\n\nModi promised to be \"tough on Pakistan\" during his election campaign and repeatedly called Pakistan an exporter of terrorism.[376][377][378] On 29 September 2016, the Modi administration said Indian Army had conducted a surgical strike on terror launch pads in Azad Kashmir; the Indian media said up to 50 terrorists and Pakistani soldiers had been killed in the strike.[379][380][381] Pakistan denied any surgical strikes to have taken place.[382] Subsequent reports said India's statement about the scope of the strike and the number of casualties had been exaggerated.[376][383][384] In February 2019, India carried out airstrikes against a supposed terrorist camp in Pakistan; no targets of significance were hit.[385][386] Further military skirmishes, including cross-border shelling and the loss of an Indian aircraft, occurred.[387][388][389] Eight months after the incident, the Modi administration admitted that six Indian military personnel had been killed by friendly fire.[390]\n\n\n\n![](image)PM Modi along with Quad leaders in Washington\nIn May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops engaged in an aggressive skirmishes along the Sino-Indian border, including near the disputed Pangong Lake, Ladakh, and the Tibet Autonomous Region and near the border between Sikkim and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Additional clashes took place in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).[391] In 2020, skirmishes between the nations led to many border clashes, responses and reactions from both sides.[392] A series of talks between India and China were held, using military and diplomatic means for peace.[393] The first border clash reported in 2021 was on 20 January; this was referred to as a minor border clash in Sikkim.[394] Modi has been criticised for maintaining silence over ceding about 2,000 sq km land to China since June 2020.[395][396][397]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Modi signed an agreement with Russian leader Vladimir Putin to extend military technical cooperation.[398] The Modi government bought the S-400 missile system, an anti-missile striking system, strengthening the relationship between the two nations.[399] India refused to condemn the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and stayed neutral.[398][400] The Indian government's Operation Ganga initiative sought to return Indians stranded in Ukraine during the war. More than 19,000 Indian nationals were evacuated,[401][402] including some from neighbouring countries.[403]\n\n\n\n### Environment\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Modi (right) at CoP21 Climate Conference, in Paris, announcing the founding of an International Solar Alliance (ISA). November 2015.\nWhile naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the Ministry of Environment and Forests the \"Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change\", and more-than-halved its money allocation in his administration's first budget.[404] The new ministry removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection, and others related to industrial activity.[240] The government also tried to reconstitute the National Board for Wildlife so it would no longer have representatives from NGOs but the Supreme Court of India blocked this move.[405] Other changes included a reduction of ministry oversight on small mining projects and ending the requirement for approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. Modi also lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in India's most-polluted areas.[405] The changes were welcomed by businesspeople but criticised by environmentalists.[406]\n\n\nSpeaking with Assamese students in 2014, Modi downplayed climate change, saying, \"Climate has not changed. We have changed. Our habits have changed. Our habits have got spoiled. Due to that, we have destroyed our entire environment.\"[407] Later in his administration, however, he has called for climate action,[408][409] especially with the proliferation of clean energy.[410][411] In 2015, Modi proposed the International Solar Alliance initiative to encourage investment in solar energy.[412] Holding developed countries responsible,[413] Modi and his government have said India has had a negligible historical role in climate change. At the COP26 conference, Modi announced India would target carbon neutrality by 2070 and expand its renewable energy capacity.[414] Indian environmentalists and economists applauded the decision, describing it as bold climate action.[415] India has become the only major economy to be on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals.[416] It has achieved 10 percent of ethanol blending five months ahead of schedule.[417]\n\n\n\n### Democratic backsliding\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding.[g] According to one study, \"The BJP government incrementally but systemically attacked nearly all existing mechanisms that are in place to hold the political executive to account, either by ensuring that these mechanisms became subservient to the political executive or were captured by party loyalists\".[29][418] The Modi government has used state power to intimidate and stifle critics in the media and academia, undermining freedom of expression and alternative sources of information.[419][30] His administration has been criticised for using a democratic mandate to undermine democratic processes, including focusing on Hindu-nationalist priorities rather than economic development. Modi's second term as PM, in particular, saw the erosion of civil rights and press freedom.[420]\n\n\n\n## Public perception and image\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Public image of Narendra Modi\n\n![](image)Modi at Yoga Day celebrations in New Delhi, 21 June 2015\nNarendra Modi has received consistently high approval ratings during his premiership;[33] he is often ranked in popular opinion polls as the greatest prime minister in Indian history.[421][422][423]\n\n\n\n### Image\n\n[edit]\n\nModi is a vegetarian and teetotaller,[424][425] who has a frugal lifestyle, and is a workaholic and introvert.[426] On 31 August 2012, he posted on Google Hangouts, becoming the first Indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat.[427][428] Modi has been called a fashion icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved *kurta*, and for a suit with his name repeatedly embroidered in the pinstripes, which he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention, and criticism.[429][430][431] Scholars and biographers have described Modi's personality as energetic, eccentric, arrogant and charismatic.[37][432]\n\n\nThe nomination of Modi for the prime-ministership drew attention to his reputation as \"one of contemporary India's most controversial and divisive politicians\".[184][433][434] During the 2014 election campaign, the BJP projected an image of Modi as a strong, masculine leader who would be able to take difficult decisions.[184][204][206][210][211] Campaigns in which he has participated have focused on Modi as an individual, an unusual tactic for the BJP and RSS.[206] Modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and development.[435] Modi's role in the 2002 Gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy.[8] Modi's hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government also continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.[8][37][157][206]\n\n\n\n### Approval ratings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Opinion polling on the Narendra Modi premiership\n\n![](image)Modi interacting with the school children after delivering his address on Independence Day in New Delhi, 15 August 2017\nDuring his premiership, Modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a Pew Research poll, with 68% of respondents rating him \"very favourably\" and 93% approving of his government.[436] Modi's approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% during his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instaVaani.[437] At the end of his second year in office, an updated Pew Research poll showed Modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him \"very favourably\".[438][439] At the end of his third year in office, a further Pew Research poll showed Modi with an overall approval rating of 88%, his highest yet, with 69% of people polled rating him \"very favourably\".[440] A poll conducted by *The Times of India* in May 2017 showed 77% of respondents rated Modi as \"very good\" and \"good\".[441] In early 2017, a survey by Pew Research Center showed Modi to be the most popular figure in Indian politics.[442] In a weekly analysis by Morning Consult called the Global Leader Approval Rating Tracker, Modi had the highest net approval rating as of 22 December 2020 of all government leaders in the 13 countries being tracked.[443][444]\n\n\n\n### In popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Category:Cultural depictions of Narendra Modi\n\n*Modi Kaka Ka Gaon* (Modi uncle's town), a 2017 Indian Hindi-language drama film by Tushar Amrish Goel, is the first biopic about Modi.

The Indian government banned the documentary, drawing widespread criticism.[449][450][451][452]\n\n\nOther portrayals of Modi include those by Rajit Kapur in the film *Uri: The Surgical Strike* (2019) and Vikram Gokhale in the web-television series *Avrodh: The Siege Within* (2020), both of which are based on the 2016 Uri attack and the subsequent Indian surgical strikes.[453][454] Gokhale reprised the role in the sequel *Avrodh: The Siege Within 2* (2022)*,* which is based on the 2016 Indian banknote demonetisation.[455] Pratap Singh played a character based on Modi in *Chand Bujh Gaya* (2005) which is set against the backdrop of the Gujarat riots.[456]\n\n\nModi appeared in an episode of Discovery Channel's show *Man vs Wild* with the host Bear Grylls,[457][458] becoming the second world leader after Barack Obama to appear in the reality show.[459] In the show, Modi treks through jungles, and talks about nature and wildlife conservation with Grylls.[460] The episode was recorded in Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand, and was broadcast in India and 180 other countries.[461] Modi hosts *Mann Ki Baat*, a monthly radio programme on All India Radio, and has conducted the competition *Pariksha Pe Charcha*, and discussions for students and the issues they face in examinations.[462][463]\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of awards and honours received by Narendra Modi\n\nIn March 2012 and June 2014, Narendra Modi appeared on the cover of the Asian edition of *Time Magazine*, becoming one of the few Indian politicians to have done so.[464][465] In 2014, *CNN-News18* (formally *CNN-IBN*) news network awarded Modi Indian of the Year.[466] In June 2015, Modi was featured on the cover of Time Magazine.[467] In 2014, 2015, 2017, 2020 and 2021, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World.[468] *Forbes Magazine* ranked him the 15th Most Powerful Person in the World in 2014 and the 9th Most Powerful Person in the World in 2015, 2016 and 2018.[469] In 2015, Modi was ranked the 13th Most Influential Person in the World by *Bloomberg Markets Magazine*.[470] In 2021 *Time* called Modi the third \"pivotal leader\" of independent India after Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, who \"dominated the country's politics like no one since them\".[471][472] Modi was ranked fifth on *Fortune Magazine*'s first annual list of the \"World's Greatest Leaders\" in 2015.[473][474] In 2017, Gallup International Association (GIA) conducted a poll and ranked Modi third-top leader of the world.[475][476] In 2016, a wax statue of Modi was unveiled at Madame Tussauds wax museum in London.[477][478]\n\n\n\n![](image)Narendra Modi's wax statue at Madame Tussauds, London\nIn 2015, Modi was named one of *Time*'s \"30 Most Influential People on the Internet\" because he was the second-most-followed politician on Twitter and Facebook.[479] In 2018, he was the third-most-followed world leader on Twitter and the most-followed world leader on Facebook and Instagram.[480][481][482] In October 2018, Modi received United Nations' highest environmental award, the Champions of the Earth, for policy leadership by \"pioneering work in championing\" the International Solar Alliance and \"new areas of levels of cooperation on environmental action\".[483][484] Modi was conferred the 2018 Seoul Peace Prize in recognition of \"his dedication to improving international co-operation, raising global economic growth, accelerating the Human Development of the people of India by fostering economic growth and furthering the development of democracy through anti-corruption and social integration efforts\". He is the first Indian to win the award.[485][486]\n\n\nFollowing his second swearing-in ceremony as Prime Minister of India, a picture of Modi was displayed on the facade of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) building in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.[487] The Texas India Forum hosted a community event in honour of Modi on 22 September 2019 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. The event was attended by over 50,000 people and several American politicians, including President Donald Trump, making it the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the United States other than the Pope.[488][489] At the event, Modi was presented with the Key to the City of Houston by Mayor Sylvester Turner.[490] The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Modi the Global Goalkeeper Award on 24 September 2019 in New York City, in recognition of the Swachh Bharat Mission and \"the progress India has made in providing safe sanitation under his leadership\".[491][492][493]\n\n\nIn 2020, Modi was among eight world leaders who were awarded the parody Ig Nobel Prize in Medical Education \"for using the COVID-19 viral pandemic to teach the world that politicians can have a more immediate effect on life and death than scientists and doctors can\".[494] On 21 December 2020, US President Donald Trump awarded Modi the Legion of Merit for improving India\u2013United States relations.[495][496][497][498] On 24 February 2021, Gujarat Cricket Association renamed Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad\u2014the largest cricket stadium in the world\u2014Narendra Modi Stadium.[499]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Electoral history of Narendra Modi\n\n\n\nElection results\n| Year\n | Office\n | Constituency\n | Party\n | Votes for Modi\n | %\n | Opponent\n | Party\n | Votes\n | %\n | Result\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002 | Member of the Legislative Assembly | Rajkot II | Bharatiya Janata Party | ![](image) | 45,298\n | 57.32\n | Ashwinbhai Narbheshankar Mehta\n | Indian National Congress | ![](image) | 30,570\n | 38.68\n | Won\n | [500] |\n| 2002 | Maninagar | 113,589\n | 73.29\n | Yatinbhai Oza | 38,256\n | 24.68\n | Won\n | [501] |\n| 2007 | 139,568\n | 69.53\n | Dinsha Patel | 52,407\n | 26.11\n | Won\n | [502] |\n| 2012 | 120,470\n | 75.38\n | Shweta Sanjiv Bhat\n | 34,097\n | 21.34\n | Won\n | [174] |\n| 2014 | Member of the Lok Sabha | Vadodara | 845,464\n | 72.75\n | Madhusudan Mistry | 275,336\n | 23.69\n | Won\n | [503] |\n| 2014 | Varanasi | 581,022\n | 56.37\n | Arvind Kejriwal | Aam Aadmi Party | ![](image) | 209,238\n | 20.30\n | Won\n | [218] |\n| 2019 | 674,664\n | 63.62\n | Shalini Yadav\n | Samajwadi Party |  | 195,159\n | 18.40\n | Won\n | [504] |\n\n\n## Writing career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, Modi published a Gujarati book titled *Jyotipunj*, which contains profiles of RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as *Pujniya Shri Guruji* (\"Guru worthy of worship\").[505] According to *The Economic Times*, Modi's intention was to explain the workings of the RSS to his readers, and to reassure RSS members he remained ideologically aligned with them.\n\n\nAfter becoming the Prime Minister he also authored a book called Exam Warriors, a guide for children to commendably face exams. Modi has written eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.[506]\n\n\n\n## Private life\n\n[edit]\n\nModi used to maintain a close and publicised relationship with his centenarian mother, Hiraben.[507]\n\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see Bibliography of Narendra Modi.\n\n* Modi, Narendra (2004). *Aapaatkaal Mein Gujarat* (in Hindi) (Samskarana 1\u00a0ed.).

A member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), he was the country's first president to not have emerged from the country's political or military elite. He previously served as governor of Jakarta from 2012 to 2014 and mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012.\n\n\nJokowi was born and raised in a riverside slum in Surakarta. He graduated from Gadjah Mada University in 1985, and married his wife, Iriana, a year later.[*citation needed*] He worked as a carpenter and a furniture exporter before being elected mayor of Surakarta in 2005.[1][2] He achieved national prominence as mayor and was elected governor of Jakarta in 2012,[3] with Basuki Tjahaja Purnama as his deputy.[4][5] As governor, he reinvigorated local politics, introduced publicised *blusukan* visits (unannounced spot checks)[6] and improved the city's bureaucracy, reducing corruption in the process. He also introduced years-late programs to improve quality of life, including universal healthcare, dredged the city's main river to reduce flooding, and inaugurated the construction of the city's subway system.[7]\n\n\nIn 2014, he was nominated as the PDI-P's candidate in that year's presidential election,[8] choosing Jusuf Kalla as his running mate. Jokowi was elected over his opponent Prabowo Subianto, who disputed the outcome of the election, and was inaugurated on 20 October 2014.[9][10] Since taking office, Jokowi has focused on economic growth and infrastructure development as well as an ambitious health and education agenda.[11] On foreign policy, his administration has emphasised \"protecting Indonesia's sovereignty\",[12] with the sinking of illegal foreign fishing vessels[13] and the prioritising and scheduling of capital punishment for drug smugglers. The latter was despite intense representations and diplomatic protests from foreign powers, including Australia and France.[14][15] He was re-elected in 2019 for a second five-year term, again defeating Prabowo Subianto.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nJokowi was born Mulyono on 21 June 1961 in Surakarta,[17] and is of Javanese descent.[18] He is the eldest of four siblings and is the only son of Noto Mihardjo and Sudjiatmi Notomihardjo. He has three younger sisters, Iit Sriyantini, Ida Yati, and Titik Relawati.[19][20] His father came from Karanganyar, while his grandparents came from a village in Boyolali.[21] Jokowi was often sick as a toddler, and his name was thus changed\u2014a common practice in Javanese culture\u2014to Joko Widodo, with *widodo* meaning \"healthy\" in Javanese.[18] At the age of 12, he started working in his father's furniture workshop.[22][23] Jokowi's family lived in three different rented homes (one of which the government declared condemned property) during his youth, which greatly affected him. Later he organized low income housing in Surakarta during his years as mayor of that city.[24]\n\n\nJokowi's education began at State Elementary School 111 Tirtoyoso, an ordinary public school.[25] He continued his studies at State Junior High School 1 Surakarta.[26] Later he wanted to attend State Senior High School 1 Surakarta, but did not score high enough on the entrance exam so he enrolled in the newer State Senior High School 6 in that city.[27]\n\n\n\n### Business career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter graduating from university, Jokowi began work at PT Kertas Kraft Aceh (id), a state-owned firm in Aceh, Sumatra.[28] He worked in the present-day Bener Meriah Regency between 1986 and 1988 as a supervisor of forestry and raw materials of a Sumatran pine plantation.[29][30]\nHowever, Jokowi soon lost interest in the firm and returned home. He began working in his grandfather's furniture factory for a year before establishing his own company, Rakabu, whose namesake is his first child. He obtained his initial capital from a Rp 15 million investment from his father and a bank loan. The company, which mainly focused on teak furniture, nearly went bankrupt at one point but survived following an IDR 500 million loan from Perusahaan Gas Negara. By 1991, the company began exporting its products, and they were successful in international markets. The firm first established a presence in the European market in France, and it was a French customer named Bernard who gave Joko Widodo the nickname \"Jokowi\".[28][31][2]\n\n\nBy 2002, Jokowi had become the chairman of Surakarta's furniture manufacturers association.[2] Ultimately he decided to become a politician and promote reform in his home town, Surakarta, after seeing the neat layouts of some European cities while promoting his furniture there.[23] After becoming mayor, he also made a joint venture with politician and former lieutenant general Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, when the two founded PT Rakabu Sejahtera (from Rakabu and Luhut's PT Toba Sejahtera).[32][33]\n\n\nIn 2018, Jokowi reported his net worth to be Rp 50.25 billion (US$3.5 million), mostly in the form of property holdings in Central Java and Jakarta.[34]\n\n\n\n## Political career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Mayor of Surakarta\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Official Portrait of Joko Widodo as the Mayor of Surakarta\n![](image)Joko Widodo as Surakarta's mayor and his deputy F. X. Hadi Rudyatmo in traditional Javanese *wayang wong* costume.\nAfter first joining PDI-P in 2004, Jokowi ran in the mayoral race in Surakarta in 2005 with F. X. Hadi Rudyatmo as his running mate, with the support of PDI-P and the National Awakening Party.[35][36] The pair won 36.62% of the vote against the incumbent Slamet Suryanto and two other candidates. During the campaign, many questioned his background as a property and furniture businessman. However, one academic paper claimed his leadership style was successful because it established an interactive relationship with the people, through which he was able to induce people's strong faith in him.[37] He adopted the development framework of European cities (which he frequently travelled to as a businessman) as a guide for changes in Surakarta.[38]\n\n\nHis notable policies as mayor include[39] building new traditional markets and renovating existing markets, constructing a 7-km city walk with a 3-meter wide pedestrian walkway along Surakarta's main street, revitalising the Balekambang and Sriwedari parks, employing stricter regulations on cutting down trees along the city's main streets, rebranding the city as a centre of Javanese culture and tourism under the tagline \"The Spirit of Java\", promoting the city as a centre for meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE), launching healthcare and education insurance program for all residents, a local bus rapid transit system named *Batik Solo Trans* and a Solo Techno Park, which helped support the Esemka Indonesian car project.[40]\n\n\nIt was during his tenure as mayor that he conducted the *blusukan*, an impromptu visit to specific areas to listen to people's issues, which proved popular later in his political career. He also prohibited his family members from bidding for city projects, therefore suppressing the risk of corruption. His policies brought him into conflict with then provincial governor Bibit Waluyo, who on one occasion called Jokowi a \"fool\" for the latter's opposition to a provincial construction project in Surakarta.[41]\n\n\nHis supporters pointed to rapid positive changes in Surakarta under his leadership and the city's branding with the motto 'Solo: The Spirit of Java'. While in office, he successfully relocated antique stalls in the Banjarsari Gardens without incident, a helpful move in revitalising the functions of the open green space; he emphasised the importance of business firms engaging in community activities; he improved communications with the local community by appearing regularly on local television. As a follow-up of the city's new branding, he applied for Surakarta to become a member of the Organization of World Heritage Cities, which was approved in 2006, and subsequently had the city chosen to host the organisation's conference in October 2008.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2007, Surakarta had also hosted the World Music Festival (Festival Musik Dunia/FMD), held at the complex of Fort Vastenburg near the centre of the city. The following year, it was held in the Mangkunegaran Palace Complex.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPart of Jokowi style was his populist 'can-do' (*punya gaye*) elements designed to build bonds with the broad electorate.[37] As mayor, he became personally involved in an incident just before Christmas 2011 when the Surakarta municipality had overdue bills of close to $1 million (IDR 8.9 billion) owed to the state-owned electricity company *Perusahaan Listrik Negara* (PLN).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFollowing its policy of pursuing a more disciplined approach to collecting overdue bills, it imposed a blackout on street lights in the city just before Christmas. The city government quickly authorised payment, but in settling the bill, protested that the PLN should consider the public interest before taking such action. To reinforce the point, Jokowi made a highly publicised personal visit to the local PLN office to deliver the IDR 8.9 billion in cash in the form of hundreds of bundles of notes and even small coins.[42]\n\n\nIn 2010, he was re-elected for a second term, again running with Hadi. They won 90.09% of the vote, losing in only a single polling station.[43] He was later chosen as the 'Tempo Leader of Choice' by Tempo news magazine (2008) and received a 'Changemakers Award' from Republika newspaper (2010); his name also started being considered in national polls for the governorship of Jakarta, long before PDI-P's nomination, including those by University of Indonesia and Cyrus Network (2011).[37]\n\n\nIn 2012, Jokowi faced a smear campaign after declaring his intention to run for the governorship of Jakarta.[44] A group calling itself *Save Solo, Save Jakarta and Save Indonesia Team* (TS3) reported him to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) for allegedly having facilitated misuse of education funds by his subordinates in Surakarta in 2010. The KPK investigated the allegation, found it was based on false data and said there was no indication Jokowi had misappropriated funds.[45]\n\n\n\n### Governor of Jakarta\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJoko Widodo's two versions of official portrait as Governor of Jakarta (2012)\n\nDespite disappointment from some Surakarta residents that he would not complete his second term as mayor,[46] Jokowi ran in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election and defeated the incumbent Fauzi Bowo in a runoff round.[3] His inner circle of advisers in Jakarta reportedly included people such as FX Hadi 'Rudy' Rudyatmo, Sumartono Hadinoto and Anggit Nugroho, who were colleagues while he was mayor of Surakarta, as well as Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (\"Ahok\"), his deputy as governor of Jakarta.[47][48] Jokowi continued the *blusukan* practice he had adopted as mayor of Surakarta by regularly visiting population centers, especially slums. During these visits, he wore simple, informal clothes and stopped at markets or walked along narrow Jakarta alleys to listen and witness firsthand issues addressed by residents, such as the price of food, housing difficulties, flooding, and transportation. Polling and media coverage suggested that his hands-on style proved very popular both in Jakarta and elsewhere across Indonesia.[49]\n\n\nAfter taking office, taxes and Jakarta's provincial budget increased significantly from IDR 41 trillion in 2012 to IDR 72 trillion in 2014.[50] Both Jokowi and Ahok publicised their monthly salary and the provincial budget.[51][52] They also initiated programs aimed towards transparency, such as online taxes, e-budgeting, e-purchasing, and a cash management system.[51] Moreover, all meetings and activities that Jokowi and Ahok attended were recorded and uploaded on YouTube.[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jokowi on a *blusukan* neighborhood visit in Jakarta\nIn healthcare, Jokowi introduced a universal health care program, the 'Healthy Jakarta Card' (*Kartu Jakarta Sehat*, KJS).[54] It involved an insurance program provided through state-owned insurance company PT Askes Indonesia (*Persero*) and a plan to regulate health charges for treatment for over 20,000 services and procedures.[55] The program was criticised for confusion over details of the implementation and long queues,[56] though Jokowi defended it and counselled patience. In education, Jokowi launched the 'Smart Jakarta Card' (*Kartu Jakarta Pintar*, KJP) on 1 December 2012 to help needy students. It gives an allowance that can be withdrawn from ATMs for buying school needs such as books and uniforms.[57]\n\n\nHis administration's other notable policies include a system of bureaucratic recruitment called *lelang jabatan* (literally 'auction of office position'), giving every civil servant the same opportunity to achieve a certain position by fulfilling the required qualifications,[58] regulation of the chaotic agglomeration of street vendors in Pasar Minggu and Pasar Tanah Abang,[59][60] the dredging and reservoir normalisation projects to reduce flooding,[61][62][63] and the inauguration of long-delayed Jakarta MRT and Jakarta LRT.[64][65] As governor, Jokowi also appointed a non-Muslim 'lurah' (subdistrict chief) for the Muslim-majority subdistrict of Lenteng Agung despite protests by some residents.[66] Former deputy governor Prijanto claimed that Jokowi had carried out maladministration when abusing government certificate asset of BMW Park by formalising another expired certificate.[67]\n\n\nIn 2013, Jokowi was reported to the National Commission on Human Rights over the eviction of the squatters near Pluit. In previous \"political contracts\", he had vowed not to evict residents to distant locations.[68][69] Jokowi met with Pluit residents and Komnas HAM to explain the evictions were necessary for restoring water catchment to reduce flooding and that families were being relocated to low-cost apartments.[70][71]\n\n\n\n## Presidential candidacies\n\n[edit]\n\n### 2014\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 2014 Indonesian presidential election and Joko Widodo 2014 presidential campaign\n\nMegawati Sukarnoputri nominated Jokowi to be the presidential candidate of her party.[8] During the campaign, a social media volunteer team, *JASMEV*, once made a provocative statement by threatening that Islam would not be given a space in Indonesia if Jokowi won the 2014 election.[72][73] The group was paid IDR 500 million to campaign for the Joko Widodo-Jusuf Kalla ticket during the 2014 election.[74]\n\n\nFollowing the release of Quick Count results from many different polls, Jokowi declared victory on 9 July. However, his opponent Prabowo also declared victory, creating confusion among the population.[75] On 22 July, hours before the announcement of the election results, Prabowo withdrew.[76] Jokowi's victory was expected and realised hours later.[77][76] The General Elections Commission (KPU) gave him a close victory with 53.15% of the vote (almost 71 million votes), to Prabowo's 46.85% (62 million votes),[78] though Prabowo's camp disputed these totals.[79]\n\n\nAfter his victory, Jokowi stated that growing up under the authoritarian and corrupt New Order regime, he would have never expected someone with a lower-class background to become president. *The New York Times* reported him as saying, \"now, it's quite similar to America, yeah? There is the American dream, and here we have the Indonesian dream\".[80] Jokowi was the first Indonesian president outside the military or the political elite, and the political commentator Salim Said gave the popular view of the politician as \"someone who is our neighbour, who decided to get into politics and run for president\".[80]\n\n\n\n### 2019\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 2019 Indonesian general election and Joko Widodo 2019 presidential campaign\n\nIn 2018, Jokowi announced that he would run for re-election next year. His vice president Jusuf Kalla was not eligible for another term because of the term limits set for president and vice president. Kalla had already served a five-year term as vice president during Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's first term (2004\u20132009). Speculation surrounding Jokowi's choice of running mate focused on several candidates, including Mahfud MD, a former defence minister and chief justice of the Constitutional Court. In a surprise move, Jokowi announced that Ma'ruf Amin would be his running mate. Mahfud had reportedly been preparing for the vice-presidential candidacy. Ma'ruf was selected instead following a push by several constituent parties of Jokowi's governing coalition and influential Islamic figures.[81] Explaining his decision, Jokowi referred to Ma'ruf's extensive experience in government and religious affairs.[82]\n\n\nThe KPU officially announced that the Joko Widodo-Ma'ruf Amin ticket had won the election in the early hours of 21 May 2019.[83] The official vote tally was 85 million votes for Jokowi (55.50%) and 68 million votes for Prabowo (44.50%).[84] Supporters of Prabowo protested in Jakarta against the result, and it turned into a riot which left eight people dead and over 600 injured.[85] Following the protests, Prabowo's campaign team launched a Constitutional Court lawsuit but was rejected in its entirety.[86]\n\n\n\n## Presidency of Indonesia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: First inauguration of Joko Widodo and Second inauguration of Joko Widodo\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJoko Widodo recites the oath of office in 2014 (top) and 2019 (bottom)\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJoko Widodo's official presidential portraits during his first term; released in 2014 (L) and 2016 (R)\n\n### Government and cabinets\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Working Cabinet (2014\u20132019) and Onward Indonesia Cabinet\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJoko Widodo's initial cabinet lines-up in 2014 (up) and 2019 (down)\n\nDespite vowing not to give government positions simply to political allies during the 2014 campaign, many members of political parties received ministerial positions in Jokowi's first cabinet.[87][88] The first year of Jokowi's administration saw him controlling a minority government until Golkar, the second-largest party in the People's Representative Council (DPR), switched from opposition to the government. Jokowi denied accusations of interfering with Golkar's internal affairs, although he admitted that Luhut might have influenced the change.[89] His cabinet's Minister of Industry Airlangga Hartarto was elected chairman of Golkar in 2018.[90] The National Mandate Party (PAN) had also switched sides beforehand but later returned to being the opposition in 2018.[91][92]\n\n\nJokowi announced the 34 names in his cabinet on 26 October 2014.[93] While it was praised for the inclusiveness of women, with Retno Marsudi becoming Indonesia's first female foreign minister, it received criticism for several perceived political inclusions, such as Puan Maharani (daughter of Megawati Sukarnoputri).[94] The Jokowi administration also saw the formation of two new ministries (Ministry of Public Works and Housing and Ministry of Environment and Forestry) from a merger of old ministries, in addition to renaming and reorganisation of other ministries.[95] He conducted a total of three cabinet reshuffles until 2018, removing ministers such as Rizal Ramli and Bambang Brodjonegoro while including ministers such as Luhut and World Bank Director Sri Mulyani Indrawati.[96] Another reshuffle occurred in December 2020, replacing six ministers including two apprehended by the KPK.[97]\n\n\nHe was criticised by PDI-P over perceived policy weaknesses, and PDI-P legislator Effendi Simbolon called for his impeachment.[98] On 9 April 2015, during a PDI-P Congress, party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri referred to Jokowi as a functionary. She noted that presidential candidates are nominated by political parties, hinting that Jokowi owed his position to the party and should carry out its policy line.[99][100] Several months prior, Megawati and Jokowi had disputed over the appointment of a new police chief, with Megawati supporting her former adjutant Budi Gunawan while Jokowi supported Badrodin Haiti.[89][101][102]\n\n\n\n![](image)Widodo and Prabowo Subianto in October 2019\nFollowing his re-election, Jokowi announced his second cabinet on 23 October 2019. He retained several ministers such as Sri Mulyani and Luhut but also included Gojek founder Nadiem Makarim and two-time presidential rival Prabowo Subianto as education and defence ministers, respectively.[103]\n\n\nIn the first year of his second presidential term, his approval rating fell to 45.2%, and the disapproval rating was 52%.[104][105] His deputy, Ma'ruf Amin, had a 67% disapproval rating. The low ratings were attributed to unpopular policies. At the start of 2023, his approval ratings had reached an all-time high of 76.2%, following easing of COVID-19 restrictions.[106]\n\n\n\n### Economy\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore taking office, Jokowi sought for outgoing president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) to take responsibility for the decision to further increase fuel prices[107] by further removing subsidies.[108] Previous attempts by SBY to do so had resulted in civil unrest.[107] On 1 January 2015, Jokowi took measures that, on the surface, appeared to reduce fuel subsidies.[109][110] The policy stirred up some demonstrations, with Jokowi citing it as necessary to increase funding for the infrastructure, education and health sectors.[111] However, since March 2015, the government has set the price of Premium-branded petrol far below the market price, causing the fuel subsidy to be incurred by state-owned oil company Pertamina instead of the direct government account.[112] Additionally, the government also implemented a single-price program, aiming to sell fuel through official channels at the same price nationally, including in isolated parts of Kalimantan and Papua. The government claimed that this was achieved in 2017.[113]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2015, year-on-year GDP grew 4.92%, and in the second quarter, it grew 4.6%, the lowest figure since 2009.[114][115][116] Since then, growth has remained above the 5% mark, which is still below what is considered a healthy economic growth mark of 6%.[117] The Indonesian rupiah (IDR) has also weakened throughout Jokowi's administration, with its exchange rate per US dollar briefly passing IDR 15,000 in 2018, the lowest level since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and sank lower to 16,700 in 2020.[118][119] The year-on-year inflation in June 2015 was 7.26%, higher than in May (7.15%) and June the year before (6.7%).[120]\n\n\nJokowi's administration continued the resource nationalism policy of its predecessor, nationalising some assets controlled by multinational companies such as Freeport McMoRan, TotalEnergies and Chevron. In 2018, in a move aimed to cut imports, oil companies operating in Indonesia were ordered to sell their crude oil to state-owned Pertamina.[121] A ban was also enforced on the exports of raw nickel ore, intended to help promote the development of local nickel-related industries such as smelters and battery factories.[122] The policy was further extended, with export bans of unprocessed copper, tin, bauxite and gold ores expected to come into force in mid 2023.[123]\n\n\nInfrastructure development has been a significant feature of the Jokowi administration, focusing on road and railway expansion, seaports and airports development, and irrigation. In 2016, the state budget allocated Rp 290 trillion (US$22 billion) for infrastructure, the biggest in Indonesian history.[124] In total, his administration planned 265 infrastructure projects starting in 2016.[125] In September 2015, Indonesia awarded a $5.5 billion high-speed rail project to China,[126][127] to Japan's disappointment, which is also vying for the project.[128] Indonesia's transportation ministry laid out a litany of shortcomings in plans for the project, casting doubt on the project and spotlighting Jokowi's limits in turning mega-projects into reality as he tries to draw foreign investors.[129] Other significant projects include the completion of the 4,325-kilometer Trans Papua road and the Trans-Java Toll Road,[130][131] initial construction of the Trans-Sulawesi Railway[132] and the Trans-Sumatra Toll Road,[133] a US$50 billion plan to develop the maritime sector including 24 \"strategic ports\",[134] and expansion of airport capacity in remote areas.[135] The ports' development and modernisation program, dubbed the \"Sea Toll Road\" program, was aimed to reduce price inequality between the better developed western parts of the country and the less populated eastern parts.[136]\n\n\nIn addition to the major projects, the Jokowi administration also implemented a village fund program in which villages across the country received funding to allocate on basic infrastructures such as roads and water supply, tourism development and village enterprises to improve rural economies.[137][138] The initial campaign promise was that IDR 1.4 billion (around US$100,000) would be allocated for every village annually,[139] though as of 2019, less than a billion was allocated.[140] Between 2015 and 2018, IDR 187 trillion (US$14 billion) had been reallocated through the program.[141] The administration has targeted to streamline land certification across the country, aiming to distribute certificates of land ownership across the country completely. It involved increasing the issuing rate of certificates from around 500,000 to several million annually.[142][143] In 2016, the administration signed into law a tax amnesty bill following a lengthy public debate and push back, giving wealthy Indonesians a chance to declare their unreported assets before the government would strengthen rules and oversight around imports and exports. It became the most successful program of its kind in history, with over IDR 4,865 trillion (approximately US$366 billion) of previously unreported assets declared to the tax office.[144][145]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jokowi at the opening ceremony of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland on 1 November 2021\nThe opposition criticised the aggressive spending on infrastructure as it increased Indonesia's national debt by 48% between 2014 and March 2018 to US$181 billion. They also pointed out that most of the debt was allocated for remunerations rather than infrastructure development.[146][147][148] In April 2018, Jokowi also issued a new policy that allows foreign workers in Indonesia without Indonesian language skills requirement,[149] reasoning that it would increase investments.[150] The policy faced significant opposition from local labour unions, who claimed that the policy would increase unemployment rates.[151][152]\n\n\nIn 2020, the DPR passed the Omnibus Law on Job Creation. Though intended to boost investment and reduce red tape, it is also perceived as weakening labour and environmental protections, causing a series of protests in major cities. Jokowi defended the law by saying that it would be needed to create jobs and called for protesters to lodge a challenge instead to the Constitutional Court of Indonesia.[153] The law, which revised over 70 previous laws and contained some 1,200 clauses, had been put forward by Jokowi following his 2019 re-election. Several groups had criticised the opaqueness of the government during the deliberation of the law.[154] In the same year, Indonesia hit the lowest inflation level in history[155] and faced the first economic recession since the 1997 Asian Financial crisis.[156]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Jokowi promised to end and reverse deforestation in Indonesia by 2030, in the COP26 climate summit's first major agreement.[157][158]\n\n\nThe European Commission officially approved a measure to phase out palm oil-based biofuels by 2030.[159][160] During a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Widodo expressed concern about the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which aims to prevent products linked to deforestation from reaching the EU market.[161]\n\n\n\n### Politics\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Joko Widodo and U.S. president Joe Biden, 1 November 2021\n![](image)Jokowi visiting the destroyed village of Petobo after the 2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami.\nEarly in his first term, the opposition coalition within the DPR attempted to revoke a regulation (*Perppu*, Government Regulation in Lieu of Acts) issued by Jokowi's predecessor, which had guaranteed the holding of direct regional elections in Indonesia (and overrode a legislator-issued bill which arranged for indirect elections).[162] Jokowi supported the direct regional elections and opposed attempts to revoke the regulation, stating that \"direct regional elections was, in principle, non-negotiable\".[163] Within the first three years of his administration, Jokowi issued four such *Perppu*.[164] Jokowi's government, including parties which opposed him during presidential elections, have been described as a big tent government, and by former Singaporean foreign minister George Yeo as \"democracy with Javanese characteristics\".[165]\n\n\nFollowing his reelection in 2019, a number of prominent politicians began floating the idea of amending the constitution to permit Jokowi to run for a third term in 2024.[166][167] Key cabinet members voicing their support for a term limit extension included Coordinating Ministers Airlangga Hartarto and Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan.[168] The proposal became more prominent following the COVID-19 pandemic, due to disruptions to government programs in his second term. By April 2022, Jokowi explicitly announced that he would not be seeking a third term, and ordered his cabinet to refrain from publicly speaking about a term limit extension or an election delay.[169]\n\n\nWhile not running for a third term, Jokowi explicitly stated to media outlets that he would not be a neutral actor,[170] and will \"meddle\" in the 2024 presidential election. He also held meetings with leaders of political parties in his capacity as president.[171][172][173] In September 2023, during a public rally, Jokowi stated that he was in possession of intelligence information collected by government agencies (naming BIN and BAIS) on internal workings of political parties.[174][175] In October 2023, Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court of Indonesia Anwar Usman (Jokowi's brother-in-law) made a ruling which created a loophole for the minimum age requirement of presidential and vice-presidential candidates, hence allowing Jokowi's son Gibran Rakabuming Raka to run as Prabowo's running mate in 2024. Usman was later reprimanded by a judicial panel for the decision and was made to step down as Chief Justice.[176]\n\n\n\n### Law and human rights\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Bali Nine and Capital punishment in Indonesia\n\nJudicial executions in Indonesia are carried out under a presidential decree following a death sentence imposed by a trial court.[177] Jokowi in 2015 said he would not grant clemency for drug offenders sentenced to death, arguing Indonesia was in a state of emergency over drug-related crimes, citing statistics the *Jakarta Globe* reported to be faulty.[178][179] His stance drew criticism as it could harm relations with the native countries of the condemned convicts,[180] and also imperil Indonesians facing the death penalty abroad.[181][182] Australia, Brazil and the Netherlands recalled their ambassadors from Indonesia following multiple executions in 2015.[14][183] Australia reduced its foreign aid to Indonesia by nearly half,[184] and Amnesty International issued a condemnation saying they showed a \"complete disregard for due process and human rights safeguards\".[185] Former Indonesian Constitutional Court chief justice Jimly Asshiddiqie, who was a key player in the anti-death penalty lobby in Jakarta, said the push for the execution of Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan had come from Jokowi personally.[186] *The Sydney Morning Herald* reported that Jokowi did not have or read related documents when he refused their clemency requests.[187] In the same year, Jokowi granted Frenchman Serge Atlaoui and Filipino Mary Jane Veloso temporary reprieves due to pending legal appeals.[187] As of 2017, around 260 people remain on death row in Indonesia.[188]\n\n\nRegarding terrorism, Jokowi's administration in early 2016 proposed replacing the 2003 anti-terrorism law. Following the 2018 Surabaya bombings, the worst terrorist attack on Indonesian soil since the 2002 Bali bombings, the controversial bill passed, allowing the Indonesian National Armed Forces to participate in counter-terrorism activities upon police request and presidential approval.[189] It also allowed extended detention of terror suspects and permitted wiretapping without initial court approval.[190] Jokowi had threatened to issue a presidential regulation in lieu of law (*perppu*) if the bill did not pass the parliament by June that year.[191]\n\n\nDuring Jokowi's administration, there have been numerous instances where people were arrested or reported to police for activities deemed insulting to the president.[192][193] Rights activists deem such arrests as a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech.[194][195] A group claiming to be Jokowi's supporters reported *Tempo* magazine to police over a caricature of Jokowi as Pinocchio,[196][197] after which the Presidential Palace issued a statement saying \"the President respected freedom of press and speech\".[198] A book about Jokowi titled *Jokowi Undercover* was banned upon release and its author sentenced to three years in prison[199] and buyers of the book being advised to surrender their copies to the authorities.[200] *Tempo* magazine described the 436-page book as \"trashy and tasteless, a compilation of hoax reports on President Joko Widodo, scattered across the internet and cyber chatrooms\".[201] The government's plans to resurrect a Dutch colonial law that would permit imprisonment for insulting the president resulted in widespread protests.[202][203] A Law Firm and Public Interest Law Office (AMAR) institution later reported following the protests that they received many complaints of students regarding threats and sanctions of expulsion or suspension from their schools and universities.[204] In addition, a remission granted to a journalist's murderer was revoked following media criticism.[205][206]\n\n\n\n![](image)Since 2019, a series of mass protests and civil unrests were held across the country against some controversial policies.\nIn response to major protests, Jokowi's administration has generated some controversies. On 22 May 2019, amid post-election riots by supporters of losing presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto, the government limited the speed at which photos and videos could be shared on social media to stop people from being incited by fake news and calls for violence.[207][208] In the aftermath, Amnesty International's Indonesian office denounced repressive measures against the demonstrators, condemned them as a grave human rights abuse and demanded the government investigate the extrajudicial executions in the clashes.[209][210] In August and September 2019, the government blocked internet access in Papua and West Papua provinces amid violent protests against racism. Jakarta State Administrative Court in 2020 ruled the internet blocks in Papua illegal.[211]\n\n\nIn 2017, Jokowi supported a controversial bill on mass organisations, which upon passing resulted in the disbandment of the Indonesian branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir. He argued the law was necessary to defend the national ideology, Pancasila.[212] The 2020 banning of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) was also based on that law.[213] Twenty-three days' earlier, police had shot dead six FPI members during a confrontation.[214][215] The president's subsequent defence of the police during their duty and his statement that no citizens should break the law or harm the country[216][217] was criticised by FPI secretary-general Munarman as a justification of human rights abuse and structural violence.[218] A police chief involved in the car chase and subsequent murder claimed that the members were armed.[214] After the passing of several controversial bills and repressive crackdowns from security officers on major protests since 2019,[219] his presidency has been criticised for \"Neo-Authoritarianism\".[220][221][222][223] The *South China Morning Post* even named him a 'Little Suharto'[1]\n\n\nA premium price hike of public health care BPJS Kesehatan through Executive Order (*Perpres*) 64/2020 was criticised as a flagrant breach of permanent Supreme Court (*Mahkamah Agung*) decision[224] that nullified the Perpres 82/2018 about the price hike. The *Perpres* 64/2020 itself was signed amid the COVID-19 pandemic that had caused hardship among the population.[225][226] His former deputy mayor of Surakarta, F. X. Hadi Rudyatmo, also voiced similar concerns.[227]\n\n\nJokowi's presidency coincided with the 50th anniversary of the Indonesian mass killings of 1965\u201366 in 2015. A government-supported symposium to resolve human rights violations surrounding the event was held in 2016, but Jokowi said his government would not apologise to the victims of the mass purge.[228][229] On LGBT rights, Jokowi stated that \"there should be no discrimination against anyone\", but added that \"in terms of our beliefs, [the LGBT lifestyle] isn't allowed, Islam does not allow it.\"[230] Under his presidency, the controversial transmigration program was cut once more, when in 2015, it was decided to end the migration program to the Papuan provinces.[231]\n\n\nFollowing the July 2022 murder of Nofriansyah Yosua Hutabarat, an Indonesian police officer, there were allegations of police involvement in a cover-up. Police chief General Listyo Sigit Prabowo took over the investigation, forming a special team including members of the Human Rights Commission and Police Commissions.[232] Jokowi was keen for the force to be open about what happens: \"Open it as it is. No cover-up. Transparent. That's it. This is important so that the people don't have doubts over the incident that occurred. This is what has to be maintained. Public trust in the police must be maintained.\"[233] In August 2022, Hutabarat's former boss, Inspector General Ferdy Sambo, head of internal affairs of the Indonesian National Police, along with three others, was charged with Hutabarat's murder.[234][235]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of international presidential trips made by Joko Widodo\n\n![](image)Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting Joko Widodo in Rome, Italy on 31 October 2021\n![](image)Joko Widodo and Salman of Saudi Arabia, 1 March 2017\n![](image)Indonesian President Joko Widodo meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping\n![](image)Joko Widodo and Prime Minister of Malaysia Ismail Sabri Yaakob, 1 April 2022\nBefore Jokowi's election, Indonesia's foreign policy under former president SBY was moulded by the mission statement, \"A thousand friends and zero enemies\".[236] Jokowi has mandated a three-pronged policy of maintaining Indonesia's sovereignty, enhancing the protection of Indonesian citizens, and intensifying economic diplomacy.[12]\n\n\nJokowi aspires Indonesia to become a global maritime power (Template:Lang-id or global maritime axis). He sees the sea as having an increasingly important role in Indonesia's future and that as a maritime country, Indonesia must assert itself as a force between the two oceans: the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The five pillars of this maritime-axis doctrine are rebuilding Indonesia's maritime culture, maintaining and managing marine resources, developing maritime infrastructure and connectivity as well as developing the shipping industry and maritime tourism, inviting other nations to cooperate in the marine field and eliminate the source of conflicts at sea, and developing maritime defence forces.[237] As part of this vision, Jokowi has adopted a tougher stance on illegal fishing.[238] He stated that Jakarta could no longer tolerate a situation where over 5,000 ships are operating illegally in its waters every day, making a mockery out of Indonesian sovereignty and resulting in annual losses of over $20 billion.[239][240]\n\n\n\nOn the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, particularly in the Natuna Islands where China's nine-dash line intercepts Indonesian EEZ claims, Jokowi stated that \"there will be no compromise on sovereignty\",[241] and renamed Indonesia's section of the waters in the South China Sea as \"North Natuna Sea\".[242] In June 2016, he held a cabinet meeting off the islands aboard the Indonesian Navy corvette KRI *Imam Bonjol*, calling to step up maritime patrols in the area.[243] Under his administration, Indonesia has released an \"Indo-Pacific Vision\" for ASEAN countries, which calls for regional architecture and considers the Indian and Pacific Oceans as a single interconnected geostrategic area.[244] Indonesia also entered a trilateral cooperation agreement with Malaysia and the Philippines, allowing coordinated patrols in the pirate-infested Sulu Sea.[245]\n\n![Widodo-Putin](image)\nWidodo meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow on 30 June 2022\n\nIn the Muslim world, Jokowi released a statement calling for the Muslim leaders at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit meeting in Jakarta to unite in reconciliation and push for Palestinian independence.[246] Under Jokowi, Indonesia's Foreign Minister has visited Palestine but refused entreaties to establish bilateral diplomatic relations with Israel.[247] An honorary consul was established in Ramallah in the West Bank though it had to be inaugurated in Amman, Jordan. [248] Jokowi also condemned the persecution of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar and oversaw the departure of four Indonesian Air Force transport planes with 34 tons of relief supplies for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.[249][250] In October 2021, Jokowi advocated COVID-19 vaccine equity, urging richer countries to share their vaccines with poorer ones.[251]\n\n\nResponding to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Jokowi visited both countries in July 2022, meeting with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, emphasizing in statements the need for peace and for the restoration of global food supply chains.[252] As Indonesia hosted the 2022 G20 Summit that year, Jokowi also invited Zelenskyy to attend,[253] while resisting calls to revoke Russia's invitation to the summit.[254]\n\n\nDuring a press conference at the White House on 14 November 2023, Widodo called for a ceasefire in the Israel\u2013Hamas war, \"for the sake of humanity\", and urged US President Joe Biden to do more to end \"atrocities\" in the Gaza Strip.[255]\n\n\n\n### Capital relocation\n\n[edit]\n\nBy April 2019, it was made public that Jokowi had decided in a meeting with cabinet ministers to move the capital of Indonesia away from Jakarta to a location outside Java.[256] On 25 August 2019, it was further announced that the new capital would be located in Kalimantan, between the regencies of North Penajam Paser and Kutai Kartanegara.[257]\n\n\n\n## Jokowi Effect\n\n[edit]\n\nThe **Jokowi Effect** (Template:Lang-id) is a term coined to describe the influence of media popularity of Jokowi on Indonesian politics and the Indonesian economy. When Jokowi was declared as a presidential candidate in the 2014 Indonesian presidential election it is believed that the popularity of the Indonesian Democratic Party \u2013 Struggle was boosted to 30% in the 2014 Indonesian legislative election.[258] Meanwhile, in the capital market, the effect is said to have stimulated the Indonesian stock market and Rupiah, because Jokowi was regarded as having a clean track record.[259]\n\n\n\n## Family and personal life\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Joko Widodo and First Lady Iriana host Philippine President Bongbong Marcos at the Bogor Palace in Java on 5 September 2022\nJokowi married his wife Iriana in 1986. The couple has two sons and one daughter.[260] Their first son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka (born 1 October 1987), studied abroad in Sydney and Singapore (at the Management Development Institute of Singapore, MDIS) and has served as the mayor of Surakarta, Jokowi's hometown, since 2021. Their only daughter, Kahiyang Ayu (born 20 April 1991), completed an undergraduate degree in food technology at the state-owned Sebelas Maret University in Surakarta. Their second son, Kaesang Pangarep (born 25 December 1994), completed his high school years in ACS International, Singapore,[261] and is an online vlogger. Jokowi has five grandchildren: a grandson and a granddaughter from Gibran (born in 2016 and 2019 respectively)[262] and a granddaughter and two grandsons from Kahiyang (born in 2018, 2020 and 2022 respectively).[263][264]\n\n\nSeveral members of Jokowi's family have declared their intentions to enter politics by running as candidates in 2020 local elections. Gibran declared his candidacy for the mayorship of Surakarta, in addition to his son-in-law Bobby Nasution (Medan) and brother-in-law Wahyu Purwanto (Gunung Kidul Regency).[265] Gibran and Bobby won their elections, and both took office in 2021.[266] Jokowi's younger sister Idayati married Anwar Usman, Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court of Indonesia, in May 2022.[267]\n\n\nJokowi has been described as \"Muslim but broadly secular in his outlook\".[268] His statement in 2019 that religion and politics should be separated prompted a public debate on whether he was promoting secularism in the country.[269] In June 2013, a film titled *Jokowi*, depicting Jokowi's childhood and youth, was released.[270] He expressed some objections to the film, saying that he felt his life had been a simple one and was not worthy of being adapted into a film.[271]\n\n\nAccording to *The Economist*, Jokowi \"has a penchant for loud rock music\" and owned a bass guitar signed by Robert Trujillo of heavy metal band Metallica which was confiscated by the KPK.[272] In November 2017, Danish Prime Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, who was on an official visit to Jakarta, gave Jokowi a Metallica *Master of Puppets* vinyl box set as a diplomatic gift. It was signed by the band's drummer and co-founder, Lars Ulrich, a Danish native.[273] Under his policy of transparency, Jokowi paid IDR 11 million ($800) out of his personal funds to claim the record, which had been declared a state asset to avoid accusations of gratification.[274] He is also a fan of other metal bands including Lamb of God, Carcass and Napalm Death.[275] On 2 November 2013, while he was the Governor of Jakarta, he was seen in the rock festival Rock in Solo in casual dress.[276]\n\n\nHe has also been noted by many to be very similar in appearance to former US president Barack Obama;[277][278] his outsider political profile also inspired comparisons to Obama.[279][280]\n\n\nJokowi is a silat practitioner. He had been practicing Setia Hati Terate style from Persaudaraan Setia Hati Terate school since his time at junior high school and eventually mastering it. He attained first degree *pendekar warga* rank of the silat school on 16 November 2013.[281][282][283]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honours\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Joko Widodo portrait with his presidential decorations\n![](image)Coat of arms as member of the Order of the Seraphim\n### National honours\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![](image) Star of the Republic of Indonesia, 1st Class \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Star of Mahaputera, 1st Class \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Star of Merit, 1st Class \u2013 2011[285]\n* ![](image) Star of Humanity \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Star of Democracy Upholder, 1st Class \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Star of Budaya Parama Dharma \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Star of Bhayangkara, 1st Class \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Guerilla Star \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Sacred Star \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Star of Dharma \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Star of Yudha Dharma, 1st Class \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Star of Kartika Eka Paksi, 1st Class \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Star of Jalasena, 1st Class \u2013 2014[284]\n* ![](image) Star of Swa Bhuwana Paksa, 1st Class \u2013 2014[284]\n\n\n### Foreign honours\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![Brunei](image) Brunei\n\t+ ![](image) The Most Esteemed Family Order of Brunei (DK) \u2013 7 February 2015[286][287]\n\t+ ![](image) Sultan of Brunei Golden Jubilee Medal \u2013 6 October 2017[288]\n* ![Saudi Arabia](image) Saudi Arabia\n\t+ ![](image) Order of Abdulaziz al Saud \u2013 12 September 2015[289]\n* ![East Timor](image) East Timor\n\t+ ![](image) Great-collar of the Order of Timor-Leste \u2013 26 January 2016[290]\n* ![Sweden](image) Sweden\n\t+ ![](image) Knight of the Royal Order of the Seraphim \u2013 22 May 2017[291]\n* ![Afghanistan](image) Afghanistan\n\t+ ![](image) Medal of Ghazi Amanullah \u2013 29 January 2018[292]\n\n\n### Other\n\n[edit]\n\n**2008:** Listed by *Tempo* as one of the 'Top 10 Indonesian Mayors of 2008'.[293]\n\n\n**2012:** Ranked 3rd at the 2012 World Mayor Prize for \"transforming a crime-ridden city into a regional centre for art and culture and an attractive city to tourists\".[294]\n\n\n**2013:** Listed as one of \"The Leading Global Thinkers of 2013\" in *Foreign Policy* magazine.

Xi has also served as the president of the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 2013.

He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the Central Secretariat in October 2007. In 2008, he was designated as Hu Jintao's presumed successor as paramount leader; to that end, Xi was appointed vice president of the PRC and vice chairman of the CMC. He officially received the title of leadership core from the CCP in 2016.\n\n\nXi is the first CCP general secretary born after the establishment of the PRC. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China's relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. He has also promoted \"common prosperity\", a series of policies designed with stated goal to increase equality, and used the term to justify a broad crackdown and major slew of regulations against the tech and tutoring sectors in 2021. Xi met with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou in 2015, the first time PRC and Republic of China leaders met, though relations deteriorated after Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016. He responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China with a zero-COVID approach from January 2020 until December 2022, afterwards shifting towards a mitigation strategy. Xi also oversaw the passage of a national security law in Hong Kong, clamping down on political opposition in the city, especially pro-democracy activists.\n\n\nOften described as an authoritarian leader by political and academic observers, Xi's tenure has included an increase of censorship and mass surveillance, deterioration in human rights, including the internment of one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang (which some observers have described as part of a genocide), a cult of personality developing around Xi, and the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Xi's political ideas and principles, known as Xi Jinping Thought, have been incorporated into the party and national constitutions, and he has emphasized the importance of national security and the need for CCP leadership over the country. As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including chairing the National Security Commission and new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. He and the CCP Central Committee passed a \"historical resolution\" in November 2021, the third such resolution after Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, the second leader of the CCP to do so after Mao, and in March 2023 was reelected state president for a third term, the first head of state to be so.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nXi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953,[2] the third child of Xi Zhongxun and his second wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (\u5b89\u5b89; *\u0100n'\u0101n*), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nXi went to the Beijing Bayi School,[7][8] and then the Beijing No. 25 School,[9] in the 1960s. He became friends with Liu He, who attended Beijing No. 101 School in the same district, who later became China's vice premier and a close advisor to Xi after he became China's paramount leader.[10][11] In 1963, when he was aged 10, his father was purged from the CCP and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan.[12] In May 1966, the Cultural Revolution cut short Xi's secondary education when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. Student militants ransacked the Xi family home and one of Xi's sisters, Xi Heping, committed suicide from the pressure.[13]\n\n\nLater, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement.[14] He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house.[15] According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor.[16] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but he later returned to the village. He then spent a total of seven years there.[17][18]\n\n\nThe misfortunes and suffering of his family in his early years hardened Xi's view of politics. During an interview in 2000, he said, \"People who have little contact with power, who are far from it, always see these things as mysterious and novel. But what I see is not just the superficial things: the power, the flowers, the glory, the applause. I see the bullpens and how people can blow hot and cold. I understand politics on a deeper level.\" The \"bullpens\" (\u725b\u68da) was a reference to Red Guards' detention houses during the Cultural Revolution.[16]\n\n\nAfter seven rejections, Xi joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1971 on his eighth attempt after he befriended a local official.[8] He reunited with his father in 1972, because of a family reunion ordered by premier Zhou Enlai.[13] From 1973, he applied to join the CCP ten times and was finally accepted on his tenth attempt in 1974.[19][20][21] From 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student in Beijing. The engineering majors there spent about 15 percent of their time studying Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism and 5 percent of their time doing farm work and \"learning from the People's Liberation Army\".[22]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1979 to 1982, Xi served as secretary for his father's former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and secretary-general of the CMC.[8] In 1982, he was sent to Zhengding County in Hebei as deputy party secretary of Zhengding County. He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county.[23] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982\u20131985), Fujian (1985\u20132002), Zhejiang (2002\u20132007), and Shanghai (2007).[24] Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.[b][25]\n\n\nFrom 1998 to 2002, Xi studied Marxist theory and ideological education in Tsinghua University,[26] graduating with a doctorate in law and ideology in 2002.[27] In 1999, he was promoted to the office of Vice Governor of Fujian, and became governor a year later. In Fujian, Xi made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to strengthen the private sector of the provincial economy.[28] In February 2000, he and then-provincial party secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top members of PSC\u00a0\u2013 general secretary Jiang Zemin, premier Zhu Rongji, vice president Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection secretary Wei Jianxing\u00a0\u2013 to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.[29]\n\n\nIn 2002, Xi left Fujian and took up leading political positions in neighbouring Zhejiang. He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year.[30] His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders.[31] Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi's chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.[32]\n\n\nFollowing the dismissal of Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, Xi was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007, where he was the party secretary there for seven months.[33][34] In Shanghai, Xi avoided controversy and was known for strictly observing party discipline. For example, Shanghai administrators attempted to earn favour with him by arranging a special train to shuttle him between Shanghai and Hangzhou for him to complete handing off his work to his successor as Zhejiang party secretary Zhao Hongzhu. However, Xi reportedly refused to take the train, citing a loosely enforced party regulation that stipulated that special trains can only be reserved for \"national leaders\".[35] While in Shanghai, he worked on preserving unity of the local party organisation. He pledged there would be no 'purges' during his administration, despite the fact many local officials were thought to have been implicated in the Chen Liangyu corruption scandal.[36] On most issues, Xi largely echoed the line of the central leadership.[37]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping greeting U.S. president George W. Bush in August 2008\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev on 28 September 2010\nXi was appointed to the nine-man PSC at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. He was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the first secretary of the CCP's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as vice president of the PRC.[38] Following his elevation, Xi held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new president of the Central Party School of the CCP, its cadre-training and ideological education wing. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. He made his first foreign trip as vice president to North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008.[39] After the Olympics, Xi was assigned the post of committee chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of the PRC. He was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level CCP committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of politically sensitive anniversaries in 2009.[40]\n\n\nXi's position as the apparent successor to become the paramount leader was threatened with the rapid rise of Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time. Bo was expected to join the PSC at the 18th Party Congress, with most expecting that he would try to eventually maneuver himself into replacing Xi.[41] Bo's policies in Chongqing inspired imitations throughout China and received praise from Xi himself during Xi's visit to Chongqing in 2010. Records of praises from Xi were later erased after he became paramount leader. Bo's downfall would come with the Wang Lijun incident, which opened the door for Xi to come to power without challengers.[42]\n\n\nXi is considered one of the most successful members of the Princelings, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was \"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations\".[43] Lee also commented: \"I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive\".[44] Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as \"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line\".[45] Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi \"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man\".[46]\n\n\n\n### Trips as Vice President[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2009, in his capacity as vice-president, Xi Jinping embarked on a tour of Latin America, visiting Mexico,[47] Jamaica,[48] Colombia,[49] Venezuela,[50] Brazil,[51] and Malta, after which he returned to China.[52] On 11 February 2009, while visiting Mexico, Xi spoke in front of a group of overseas Chinese and explained China's contributions during the international financial crisis, saying that it was \"the greatest contribution towards the whole of human race, made by China, to prevent its 1.3\u00a0billion people from hunger\".[c] He went on to remark: \"There are some bored foreigners, with full stomachs, who have nothing better to do than point fingers at us. First, China doesn't export revolution; second, China doesn't export hunger and poverty; third, China doesn't come and cause you headaches. What more is there to be said?\"[d][53] The story was reported on some local television stations. The news led to a flood of discussions on Chinese Internet forums and it was reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was caught off-guard by Xi's remarks, as the actual video was shot by some accompanying Hong Kong reporters and broadcast on Hong Kong TV, which then turned up on various Internet video websites.[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Muscatine, Iowa house where Xi stayed with an American family during a 1985 agricultural visit to the United States. The home was turned into a museum decades later.\nIn the European Union, Xi visited Belgium, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania from 7 to 21 October 2009.[55] He visited Japan, South Korea, Cambodia, and Myanmar on his Asian trip from 14 to 22 December 2009.[56] He later visited the United States, Ireland and Turkey in February 2012. This visit included meeting with then U.S. president Barack Obama at the White House[57] and then vice president Joe Biden; and stops in California and Iowa, where he met with the family that previously hosted him during his 1985 tour as a Hebei provincial official.[58]\n\n\n\n### Accession to top posts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Generations of Chinese leadership and Succession of power in China\n\nA few months before his ascendancy to the party leadership, Xi disappeared from official media coverage and cancelled meeting with foreign officials for several weeks beginning on 1 September 2012, causing rumors.[8] He then reappeared on 15 September.[59] On 15 November 2012, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee of the CCP. This made him, informally, the paramount leader and the first to be born after the founding of the PRC. The following day Xi led the new line-up of the PSC onto the stage in their first public appearance.[60] The PSC was reduced from nine to seven, with only Xi and Li Keqiang retaining their seats; the other five members were new.[61][62][63] In a marked departure from the common practice of Chinese leaders, Xi's first speech as general secretary was plainly worded and did not include any political slogans or mention his predecessors.[64] Xi mentioned the aspirations of the average person, remarking, \"Our people ... expect better education, more stable jobs, better income, more reliable social security, medical care of a higher standard, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful environment.\" Xi also vowed to tackle corruption at the highest levels, alluding that it would threaten the CCP's survival; he was reticent about far-reaching economic reforms.[65]\n\n\nIn December 2012, Xi visited Guangdong in his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership. The overarching theme of the trip was to call for further economic reform and a strengthened military. Xi visited the statue of Deng Xiaoping and his trip was described as following in the footsteps of Deng's own southern trip in 1992, which provided the impetus for further economic reforms in China after conservative party leaders stalled many of Deng's reforms in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. On his trip, Xi consistently alluded to his signature slogan, the \"Chinese Dream\". \"This dream can be said to be the dream of a strong nation. And for the military, it is a dream of a strong military\", Xi told sailors.[66] Xi's trip was significant in that he departed from the established convention of Chinese leaders' travel routines in multiple ways. Rather than dining out, Xi and his entourage ate regular hotel buffet. He travelled in a large van with his colleagues rather than a fleet of limousines, and did not restrict traffic on the parts of the highway he travelled.[67]\n\n\nXi was elected president on 14 March 2013, in a confirmation vote by the 12th National People's Congress in Beijing. He received 2,952 for, one vote against, and three abstentions.[60] He replaced Hu Jintao, who retired after serving two terms.[68] In his new capacity as president, on 16 March 2013 Xi expressed support for non-interference in China\u2013Sri Lanka relations amid a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn that country over government abuses during the Sri Lankan Civil War.[69] On 17 March, Xi and his new ministers arranged a meeting with the chief executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung, confirming his support for Leung.[70] Within hours of his election, Xi discussed cyber security and North Korea with U.S. President Barack Obama over the phone. Obama announced the visits of treasury and state secretaries Jacob Lew and John F. Kerry to China the following week.[71]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping Administration\n\n### Anti-corruption campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping\n\n> \n> \u201cTo speak the truth\u201d means to focus on the nature of things, to speak frankly, and follow the truth. This is an important embodiment of a leading official\u2019s characteristics of truth seeking, embodying justice, devotion to public interests, and uprightness. Moreover, he highlighted that the premise of telling the truth is to listen to the truth.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Xi Jinping during a speech in 2012[72][73]\n\nXi vowed to crack down on corruption almost immediately after he ascended to power at the 18th Party Congress. In his inaugural speech as general secretary, Xi mentioned that fighting corruption was one of the toughest challenges for the party.[74] A few months into his term, Xi outlined the Eight-point Regulation, listing rules intended to curb corruption and waste during official party business; it aimed at stricter discipline on the conduct of party officials. Xi also vowed to root out \"tigers and flies\", that is, high-ranking officials and ordinary party functionaries.[75]\n\n\nXi initiated cases against former CMC vice-chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, former PSC member and security chief Zhou Yongkang and former Hu Jintao chief aide Ling Jihua.[76] Along with new disciplinary chief Wang Qishan, Xi's administration spearheaded the formation of \"centrally-dispatched inspection teams\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5de1\u89c6\u7ec4). These were essentially cross-jurisdictional squads of officials whose main task was to gain more in-depth understanding of the operations of provincial and local party organizations, and in the process, also enforce party discipline mandated by Beijing. Many of the work teams also had the effect of identifying and initiating investigations of high-ranking officials. Over one hundred provincial-ministerial level officials were implicated during a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign. These included former and current regional officials (Su Rong, Bai Enpei, Wan Qingliang), leading figures of state-owned enterprises and central government organs (Song Lin, Liu Tienan), and highly ranked generals in the military (Gu Junshan). In June 2014, the Shanxi provincial political establishment was decimated, with four officials dismissed within a week from the provincial party organization's top ranks. Within the first two years of the campaign alone, over 200,000 low-ranking officials received warnings, fines, and demotions.[77]\n\n\nThe campaign has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including members of the PSC.[78] Xi's anti-corruption campaign is seen by critics, such as *The Economist*, as a political tool with the aim of removing potential opponents and consolidating power.[79][80] Xi's establishment of a new anti-corruption agency, the National Supervision Commission, ranked higher than the supreme court, has been described by Amnesty International's East Asia director as a \"systemic threat to human rights\" that \"places tens of millions of people at the mercy of a secretive and virtually unaccountable system that is above the law.\"[81][82]\n\n\nXi has overseen significant reforms of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CCP's highest internal control institution.[83] He and CCDI Secretary Wang Qishan further institutionalized CCDI's independence from the day-to-day operations of the CCP, improving its ability to function as a *bona fide* control body.[83] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, any anti-corruption punishment to officials at or above the vice ministerial level need approval from Xi.[84] Another article from *The Wall Street Journal* said that when he wants to neutralize a political rival, he asks inspectors to prepare hundreds of pages of evidence. The article also said that he sometimes authorizes investigations on close associates of a high-ranking politician to replace them with his own proteges and puts political rivals in less important positions to separate them from their political bases. Reportedly, these tactics have even been used against Wang Qishan, Xi's close friend.[85]\n\n\nAccording to historian and sinologist Wang Gungwu, Xi Jinping inherited a political party that was faced with pervasive corruption.[86][87] Xi believed that the amount of corruption at the higher levels of the CCP put both the party and the country at risk of collapse.[86] Wang further adds that Xi has a belief that only the CCP is capable of governing China, and that a collapse of the party would be disastrous for the Chinese people. Xi and the new generational leaders reacted by launching the anti-corruption campaign to eliminate corruption at the higher levels of the government.[86]\n\n\n\n### Censorship[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Censorship in China and Internet censorship in China\n\nSince Xi became the CCP general secretary, censorship, including internet censorship, has been significantly stepped up.[88][89] Chairing the 2018 China Cyberspace Governance Conference on 20 and 21 April 2018, Xi committed to \"fiercely crack down on criminal offenses including hacking, telecom fraud, and violation of citizens' privacy.\"[90] During a visit to Chinese state media, Xi stated that \"party and government-owned media must hold the family name of the party\" (\u515a\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\u4e3b\u529e\u7684\u5a92\u4f53\u5fc5\u987b\u59d3\u515a) and that the state media \"must embody the party's will, safeguard the party's authority\".[91]\n\n\nHis administration has overseen more Internet restrictions imposed in China, and is described as being \"stricter across the board\" on speech than previous administrations.[92] Xi has taken a very strong stand to control internet usage inside China, including Google and Facebook,[93] advocating Internet censorship in the country under the concept of internet sovereignty.[94][95] The censorship of Wikipedia has also been stringent; in April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia were blocked in China.[96] Likewise, the situation for users of Weibo has been described as a change from fearing that individual posts would be deleted, or at worst one's account, to fear of arrest.[97]\n\n\nA law enacted in September 2013 authorized a three-year prison term for bloggers who shared more than 500 times any content considered \"defamatory\".[98] The State Internet Information Department summoned a group of influential bloggers to a seminar instructing them to avoid writing about politics, the CCP, or making statements contradicting official narratives. Many bloggers stopped writing about controversial topics, and Weibo went into decline, with much of its readership shifting to WeChat users speaking to very limited social circles.[98] In 2017, telecommunications carriers in China were instructed by the government to block individuals' use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) by February 2018.[99]\n\n\nXi has spoken out against \"historical nihilism\", meaning historical viewpoints that challenge the official line of the CCP.[100] Xi said that one of the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union has been historical nihilism.[101] The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has established a telephone hotline for people to report acts of historical nihilism, while Toutiao and Douyin urged its user to report instances of historical nihilism.[102] In May 2021, the CAC reported that it removed two million online posts for historical nihilism.[103]\n\n\n\n### Consolidation of power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Xi in Beijing, September 2015\nSee also: New Zhijiang Army and Fujian clique\n\nPolitical observers have called Xi the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, especially since the ending of presidential two-term limits in 2018.[104][105][106][107] Xi has notably departed from the collective leadership practices of his post-Mao predecessors. He has centralised his power and created working groups with himself at the head to subvert government bureaucracy, making himself become the unmistakable central figure of the new administration.[108] Beginning in 2013, the CCP under Xi has created a series of Central Leading Groups: supra-ministerial steering committees, designed to bypass existing institutions when making decisions, and ostensibly make policy-making a more efficient process. The most notable new body is the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms. It has broad jurisdiction over economic restructuring and social reforms, and is said to have displaced some of the power previously held by the State Council and its premier.[109]\n\n\nXi also became the leader of the Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization, in charge of cyber-security and Internet policy. The Third Plenum held in 2013 also saw the creation of the National Security Commission of the CCP, another body chaired by Xi, which commentators have said would help Xi consolidate over national security affairs.[110][111] In the opinion of at least one political scientist, Xi \"has surrounded himself with cadres he met while stationed on the coast, Fujian and Shanghai and in Zhejiang.\"[112] Control of Beijing is seen as crucial to Chinese leaders; Xi has selected Cai Qi, one of the cadres mentioned above, to manage the capital.[113] Xi was also believed to have diluted the authority of premier Li Keqiang, taking authority over the economy which has generally been considered to be the domain of the premier.[114][115]\n\n\nSince coming to power, various observers have said that Xi has seriously diluted the influence of the once-dominant \"Tuanpai\", also called the Youth League Faction, which were CCP officials who rose through the Party's Communist Youth League (CYLC).[116] He criticized the cadres of the CYLC, saying that [these cadres] can't talk about science, literature and art, work or life [with young people]. All they can do is just repeat the same old bureaucratic, stereotypical talk.\"[117] Its budget was also cut, dropping from around 700 million yuan ($96 million) in 2012 to 260 million yuan ($40 million) in 2021, while its membership dropped from 90 million to 74 million in the same period.[116] He also led to the closure of the Central School of the Communist Youth League of China, merging it with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and effectively demoted Qin Yizhi, first secretary of the CYLC, in 2017.[118]\n\n\nIn March 2018, the National People's Congress (NPC) passed a set of constitutional amendments including removal of term limits for the president and vice president, the creation of a National Supervisory Commission, as well as enhancing the central role of the CCP.[119][120] On 17 March 2018, the Chinese legislature reappointed Xi as president, now without term limits; Wang Qishan was appointed vice president.[121][122] The following day, Li Keqiang was reappointed premier and longtime allies of Xi, Xu Qiliang and Zhang Youxia, were voted in as vice-chairmen of the CMC.[123] Foreign minister Wang Yi was promoted to state councillor and General Wei Fenghe was named defence minister.[124] According to the *Financial Times*, Xi expressed his views of constitutional amendment at meetings with Chinese officials and foreign dignitaries. Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts\u2014general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC\u2014which have no term limits. However, Xi did not say whether he intended to serve as party general secretary, CMC chairman and state president, for three or more terms.[125]\n\n\nIn its sixth plenary session in November 2021, CCP adopted a historical resolution, a kind of document that evaluated the party's history. This was the third of its kind after ones adopted by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping,[126][127] and the document for the first time credited Xi as being the \"main innovator\" of Xi Jinping Thought[128] while also declaring Xi's leadership as being \"the key to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".[129] In comparison with the other historical resolutions, Xi's one did not herald a major change in how the CCP evaluated its history.[130] To accompany the historical resolution, the CCP promoted the terms Two Establishes and Two Safeguards, calling the CCP to unite around and protect Xi's core status within the party.[131] In 2022, Xi appointed his close ally Wang Xiaohong as the Minister of Public Security, giving him further control over the security establishment.[132]\n\n\nThe 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held between 16 and 22 October 2022, has overseen amendments in the CCP constitution and the re-election of Xi as general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC for a third term, with the overall result of the Congress being further strengthening of Xi's power.[133] The newly amended CCP constitution included the term two safeguards, reinforcing Xi's power.[134] It also included concepts promoted by Xi like common prosperity, \"Chinese-style modernization\" and \"whole-process people's democracy\".[135] Xi's re-election made him the first party leader since Mao Zedong to be chosen for a third term, though Deng Xiaoping ruled the country informally for a longer period.[136] Xi was further re-elected as the PRC president and chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission on 10 March 2023 during the opening of the 14th National People's Congress.[137]\n\n\nThe new Politburo Standing Committee elected just after the CCP Congress was filled almost completely with people close to Xi, with four out of the seven members of the previous PSC including premier Li Keqiang and CPPCC chairman Wang Yang stepping down.[138] Li Qiang, a close Xi ally, became the second-ranking member of the PSC, and was further promoted to premier in 2023.[133][139] Other allies of Xi, including Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang and Li Xi have also joined the PSC, and became the first secretary of the CCP Secretariat, first vice premier, and secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection respectively.[140] The only remaining members of the previous PSC except Xi were Zhao Leji and Wang Huning, though their ranking and positions changed,[140] and became the NPC Standing Committee and CPPCC chairmen respectively on 10 March 2023.[141][142] Reuters remarked that the retirement of Wang Yang and Li Keqiang, as well as the demotion of vice premier Hu Chunhua from the Politburo meant the wipeout of Tuanpai,[116] while Willy Wo-Lap Lam wrote that there were no representatives from the Tuanpai or the Shanghai clique, leading to a total dominance of Xi's own faction.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Cult of personality[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping's cult of personality\n\nXi has had a cult of personality constructed around himself since entering office[144][145] with books, cartoons, pop songs and dance routines honouring his rule.[146] Following Xi's ascension to the leadership core of the CCP, he had been referred to as *Xi Dada* (\u4e60\u5927\u5927, Uncle or Papa Xi),[146][147] though this stopped in April 2016.[148] The village of Liangjiahe, where Xi was sent to work, has become a \"modern-day shrine\" decorated with CCP propaganda and murals extolling the formative years of his life.[149] The CCP's Politburo named Xi Jinping *lingxiu* (\u9886\u8896), a reverent term for \"leader\" and a title previously only given to Mao Zedong and his immediate successor Hua Guofeng.[150][151][152] He is also sometimes called the \"pilot at the helm\" (\u9886\u822a\u638c\u8235).[153] On 25 December 2019, the Politburo officially named Xi as \"People's Leader\" (\u4eba\u6c11\u9886\u8896; *r\u00e9nm\u00edn l\u01d0ngxi\u00f9*), a title only Mao had held previously.[154]\n\n\n\n### Economy and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of China\n\nXi was initially seen as a market reformist,[155] and the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee under him announced that \"market forces\" would begin to play a \"decisive\" role in allocating resources.[156] This meant that the state would gradually reduce its involvement in the distribution of capital, and restructure China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to allow further competition, potentially by attracting foreign and private sector players in industries that were previously highly regulated. This policy aimed to address the bloated state sector that had unduly profited from an earlier round of re-structuring by purchasing assets at below-market prices, assets that were no longer being used productively. Xi also launched the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone in August 2013, which was seen as part of the economic reforms.[157] In However, by 2017, Xi's promise of economic reforms has been said to stall by experts.[158][155] In 2015, the Chinese stock market bubble popped, which led Xi to use state forces to fix the issue.[159] From 2012 to 2022, the share of the market value of private sector firms in China's top listed companies has increased from around 10% to over 40%.[160] He has also overseen the relaxation of restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) and increased cross-border holdings of stocks and bonds.[160]\n\n\nXi has increased state control over China's economy, voicing support for SOEs,[161][155] while also supporting the country's private sector.[162] CCP control of SOEs has increased under Xi, while some limited steps towards market liberalization, such as increasing mixed ownership of SOEs were also undertaken.[163] Under Xi, \"government guidance funds\", public-private investment funds set up by or for government bodies, have raised more than $900 billion for early funding to companies that work in sectors the government deems as strategic.[164] Xi has increased the role of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission at the expense of the State Council.[165] His administration made it easier for banks to issue mortgages, increased foreign participation in the bond market, and increased the national currency renminbi's global role, helping it to join IMF's basket of special drawing right.[166] In the 40th anniversary of the launching of Chinese economic reforms in 2018, he has promised to continue reforms but has warned that nobody \"can dictate to the Chinese people\".[167]\n\n\nXi has also personally made eradicating extreme poverty through \"targeted poverty alleviation\" a key goal.[168] In 2021, Xi declared a \"complete victory\" over extreme poverty, saying that nearly 100 million people have been lifted out of poverty under his tenure, though some experts said that China's poverty threshold was relatively lower than the one set by the World Bank.[169] In 2020, premier Li Keqiang, citing the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that China still had 600 million people living with less than 1000 yuan ($140) a month, although an article from *The Economist* said that the methodology NBS used was flawed, stating that the figure took the combined income, which was then equally divided.[170]\n\n\nChina's economy has grown under Xi, with GDP in nominal terms more than doubling from $8.53 trillion in 2012 to $17.73 trillion in 2021,[171] while China's nominal GDP per capita surpassed the world average in 2021,[172] though the rate of growth has slowed from 7.9% in 2012 to 6% in 2019.[173] Xi has stressed the importance of \"high-quality growth\" rather than \"inflated growth\".[174] He has additionally stated that China will focus on quality of economic growth and that it has abandoned a growth-at-all-costs strategy which Xi refers to as \"GDP heroism\".[175]:\u200a22 Instead, Xi said that other social issues such as environmental protection are important.[175]:\u200a22 His administration pursued a debt-deleveraging campaign, seeking to slow and cut the unsustainable amount of debt China has accrued during its economic growth.[176] Though China's total non-financial-sector debt-to-GDP ratio reached a record 270.9% by 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis, it fell to reach around 262.5% by 2021 before going up again to 273.2% in 2022, mainly due to the pressure put by the zero-COVID policy to local finances.[177]\n\n\nXi has circulated a policy called \"dual circulation\", meaning reorienting the economy towards domestic consumption while remaining open to foreign trade and investment.[178] Xi has also made boosting productivity in the economy a priority.[179] Xi has attempted to reform the property sector to combat the steep increase in the property prices and to cut Chinese economy's dependence on the real estate sector.[180] In the 19th CCP National Congress, Xi declared \"Houses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation\".[181] In 2020, Xi's government formulated the \"three red lines\" policy that aimed to deleverage the heavily indebted property sector.[182] Xi additionally has supported a property tax, for which he has faced resistance from members of the CCP.[183]\n\n\nXi's administration has promoted \"Made in China 2025\" plan that aims to make China self-reliant in key technologies, although publicly China de-emphasised this plan due to the outbreak of a trade war with the U.S. Since the outbreak of the trade war in 2018, Xi has revived calls for \"self-reliance\", especially on the matters of technology.[184] Domestic spending on R&D has significantly increased under Xi, surpassing the total of the European Union (EU) and reaching a record $564 billion in 2020.[185] In August 2022, Xi's administration has allocated more than $100 billion to support China's efforts at semiconductor independence.[186] The Chinese government has also supported technology companies like Huawei through grants, tax breaks, credit facilities and other forms of assistance, enabling their rise but also leading to countermeasures by the U.S.[187] Xi has also been personally involved in the development of Xiong'an, a new area announced in 2017, planned to become a major metropolis near Beijing and Tianjin in Hebei province; the relocation aspect is estimated to last until 2035 while it is planned to developed into a \"modern socialist city\" by 2050.[188]\n\n\n\n> \n> Common prosperity is an essential requirement of socialism and a key feature of Chinese-style modernization. The common prosperity we are pursuing is for all, affluence both in material and spiritual life, but not for a small portion nor for uniform egalitarianism.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Xi Jinping during a speech in 2021[189]\n\nIn November 2020, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Xi personally ordered a halt to Ant Group's initial public offering (IPO), in reaction to its founder Jack Ma criticizing government regulation in finance.[190] Xi's administration has also overseen a decrease in offshore IPOs by Chinese companies, with most Chinese IPOs taking place either in Shanghai or Shenzhen as of 2022[update], and has increasingly directed funding to IPOs of companies that works in sectors it deems as strategic, including electric vehicles, biotechnology, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and other high-technology manufacturing.[164]\n\n\nSince 2021, Xi has promoted the term \"common prosperity\", a term which he defined as an \"essential requirement of socialism\", described as affluence for all and said entailed reasonable adjustments to excess incomes.[189][191] Common prosperity has been used as the justification for large-scale crackdowns and regulations towards the perceived \"excesses\" of several sectors, most prominently tech and tutoring industries.[192] The examples of actions taken against tech companies have included fining large tech companies[193] and passing of laws such as the Data Security Law. China also banned private tutoring companies from making profits and teaching school syllabus during weekends and holidays, effectively destroying the whole industry.[194] Xi additionally opened a new stock exchange in Beijing targeted for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which was another part of his common prosperity campaign.[195] There have also been other numerous cultural regulations, such as limiting video game usage by minors to 90 minutes during weekdays and 3 hours during weekends,[196] complete banning of cryptocurrency,[197] cracking down on idol worship, fandom and celebrity culture[198] and cracking down on \"sissy men\".[199] *The Wall Street Journal* has also reported in October 2021 that Xi had launched a round of inspections of the country's financial institutions, including state-owned banks, investment funds and financial regulators, on whether their ties to private firms had become too close, with the investigations being led by Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.[200]\n\n\n\n### Reforms[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2013, at the conclusion of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, the Communist Party delivered a far-reaching reform agenda that alluded to changes in both economic and social policy. Xi signaled at the plenum that he was consolidating control of the massive internal security organization that was formerly the domain of Zhou Yongkang.[156] A new National Security Commission was formed with Xi at its helm. The Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms\u2014another *ad hoc* policy coordination body led by Xi upgraded to a commission in 2018\u2014was also formed to oversee the implementation of the reform agenda.[201] Termed \"comprehensive deepening reforms\" (\u5168\u9762\u6df1\u5316\u6539\u9769; *qu\u00e1nmi\u00e0n sh\u0113nhu\u00e0 g\u01ceig\u00e9*), they were said to be the most significant since Deng Xiaoping's 1992 Southern Tour. The plenum also announced economic reforms and resolved to abolish the *laogai* system of \"re-education through labour\", which was largely seen as a blot on China's human rights record. The system has faced significant criticism for years from domestic critics and foreign observers.[156] In January 2016, a two-child policy replaced the one-child policy,[202] which was in turn was replaced with a three-child policy in May 2021.[203] In July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed.[204]\n\n\n\n#### Political reforms[edit]\n\n\nXi's administration taken a number of changes to the structure of the CCP and state bodies, especially in a large overhaul in 2018. In March 2014, the CCP Central Committee merged the Office for External Propaganda (OEP), externally known as the State Council Information Office (SCIO), to the CCP's Central Propaganda Department. SCIO is now used by the Central Propaganda Department as an external name under an arrangement called \"one institution with two names\".[205] February earlier that year oversaw the creation of the Central Leading Group for Cybersecurity and Informatization. The State Internet Information Office (SIIO), previously under the OEP and SCIO, was transferred to the central leading group and renamed in English into the Cyberspace Administration of China.[206] As part of managing the financial system, the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a State Council body, was established in 2017. Chaired by vice premier Liu He during its existence, the committee was disestablished by the newly established Central Financial Commission during the 2023 Party and state reforms.[207]\n\n\n2018 has seen larger reforms to the bureaucracy. In that year, several central leading groups including reform, cyberspace affairs, finance and economics. and foreign affairs were upgraded to commissions.[208][209] In the area of media, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) was renamed into the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) with its film, news media and publications being transferred to the Central Propaganda Department.[209] Additionally, the control of China Central Television (CCTV, including its international edition, China Global Television), China National Radio (CNR) and China Radio International (CRI) were transferred to the newly established China Media Group (CMG) under the control of the Central Propaganda Department.[209][210] Two State Council departments. one dealing with overseas Chinese, and other one dealing with religious affairs, were merged into the United Front Work Department while another commission dealing with ethnic affairs was brought under formal UFWD leadership.[209]\n\n\n2023 has seen further reforms to the CCP and state bureaucracy, most notably the strengthening of Party control over the financial and technology domains.[211] This included the creation of two CCP bodies for overseeing finance; the Central Financial Commission (CFC), as well as the revival of the Central Financial Work Commission (CFWC) that was previously dissolved in 2002.[211] The CFC would broadly manage the financial system while the CFWC would focus on strengthening the ideological and political role of the CCP in the sector.[207] Additionally, a new CCP Central Science and Technology Commission would be established to broadly oversee the technology sector, while a newly created Social Work Department was tasked with CCP interactions with several sectors, including civic groups, chambers of commerce and industry groups, as well as handling public petition and grievance work.[211] A new Central Hong Kong and Macau Work Office would also be established, with the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office being turned into the new body's external name.[211]\n\n\nAt the State Council, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission was replaced by the National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR), which is taking a much larger responsibility on financial regulation, effectively overseeing all financial activities except the securities industry, which was continued to be regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, now elevated to a government body.[212] Several regulatory responsibilities were also transferred from the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to the SAFS, while the PBoC will also reopen offices around the country that were closed in a previous reorganization.[213]\n\n\n\n#### Legal reforms[edit]\n\n\n> \n> Efforts should be made to enable the people to see that justice is served in every judicial case.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Xi Jinping during a speech in November 2020[214]\n\nThe party under Xi announced a raft of legal reforms at the Fourth Plenum held in the fall 2014, and he called for \"Chinese socialistic rule of law\" immediately afterwards. The party aimed to reform the legal system, which had been perceived as ineffective at delivering justice and affected by corruption, local government interference and lack of constitutional oversight. The plenum, while emphasizing the absolute leadership of the party, also called for a greater role of the constitution in the affairs of state and a strengthening of the role of the National People's Congress Standing Committee in interpreting the constitution.[215] It also called for more transparency in legal proceedings, more involvement of ordinary citizens in the legislative process, and an overall \"professionalization\" of the legal workforce. The party also planned to institute cross-jurisdictional circuit legal tribunals as well as giving provinces consolidated administrative oversight over lower level legal resources, which is intended to reduce local government involvement in legal proceedings.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Military reforms[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Modernization of the People's Liberation Army and 2015 People's Republic of China military reform\nSince taking power in 2012, Xi has undertaken an overhaul of the People's Liberation Army, including both political reform and its modernization.[217] Military-civil fusion has advanced under Xi.[218][219] Xi has been active in his participation in military affairs, taking a direct hands-on approach to military reform. In addition to being the Chairman of the CMC and leader of the Central Leading Group for Military Reform founded in 2014 to oversee comprehensive military reforms, Xi has delivered numerous high-profile pronouncements vowing to clean up malfeasance and complacency in the military. Xi has repeatedly warned that the depoliticization of the PLA from the CCP would lead to a collapse similar to that of the Soviet Union.[220] Xi held the New Gutian Conference in 2014, gathering China's top military officers, re-emphasizing the principle of \"the party has absolute control over the army\" first established by Mao at the 1929 Gutian Conference.[221]\n\n\n> \n> In the USSR, where the military was depoliticized, separated from the party and nationalized, the party was disarmed. When the Soviet Union came to crisis point, a big party was gone just like that. Proportionally, the Soviet Communist Party had more members than we do, but nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Xi Jinping during a speech[222]\n\nThough predating Xi, his administration has taken a more assertive stance towards maritime affairs, and has boosted CCP control over the maritime security forces.[223] In 2013, the previously separate rival maritime law enforcements of China were merged into the China Coast Guard. Initially under the joint administration of the State Oceanic Administration and the Ministry of Public Security, it was placed squarely under the administration of the People's Armed Police (PAP) in 2018.[223]\n\n\nXi announced a reduction of 300,000 troops from the PLA in 2015, bringing its size to 2 million troops. Xi described this as a gesture of peace, while analysts such as Rory Medcalf have said that the cut was done to reduce costs as well as part of PLA's modernization.[224] On 2016, he reduced the number of theater commands of the PLA from seven to five.[225] He has also abolished the four autonomous general departments of the PLA, replacing them with 15 agencies directly reporting to the CMC.[217] Two new branches of the PLA were created under his reforms, the Strategic Support Force[226] and the Joint Logistics Support Force.[227] In 2018, the PAP was placed under the sole control of the CMC; the PAP was previously under the joint command of the CMC and the State Council through the Ministry of Public Security.[228]:\u200a15\n\n\nOn 21 April 2016, Xi was named commander-in-chief of the country's new Joint Operations Command Center of the PLA by Xinhua News Agency and the broadcaster China Central Television.[229][230] Some analysts interpreted this move as an attempt to display strength and strong leadership and as being more \"political than military\".[231] According to Ni Lexiong, a military affairs expert, Xi \"not only controls the military but also does it in an absolute manner, and that in wartime, he is ready to command personally\".[232] According to a University of California, San Diego expert on Chinese military, Xi \"has been able to take political control of the military to an extent that exceeds what Mao and Deng have done\".[233]\n\n\nUnder Xi, China's official military budget has more than doubled,[185] reaching a record $224 billion in 2023.[234] The PLA Navy has grown rapidly under Xi, with China adding more warships, submarines, support ships and major amphibious vessels than the than the entire number of ships under the United Kingdom navy between 2014 and 2018.[235] In 2017, China established the navy's first overseas base in Djibouti.[236] Xi has also undertaken an expansion of China's nuclear arsenal, with him calling China to \"establish a strong system of strategic deterrence\". The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) has estimated China's total amount of nuclear arsenals to be 410 in 2023, with the US Department of Defense estimating that China's arsenal could reach 1,000 by 2030.[237]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of Xi Jinping\nSee also: List of international trips made by Xi Jinping\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet in 2016![](image)World leaders assemble for \"family photo\" at G20 summit in HamburgXi has taken a harder line on security issues as well as foreign affairs, projecting a more nationalistic and assertive China on the world stage.[238] His political program calls for a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure.[239] Foreign analysts and observers have frequently said that Xi's main foreign policy objective is to restore China's position on the global stage as a great power.[240][222][241] Xi advocates \"baseline thinking\" in China's foreign policy: setting explicit red lines that other countries must not cross.[242] In the Chinese perspective, these tough stances on baseline issues reduce strategic uncertainty, preventing other nations from misjudging China's positions or underestimating China's resolve in asserting what it perceives to be in its national interest.[242] Xi stated during the 20th CCP National Congress that he wanted to ensure China \"leads the world in terms of composite national strength and international influence\" by 2049.[243]\n\n\nXi has promoted \"major-country diplomacy\" (\u5927\u56fd\u5916\u4ea4), stating that China is already a \"big power\" and breaking away from previous Chinese leaders who had a more precautious diplomacy.[244] He has adopted a hawkish foreign policy posture called \"wolf warrior diplomacy\",[245] while his foreign policy thoughts are collectively known as \"Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy\".[246] In March 2021, he said that \"the East is rising and the West is declining\" (\u4e1c\u5347\u897f\u964d), saying that the power of the Western world was in decline and their COVID-19 response was an example of this, and that China was entering a period of opportunity because of this.[247] Xi has frequently alluded to \"community with a shared future for mankind\", which Chinese diplomats have said doesn't imply an intention to change the international order,[248] but which foreign observers say China wants a new order that puts it more at the centre.[249] Under Xi, China has, along with Russia, also focused on increasing relations with the Global South in order to blunt the effect of Western sanctions.[250]\n\n\nXi has put an emphasis on increasing China's \"international discourse power\" (\u56fd\u9645\u8bdd\u8bed\u6743) to create a more favorable global opinion of China in the world.[251] In this pursuit, Xi has emphasised the need to \"tell China's story well\" (\u8bb2\u597d\u4e2d\u56fd\u6545\u4e8b), meaning expanding China's external propaganda (\u5916\u5ba3) and communications.[252] Xi has expanded the focus and scope of the united front, which aims to consolidate support for CCP in non-CCP elements both inside and outside China, and has accordingly expanded the United Front Work Department.[253] Xi has unveiled the Global Development Initiative (GDI),[254] the Global Security Initiative (GSI),[255] and the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI), in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, aiming to increase China's influence in the international order.[256]\n\n\n\n#### Security[edit]\n\n\nUnder Xi, China has promoted reformation of the international system, with Xi calling for a \"rejection of hegemonic power structures in global governance\".[257] Addressing a regional conference in Shanghai on 21 May 2014, he called on Asian countries to unite and forge a way together, rather than get involved with third party powers, seen as a reference to the United States. \"Matters in Asia ultimately must be taken care of by Asians. Asia's problems ultimately must be resolved by Asians and Asia's security ultimately must be protected by Asians\", he told the conference.[258] His proposed Global Security Initiative has been aiming to create a new global security architecture, incorporating the term \"indivisible security\", a concept also supported by Russia.[255] He has also advocated for international security cooperation; during a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in September 2021, he spoke out against \"interference in other countries' internal affairs\", and called for joint cooperation in warding off against \"colour revolutions\".[259]\n\n\n\n#### Africa[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sino-African relations\n\nUnder Xi, China has cut back lending to Africa after fears that African countries couldn't repay their debts to China.[260] Xi has also promised that China would write off debts of some African countries.[261] In November 2021, Xi promised African nations 1 billion doses of China's COVID-19 vaccines, which was in addition to the 200 million already supplied before. This has been said to be part of China's vaccine diplomacy.[262]\n\n\n\n#### European Union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013European Union relations\n\n![](image)Xi in an official visit to Warsaw, where he and Poland's president Andrzej Duda signed a declaration on strategic partnership.China's efforts under Xi has been for the European Union (EU) to stay in a neutral position in their contest with the U.S.[263] China and the EU announced the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) in 2020, although the deal was later frozen due to mutual sanctions over Xinjiang.[264] Xi has supported calls for EU to achieve \"strategic autonomy\",[265] and has also called on the EU to view China \"independently\".[266]\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013India relations\n\n![](image)The BRICS leaders in 2023, from left to right: Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Xi Jinping, Cyril Ramaphosa, Narendra Modi and Sergey Lavrov (representing Vladimir Putin).\nRelations between China and India had ups and downs under Xi, later deteriorating due to various factors. In 2013, the two countries had a standoff in Depsang for three weeks, which ended with no border change.[267] In 2017, the two countries again had a standoff over a Chinese construction of a road in Doklam, a territory both claimed by Bhutan, India's ally, and China,[268] though by 28 August, both countries mutually disengaged.[269] The most serious crisis in the relationship came when the two countries had a deadly clash in 2020 at the Line of Actual Control, leaving some soldiers dead.[270][271] The clashes created a serious deterioration in relations, with China seizing a small chunk of territory that India controlled.[272]\n\n\n\n#### Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013Japan relations\n\nChina\u2013Japan relations have initially soured under Xi's administration; the most thorny issue between the two countries remains the dispute over the Senkaku islands, which China calls Diaoyu. In response to Japan's continued robust stance on the issue, China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone in November 2013.[273] However, the relations later started to improve, with Xi being invited to visit in 2020,[274] though the trip was later delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[275] In August 2022, Kyodo News reported that Xi personally decided to let ballistic missiles land within Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) during the military exercises held around Taiwan, to send a warning to Japan.[276]\n\n\n\n#### Middle East[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi with Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, 23 January 2016\nWhile China has historically been wary of getting closer to the Middle East countries, Xi has changed this approach.[277] China has grown closer to both Iran and Saudi Arabia under Xi.[277] During a visit to Iran in 2016, Xi proposed a large cooperation program with Iran,[278] a deal that was later signed in 2021.[279] China has also sold ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia and is helping build 7,000 schools in Iraq.[277] In 2013, Xi proposed a peace deal between Israel and Palestine that entails a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.[280] Turkey, with whom relations were long strained over Uyghurs, has also grown closer to China.[281] On 10 March 2023, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to restore diplomatic ties cut in 2016 after a deal brokered between the two countries by China following secret talks in Beijing.[282]\n\n\n\n#### North Korea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013North Korea relations\n\nUnder Xi, China initially took a more critical stance on North Korea due to its nuclear tests.[283] However, starting in 2018, the relations started to improve due to meetings between Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.[284] Xi has also supported denuclearization of North Korea,[285] and has voiced support for economic reforms in the country.[286] At the G20 meeting in Japan, Xi called for a \"timely easing\" of sanctions imposed on North Korea.[287] After the 20th CCP National Congress in 2022, *Rodong Sinmun*, official newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, wrote a long editorial praising Xi, titling both Kim and Xi *Suryong* (\uc218\ub839), a title historically reserved for North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013Russia relations\n\n![](image)Xi with his wife Peng Liyuan during the Moscow Victory Day Parade on 9 May 2015\nXi has cultivated stronger relations with Russia, particularly in the wake of the Ukraine crisis of 2014. He seems to have developed a strong personal relationship with president Vladimir Putin. Both are viewed as strong leaders with a nationalist orientation who are not afraid to assert themselves against Western interests.[289] Xi attended the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Under Xi, China signed a $400\u00a0billion gas deal with Russia; China has also become Russia's largest trading partner.[289]\n\n\nXi and Putin met on 4 February 2022 during the run up to the 2022 Beijing Olympics during the massive Russian build-up of force on the Ukrainian border, with the two expressing that the two countries are nearly united in their anti-US alignment and that both nations shared \"no limits\" to their commitments.[290][291] U.S. officials said that China had asked Russia to wait for the invasion of Ukraine until after the Beijing Olympics ended on 20 February.[291] In April 2022, Xi Jinping expressed opposition to sanctions against Russia.[292] On 15 June 2022, Xi Jinping reasserted China's support for Russia on issues of sovereignty and security.[293] However, Xi also said China is committed to respecting \"the territorial integrity of all countries\",[294] and said China was \"pained to see the flames of war reignited in Europe\".[295] China has additionally kept a distance from Russia's actions, instead putting itself as a neutral party.[291] In February 2023, China released a 12-point peace plan to \"settle the acute crisis in Ukraine\"; the plan was praised by Putin but criticized by the U.S. and European countries.[296]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vladimir Putin welcomes Xi in Moscow during Xi's visit to Russia in March 2023\nDuring the war Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given a nuanced take to China,[297] saying that the country has the economic leverage to pressure Putin to end the war, adding \"I'm sure that without the Chinese market for the Russian Federation, Russia would be feeling complete economic isolation. That's something that China can do \u2013 to limit the trade [with Russia] until the war is over.\" In August 2022, Zelenskyy said that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Xi Jinping did not respond to his requests for direct talks with him.[298] He additionally said that while he would like China to take a different approach to the war in Ukraine, he also wanted the relationship to improve every year and said that China and Ukraine shared similar values.[299] On 26 April 2023, Zelenskyy and Xi held their first phone call since the start of the war.[300]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013South Korea relations\n\nXi has initially improved relationships with South Korea,[283] and the two countries signed a free-trade agreement in December 2015.[301] Starting in 2017, China's relationship with South Korea soured over the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), a missile defence system, purchase of the latter. which China sees as a threat but which South Korea says is a defence measure against North Korea.[302] Ultimately, South Korea halted the purchase of the THAAD after China imposed unofficial sanctions.[303] China's relations with South Korea improved again under president Moon Jae-in.[304]\n\n\n\n#### Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Philippine President Bongbong Marcos in Bangkok, November 2022\nSince Xi came to power, China has been rapidly building and militarizing islands in the South China Sea, a decision *Study Times* of the Central Party School said was personally taken by Xi.[305] In April 2015, new satellite imagery revealed that China was rapidly constructing an airfield on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea.[306] In November 2014, in a major policy address, Xi called for a decrease in the use of force, preferring dialogue and consultation to solve the current issues plaguing the relationship between China and its South East Asian neighbors.[307]\n\n\n\n#### Taiwan[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cross-Strait relations and Ma\u2013Xi meeting\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping met with then-Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou in November 2015 in their capacity as the leader of mainland China and Taiwan respectively.\nIn 2015, Xi met with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou, which marked the first time the political leaders of both sides of the Taiwan Strait have met since the end of the Chinese Civil War in Mainland China in 1950.[308] Xi said that China and Taiwan are \"one family\" that cannot be pulled apart.[309] However, the relations started deteriorating after Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016.[310]\n\n\nIn the 19th Party Congress held in 2017, Xi reaffirmed six of the nine principles that had been affirmed continuously since the 16th Party Congress in 2002, with the notable exception of \"Placing hopes on the Taiwan people as a force to help bring about unification\".[311] According to the Brookings Institution, Xi used stronger language on potential Taiwan independence than his predecessors towards previous DPP governments in Taiwan.[311] He said that \"we will never allow any person, any organisation, or any political party to split any part of the Chinese territory from China at any time at any form.\"[311] In March 2018, Xi said that Taiwan would face the \"punishment of history\" for any attempts at separatism.[312]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Xi Jinping called on Taiwan to reject its formal independence from China, saying: \"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means.\" Those options, he said, could be used against \"external interference\". Xi also said that they \"are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities.\"[313][314] President Tsai responded to the speech by saying Taiwan would not accept a one country, two systems arrangement with the mainland, while stressing the need for all cross-strait negotiations to be on a government-to-government basis.[315]\n\n\nIn 2022, after the Chinese military exercises around Taiwan, the PRC published a white paper called \"The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era\", which was the first white paper regards to Taiwan since 2000.[316] The paper urged Taiwan to become a special administrative region of the PRC under the one country two systems formula,[316] and said that \"a small number of countries, the U.S. foremost amongst them\" are \"using Taiwan to contain China\".[317] Notably, the new white paper excluded a part that previously said the PRC would not send troops or officials to Taiwan after unification.[317]\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013United States relations\n\n![](image)U.S. president Donald Trump arrives in China, 8 November 2017Xi has called China\u2013United States relations in the contemporary world a \"new type of great-power relations\", a phrase the Obama administration had been reluctant to embrace.[318] Under his administration the U.S.\u2013China Strategic and Economic Dialogue that began under Hu Jintao has continued, until it was suspended by the administration of Donald Trump.[319] On China\u2013U.S. relations, Xi said, \"If [China and the United States] are in confrontation, it would surely spell disaster for both countries\".[320] The U.S. has been critical of Chinese actions in the South China Sea.[318] In 2014, Chinese hackers compromised the computer system of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management,[321] resulting in the theft of approximately 22 million personnel records handled by the office.[322] Xi has also indirectly spoken out critically on the U.S. \"strategic pivot\" to Asia.[323]\nRelations with the U.S. soured after Donald Trump became president in 2017.[324] Since 2018, U.S. and China have been engaged in an escalating trade war.[325] In 2020, the relations further deteriorated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[326] In 2021, Xi has called the U.S. the biggest threat to China's development, saying that \"the biggest source of chaos in the present-day world is the United States\".[247] Xi has also scrapped a previous policy in which China did not challenge the U.S. in most instances, while Chinese officials said that they now see China as an \"equal\" to the U.S.[327] On 6 March 2023, during a speech to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Xi said that \"Western countries\u2014led by the U.S.\u2014have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression\" against China, which he said brought \"unprecedentedly severe challenges to our country's development\".[328]\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping with U.S. President Joe Biden at the margins of the 2022 G20 Bali summit\n#### Economic relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Belt and Road Initiative\n![](image)Countries that signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was unveiled by Xi in September and October 2013 during visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia,[329] and was thereafter promoted by Premier Li Keqiang during state visits to Asia and Europe. Xi made the announcement for the initiative while in Astana, Kazakhstan, and called it a \"golden opportunity\".[330] BRI has been called Xi's \"signature project\", involving numerous infrastructure development and investment projects throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas.[331] BRI was added to the CCP Constitution at the closing session of the 19th Party Congress on 24 October 2017,[332] further elevating its importance.[333] Since the BRI was launched, China became the world's largest lender, lending about $1 trillion in a decade to almost 150 countries. However, by 2022, many BRI projects have stalled, and most of China's debt became held by countries in financial distress, leading the Chinese leaders to adopt a more conservative approach to BRI, dubbed as \"Belt and Road Initiative 2.0\".[334]\n\n\nXi officially proposed the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in October 2013 during a visit to Indonesia,[335] which officially launched in January 2016.[336] The membership of the AIIB has included numerous countries, including allies of the United States and Western countries, despite opposition from the US.[336] Since its launch until 2022, AIIB has invested $36.43 billion to 190 projects.[337] Xi's tenure has seen a signing of several free-trade deals, including with Australia in 2014,[338] South Korea in 2015,[301] and the larger Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2020.[339] Xi has also expressed his interest in China joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), with China formally applying to join in September 2021.[340]\n\n\n\n### National security[edit]\n\n\nXi has devoted a large amount of work towards national security, calling for a \"holistic national security architecture\" that encompasses \"all aspects of the work of the party and the country\".[341] During a private talk with U.S. president Obama and vice president Biden, he said that China had been a target of \"colour revolutions\", foreshadowing his focus on national security.[342] Since its creation by Xi, the National Security Commission has established local security committees, focusing on dissent.[342] In the name of national security, Xi's government has passed numerous laws including a counterespionage law in 2014,[343] national security[344] and a counterterrorism law in 2015,[345] a cybersecurity law[346] and a law restricting foreign NGOs in 2016,[347] a national intelligence law in 2017,[348] and a data security law in 2021.[349] Under Xi, China's mass surveillance network has dramatically grown, with comprehensive profiles being built for each citizen.[350]\n\n\n\n### Hong Kong[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hong Kong protesters throw eggs at Xi Jinping's portrait on National DayDuring his leadership, Xi has supported and pursued a greater political and economic integration of Hong Kong to mainland China, including through projects such as the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge.[351] He has pushed for the Greater Bay Area project, which aims to integrate Hong Kong, Macau, and nine other cities in Guangdong.[351] Xi's push for greater integration has created fears of decreasing freedoms in Hong Kong.[352] Many of the views held by the central government and eventually implemented in Hong Kong were outlined in a white paper published by the State Council in 2014 named *The Practice of the 'One Country, Two Systems' Policy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region*, which outlined that the China's central government has \"comprehensive jurisdiction\" over Hong Kong.[353] Under Xi, the Chinese government also declared the Sino-British Joint Declaration to be legally void.[353]\n\n\nIn August 2014, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) made a decision allowing universal suffrage for the 2017 election of the chief executive of Hong Kong, but also requiring the candidates to \"love the country, and love Hong Kong\", as well as other measures that ensured the Chinese leadership would be the ultimate decision-maker on the selection, leading to protests,[354] and the eventual rejection of the reform bill in the Legislative Council due to a walk-out by the pro-Beijing camp to delay to vote.[355] In the 2017 chief executive election, Carrie Lam was victorious, reportedly with the endorsement of the CCP Politburo.[356]\n\n\n\nXi has supported the Hong Kong Government and Carrie Lam against the protesters in the 2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests, which broke out after a proposed bill that would allow extraditions to China.[357] He has defended the Hong Kong police's use of force, saying that \"We sternly support the Hong Kong police to take forceful actions in enforcing the law, and the Hong Kong judiciary to punish in accordance with the law those who have committed violent crimes.\"[358] While visiting Macau on 20 December 2019 as part of the 20th anniversary of its return to China, Xi warned of foreign forces interfering in Hong Kong and Macau,[359] while also hinting that Macau could be a model for Hong Kong to follow.[360]\n\n![](image)Xi swearing in John Lee as chief executive during the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China\nIn 2020, the NPCSC passed a national security law in Hong Kong that dramatically expanded government clampdown over the opposition in the city; amongst the measures were the dramatic restriction on political opposition and the creation of a central government office outside Hong Kong jurisdiction to oversee the enforcement of the law.[353] This was seem as the culmination of a long-term project under Xi to further closely integrate Hong Kong with the mainland.[353] Xi visited Hong Kong as president in 2017 and 2022, in the 20th and 25th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong respectively.[361] In his 2022 visit, he swore in John Lee as chief executive, a former police officer that was backed by the Chinese government to expand control over the city.[362][363] While in the city, he said Hong Kong had moved from \"chaos\" to \"stability\".[364] Since John Lee became chief executive, Hong Kong government officials including Lee himself have shown public displays of loyalty towards Xi, similar to the mainland but previously unheard in the city.[365]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human rights in China, Uyghur genocide, and Antireligious campaigns in China\n\nAccording to the Human Rights Watch, Xi has \"started a broad and sustained offensive on human rights\" since he became leader in 2012.[366] The HRW also said that repression in China is \"at its worst level since the Tiananmen Square massacre.\"[367] Since taking power, Xi has cracked down on grassroots activism, with hundreds being detained.[368] He presided over the 709 crackdown on 9 July 2015, which saw more than 200 lawyers, legal assistants and human rights activists being detained.[369] His term has seen the arrest and imprisonment of activists such as Xu Zhiyong, as well as numerous others who identified with the New Citizens' Movement. Prominent legal activist Pu Zhiqiang of the Weiquan movement was also arrested and detained.[370]\n\n\nIn 2017, the local government of the Jiangxi province told Christians to replace their pictures of Jesus with Xi Jinping as part of a general campaign on unofficial churches in the country.[371][372][373] According to local social media, officials \"transformed them from believing in religion to believing in the party\".[371] According to activists, \"Xi is waging the most severe systematic suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982\", and according to pastors and a group that monitors religion in China, has involved \"destroying crosses, burning bibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith\".[374]\n\n\nUnder Xi, the CCP has embraced assimilationist policies towards ethnic minorities, scaling back affirmative action in the country by 2019,[375] and scrapping a wording in October 2021 that guaranteed the rights of minority children to be educated in their native language, replacing it with one that emphasized teaching the national language.[376] In 2020, Chen Xiaojiang was appointed as head of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission, the first Han Chinese head of the body since 1954.[377] On 24 June 2022, Pan Yue, another Han Chinese, became the head of the commission, with him reportedly holding assimilationist policies toward ethnic minorities.[378] Xi outlined his official views relations between the majority Han Chinese and ethnic minorities by saying \"[n]either Han chauvinism nor local ethnic chauvinism is conducive to the development of a community for the Chinese nation\".[379]\n\n\n\n#### Xinjiang[edit]\n\n\nFollowing several terrorist attacks in Xinjiang in 2013 and 2014, the CCP leaders held a secret meeting to find a solution to the attacks,[380] leading to Xi to launch the Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism in 2014, which involved mass detention, and surveillance of ethnic Uyghurs there.[381][382] Xi made an inspection tour in Xinjiang between 27 and 30 April in 2014.[383] The program was massively expanded in 2016, after the appointment of Chen Quanguo as the Xinjiang CCP secretary. The campaign included the detainment of 1.8 million people in internment camps, mostly Uyghurs but also including other ethnic and religious minorities, by 2020,[380] and a birth suppression campaign that led to a large drop in the Uyghur birth rate by 2019.[384] Various human rights groups and former inmates have described the camps as \"concentration camps\", where Uyghurs and other minorities have been forcibly assimilated into China's majority ethnic Han society.[385] This program has been called a genocide by some observers, while a report by the UN Human Rights Office said they may amount to crimes against humanity.[386][387]\n\n\nInternal Chinese government documents leaked to the press in November 2019 showed that Xi personally ordered a security crackdown in Xinjiang, saying that the party must show \"absolutely no mercy\" and that officials use all the \"weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship\" to suppress those \"infected with the virus of extremism\".[382][388] The papers also showed that Xi repeatedly discussed about Islamic extremism in his speeches, likening it to a \"virus\" or a \"drug\" that could be only addressed by \"a period of painful, interventionary treatment.\"[382] However, he also warned against the discrimination against Uyghurs and rejected proposals to eradicate Islam in China, calling that kind of viewpoint \"biased, even wrong\".[382] Xi's exact role in the building of internment camps has not been publicly reported, though he's widely believed to be behind them and his words have been the source for major justifications in the crackdown in Xinjiang.[389][390] In the Xinjiang Police Files leaked in 2022, a document quoting Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi suggested that Xi had been aware of the internment camps.[391]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chinese government response to COVID-19 and COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China\nOn 20 January 2020, Xi commented for the first time on the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, and ordered \"efforts to curb the spread\" of the virus.[392] He gave premier Li Keqiang some responsibility over the COVID-19 response, in what has been suggested by *The Wall Street Journal* was an attempt to potentially insulate himself from criticism if the response failed.[393] The government initially responded to the pandemic with a lockdown and censorship, with the initial response causing widespread backlash within China.[394] He met with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), on 28 January.[395] *Der Spiegel* reported that in January 2020 Xi pressured Tedros Adhanom to hold off on issuing a global warning about the outbreak of COVID-19 and hold back information on human-to-human transmission of the virus, allegations denied by the WHO.[396] On 5 February, Xi met with Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen in Beijing, the first foreign leader allowed into China since the outbreak.[395] After the COVID-19 outbreak got under control in Wuhan, Xi visited the city on 10 March.[397]\n\n\n![](image)Italian president Sergio Mattarella with Xi in March 2019\nAfter getting the outbreak in Wuhan under control, Xi has favoured what has officially been termed \"dynamic zero-COVID policy\"[398] that aims to control and suppress the virus as much as possible within the country's borders. This has involved local lockdowns and mass-testing.[399] While initially credited for China's suppression of the COVID-19 outbreak, the policy was later criticized by foreign and some domestic observers for being out of touch with the rest of the world and taking a heavy toll on the economy.[399] This approach has especially come under criticism during a 2022 lockdown on Shanghai, which forced millions to their homes and damaged the city's economy,[400] denting the image of Li Qiang, close Xi ally and Party secretary of the city.[401] Conversely, Xi has said that the policy was designed to protect people's life safety.[402] On 23 July 2022, the National Health Commission reported that Xi and other top leaders have taken the local COVID-19 vaccines.[403]\n\n\nAt the 20th CCP Congress, Xi confirmed the continuation of the zero-COVID policy,[404] stating he would \"unswervingly\" carry out \"dynamic zero-COVID\" and promising to \"resolutely win the battle,\"[405] though China started a limited easing of the policies in the following weeks.[406] In November 2022, protests broke out against China's COVID-19 policies, with a fire in a high-rise apartment building in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi being the trigger.[407] The protests were held in multiple major cities, with some of the protesters demanding the end of Xi's and the CCP's rule.[407] The protests were mostly suppressed by December,[407] though the government further eased COVID-19 restrictions in the time since.[408] On 7 December 2022, China announced large-scale changes to its COVID-19 policy, including allowing quarantine at home for mild infections, reducing of PCR testing, and decreasing the power of local officials to implement lockdowns.[409]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental policy in China\n\nIn September 2020, Xi announced that China will \"strengthen its 2030 climate target (NDC), peak emissions before 2030 and aim to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060\".[410] If accomplished, this would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2\u20130.3\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\".[410] Xi mentioned the link between the COVID-19 pandemic and nature destruction as one of the reasons for the decision, saying that \"Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature.\"[411] On 27 September, Chinese scientists presented a detailed plan how to achieve the target.[412] In September 2021, Xi announced that China will not build \"coal-fired power projects abroad, which was said to be potentially \"pivotal\" in reducing emissions. The Belt and Road Initiative did not include financing such projects already in the first half of 2021.[413]\n\n\nXi Jinping did not attend COP26 personally. However, a Chinese delegation led by climate change envoy Xie Zhenhua did attend.[414][415] During the conference, the United States and China agreed on a framework to reduce GHG emission by co-operating on different measures.[416]\n\n\n\n### Governance style[edit]\n\n\nKnown as a very secretive leader, little is known publicly about how Xi makes political decisions, or how he came to power.[417][418] Xi's speeches generally get released months or years after they are made.[417] Xi has also never given a press conference since becoming paramount leader, except in rare joint press conferences with foreign leaders.[417][419] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Xi prefers micromanaging in governance, in contrast to previous leaders such as Hu Jintao who left details of major policies to lower-ranking officials.[84] Reportedly, ministerial officials try to get Xi's attention in various ways, with some creating slide shows and audio reports. *The Wall Street Journal* also reported that Xi created a performance-review system in 2018 to give evaluations on officials on various measures, including loyalty.[84] According to *The Economist*, Xi's orders have generally been vague, leaving lower level officials to interpret his words.[389] Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency said that Xi \"personally reviews every draft of major policy documents\" and \"all reports submitted to him, no matter how late in the evening, were returned with instructions the following morning\".[420] With regard to behavior of Communist Party members, Xi emphasizes the \"Two Musts\" (members must not be arrogant or rash and must keep their hard-working spirit) and the \"Six Nos\" (members must say no to formalism, bureaucracy, gift-giving, luxurious birthday celebrations, hedonism, and extravagance).[175]:\u200a52 Xi called for officials to practice self-criticism which, according to observers, is in order to appear less corrupt and more popular among the people.[421][422][423]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ideology of the Chinese Communist Party\n\n### Chinese Dream[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chinese Dream\n\n![](image)According to *Qiushi*, the Chinese Dream is about Chinese prosperity, collective effort, socialism, and national glory.\nXi and CCP ideologues coined the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" to describe his overarching plans for China as its leader. Xi first used the phrase during a high-profile visit to the National Museum of China on 29 November 2012, where he and his Standing Committee colleagues were attending a \"national revival\" exhibition. Since then, the phrase has become the signature political slogan of the Xi era.[424][425] The origin of the term \"Chinese Dream\" is unclear. While the phrase has been used before by journalists and scholars,[426] some publications have posited the term likely drew its inspiration from the concept of the American Dream.[427] *The Economist* noted the abstract and seemingly accessible nature of the concept with no specific overarching policy stipulations may be a deliberate departure from the jargon-heavy ideologies of his predecessors.[428] Xi has linked the \"Chinese Dream\" with the phrase \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".[429][e]\n\n\n\n### Cultural revival[edit]\n\n\nIn recent years, top political leaders of the CCP such as Xi have overseen the rehabilitation of ancient Chinese philosophical figures like Han Fei into the mainstream of Chinese thought alongside Confucianism. At a meeting with other officials in 2013, he quoted Confucius, saying \"he who rules by virtue is like the Pole Star, it maintains its place, and the multitude of stars pay homage.\" While visiting Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius, in November, he told scholars that the Western world was \"suffering a crisis of confidence\" and that the CCP has been \"the loyal inheritor and promoter of China's outstanding traditional culture.\"[430]\n\n\nAccording to several analysts, Xi's leadership has been characterised by a resurgence of the ancient political philosophy Legalism.[431][432][433] Han Fei gained new prominence with favourable citations; one sentence of Han Fei's that Xi quoted appeared thousands of times in official Chinese media at the local, provincial, and national levels.[433] Xi has additionally supported the Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming, telling local leaders to promote him.[434]\n\n\nXi has also overseen a revival of traditional Chinese culture, breaking from the CCP's previous path, which had often attacked it.[435] He has called traditional culture the \"soul\" of the nation and the \"foundation\" of the CCP's culture.[436] Xi has also called for integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China's traditional culture.[256] Hanfu, the traditional dress of Han Chinese, has seen a revival under him, associated with the revival of traditional culture.[437] He has established the \"four matters of confidence\", which has later been added to the CCP constitution, calling for CCP members, government officials and the Chinese people to be \"confident in our chosen path, confident in our guiding theories, confident in our political system, and confident in our culture\". He has unveiled Global Civilisation initiative in 2023, calling for \"respecting the diversity of civilisations, advocating the common values of humanity, valuing the inheritance and innovation of civilisations, and strengthening international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation\"[256]\n\n\n\n### Ideology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eight-point Regulation\n\nXi has said that \"only socialism can save China\".[438] Xi has also declared socialism with Chinese characteristics to be the \"only correct path to realize national rejuvenation\".[439] According to BBC News, while the CCP was perceived to have abandoned its communist ideology since it initiated economic reforms in the 1970s, Xi is believed by some observers to be more believing in the \"idea of a communist project\",[440] being described as a Marxist\u2013Leninist by former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd.[441] Xi's emphasis on prioritizing ideology has included re-asserting the Party's goal of eventually realizing communism and reprimanding those who dismiss communism as impractical or irrelevant.[163] Xi described the communist ideal as the \"calcium\" in a Party member's spine, without which the Party member would suffer the \"osteoporosis\" of political decay and be unable to stand upright.[163]\n\n\nSubscribing to the view that socialism will eventually triumph over capitalism, Xi has said \"Marx and Engels's analysis of the basic contradictions of capitalist society is not outdated, nor is the historical materialist view that capitalism is bound to die out and socialism bound to win\".[442] Xi has overseen the increase of \"Socialist Political Economy With Chinese Characteristics\" as a major study topic for academics in China, aiming to decrease the influence of Western-influenced economics.[442] Though he has called a stop to what he considers to be \"disorderly expansion of capital\", he has also said that \"it is necessary to stimulate the vitality of capital of all types, including nonpublic capital, and give full play to its positive role\".[442]\n\n\n\n> \n> China's success proves that socialism is not dead. It is thriving. Just imagine this: had socialism failed in China, had our communist party collapsed like the party in the Soviet Union, then global socialism would lapse into a long dark age. And communism, like Karl Marx once said, would be a haunting spectre lingering in limbo.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Xi Jinping during a speech in 2018[443]\n\nXi has supported greater CCP control over the PRC, saying \"government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west \u2013 the party leads them all\".[444] During the 100th anniversary of the CCP in 2021, he said that \"without the Communist Party of China, there would be no new China and no national rejuvenation\", and that \"the leadership of the Party is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and constitutes the greatest strength of this system\".[445] He has said that China, despite many setbacks, has achieved great progress under the CCP, saying that \"socialism with Chinese characteristics has become the standard-bearer of 21st-century socialist development\".[443] However, he has also warned that it will take a long time for China under the CCP to complete its rejuvenation, and during this timeframe, party members must be vigilant to not let CCP rule collapse.[443]\n\n\nXi has ruled out a multi-party system for China, saying that \"constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentarism, a multi-party system and a presidential system, we considered them, tried them, but none worked\".[446] However, Xi considers China to be a democracy, saying that \"China's socialist democracy is the most comprehensive, genuine and effective democracy\".[447] China's definition of democracy is different from liberal democracies and is rooted in Marxism\u2013Leninism, and is based on the phrases \"people's democratic dictatorship\" and \"democratic centralism\".[447] Xi has additionally coined the term \"whole-process people's democracy\" which he said was about having \"the people as masters\".[448] Foreign analysts and observers have widely disputed that China is a democracy, saying that it is a one-party authoritarian state and Xi an authoritarian leader.[455] Some observers, including German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock,[456] have called Xi a dictator, citing the large centralisation of power around him unseen compared to his predecessors.[457][458] Xi has additionally rejected Westernisation as the only way to modernize, instead promoting what he says is \"Chinese-style modernisation\".[459] He has identified five concepts as part of Chinese-style modernisation, including modernisation of a huge population, common prosperity, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development.[460]\n\n\n\n#### Xi Jinping Thought[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping Thought\n\n![](image)A billboard promoting Xi Jinping Thought in Shenzhen\nIn September 2017, the CCP Central Committee decided that Xi's political philosophies, generally referred to as \"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\", would become part of the Party Constitution.[461][462] Xi first made mention of the \"Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\" in his opening day speech delivered to the 19th Party Congress in October 2017. His Politburo Standing Committee colleagues, in their own reviews of Xi's keynote address at the Congress, prepended the name \"Xi Jinping\" in front of \"Thought\".[463] On 24 October 2017, at its closing session, the 19th Party Congress approved the incorporation of Xi Jinping Thought into the Constitution of the CCP,[104] while in March 2018, the National People's Congress changed the state constitution to include Xi Jinping Thought.[464]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Governance of China* in different languages presented at Shanghai Library\nXi himself has described the Thought as part of the broad framework created around socialism with Chinese characteristics, a term coined by Deng Xiaoping that places China in the primary stage of socialism. In official party documentation and pronouncements by Xi's colleagues, the Thought is said to be a continuation of Marxism\u2013Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, as part of a series of guiding ideologies that embody \"Marxism adopted to Chinese conditions\" and contemporary considerations.[463] It has additionally been described as the \"21st century Marxism\" by two professors in the Central Party School of the CCP.[16] Wang Huning, a top political adviser and a close ally of Xi, has been described as pivotal to developing Xi Jinping Thought.[16] The concepts and context behind Xi Jinping Thought are elaborated in Xi's *The Governance of China* book series, published by the Foreign Languages Press for an international audience. Volume one was published in September 2014, followed by volume two in November 2017.[465]\n\n\nAn app for teaching Xi Jinping Thought had become the most popular smartphone app in China in 2019, as the country's ruling CCP launched a new campaign that calls on its cadres to immerse themselves in the political doctrine every day. *Xuexi Qiangguo* is now the most downloaded item on Apple's domestic App Store, surpassing in demand social media apps such as WeChat and TikTok.[466] In 2021, the government included Xi Jinping Thought in the curriculum including to students from primary schools to university, which created pushback from parents. For much of the preceding 30 years, political ideology and communist doctrine were not a standard taught in Chinese schools until middle school, and textbooks featured a wider set of Chinese leaders with less emphasis on a single leader like Xi.[467]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping, Peng Liyuan and U.S. president Barack Obama in the Lincoln Bedroom\nXi's first marriage was to Ke Lingling, the daughter of Ke Hua, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s. They divorced within a few years.[468] The two were said to fight \"almost every day\", and after the divorce Ke moved to England.[8] In 1987, Xi married the prominent Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan.[469] Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques.[470] Peng Liyuan, a household name in China, was better known to the public than Xi until his political elevation. The couple frequently lived apart due largely to their separate professional lives. Peng has played a much more visible role as China's \"first lady\" compared to her predecessors; for example, Peng hosted U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama on her high-profile visit to China in March 2014.[471]\n\n\nXi and Peng have a daughter named Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University in the spring of 2015. While at Harvard, she used a pseudonym and studied Psychology and English.[472] Xi's family has a home in Jade Spring Hill, a garden and residential area in north-western Beijing run by the CMC.[473]\n\n\nIn June 2012, *Bloomberg News* reported that members of Xi's extended family have substantial business interests, although there was no evidence he had intervened to assist them.[474] The *Bloomberg* website was blocked in mainland China in response to the article.[475] Since Xi embarked on an anti-corruption campaign, *The New York Times* reported members of his family were selling their corporate and real estate investments beginning in 2012.[476] Relatives of highly placed Chinese officials, including seven current and former senior leaders of the Politburo of the CCP, have been named in the Panama Papers, including Deng Jiagui,[477] Xi's brother-in-law. Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became general secretary of the CCP in November 2012.[478]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\nPeng described Xi as hardworking and down-to-earth: \"When he comes home, I've never felt as if there's some leader in the house. In my eyes, he's just my husband.\"[479] In 1992, *The Washington Post* journalist Lena H. Sun had an interview with Xi, then CCP secretary of Fuzhou; Sun described Xi as considerably more at ease and confident than many officials his age, and said that he talked without consulting notes.[480] He was described in a 2011 *The Washington Post* article by those who know him as \"pragmatic, serious, cautious, hard-working, down to earth and low-key\". He was described as a good hand at problem solving and \"seemingly uninterested in the trappings of high office\".[481]\n\n\n\n## Public life[edit]\n\n\nIt is hard to gauge the opinion of the Chinese public on Xi, as no independent surveys exist in China and social media is heavily censored.[482] However, he is believed to be widely popular in the country.[483][484] According to a 2014 poll co-sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, Xi ranked 9 out of 10 in domestic approval ratings.[485] A YouGov poll released in July 2019 found that about 22% of people in mainland China list Xi as the person they admire the most, a plurality, although this figure was less than 5% for residents of Hong Kong.[486] In the spring of 2019, the Pew Research Center made a survey on confidence on Xi Jinping among six-country medians based on Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines and South Korea, which indicated that a median 29% have confidence in Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs, meanwhile a median of 45% have no confidence; these numbers are slightly higher than those of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (23% confidence, 53% no confidence).[487] A poll by Politico and Morning Consult in 2021 found that 5% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Xi, 38% unfavorable, 17% no opinion and 40%, a plurality, never hearing of him.[488]\n\n\nIn 2017, *The Economist* named him the most powerful person in the world.[489] In 2018, *Forbes* ranked him as the most powerful and influential person in the world, replacing Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been ranked so for five consecutive years.[490] Since 2013, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Xi among the list of press freedom predators.[491]\n\n\nUnlike previous Chinese leaders, Chinese state media has given a more encompassing view of Xi's private life, although still strictly controlled. According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi would swim one kilometer and walk every day as long as there was time, and is interested in foreign writers, especially Russian.[420] He is known to love films and TV shows such as *Saving Private Ryan*, *The Departed,* *The Godfather* and *Game of Thrones,*[492][493][494] also praising the independent film-maker Jia Zhangke.[495] The Chinese state media has also cast him as a fatherly figure and a man of the people, determined to stand up for Chinese interests.[418]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Decoration\n | Country/Organisation\n | Date\n | Note\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | The Golden Olympic Order | ![](image)\u00a0International Olympic Committee | 19 November 2013\n | The highest award of the Olympic movement\n | [496] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 30 March 2014\n | The highest order of Belgium\n | [497] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of the Liberator | ![](image)\u00a0Venezuela | 20 July 2014\n | The highest order of Venezuela\n | [498] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed | ![](image)\u00a0Cuba | 22 July 2014\n | Order of Cuba\n | [499] |\n| ![](image) | Nishan-e-Pakistan | ![](image)\u00a0Pakistan | 21 April 2015\n | The highest civilian award of Pakistan\n | [500] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Abdulaziz al Saud | ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | 19 January 2016\n | Saudi Arabian order of merit\n | [501] |\n| ![](image) | Collar of the Order of the Republic of Serbia | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia | 18 June 2016\n | The highest state order of Serbia\n | [502] |\n| ![](image) | Order for Promotion of Peace and Friendship | ![](image)\u00a0Belarus | 29 September 2016\n | Order of Belarus\n | [503] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross Medal of Honor\n | ![](image)\u00a0Peru | 21 November 2016\n | Medal of Peru\n | [504] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Saint Andrew | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 3 July 2017\n | The highest order of Russia\n | [505] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Collar of the State of Palestine | ![](image)\u00a0Palestine | 18 July 2017\n | The highest civilian order of Palestine\n | [506] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Zayed | ![](image)\u00a0United Arab Emirates | 20 July 2018\n | The highest civilian decoration of the United Arab Emirates\n | [507] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion | ![](image)\u00a0Senegal | 29 July 2018\n | Order of Senegal\n | [508] |\n| ![](image) | Collar of the Order of the Liberator General San Martin | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | 2 December 2018\n | Order of Argentina\n | [509] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Manas | ![](image)\u00a0Kyrgyzstan | 13 June 2019\n | The highest order of Kyrgyzstan\n | [510] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Crown | ![](image)\u00a0Tajikistan | 15 June 2019\n | Order of Tajikistan\n | [511] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Golden Eagle | ![](image)\u00a0Kazakhstan | 14 September 2022\n | The highest order of Kazakhstan\n | [512] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Friendship | ![](image)\u00a0Uzbekistan | 15 September 2022\n | State award of Uzbekistan\n | [513] |\n|  | Order of South Africa | ![](image)\u00a0South Africa | 22 August 2023\n | State award of South Africa\n | [514] |\n\n\n### Key to the City[edit]\n\n\nXi holds a \"key to the city\", an honor granted to attending guests to symbolize their significance, in:\n\n\n\n* ![](image)![Iowa](image) Muscatine, Iowa, United States (26 April 1985)[515][516]\n* ![](image) Montego Bay, Jamaica (13 February 2009)[48]\n* ![](image)![](image) Muscatine, Iowa, United States (14 February 2012)[515]\n* ![](image)![](image)\u00a0San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica (3 June 2013)[517]\n* ![](image)![](image)\u00a0Mexico City, Mexico (5 June 2013)[518]\n* ![](image)![](image)\u00a0Buenos Aires, Argentina (19 July 2014)[519]\n* ![](image)![](image)\u00a0Prague, Czech Republic (29 March 2016)[520]\n* ![](image)![Madrid](image) Madrid, Spain (28 November 2018)[521]\n\n\n### Honorary doctorates[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Nazarbayev University (7 September 2013)[522]\n* ![](image) University of Johannesburg (11 April 2019)[523]\n* ![](image) Saint Petersburg State University (6 June 2019)[524]\n* ![](image) King Saud University (8 December 2022)[525]\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* Xi, Jinping (1999). *Theory and Practice on Modern Agriculture*.

He served as the 11th president of Pakistan from 2008 to 2013, the first president born after Independence. He is the widower of twice-elected Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto. He has been a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan since August 2018.\n\n\nThe son of Hakim Ali Zardari, a landowner from Sindh, Zardari rose to prominence after his marriage to Benazir Bhutto in 1987, who became the Prime Minister of Pakistan after her election in 1988. When Bhutto's government was dismissed by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1990, Zardari was widely criticized for involvement in corruption scandals that led to its collapse.[5][6] When Bhutto was reelected in 1993, Zardari served as Federal Investment Minister and Chairperson of Pakistan Environmental Protection Council. Following increasing tensions between Bhutto's brother Murtaza and Zardari, Murtaza was killed by police in Karachi on 20 September 1996.[7][8] Bhutto's government was dismissed a month later by President Farooq Leghari, while Zardari was arrested and indicted for Murtaza's murder as well as corruption charges.[9][10]\n\n\nAlthough incarcerated, he nominally served in Parliament after being elected to the National Assembly in 1990 and Senate in 1997. He was released from jail in 2004 and went into self-exile to Dubai, but returned when Bhutto was assassinated on 27 December 2007. As the new co-chairman of the PPP, he led his party to victory in the 2008 general elections. He spearheaded a coalition that forced military ruler Pervez Musharraf to resign, and was elected president on 6 September 2008. He was acquitted of various criminal charges the same year.[11][7] When NAB try to arrest Hakam Ali Zardari, the father of Asif Ali Zardari, he approached Barrister Ijaz Hussain Batalvi to engage him as his Lawyer against NAB prosecution and Mr.Batalvi smiling ready to ask him if he get permission from his daughter in law (Benazir Bhutto) and he never came back, it revealed by Akhtar Aly Kureshy Advocate, a follower of Ijaz Hussain Batalvi legacy.\n\n\nAs president, Zardari remained a strong American ally in the war in Afghanistan, despite prevalent public disapproval of the United States following the Raymond Davis incident and the NATO attack in Salala in 2011. Domestically, Zardari achieved the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 2010, which constitutionally reduced his presidential powers. His attempt to prevent the reinstatement of Supreme Court judges failed in the face of massive protests led by his political rival Nawaz Sharif. The restored Supreme Court dismissed the PPP's elected Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani for contempt in 2012 after Gillani refused to write to the Government of Switzerland to reopen corruption cases against Zardari. Zardari's tenure was also criticised for mishandling nationwide floods in 2010, and growing terrorist violence. Following multiple bombings of Hazaras in Quetta in early 2013, Zardari dismissed his provincial government in Balochistan.\n\n\nTowards the end of his term, Zardari recorded abysmally low approval ratings, ranging from 11 to 14%.[12][13] After the PPP was heavily defeated in the 2013 general election, Zardari became the country's first elected president to complete his constitutional term on 9 September 2013.[14] His legacy remains divisive, with political observers accusing his administration of corruption and cronyism.[15][16]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nZardari was born on 26 July 1955[17] in Karachi, Sindh[18][19] in the Zardari family. He is of Baloch origin, belonging to the Sindhi-speaking Zardari tribe.[17] He is the only son of Hakim Ali Zardari, a tribal chief and prominent landowner, and Bilquis Sultana Zardari.[18][20] His paternal grandmother was of Iraqi descent,[21] while his mother was the granddaughter of Hassan Ali Effendi, a Sindhi educationist who is known as the founder of the Sindh Madressatul Islam.[22][23][24]\n\n\nIn his youth, he enjoyed polo and boxing.[25] He led a polo team known as the Zardari Four.[26] His father owned Bambino[27]\u2014a famous cinema in Karachi\u2014and donated movie equipment to his school.[25] He also appeared in a 1969 movie, *Salgira*, as a child.[28] Zardari's academic background remains a question mark.[25] He received his primary education from Karachi Grammar School. His official biography says he graduated from Cadet College, Petaro in 1972.[17][25] He went to St Patrick's High School, Karachi from 1973 to 1974; a school clerk says he failed his final examination there.[25] In March 2008, he claimed he had graduated from the London School of Business Studies with a bachelor of education degree in the early 1970s.[27] Zardari's official biography states he also attended Pedinton School in Britain.[25][27][29] His British education, however, has not been confirmed, and a search did not turn up any Pedinton School in London.[25][27][29] The issue of his diploma was contentious because a 2002 rule required candidates for Parliament to hold a college degree,[27] but the rule was overturned by Pakistan's Supreme Court in April 2008.[25][29]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Early political career and Benazir Bhutto era\n\n[edit]\n\nZardari's initial political career was unsuccessful. In 1983, he lost an election for a district council seat in Nawabshah, a city of Sindh, where his family owned thousands of acres of farmland.[25] He then went into real estate.[25]\n\n\nHe married Benazir Bhutto on 18 December 1987.[30][31] The arranged marriage, done in accordance with Pakistani culture, was initially considered an unlikely match.[30][31] The lavish sunset ceremony in Karachi was followed by immense night celebrations that included over 100,000 people.[30][31] The marriage enhanced Bhutto's political position in a country where older unmarried women are frowned upon.[30][31] Zardari deferred to his wife's wishes by agreeing to stay out of politics.[31]\n\n\nIn 1988, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq died in a plane crash. A few months later, Bhutto became Pakistan's first female Prime Minister when her party won 94 of 207 seats contested in the 1988 elections.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Involvement in the first Bhutto Administration and first imprisonment\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Corruption charges against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari\n\n![](image)Zardari, Benazir Bhutto, and baby Bilawal in a state visit to Andrews Air Force Base in 1989\nHe generally stayed out of his wife's first administration, but he and his associates became entangled in corruption cases linked to the government.[5] He was largely blamed for the collapse of the Bhutto administration.[6]\n\n\nAfter the dismissal of Bhutto's government in August 1990,[32] Benazir Bhutto and Zardari were prohibited from leaving the country by security forces under the direction of the Pakistan Army.[33] During the interim government between August and October, caretaker Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, a Bhutto rival, initiated investigations of corruption by the Bhutto administration.[34] Jatoi accused Zardari of using his wife's political position to charge a ten percent commission for obtaining permission to set up any project or to receive loans.[34] He was tagged with the nickname \"Mr. Ten Percent\".[25]\n\n\nHe was arrested on 10 October 1990 on charges relating to kidnapping and extortion.[32][35] The charges alleged an extortion scheme that involved tying a supposed bomb to a British businessman's leg.[25] The Bhutto family considered the indictment politically motivated and fabricated.[35] In the October 1990 elections, he was elected to the National Assembly while in jail.[36] Bhutto and the PPP staged a walkout from the inaugural session of the National Assembly to protest Zardari's incarceration.[36] He posted $20,000 bail, but his release was blocked by a government ordinance that removed a court's power to release suspects being tried in the terrorist court, which fast-track trials for alleged terrorists.[6] The ordinance was later revoked and a special court acquitted him of bank fraud and conspiracy to murder political opponents.[6] He was freed in February 1993.[6] In March 1994, Zardari was acquitted of bank fraud charges.[37] All other corruption charges relating to Bhutto's first term were dropped or thrown out of the courts.[38]\n\n\nOn 25 March 1991, the hijackers aboard Singapore Airlines Flight 117 demanded Zardari's release among other demands. The hijackers were killed by Singapore Commandos.\n\n\n\n### Political involvement in the second Bhutto Administration\n\n[edit]\n\nIn April 1993, he became one of the 18 cabinet ministers in the caretaker government that succeeded Nawaz Sharif's first abridged premiership.[39] The caretaker government lasted until the July elections.[39] After Bhutto's election, he served as her Investment Minister,[38][40] chief of the intelligence bureau,[38] and the head of the Federal Investigation Agency.[38] In February 1994, Benazir sent Zardari to meet with Saddam Hussein in Iraq to deliver medicine in exchange for three detained Pakistanis arrested on the ambiguous Kuwait-Iraq border.[41] In April 1994, Zardari denied allegations that he was wielding unregulated influence as a spouse and acting as \"de-facto Prime Minister\".[42][43] In March 1995, he was appointed chairman of the new Environment Protection Council.[44][45]\n\n\nDuring the beginning of the second Bhutto Administration, a Bhutto family feud between Benazir and her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, surfaced over the political future of Murtaza Bhutto, Nusrat's son and Benazir's younger brother.[46] Benazir thanked Zardari for his support.[46] In September 1996, Murtaza and seven others died in a shootout with police in Karachi, while the city was undergoing a three-year civil war.[47][48] At Murtaza's funeral, Nusrat accused Benazir and Zardari of being responsible and vowed to pursue prosecution.[38][47] Ghinwa Bhutto, Murtaza's widow, also accused Zardari of being behind his killing.[38][49] President Farooq Leghari, who would dismiss the Bhutto government seven weeks after Murtaza's death, also suspected Benazir and Zardari's involvement.[38] Several of Pakistan's leading newspapers alleged that Zardari wanted his brother-in-law out of the way because of Murtaza's activities as head of a breakaway faction of the PPP.[38]\n\n\nIn November 1996, Bhutto's government was dismissed by Leghari primarily because of corruption and Murtaza's death.[38] Zardari was arrested in Lahore while attempting to flee the country to Dubai.[38][48]\n\n\n\n## Jail and exile\n\n[edit]\n\n### *The New York Times* report\n\n[edit]\n\nA major report was published in January 1998 by *The New York Times* detailing Zardari's vast corruption and misuse of public funds.[50] The report discussed $200 million in kickbacks to Zardari and a Pakistani partner for a $4 billion contract with French military contractor Dassault Aviation, in a deal that fell apart only when the Bhutto government was dismissed.[50] It contained details of two payments of $5 million each by a gold bullion dealer in return for a monopoly on gold imports.[50] It had information from Pakistani investigators that the Bhutto family had allegedly accrued more than $1.5 billion in illicit profits through kickbacks in virtually every sphere of government activity.[50] It also reported Zardari's mid-1990s spending spree, which included hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on jewellery.[50] The arrangements made by the Bhutto family for their wealth relied on Western property companies, Western lawyers, and a network of Western friends.[50] The report described how Zardari had arranged secret contracts, painstaking negotiations, and the dismissal of anyone who objected to his dealings.[50]\n\n\nCitibank, already under fire for its private-banking practices, got into further trouble as a result of the report.[51] Zardari's financial history was one case study in a 1999 U.S. Senate report on vulnerabilities in banking procedures.[52]\n\n\n\n### Second imprisonment and conviction\n\n[edit]\n\nIn March 1997, Zardari was elected to the Senate while in a Karachi jail.[53][54] In December 1997, he was flown to Islamabad under tight security to take his oath.[53]\n\n\nIn July 1998, he was indicted for corruption in Pakistan after the Swiss government handed over documents to Pakistani authorities relating to money laundering.[55] The Swiss had also indicted him for money laundering.[55] At the same time, in a separate case, he and 18 others were indicted for conspiracy to murder Murtaza Bhutto.[56] After criminal prosecutions began, Citibank closed Zardari's account.[51]\n\n\nIn April 1999, Bhutto and Zardari were convicted for receiving indemnities from a Swiss goods inspection company that was hired to end corruption in the collection of customs duties.[57] The couple received a fine of $8.6 million.[57][58] Both were also sentenced to five years imprisonment, but Bhutto could not be extradited back to Pakistan from her self-imposed exile.[57][58] Zardari was already in jail awaiting trial on separate charges.[57][58] The evidence used against them had been gathered by Swiss investigators and the Pakistani Bureau of Accountability.[57][59]\n\n\nIn May 1999, he was hospitalised after an alleged attempted suicide.[60] He claimed it was a murder attempt by the police.[60]\n\n\nIn August 2003, a Swiss judge convicted Bhutto and Zardari of money laundering and sentenced them to six months imprisonment and a fine of $50,000.[61] In addition, they were required to return $11 million to the Pakistani government.[61] The conviction involved charges relating to kickbacks from two Swiss firms in exchange for customs fraud.[62] In France, Poland, and Switzerland, the couple faced additional allegations.[63]\n\n\nIn November 2004, he was released on bail by court order.[64][65][66] A month later, he was unexpectedly arrested for failing to show up for a hearing on a murder case in Islamabad.[64][65][66] He was placed under house arrest in Karachi.[64][66] A day later, he was released on $5,000 bail.[64][65] His release, rearrest, and then release again was regarded as a sign of growing reconciliation between Musharraf's government and the PPP.[64][65] After his second release in late 2004, he left for exile in Dubai.[25][67]\n\n\n\n### Exile and legal problems\n\n[edit]\n\nHe returned to Lahore in April 2005.[67][68][69] Police prevented him from holding rallies by escorting him from the airport to his home.[67][68][69] He criticised Musharraf's government, but rumours of reconciliation between Musharraf and the PPP grew.[68][69] Zardari went back to Dubai in May 2005.[70][71]\n\n\nIn June 2005, he had a heart attack and was treated in the United Arab Emirates.[70][71] A PPP spokesman stated he underwent angioplasty in the United States.[71] In September 2005, he did not show up for a Rawalpindi hearing on corruption charges; the court issued an arrest warrant.[71] His lawyers stated he could not come because he was recovering from his treatment.[71] Following a request by the Rawalpindi court, Interpol issued a red notice in January 2006 against the couple which called on member nations to decide on the couple's extradition.[72][73]\n\n\nWhen Bhutto announced in September 2007 her upcoming return to Pakistan, her husband was in New York City undergoing medical treatment.[74] After the October 2007 bombing in Karachi that tainted Bhutto's return, he accused Pakistani intelligence services of being behind the attacks and claimed \"it was not done by militants\".[75][76] He had not accompanied Bhutto, staying in Dubai with their daughters. Bhutto called for the removal of the chief investigator of the attacks because she claimed he had been involved in Zardari's alleged torture in prison in 1999.[77]\n\n\nIn November 2007, Musharraf instituted emergency rule for six weeks (see Pakistani state of emergency, 2007),[78] under the pretext of rising Islamist militancy, a few days after Bhutto's departure for Dubai to meet with Zardari.[79][80] Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai.[79][81] Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S.-backed proposal\u2014the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)\u2014to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan.[79][80] Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition of martial law.[79][80][81] Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters.[79][80]\n\n\nIn the midst of his exile, Zardari had several different legal problems. In Pakistan, Musharraf granted him amnesty for his alleged offences through the National Reconciliation Ordinance, drafted in October 2007.[62] However, the ordinance faced mounting public pressure and an uncompromising judiciary.[62] In addition, it only dealt with charges up to 1999.[62] This left open the possibility of investigations into his alleged involvement in about $2 million in illegal kickbacks to Saddam Hussein, discovered in October 2005, under the oil-for-food program.[62] If the ordinance was rescinded, he would have had to deal with charges relating to evading duties on an armoured BMW, commissions from a Polish tractor manufacturer, and a kickback from a gold bullion dealer.[62] In Switzerland, Bhutto and Zardari appealed the 2003 Swiss conviction, which required the reopening of the case in October 2007.[62] In November 2007, Swiss authorities returned the frozen $60 million to him through offshore companies because of the National Reconciliation Ordinance.[82] In Spain, a criminal investigation was opened over the money laundering for the oil-for-food program because of the illicit profits handled through Spanish firms.[62] In Britain, he was fighting a civil case against the Pakistani government for the proceeds from the liquidation sale of a Surrey mansion.[62] He successfully used his medical diagnosis to postpone a verdict on his British manor trial.[83][84][85]\n\n\nIn exile, he shifted between homes in New York, London, and Dubai, where his three children lived.[25]\n\n\nOn the night of 27 December 2007, he returned to Pakistan following his wife's assassination.[86]\n\n\n\n## Co-chairperson of the PPP\n\n[edit]\n\n### Bhutto's assassination and succession\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Assassination of Benazir Bhutto\n\nZardari prevented Bhutto's autopsy in accordance with Islamic principles.[87][88] He and their children attended her funeral, which was held the next day.[89] He denied government allegations that the assassination was sponsored by Al-Qaida.[87][90] He called for an international inquiry into her death and stated that she would still be alive if Musharraf's government had provided adequate protection.[88][91][92] He and his family offered to accept Musharraf's demand to exhume Bhutto's body in exchange for a United Nations inquiry, but Musharraf rejected the proposal.[93]\n\n\nIn Bhutto's political will, she had designated Zardari her successor as party leader.[87][90][94] However, their nineteen-year-old son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, became Chairman of the PPP because Zardari favoured Bilawal to represent Bhutto's legacy, in part to avoid division within the party due to his own unpopularity.[87][90][95] He did, however, serve as co-chairman of the PPP for at least three years until Bilawal completed his studies overseas.[87][94][95]\n\n\n\n### February parliamentary elections and coalition formation\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2008 Pakistani general election\n\nZardari called for no delays to the 8 January parliamentary elections and for the participation of all opposition parties.[87] Other major political parties quickly agreed to participate, ending any chance of a boycott.[87][88] Because of the turmoil after the Bhutto assassination, the elections were postponed six weeks to 18 February.[88][96] In January 2008, he suggested that if his party did win a majority, it might form a coalition with Musharraf's Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q).[96][97] He and Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) party (PML-N), threatened national protests if any vote-rigging was attempted.[97][98] He himself could not run for Parliament because he had not filed election papers in November 2008, back when he had no foreseeable political ambition while Bhutto was alive.[99]\n\n\nThe PPP and the PML-N won the largest and second largest number of seats respectively in the February elections.[99][100] He and Sharif agreed to form a coalition government, ending American hopes of a power-sharing deal between him and Musharraf.[99][100] They agreed to restore the judiciary, but Zardari took a less stringent stance than Sharif.[100][101] He met with U.S. ambassador Anne W. Patterson, who pushed for a pact with Musharraf.[100] To strengthen the new coalition, he reached out to Awami National Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, and Baloch nationalist leaders, who had all boycotted the elections.[102][103]\n\n\nAfter weeks of speculation and party infighting, he said he did not want to become Prime Minister.[103][104][105] In mid-March 2008, he chose Yousaf Raza Gillani for Prime Minister in a snub to the more politically powerful Makhdoom Amin Fahim.[105]\n\n\n\n### Coalition government\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf\n\nHe and Sharif agreed in a 9 March 2008 agreement, known as the Murree Declaration, to the reinstatement by 30 April 2008 of 60 judges previously sacked by Musharraf.[106][107] The deadline was later extended to 12 May.[106] He and Sharif held unsuccessful talks at London in May.[106][108] After the coalition failed to restore the judiciary, the PML-N withdrew from the government in mid-May, pulling its ministers out of the cabinet.[106][107][108][109][110] The coalition regrouped, again with the PML-N, and proposed a constitutional amendment that would remove the power of the President to dismiss Parliament.[107][109][110] By late May, the coalition was set in a confrontation with Musharraf.[109][110] At the same time, the government was successful in getting Pakistan readmitted to the Commonwealth.[111]\n\n\nHe and Sharif met in Lahore in June 2008 to discuss Musharraf's removal and the constitutional amendments, which the PML-N viewed as not going far enough to fulfill the Murree declaration.[107][112] He opposed impeachment calls because he claimed the coalition did not have the two-thirds majority in both legislative bodies\u2014National Assembly and Senate.[107][112] He was unwilling to restore the judiciary as divisions in the coalition grew and popular sentiment shifted towards Sharif.[113][114] The coalition criticised the government for barring Sharif from competing in the June by-elections.[113][114][115] Because of the impasses over Musharraf and the judiciary, the coalition could not address rising food shortages and spiraling inflation, which was the highest in 30 years.[107]\n\n\nIn August 2008, Zardari relented, and the coalition agreed to proceed full speed towards Musharraf's impeachment by drafting a charge-sheet against him.[116][117] The coalition charged him with high treason for the 1999 coup and the imposition of martial law.[116] He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and the coalition selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.[117][118] On 18 August, Musharraf resigned in order to avoid impeachment.[119][120][121][122] Although Zardari favoured granting Musharraf immunity from prosecution, the coalition could not agree on a decision.[119][120][122] The coalition also could not reach a united stance on the future of the judiciary.[119][120][121][122]\n\n\n\n### Rise to presidency\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 2008 Pakistani presidential election\n\nPresidential elections were held within three weeks after the departure of Musharraf.[123] Zardari vowed to pursue an unpopular campaign against tribal militancy in Pakistan and had the support of the United States.[123][124][125] He claimed he had a London business school degree to satisfy a prerequisite for the presidency, but his party did not produce a certificate.[126] He was endorsed by the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) for the presidency.[127] The PML-N nominated former justice Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddiqui, while the PML-Q put forth Mushahid Hussain Sayed.[128][129] Zardari won a majority in the Electoral College with 481 of 702 votes.[election 1][123][129][130][131] He was elected president on 6 September 2008.[election 2][132][133]\n\n\n\n## President of Pakistan\n\n[edit]\n\n### Initial days\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Zardari with Emomali Rahmon, Dmitry Medvedev and Hamid Karzai\nAt the inauguration on 9 September 2008, Afghan President Hamid Karzai was a guest of honour, which was a signal for much closer cooperation between the two nations in addressing the tribal insurgency along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border.[134][135] After the election, Zardari promised to approve the constitutional provision that removed the President's power to dismiss Parliament, but public scepticism remained on whether he would actually carry out his promise.[123] His economic competence was questioned after allegations that he had raised grain procurement prices through inflationary subsidies and scrapped the capital gains tax.[136] His first parliamentary speech was overshadowed by 20 September Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing.[137][138][139] A few days later, he went to the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on his first overseas trip as president.[140]\n\n\n\n![](image)Zardari and Bush meeting in 2008.\n### United Nations visit\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Pakistan and the United Nations\n\nFrom 23 to 26 September 2008, he met with various foreign leaders, including U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao.[141][142][143] He suffered political embarrassment by flirting with U.S. vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and making tongue-in-cheek comments about her.[144][145][146][147] Although, at the United Nations General Assembly, he publicly condemned U.S drone attacks in Pakistan,[148] *The Washington Post* reported that he had signed a \"secret deal\" when he met with senior American officials that arranged for the coordination of Predator strikes and a jointly approved list of prominent targets.[149][150] He and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agreed to resume peace talks by the end of 2008.[151]\n\n\n\n### Economic crises\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Periods of stagflation in Pakistan\n\nFrom 14 to 17 October 2008, he was in China[152][153] to negotiate foreign aid, as Pakistan faced the possibility of defaulting on its payments.[154] China refused to offer any aid commitments, but instead promised to provide assistance in the development of two nuclear power plants and more future business investments.[152][154]\n\n\nAfter Saudi Arabia, Britain, China, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates refused to provide any bailout,[155] he officially asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance in solving Pakistan's balance of payments problem on 22 October.[156]\n\n\nHe went to Saudi Arabia from 4 to 6 November in hopes of obtaining financial aid and securing trade agreements.[157][158] However, leaked cables revealed increasingly strained relations between Zardari and Saudi royalty, primarily because of Saudi distrust of Zardari and preference for Sharif.[159][160][161] Weaker cooperation led to decreased oil subsidies as part of a broader Saudi policy of withholding monetary assistance.[159][161]\n\n\nIn mid-November 2008, Zardari's government officially sent a letter of intent to the IMF regarding a bailout to help increase its foreign exchange reserves.[162] In a $11.3 billion multi-year loan package, Pakistan received a $7.4 billion loan for 2008\u201310.[163][164] The IMF stipulated stringent reform conditions, which included rebuilding the tax structure and privatising state enterprises.[164] The World Bank and Asian Development Bank withheld a combined $3 billion aid in the 2010\u201311 fiscal year and the IMF withheld since May 2010 the last segment of its aid package.[164]\n\n\nIn January 2011, the MQM withdrew from the government.[165][166] Zardari's ruling coalition averted a government collapse by accepting the opposition's economic proposals, which restored gas subsidies and abandoned many of the IMF's suggested reforms.[election 3][165]\n\n\nIn an effort to curb government expenditures, Zardari swore in an \"austerity cabinet\" in February 2011 which reduced the cabinet from 60 ministers to 22.[167]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Relationship with India\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Indo-Pakistani relations\n\nIn early October 2008, he received fierce domestic criticism for repeatedly calling Kashmiri nationalists (see Kashmir conflict) in India \"terrorists\".[168][169] In mid-November 2008, he suggested Pakistan was ready for a no-first-use nuclear policy and called for closer economic ties.[162][170]\n\n\nThe relationship between the two nations was damaged by the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. He initially denied any links between the perpetrators and Pakistan,[171] but the government soon pursued military action against Lashkar-e-Taiba leaders in a 7 December raid.[172][173] India cleared Zardari's government of any direct involvement in the attacks, but simultaneously demanded the extradition of 20 Pakistanis which it alleged had taken part in them.[174] Zardari offered to send Inter-Services Intelligence Director-General Ahmed Shuja Pasha to assist in the investigation.[174]\n\n\nIn June 2009, Zardari met Singh for the first time since the Mumbai attacks at a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Yekaterinburg, Russia.[175]\n\n\nOn 8 April 2012, President Zardari, along with his son Bilawal Zardari Bhutto, visited Dargah Sharif in Ajmer, India on a private visit. He also met with the Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.[176][177]\n\n\n\n#### War in Afghanistan\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan relations\n\n![](image)Vice President-Elect Joe Biden meets Zardari in January 2009\nThe government has had a longstanding conflict in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Pakistani regions bordering Afghanistan. Diplomatic relations with Afghan President Hamid Karzai improved after Musharraf's departure and Zardari's rise to power.[178] The Obama administration's AfPak policy, through AfPak envoy Richard Holbrooke, reflected the unified approach the United States took in dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan.[179]\n\n\nIn his first visit to Afghanistan as president in early January 2009, Zardari promised a renewed relationship to improve cooperation.[180][181] In late March, Obama announced a civilian aid package of $7.5 billion over five years in return for cooperation in the AfPak conflict.[182][183][184] In late April, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited Zardari and promised $1 billion over the next four years.[185] In May, Obama held a trilateral summit in Washington D.C., with Karzai and Zardari, where they discussed further cooperation.[186] At Brussels in mid-June, Zardari unsuccessfully sought trade concessions from the European Union; it instead pledged $90 million development aid to curtail tribal influence by insurgents.[187][188][189] After the U.S. Congress passed Obama's civilian aid package in October,[190][191] army generals in the Pakistani military establishment widened the growing rift with Zardari's government and openly criticised U.S. interference.[192][193]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamid Karzai, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Zardari after the Afghanistan-U.S.-Pakistan trilateral meeting in May 2009\nIn February 2009, FATA's provincial government officially declared Islamic law in Swat to achieve a ceasefire with the northwestern Pashtun tribes.[194] Because the United States and Britain opposed the measure,[195][196] Zardari did not sign the Swat ceasefire until mid-April, when domestic pressure from Parliament mounted.[194] By the end of April, the agreement collapsed as the Pakistani military pursued an unpopular offensive in the neighbouring Dir district.[197][198]\n\n\nIn September 2010, Zardari and Karzai met in Islamabad and both advocated fighting insurgents rather than trying to end the war with diplomacy.[199] Zardari went to the United States in January 2011 to attend Special Envoy Holbrooke's funeral.[200] Following Osama bin Laden's death in a compound in Abbottabad in May 2011, Obama called Zardari and collaborated on the events.[201]\n\n\n\n### Reinstatement of the judiciary\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Zardari and Hillary Clinton\nIn February 2009, Zardari and the Musharraf-appointed Supreme Court attempted to disqualify Nawaz Sharif from running in any elections[202] and tried to force his brother Shahbaz Sharif to resign as Chief Minister of Punjab province.[203][204][205] Zardari dismissed the Punjab provincial government[206] and only partially reinstated the judiciary by restoring 56 other judges deposed by Musharraf\u2014but not their former leader, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry.[207][208] After Nawaz Sharif defied house arrest and rallied with thousands of his supporters,[209] the Sharif brothers vowed to join forces with the Lawyers' Movement in the \"Long March\".[210][211] Zardari's government gave in to popular pressure[210] and Prime Minister Gilani in an early morning speech on 16 March 2009 promised to reinstate Chaudhry by 21 March.[212][213] Ten judges were reinstated on 16 March, and Chaudry assumed his position on 22 March.[214][215] Zardari's month-long direct control of the Punjab ended on 30 March.[182][215][216]\n\n\n\n### Nizam-e-Adl Regulation\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Nizam-e-Adl Regulation 2009\n\nIn April 2009, President Asif Ali Zardari signed the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation into law. The regulation formally established Sharia law in the Malakand division.[217]\n\n\n\n### Reduction of presidential powers\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan\n\nIn late November 2009, Zardari ceded to Prime Minister Gillani the chairmanship of the National Command Authority, Pakistan's nuclear arsenal oversight agency.[218][219]\n\n\nIn December 2009, the Supreme Court ruled that the National Reconciliation Ordinance amnesty was unconstitutional, which cleared the way for the revival of corruption cases against Zardari.[220] Although Zardari had immunity from prosecution because he was president,[82] the end of NRO and his earlier corruption cases challenged the legality of his presidency.[221] Calls for his resignation escalated.[222][223] Zardari, who rarely left the Aiwan-e-Sadr presidential palace,[224] responded with a nationwide spurt of speeches in January 2011.[225] In January 2010, the Supreme Court ordered Pakistan's government to reopen Zardari's corruption charges in Switzerland.[226][227] However, Zardari prevented the MQM-leaning Attorney General, Anwar Mansoor, from filing charges,[228] so Mansoor resigned in protest in early April.[229] That same month, Zardari won a key victory against the judiciary over his corruption trials when Geneva Attorney General Daniel Zappelli stated that Zardari can not be prosecuted under international laws because of his presidential immunity.[230][231] Zardari was supported by Prime Minister Gilani, who defied the Supreme Court order.[232]\n\n\nIn February 2010, Zardari sparked a standoff by attempting to appoint a Supreme Court candidate without the court's approval,[233] but the confrontation ended after he backed down and nominated a candidate acceptable by the court.[234]\n\n\nIn April 2010, after months of political pressure, the government passed the 18th Amendment, which reduced the President to a ceremonial figurehead by stripping the office of the power to dissolve Parliament, to dismiss the Prime Minister, and to appoint military chiefs.[235][236][237] The amendment also lifted the restriction of two terms as Prime Minister, which enabled Zardari's foremost political rival, Nawaz Sharif, to seek a third term.[235][236][238] The amendment was passed with virtually unanimous support in Parliament[237] and Zardari himself espoused the legislation because of political pressure.[236][238] After the 18th Amendment, Zardari's main power derived from his position as leader of the PPP, which controls the largest bloc in Parliament.[235][236]\n\n\nIn late September 2010, the Supreme Court considered removing presidential immunity.[239] In October, Chief Justice Chaudry met with his colleagues to discuss troubling media rumours that Zardari's government was planning to fire them; Chaudry requested government assurance that the stories were unfounded.[240] In early January 2011, Zardari signed the 19th Amendment, which lessened the likelihood of future clashes between the President and the judiciary by strengthening the power of the Chief Justice in deciding judicial appointments.[241][242]\n\n\nIn March 2011, Zardari delivered his annual parliamentary address to a half-empty chamber because of an opposition walkout.[243]\n\n\nIn November 2012, the Pakistan government in response to the court orders, finally wrote to the Swiss authorities seeking to reopen the corruption cases against Zardari.[244] The Swiss government responded by saying that the corruption cases being time-barred cannot be reopened.[245]\n\n\n\n### 2010 Pakistan floods and Europe tour\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2010 Pakistan floods began in late July with rain in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and soon submerged a fifth of Pakistan and affected 20 million people, resulting in one of the nation's largest natural catastrophes. Simultaneously, British Prime Minister David Cameron sparked a serious diplomatic row with Pakistan during his visit to India[246] by stating that elements within Pakistan were promoting the \"export of terror\" a week before a planned visit by Zardari to Britain.[247][248][249] Zardari ignored domestic pressure[250][251] and began his European trip in Paris on 1 August, meeting French President Sarkozy.[248][252][253] In France, he drew a rebuke from the U.S. after stating that NATO had \"lost the battle for hearts and minds\" in the Afghan war.[254][255][256] As the flood's devastation became increasingly evident, he was widely criticised for flying in a helicopter to his Normandy chateau[257][258][259] and dining at Cameron's Chequers countryside home.[260][261][262] Protests within Britain, mainly among the British Pakistani community, grew against his visit.[263][264] The widely expected maiden speech by his son Bilawal was cancelled,[265] as Zardari faced criticism for using the trip to advance Bilawal's political aspirations.[266]\n\n\nZardari returned to Pakistan on 10 August.[267] He first visit to an area affected by the flooding was in Sukkur on 12 August.[267] He cancelled the 14 August Independence Day celebrations and instead visited Naushera.[268] He flew over devastated areas with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on 15 August.[269] He left the country on 18 August and attended the four-way Russian summit at Sochi, which included Tajikistan and Afghanistan.[270] On 19 August, he visited Jampur with U.S. Senator John Kerry.[271][272] He ordered local authorities to concentrate efforts to save Shahdadkot from inundation on 24 August.[273]\n\n\n\n### 2011 Dubai hospitalisation\n\n[edit]\n\nIn early December 2011 Zardari flew to Dubai undergoing medical tests and treatment, reportedly for a \"small stroke\".[274] According to the prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, Zardari sought medical treatment outside of Pakistan because of \"threats to his life\".[275] He finds himself currently in the midst of the \"Memogate\" controversy.[275] Zardari left the hospital on 14 December to recuperate at the Persian Gulf, while his son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the chairman of Pakistan Peoples Party, assumed a more prominent role in Pakistan.[276]\nBy 19 December, Zardari had returned to Pakistan.[277]\n\n\n\n### China Pakistan Economic Corridor\n\n[edit]\n\nPakistan and China on 22 May 2013 inked several Agreements and Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) that mainly included the long-term Economic Corridor plan, maritime cooperation and satellite navigation.\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang witnessed the signing ceremony as the representatives of the two countries inked the documents at a ceremony held at the Aiwan-e-Sadr. The visit of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang marked the signing of important documents aimed at long-term cooperation between the two countries in multiple areas.[278]\n\n\n\n## Completion of presidential tenure\n\n[edit]\n\nZardari completed his five-year term on 8 September 2013,[279][280] becoming the first democratically elected president in the 66-year-long history of Pakistan to complete his tenure. He received a guard of honour while leaving the Aiwan-e-Sadr.[281] He was succeeded by Mamnoon Hussain as president.[282]\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency\n\n[edit]\n\nHe became active in the PPP, which he voted to revamp, after his presidency.[283] He succeeded Ameen Faheem as chairman of PPPP in 2015.[284] In December 2016, he announced that both he and his son Bilawal, would contest the 2018 general election.[285]\n\n\nIn July 2017, during the investigation of Panama Papers case, Zardari demanded Nawaz Sharif's resignation.[286] In August 2017, Pakistan's anti-corruption acquitted him from his last pending case in which he was accused along with his late wife, Benazir Bhutto, of laundering illegal kickbacks and maintaining assets beyond known sources of income. The case had dogged him for 19 years.[287][288] His rival Imran Khan believed that Zardari's acquittal was the result of a deal between PML-N and PPP. However he denied any kind of collaboration.[289] The National Accountability Bureau also challenged the acquittal.[290] On 2 September, after his wife's murder case verdict which declared Pervez Musharraf as fugitive and convicted two senior police officer, he said that he was not satisfied with the verdict and that he will appeal the judgment as it had acquitted five Pakistani Taliban suspects.[291] In 2019, he was arrested in Islamabad over a money laundering case.[292] An anti-graft court issued an indictment of Zardari on corruption charges on 10 August 2020.[293][294]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\n### Family\n\n[edit]\n\nZardari and Benazir Bhutto had one son and two daughters. His son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, is the current Chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party. His older daughter, Bakhtawar, was born on 25 January 1990,[295] and his younger daughter, Aseefa, was born on 3 February 1993.[296] After Benazir Bhutto's death, his sister Faryal Talpur became the guardian of his children[19] and he changed Bilawal Zardari's name to Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.[297][298]\n\n\nHis mother died in November 2002, during his detention in jail.[299] His father Hakim Ali Zardari died in May 2011.[300] After that he became the chieftain of the Zardari tribe. However, initially he had decided not to assume leadership and wanted to pass the position to his son Bilawal.[301][300]\n\n\n\n### Spirituality\n\n[edit]\n\nZardari is known to seek the advice of \"soothsayers and healers\", especially during times of political troubles. He has visited Prof. Ahmad Rafique Akhtar, a well-known Sufi scholar based in Gujar Khan who often counsels government officials and military leaders. During his presidency, he would consult with his then spiritual leader, Pir Mohammad Ejaz, about such matters as travel times, and animals were sacrificed during particularly trying periods.[302][303]\n\n\n\n### Health\n\n[edit]\n\nHis mental health has been a subject of controversy.[83][84] He has repeatedly claimed he was tortured while in prison.[304] He was diagnosed with dementia, major depressive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder from 2005 to 2007, which helped influence the verdict of one of his corruption trials.[83][84][85] He now claims he is completely healthy, with only high blood pressure and diabetes.[83][84]\n\n\n\n### Wealth\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2005, *Daily Pakistan* reported he was the second richest man in Pakistan with an estimated net worth of $1.8 billion.[305] He amassed great wealth while his wife was Prime Minister.[38] In 2007, he received $60 million in his Swiss bank account through offshore companies under his name.[82] He was reported to have estates in Surrey, West End of London, Manhattan (a condominium in Belaire Apartments), and Dubai,[26][38] as well as a 16th-century chateau in Normandy.[258] In Britain, he used a common legal device\u2014the purchase of property through nominees with no family link to the Bhuttos.[38] His homes in Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad are called Bilawal House I,[306] Bilawal House II,[307] and Zardari House[308] respectively.\n\n\n\n### Surrey estate\n\n[edit]\n\nHe bought a 365-acre (148-hectare) 20-bedroom luxury estate in Rockwood, Surrey in 1995 through a chain of firms, trusts, and offshore companies in 1994.[19][57][62][309][310] The country home's refurbishment abruptly ended in October 1996, shortly before the end of his wife's second term.[310] He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property and no one paid the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion.[62][309] Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004 and the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds because the home had been bought with money obtained through corruption.[62] However, he stepped in to claim that he actually was the beneficial owner.[26] As of November\u00a02008[update], the proceeds were in a liquidator bank account while a civil case continues.[62]\n\n\nThe estate includes two farms, lodgings, staff accommodation, and a basement made into an imitation of a local pub.[19][309] The manor has nine bedrooms and an indoor swimming pool.[310]\n\n\nHe had sent large shipments from Karachi in the 1990s for the refurbishment of Surrey Palace.[62] He has faced allegations from various people, including the daughter of Laila Shahzada,[311] that he acquired stolen art to decorate the palace.[310] He earlier had plans for a helipad, a nine-hole golf course, and a polo pony paddock.[62]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![flag](image)Pakistan portal\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* Singapore Airlines Flight 117, the hijackers demanded Zardari's release\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** The Electoral College is composed of the Senate, the National Assembly, and the four provincial assemblies. The parliamentary lower house National Assembly has 342 seats. The upper house Senate has 100 seats. The four provincial assemblies are Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan respectively. The assemblies have total of 1170 seats, but the number of Electoral College votes is 702 since provincial assembly votes are counted on a proportional basis. A person needs to win 352 votes to obtain a majority.\n2. **^** The President serves for five years.\n3. **^** In Pakistan, a government falls not by losing a majority but after a no-confidence vote.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Zardari elected PPPP president\". *Dunya News*. 27 December 2015.

A member of the Workers' Party, he previously served as the 35th president of Brazil from 2003 to 2010.[2]\n\n\nOf working-class origin, Lula migrated as a child from Pernambuco to S\u00e3o Paulo with his family. As a teenager, he began his career as a metalworker and became a trade unionist. During the military dictatorship in Brazil, he led major workers' strikes between 1978 and 1980, and helped start the Workers' Party in 1980, during Brazil's political opening. Lula was one of the main leaders of the Diretas J\u00e1 movement, which demanded democratic elections. In the 1986 Brazilian legislative election, he was elected as a federal deputy in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, with the most votes nationwide. He ran his first major campaign in the 1989 Brazilian presidential election, losing in the second round to Fernando Collor de Mello. He went on to lose two other presidential elections in 1994 and 1998 to Fernando Henrique Cardoso, before becoming president in the 2002 Brazilian presidential election, in which he defeated Jos\u00e9 Serra in the runoff. In 2006,\nhe was re-elected as president, defeating Geraldo Alckmin in the second round.[3]\n\n\nDescribed as left-wing,[4][5][6] his first presidency, which coincided with the first pink tide in the region, was marked by the consolidation of social welfare programs such as Bolsa Fam\u00edlia and Fome Zero, which propelled Brazil to leave the United Nations' Hunger Map.[7] During his two terms in office, he undertook radical reforms in the country, which eventually led to growth in GDP, reduction in public debt and inflation, and helping 20 million Brazilians escape poverty.[8] Poverty, inequality, illiteracy, unemployment, infant mortality, and child labor rates fell significantly, while the minimum wage and average income increased, and access to school, university, and health care was expanded. He also played a prominent role in foreign policy, both on a regional level (as part of the BRICS) and as part of global trade and environmental negotiations.[9] Lula was considered one of the most popular politicians in the history of Brazil, and was one of the most popular in the world while president.[10][11][12] Although popular, his first term was marked by notable scandals, such as the Mensal\u00e3o scandal and Esc\u00e2ndalo dos sanguessugas\u00a0[pt]. After the 2010 Brazilian general election, he was succeeded by his former Chief of Staff, Dilma Rousseff.[13]\n\n\nAfter his first presidency, Lula remained active in politics, and began giving lectures in Brazil and abroad. In 2016, he was appointed as Rousseff's Chief of Staff, but the appointment was suspended by the Supreme Federal Court.[14][15] In July 2017, Lula was convicted on charges of money laundering and corruption in a controversial trial that was later nullified in April 2021 by the Supreme Court Justices, due to the court lacking proper jurisdiction over his case.[16][17] Lula attempted to run in the 2018 Brazilian presidential election but was disqualified under Brazil's Ficha Limpa law.[18] Before the annulment of his cases, he was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison, and after an unsuccessful appeal, Lula was arrested in April 2018 and spent 580 days in jail, until being released in November 2019, when the Supreme Federal Court ruled that his imprisonment was unlawful.[19][20][21][22] In March 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal judge presiding over the case, Sergio Moro, who served as Minister of Justice and Public Security in the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro,[23] was biased,[24] and all of the cases Moro had brought against Lula were annulled in June 2021. Following the court ruling, Lula was legally allowed to make another run for president in the 2022 elections, defeating Bolsonaro in the runoff.[25] He became the first Brazilian president to have been elected to a third term, and the first to have defeated an incumbent president in an election. At age 77, he was sworn in on 1 January 2023, as the oldest Brazilian president at the time of inauguration.[26][27][4] A week later, the Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes was attacked in an invasion led by pro-Bolsonaro rioters; Lula condemned the attack.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nLuiz In\u00e1cio da Silva was born on 27 October 1945 (registered with a date of birth of 6 October 1945) in Caet\u00e9s (then a district of Garanhuns), located 250\u00a0km (150 miles) from Recife, capital of Pernambuco, a state in the Northeast of Brazil. He was the seventh of eight children of Aristides In\u00e1cio da Silva and Eur\u00eddice Ferreira de Melo, a couple of farmers who experienced the famine in one of the poorest parts of the agreste.[28] Two weeks after Lula's birth, his father moved to Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo, with Valdomira Ferreira de G\u00f3is, a cousin of Eur\u00eddice. He was raised Roman Catholic.[29] Lula's mother was of Portuguese and partial Italian descent.[30]\n\n\nIn December 1952, when Lula was seven years old, his mother moved the family to S\u00e3o Paulo to rejoin her husband. After a journey of 13 days in a *pau-de-arara* (open truck bed), they arrived in Guaruj\u00e1 and discovered that Aristides had formed a second family with Valdomira. Aristides's two families lived in the same house for some time, but they did not get along very well, and four years later, Eur\u00eddice moved with her children to a small room behind a bar in S\u00e3o Paulo. After that, Lula rarely saw his father, who died an alcoholic in 1978.[31]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLula has been married three times. In 1969, he married Maria de Lourdes, who died of hepatitis in 1971 while pregnant with their first son, who also died.[32] In 1974, Lula had a daughter, Lurian, with his then girlfriend, Miriam Cordeiro. The two were never married, and he only began participating in his daughter's life when she was already a young adult.[33] In 1974, Lula married Marisa Let\u00edcia Rocco Casa, a widow, with whom he then had three sons. He also adopted Marisa's son from her first marriage. Lula and Marisa remained married for 43 years, until her death on 2 February 2017 after a stroke.[34] Still in 2017, he met and started a relationship with Ros\u00e2ngela da Silva, known as Janja, but it only became public in 2019 while he was serving time in jail in Curitiba, Paran\u00e1, due to corruption charges that were later dropped.[35] Lula and Janja married on 18 May 2022.[36]\n\n\n\n## Education and work\n\n[edit]\n\nLula has had little formal education. He did not learn to read until he was ten years old[37] and quit school after the second grade to work and help his family. His first job at age 8 was still in Guaruj\u00e1 as a street vendor.[3] When he was 12, he worked as shoeshiner and street vendor in S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1960, when he was 14, he got his first formal job in a warehouse.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula da Silva lost part of his left little finger in a work-related accident when he was a metalworker in the late 1960s\nIn 1961, he started working as an apprentice of press operator while studying in a vocational course in a metallurgical industry that produced screws. In this period, Lula had his first contact with strike movements.[39] After the movement failed in the negotiations, Lula left the company for another metallurgical industry. There, age 19, he lost his left pinkie finger in an accident, while working as a press operator in the factory.[37] After the accident, he had to run to several hospitals before he received medical attention. This experience increased his interest in participating in the Workers' Union. Around that time, he became involved in union activities and held several important union posts.[38][40]\n\n\n\n## Union career\n\n[edit]\n\nInspired by his brother Frei Chico, Lula joined the labour movement when he worked at Villares Metals S.A\u00a0[pt], rising steadily through the ranks. He was elected in 1975, and reelected in 1978, as president of the Steel Workers' Union of S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo and Diadema. Both cities are located in the ABCD Region, home to most of Brazil's automobile manufacturing facilities, including Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz and others, and are among the most industrialized in the country. In the late 1970s, when Brazil was under military rule, Lula helped organize union activities, including major strikes. Labour courts found the strikes illegal, and Lula was jailed for a month. Due to this, and like other people imprisoned for political activities under the military government, Lula was awarded a lifetime pension after the fall of the military regime.[41]\n\n\n\n## Political career\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula speaking at the plenary of the Chamber of Deputies in 1989\nOn 10 February 1980, a group of academics, intellectuals, and union leaders, including Lula, founded the *Partido dos Trabalhadores* (PT) or Workers' Party, a left-wing party with progressive ideas created in the midst of Brazil's military government.\n\n\nIn 1982, he added the nickname Lula to his legal name.[42] In 1983, he helped found the Central \u00danica dos Trabalhadores (CUT) union association. In 1984, PT and Lula joined the popular *Diretas J\u00e1!* (*Direct [Elections] Now!*) campaign, demanding a direct popular vote for the next Brazilian presidential election. According to the 1967 constitution, Presidents were at that time elected by both Houses of Congress in joint session, with representatives of all State Legislatures; this was widely recognised as a mere sham as, since the March 1964 coup d'\u00e9tat, each \"elected\" President had been a retired general chosen in a closed military caucus. Lula and the PT supported the public demand for a change in the electoral system. But the campaign was defeated by a vote in Congress that rejected an amendment calling direct elections for the following year, and, in 1985, a civilian president, Tancredo Neves, was elected by the same indirect procedure, with Lula's support. Only four years later, as a direct result of *Diretas J\u00e1!* and after years of popular struggle, the 1989 elections were the first in 29\u00a0years to elect a president by direct popular vote.\n\n\n\n### Elections\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula and mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo Jos\u00e9 Serra, whom he defeated in the 2002 presidential elections\nLula first ran for office in 1982, for the state government of S\u00e3o Paulo, and lost. In the 1986 elections, Lula won a seat in Congress with the most votes nationwide.[43] The Workers' Party helped write the country's post-military government Constitution, ensuring strong constitutional guarantees for workers' rights, but failed to achieve a proposed push for agrarian reform in the Constitutional text. Under Lula's leadership, the PT took a stance against the Constitution in the 1988 Constituent Assembly, reluctantly agreeing to sign the agreed draft at a later stage.\n\n\nIn 1989, still as a Congressman, Lula ran as the PT candidate in the first democratic elections for president since 1960. Lula and Leonel Brizola, two popular left-wing candidates, were expected to tie for first place. Lula was viewed as the more left-leaning of the two, advocating immediate land reform and a default on the external debt. A minor candidate, Fernando Collor de Mello, former governor of Alagoas, quickly amassed support among the nation's elite with a more business-friendly agenda. Collor became popular taking emphatic anti-corruption positions; he eventually beat Lula in the second round of the 1989 elections. In 1992, Collor resigned, under threat of impeachment for his alleged embezzlement of public money.\n\n\nLula refused to run for re-election as a Congressman in 1990, busying himself with expanding the Workers' Party organizations around the country. As the political scene in the 1990s came under the sway of the Brazilian real monetary stabilization plan, which ended decades of rampant inflation, former PSDB Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso defeated Lula in 1994 and again, by an even wider margin, in 1998.\n\n\nA 2010 article in *The Washington Post* said that, before winning the presidency, Lula had been a \"strident union organizer known for his bushy beard and Che Guevara T-shirts\".[44] In the 2002 campaign, Lula forswore both his informal clothing style and his platform plank of linking the payment of Brazil's foreign debt to a prior thorough audit. This last point had worried economists, businessmen and banks, who feared that even a partial Brazilian default along with the existing Argentine default would have a massive ripple effect through the world economy. Embracing political consultant Duda Mendon\u00e7a's advice to pursue a more media-friendly image, Lula led the field in the first round of the 2002 election, held on 6 October, with a nearly two-to-one margin over PSDB candidate Jos\u00e9 Serra. He then defeated Serra in the runoff, to become the country's first leftist president following the fall of the military dictatorship in Brazil, with 61.3 percent of the vote.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the 1 October 2006 general elections, Lula came within a few thousand votes of being reelected in a single round (to date, Cardoso is the only person to win a first-round victory since the return of direct elections in 1989). He faced a run-off on 29 October and won by a substantial margin over the PSDB's Geraldo Alckmin, albeit with a slightly smaller share of the vote than he'd won in the 2002 runoff (60.83 percent vs 61.3 percent).[45] In an interview published 26 August 2007, he said that he had no intention to seek a constitutional change so that he could run for a third consecutive term; he also said that he wanted \"to reach the end of [his] term in a strong position in order to influence the succession.\"[46]\n\n\nIn early September 2018, Brazil's top electoral court banned former president Lula da Silva from running for president on the 2018 general election due to his corruption conviction, in accordance with Lei da Ficha Limpa. Instead, Fernando Haddad ran for president on the Workers Party ticket and was defeated by Jair Bolsonaro, after securing nearly 45 percent of the popular vote in a run-off between the candidates.[47]\n\n\n\n## First presidency (2003\u20132011)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: First presidency of Lula da Silva\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nLula at the beginning of his first (left) and second term (right)\n\nLula served two terms as president from 2003 through 2010 and left office on 1 January 2011. During his farewell speech he said he felt an additional burden to prove that he could handle the presidency despite his humble beginnings. \"If I failed, it would be the workers' class which would be failing; it would be this country's poor who would be proving they did not have what it takes to rule.\"[48]\n\n\n\n### Political orientation\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of the politics series on |\n| Lulism |\n| ![Margaret Thatcher](image) |\n| Philosophy\n* **Social democracy**\n* **Social liberalism**\n\n\n* Anti-imperialism\n* Democratic socialism\n* Keynesianism\n* Left-wing populism\n* Liberal socialism\n* Globalisation\n* Socialism of the 21st century\n* Progressivism\n |\n| People\n* Dilma Rousseff\n* Jos\u00e9 Alencar\n* Ol\u00edvio Dutra\n* Jos\u00e9 Dirceu\n* Gleisi Hoffmann\n* Fernando Haddad\n* Chico Buarque\n* Guido Mantega\n* Celso Amorim\n |\n| Organisations\n* **Workers' Party**\n* Unified Workers' Central\n* Sao Paulo Forum\n* Community of Latin American and Caribbean States\n* Union of South American Nations\n* Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization\n |\n| * ![icon](image) Socialism portal\n* ![icon](image) Organised labour portal\n* ![icon](image) Politics portal\n* ![flag](image) Brazil portal\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n![](image)Lula climbs the ramp leading to the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto with Vice President Jos\u00e9 Alencar for the official ceremony marking the beginning of their second term in 2007.\nVery few of the proposed reforms were actually implemented during Lula's terms of office. Some wings of the Worker's Party disagreed with the increasing moderation in focus since the late eighties and have since left the party to form parties, such as the Workers' Cause Party, the United Socialist Workers' Party and during Lula's presidency the Socialism and Liberty Party. Alliances with old, traditional oligarch politicians, like former presidents Jos\u00e9 Sarney and Fernando Collor, have been a cause of disappointment for some.[49]\n\n\n\n### Social projects\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

From very early on his leading program was to eradicate hunger, following the lead of projects already put into practice by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, but expanded by the new *Fome Zero* (\"Zero Hunger\") program.[50] The program combined a series of programs with the goal of ending hunger in Brazil through the construction of water cisterns in Brazil's semi-arid region of Sert\u00e3o, countering teenage pregnancy, strengthening family agriculture, distributing a minimum amount of cash to the poor and many other measures.\n\n\nLula launched a housing aid program that was far superior in scope to the policies developed until then. More than 15 billion euros were invested in water purification and the urbanization of favelas, and more than 40 billion in housing. As a priority, the government proposed to relocate the poor populations that occupy the \"risk zones\", prone to floods or landslides, and then to extend the electricity network, to launch work to relocate the streets and to improve the precarious housing. The government undertook to democratize access to real estate credit.[51]\n\n\nDuring Lula's first term, child malnutrition decreased by 46%. In May 2010, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) awarded Lula da Silva the title of \"World Champion in the Fight against Hunger\".[52]\n\n\nThe largest assistance program was *Bolsa Fam\u00edlia* (Family Allowance), which was based upon the previous *Bolsa Escola* (School Allowance), which was conditional on school attendance, first introduced in the city of Campinas by then-mayor Jos\u00e9 Roberto Magalh\u00e3es Teixeira. Not long thereafter, other municipalities and states adopted similar programs. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso later federalized the program in 2001. In 2003, Lula formed *Bolsa Fam\u00edlia* by combining *Bolsa Escola* with additional allowances for food and kitchen gas. This was preceded by the creation of a new ministry \u2013 the Ministry of Social Development and Eradication of Hunger. This merger reduced administrative costs and bureaucratic complexity for both the families involved and the administration of the program.\n\n\n*Fome Zero* has a government budget and accepts donations from the private sector and international organizations. The *Bolsa Fam\u00edlia* program has been praised internationally for its achievements, despite internal criticism accusing it of having turned into an electoral weapon.\n\n\nAlong with projects such as *Fome Zero* and *Bolsa Fam\u00edlia*, another Lula administration flagship program was the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC). The PAC had a total budget of 646\u00a0billion reais ($367 billion) by 2010, and was the Lula administration's main investment program. It was intended to strengthen Brazil's infrastructure, and consequently to stimulate the private sector and create more jobs. The social and urban infrastructure sector was scheduled to receive 84.2\u00a0billion reais ($47.9 billion).\n\n\nA number of other social projects were introduced during Lula's first presidency.[53]\n\n\n\n### Education\n\n[edit]\n\nA number of educational initiatives were also launched during Lula's first presidency. A free school meals system was extended to reach 37 million pupils while a programme called \"University for All\" was launched which aimed to provide \"whole or partial remission of student fees for low-income students.\"[54] In 2006, a reform was introduced extending primary education from 8 to 9 years as a means of improving the accessibility of education for the poor. The total length of primary and secondary education in Brazil increased from 11 to 12 years as a result. A Fund for the Maintenance and Development of Basic Education (FUNDEB) was also set up to close the gap between the quality of education in public and private schools. A basic education development index to measure the quality of education in state schools was also introduced, which was based on a school pass rate and on the performance of pupils in a test of knowledge. The PED conditioned the disbursement of public funds to state schools on the schools' performance, and in 200 the government set aside $500 million for the PED and a further $3 billion for the 2008 \u2013 2010 period. The PED was also aimed at high schools and continuing education.[55]\n\n\n\n### Economy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula on a visit to the Brazilian Aluminium Company\n![](image)Construction site of the Santo Ant\u00f4nio Dam, with funding from the Growth Acceleration Program\nAs Lula gained strength in the run-up to the 2002 elections, the fear of drastic measures, and comparisons with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, increased internal market speculation. This led to some market hysteria, contributing to a drop in the value of the real, and a downgrade of Brazil's credit rating.[56]\n\n\nLula also chose Henrique Meirelles of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, a prominent market-oriented economist, as head of the Brazilian Central Bank. As a former CEO of the BankBoston he was well known to the market.[57] Meirelles was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 2002 as a member of the opposing PSDB, but resigned as deputy to become Governor of the Central Bank.[57]\n\n\nLula and his cabinet followed, to an extent, the lead of the previous government,[58] by renewing all agreements with the International Monetary Fund, which were signed by the time Argentina defaulted on its own deals in 2001. His government achieved a satisfactory primary budget surplus in the first two years, as required by the IMF agreement, exceeding the target for the third year. In late 2005, the government paid off its debt to the IMF in full, two years ahead of schedule.[59]\n\n\nThe Brazilian economy was generally not affected by the mensal\u00e3o scandal, which related to vote buying in the Brazilian Congress.[60] In early 2006, Antonio Palocci resigned as finance minister due to his involvement in an abuse of power scandal. Lula then appointed Guido Mantega, a member of the PT and an economist by profession, as finance minister. Mantega, a former Marxist who had written a PhD thesis (in Sociology) on the history of economic ideas in Brazil from a left-wing viewpoint, was known for his criticism of high interest rates, something he claimed satisfied banking interests. Mantega was also supportive of a higher level of employment by the state. Not long after the start of his second term, Lula's government announced the Growth Acceleration Program (**Programa de Acelera\u00e7\u00e3o de Crescimento**, PAC), an investment program to solve many of the problems that prevented the Brazilian economy from expanding more rapidly. The measures included investment in the creation and repair of roads and railways, simplification and reduction of taxation, and modernization of the country's energy production to avoid further shortages. The money pledged to be spent on this program was considered to be around R$ 500\u00a0billion (US\u00a0$260 billion) over four years. Prior to taking office, Lula had been a critic of privatization. His administration created public-private partnership concessions for seven federal roadways.[61]\n\n\nAfter decades with the largest foreign debt among emerging economies, Brazil became a net creditor for the first time in January 2008.[62] By mid-2008, both Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's had elevated the classification of Brazilian debt from speculative to investment grade. Banks made record profits under Lula's government.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula and his wife Marisa Let\u00edcia review troops during the 2007 Independence Day military parade.\nLula's second term was much more confident; Lula was then not only the undisputed object of popular affection, as the first president to bring a modest well-being to many people, but also in complete control of his own administration. His two leading ministers were gone. Palocci was no longer needed to calm the nerves of overseas investors and Lula had never liked and somewhat feared Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, a virtuoso of cold political calculation and intrigue. Their joint elimination freed Lula for sole command in Brasilia. When, midway through his second term its test came, he handled it with aplomb. The crash of Wall Street in 2008 might have been a tsunami in the US and Europe, he declared, but in Brazil it would be no more than a little 'ripple' (\"*uma marolinha*\"). The phrase was seized on by the Brazilian press as proof of reckless economic ignorance and irresponsibility.[64] In 2008, Brazil enjoyed economic good health to fight the global financial crisis with a large economic stimulus lasting, at least, until 2014.[65] The Lula administration's economic policies also helped to significantly raise living standards, with the percentage of Brazilians belonging to the consumerist middle class rising from 50% to 73% of the population.[*citation needed*] According to *The Washington Post*: \n\n\n> Under Lula, Brazil became the world's eighth-largest economy, more than 20 million people rose out of acute poverty and Rio de Janeiro was awarded the 2016 Summer Olympics, the first time the Games will be held in South America.\n> \n> \u2014\u200a*The Washington Post*, October 2010[44]\n> \n\n\n### Environmental policy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The deforestation rate in Brazil declined significantly during Lula's time in office, a decline that reversed in the time of Bolsonaro.[66][67]\nIn terms of environmental protection, the creation of conservation areas and indigenous reserves led to a substantial decrease (around 75%) in deforestation starting in 2004.[68]\n\n\nInitially, Lula's administration pushed for progressive policies that significantly curbed deforestation in the Amazon. Despite this, he did not support legislation that would have required the country to phase out its fossil fuels.\n\n\nDuring his 2022 election campaign, he focused more on environmental issues and espoused more environmentally conscious policies.[69]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Brazil\n\n![](image)Lula and the Finnish President Tarja Halonen, 2023\n![](image)Lula and the U.S. President George W. Bush in the G8 Japan 2008\n![](image)Lula with BRIC leaders in 2010\nLeading a large and competitive agricultural state, Lula generally opposed and criticized farm subsidies, and this position has been seen as one of the reasons for the walkout of developing nations and subsequent collapse of the Canc\u00fan World Trade Organization talks in 2003 over G8 agricultural subsidies.[70] Brazil played an important role in negotiations regarding internal conflicts in Venezuela and Colombia, and concentrated efforts on strengthening Mercosur.[71] During the Lula administration, Brazilian foreign trade increased dramatically, changing from deficits to several surpluses after 2003. In 2004, the surplus was US$29\u00a0billion, due to a substantial increase in global demand for commodities. Brazil also provided UN peace-keeping troops and led a peace-keeping mission in Haiti.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula meeting with President of Russia Vladimir Putin in 2005\n![](image)Lula meeting with the Supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei\n![](image)United States President Barack Obama greets Lula in the Oval Office.\nIn 2003, Lula condemned the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, saying that the United States had no right \"to decide unilaterally what is good and what is bad for the world.\"[73] He said that \"the behaviour of the United States in relation to Iraq has weakened the United Nations.\"[74]\n\n\nAccording to *The Economist* of 2 March 2006, Lula had a pragmatic foreign policy, seeing himself as a negotiator, not an ideologue, a leader adept at reconciling opposites. As a result, he befriended both Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and U.S. President George W. Bush.[75] Lula also gained increasing stature in the Southern hemisphere through economic growth in Brazil. In 2008, he was said to have become a \"point man for healing regional crises\", as in the escalation of tensions between Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. Former Finance Minister, and current advisor, Delfim Netto, said: \"Lula is the ultimate pragmatist.\"[76]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2008\n![](image)Lula and his wife Marisa Leticia with the Former French President Jacques Chirac in Brazil, 2006\n![](image)Lula brokered together with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan the Iran nuclear deal in 2010.\nHe travelled to more than 80 countries during his presidency.[77] A goal of Lula's foreign policy was for the country to gain a seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. In this he was unsuccessful.[77] Lula was considered to have pulled off a major coup with Turkey in regards to getting Iran to send its uranium abroad in contravention of western calls.[77][78]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula and Pope Benedict XVI in S\u00e3o Paulo, 2007\n![](image)Lula with President of Mexico Felipe Calder\u00f3n during an official ceremony in Mexico City\n![](image)Lula and First Lady Marisa Let\u00edcia pictured in the Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada\nThe condemnation of Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani for the crime of adultery, with a sentence of execution by stoning, led to calls for Lula da Silva's intervention on her behalf. On the issue, Lula commented that \"I need to respect the laws of a [foreign] country. If my friendship with the president of Iran and the respect that I have for him is worth something, if this woman has become a nuisance, we will receive her in Brazil.\" The Iranian government declined the offer.[79][80] Lula da Silva's actions and comments sparked controversy. Mina Ahadi, an Iranian Communist politician, welcomed Lula da Silva's offer of asylum for Ashtiani, but also reiterated a call for an end to stoning altogether and requesting a cessation of recognition and support for the Iranian government.[81][82][83][84] Jackson Diehl, deputy editorial page editor of *The Washington Post*, called Lula da Silva the \"best friend of tyrants in the democratic world\" and criticised his actions.[79] Shirin Ebadi, Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate viewed Lula da Silva's intervention in a more positive light, calling it a \"powerful message to the Islamic Republic\".[85] In the final month of his first administration, his government officially recognized Palestine as a state,[86] with a number of Latin American countries following suit.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Corruption scandals and controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of scandals in Brazil\n\n### Mensal\u00e3o\n\n[edit]\n\nLula's administration was plagued by numerous corruption scandals,[87][88] notably the Mensal\u00e3o scandal and Esc\u00e2ndalo dos sanguessugas\u00a0[pt] in his first term. Brazilian attorney general \u00c1lvaro Augusto Ribeiro Costa presented charges against 40 politicians and officials involved in the Mensal\u00e3o affair, including several charges against Lula himself. Lula stated on Brazilian public television that he knew nothing about the scandals.[89] Top officials involved, such as Roberto Jefferson, Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, Luiz Gushiken and Humberto Costa have corroborated this; but one of his own party members, Arlindo Chinaglia, alleged that Lula had been warned about the matter.[90] Having lost numerous government aides in the face of political turmoil, Lula survived largely unscathed in the eyes of the public, with overwhelming approval rates.\n\n\n\n### Politicking\n\n[edit]\n\nHis administration was heavily criticized for relying on local, right-of-centre political barons, like Jos\u00e9 Sarney, Jader Barbalho, Renan Calheiros and Fernando Collor to ensure a majority in Congress. Another frequent reproach was his ambiguous treatment of the left wing of the PT. Analysts felt that he would occasionally give in to left-wing calls for tighter government control on media and increased state intervention: in 2004, he pushed for the creation of a \"Federal Council of Journalists\" (CFJ) and a \"National Cinema Agency\" (Ancinav), the latter designed to overhaul funding for electronic communications. Both proposals ultimately failed amid concerns over the effect of state control on free speech.[91][92]\n\n\n\n### Statement on the Great Recession\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore a G-20 summit in London in March 2009, Lula caused an uproar by declaring that the economic crisis was caused by \"the irrational behavior of white people with blue eyes, who before seemed to know everything, and now have shown they don't know anything.\"[93]\n\n\n\n### Cesare Battisti\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen wanted Italian terrorist Cesare Battisti was arrested in Rio de Janeiro on 18 March 2007 by Brazilian and French police officers, Brazilian Minister of Justice Tarso Genro granted him status as a political refugee, a controversial decision which divided Italy and the Brazilian and international press. On 5 February 2009, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of Italy and held a minute's silence in memory of Battisti's victims. On 18 November 2009, the Brazilian Supreme Court declared the refugee status illegal and allowed Battisi's extradition, but also stated that the Brazilian constitution gave the president personal powers to deny the extradition if he chose to, effectively putting the final decision in the hands of Lula.[94] Lula barred Battisti's extradition.[95] On 31 December 2010, Lula's last day in office, the decision not to allow extradition was officially announced. Battisti was released on 9 June 2011 from prison after the Brazilian Constitutional Court denied Italy's request to extradite him. Italy planned to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.[96] Battisti was extradited in December 2018.[97]\n\n\n\n### Operation Car Wash: corruption investigation and prosecution\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Demonstrators gather in front of the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto, the presidential palace, to protest against Lula's appointment as Chief of Staff of the Presidency, 16 March 2016.\n![](image)Lula is sworn in as Chief of Staff by President Dilma Rousseff on 17 March 2016.\nIn 2014, Brazil began *Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato* (English: Operation Car Wash), resulting in several arrests and convictions, including nine suits against Lula.\n\n\nIn April 2015, the Public Ministry of Brazil opened an investigation into allegations of influence peddling by Lula, which alleged that between 2011 and 2014 he had lobbied for government contracts in foreign countries for the Odebrecht company and had also persuaded the Brazilian Development Bank to finance the projects in Ghana, Angola, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic.[98] In June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, president of Odebrecht, was arrested on charges that he had paid politicians $230 million in bribes.[99] Three other company executives were also arrested, as well as the chief executive of Andrade Gutierrez, another construction conglomerate.[100]\n\n\nOn 4 March 2016, as part of \"Operation Car Wash\", Brazilian authorities raided Lula's home.[101][102] After the raid, the police detained Lula for questioning.[103][104] A police statement alleged that Lula had collaborated in illegal bribes from the oil company Petrobras to benefit his political party and presidential campaign.[103] Prosecutor Carlos Fernando said, \"The favors to Lula from big construction companies involved in the fraud at Petrobras were many and hard to quantify\".[105] Lula said that he and his party were being politically persecuted.[106][107][108]\n\n\nOn 16 March 2016, Rousseff appointed Lula as her chief of staff, a position comparable to that of prime minister. This would have shielded him from arrest due to the immunity that went with the position.[109] Cabinet ministers in Brazil are among close to seven hundred senior government officials enjoying special judicial standing, which means they can only be tried by Brazil's Supreme Federal Court. Supreme Court Judge Gilmar Mendes suspended Lula da Silva's appointment on the grounds that Rousseff was trying to help Lula circumvent prosecution.[110][111]\n\n\nOn 14 September 2016, prosecutors filed corruption charges against Lula, accusing him of being the mastermind or 'maximum commander of the scheme'.[112] On 19 September 2016, 13th Circuit (Paran\u00e1) federal judge Sergio Moro, who was leading the corruption probe, accepted an indictment for money laundering against Lula and his wife Marisa Leticia Lula da Silva. On 11 May 2017, Lula answered a summons by appearing in Curitiba and was questioned by Moro. The closed-court hearing lasted five hours. Thousands of Lula supporters went to Curitiba, together with Dilma Rousseff. After the hearing, Lula and Rousseff gave speeches to his supporters; Lula attacked what he called bias in the Brazilian media.[113]\n\n\nLula was found guilty by the lower court of accepting R$3.7 million in bribes ($940,000 US) in the form of improvements to his beachfront house, made by construction company Grupo Metha\u00a0[pt], which in turn received lucrative contracts from the state-owned oil company Petrobras.[114] Lula also faced other charges, including money laundering, influence peddling and obstruction of justice.[115][114] On 12 July 2017, Sergio Moro sentenced Lula to nine and a half years in prison.[116] Lula remained free pending his appeal.[117] Lula's lawyer accused the judge of bias and the judge replied that nobody, not even the former president, should be above the rule of law.[117]\n\n\nOn 25 January 2018, the Appeal Court of Porto Alegre found Lula guilty of corruption and money laundering and increased his sentence to 12 years of prison[118] for one of the nine charges, while the other eight were still pending. On 26 March 2018, that same court upheld its own sentence, thus ending the case in that court.[119]\n\n\nOn 23 March 2021, the Supreme Federal Court ruled by a 3\u20132 decision that Moro, who had overseen Lula's trial in a case, was biased against him.[24] It upheld the ruling on 23 June by a 7\u20134 decision.[120] Judge Gilmar Mendes of the Supreme Federal Court on 24 June annulled the two other cases Moro had brought against Lula, reasoning that there was a link between them and the case in which Moro was declared biased. This meant that all evidence Moro had collected against Lula is inadmissible in court and fresh trials would be needed.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Prison\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 5 April 2018, Brazil's Supreme Federal Court (STF) voted 6\u20135 to deny Lula's habeas corpus petition.[122] The court ruled that Lula must begin serving the sentence relating to 12 July 2017 conviction, despite not having exhausted all of his appeals. Lula and his political party vowed to continue his campaign from prison following the court's decision that he must surrender himself by 6 April.[123] The head of Brazil's army, General Eduardo Villas Boas, called for Lula to be placed behind bars.[124] Lula failed to turn himself in at the scheduled time,[125] but he did so on the following day on 7 April 2018.[126] After the imprisonment of Lula, protesters took to the streets in cities across Brazil.[127] Lula's imprisonment led to the formation of the Free Lula Movement.\n\n\nOn 8 July 2018, federal judge for the 4th region Rog\u00e9rio Favreto ordered Lula's release. Moro immediately stated that Favreto did not have the power to release Lula and Favreto's ruling was overturned the same day by the Judge Pedro Gebran Neto, president of the 4th regional court.[128]\n\n\nOn 9 June 2019, *The Intercept* published leaked Telegram messages between the judge in Lula's case, Sergio Moro, and the Operation Car Wash lead prosecutor, Deltan Dallagnol, in which they allegedly conspired to convict Lula to prevent his candidacy for the 2018 presidential election.[129][130]\n[131][132][133][134][135] Moro was accused of lacking impartiality in Lula's trial.[136] Following the disclosures, the resumption of legal proceedings was determined by the Supreme Court.[137] Moro denied any wrongdoing or judicial misconduct during the course of Operation Car Wash and his investigation of the former president, claiming that the conversations leaked by *The Intercept* were misrepresented by the press and that conversations between prosecutors and judges are normal.[138] Moro became Minister of Justice and Public Security after the election of president Jair Bolsonaro, and it is disputed whether an agreement was in place prior to Bolsonaro's election.\n\n\nThe information published by *The Intercept* prompted reactions both in Brazil and overseas. A group of seventeen lawyers, ministers of Justice, and high court members from eight countries reacted to the leaks by describing former President Lula as a political prisoner and calling for his release.[139] United States Senator Bernie Sanders said Lula should be released and his conviction annulled. Ro Khanna asked the Trump administration to investigate Lula's case, saying that \"Moro was a bad actor and part of a larger conspiracy to send Lula to jail\".[140] American political commentator Michael Brooks, a vocal advocate for the former president, stated that Lula's imprisonment and Moro's alleged political motives had rendered the results of the 2018 election \"fundamentally illegitimate\".[141]\n\n\nOn 8 November 2019, Lula was released from prison after 580 days when the Brazilian Supreme Court ended mandatory imprisonment of convicted criminals after their first appeal failed.[142][143][144]\nOn 27 November, the Federal Regional Tribunal of Region 4[pt] in Porto Alegre increased Lula's sentence to 17 years.[145]\n\n\nJudge Edson Fachin of the Supreme Federal Court annulled all convictions against Lula on 8 March 2021, ruling that the court in Curitiba which convicted him lacked jurisdiction to do so, and ordered a retrial in Brasilia.[146] A full Supreme Court bench later upheld the ruling by an 8\u20133 decision on 15 April.[147]\n\n\n\n#### UN Human Rights Committee\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court refused to consider alleged violations of fundamental human rights by Judge Moro, Lula's defense lawyers appealed to the United Nations Human Rights Committee.[148] In the lawsuit, the lawyers requested that the Committee provide an opinion on the accusations that Moro violated Lula's right to privacy, his right to not be arbitrarily arrested and his right to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. They presented as proof of abusive practices:\n\n\n\n1. Coercive conduct against Lula on 4 March 2016.\n2. The leaking of confidential data to the press.\n3. The leaking of illegally obtained phone conversation recordings to the press.\n4. An abusive strategy of temporary and preemptive imprisonments in order to obtain plea-bargaining deals implicating the former president.\n\n\nBecause the judge's chief of staff had posted on her Facebook page a petition calling for Lula's imprisonment[149] and the presiding judge of the appellate panel had praised Moro's decision to convict Lula for corruption, before Moro had issued his decision,[150] an op-ed in *The New York Times* concluded that \"Brazil's democracy is now weaker than it has been since military rule ended\".[151] The newspaper was joined by a number of international intellectuals, activists and political leaders, from Noam Chomsky to a group of twelve United States Congressmen,[152] who complained that the legal proceedings appeared to be designed to prevent Lula (the front-runner in opinion polls) from running for president in 2018.[153][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nOn 28 July 2016, Lula filed a 39-page petition with the UN's Human Rights Committee outlining alleged abuses of power. The petition stated that \"Lula is a victim of abuse of power by a judge, with the complicity of prosecutors and the media\".[154] The petition was the first ever taken against Brazil which ratified the committee's protocol in 2009.\n\n\n\n![](image)Protests related to 2016 Lula's coercive testimony\nThe UN accepted the case[155] and Brazil was given six months to respond to the petition. The committee was made of 18 international jurists.[156] In November 2016, Lula's legal team filed additional evidence of abuses by the Brazilian justice system,[157] and another document was filed on 5 October 2017, in Geneva, Switzerland, reporting other facts, such as Judge Moro's attendance at the premiere of a film that depicted former President Lula as guilty, despite the lack of any definitive decision against him at that time.[158]\n\n\nFollowing Judge Moro's issuance of an arrest warrant for the ex-President, on 6 April 2018, Lula appealed to the UN's Human Rights Committee to ask the government to prevent his arrest until he had exhausted all appeals.[159] Lula argued that the Brazilian Supreme Court had narrowly adopted its ruling with only six votes against five, which \"shows the need for an independent court to examine if the presumption of innocence was violated\" in his case. The Human Rights Committee received a request for \"interim measures\" and was deliberating the request.[160] The UN Human Rights Committee denied the request seeking emergency action against his imprisonment.[161]\n\n\nOn 28 May 2018, the Committee initiated a formal investigation into violations against basic judicial guarantees in Lula's case.[162] In August, the UN Human Rights Committee \"requested Brazil to take all necessary measures to ensure that Lula can enjoy and exercise his political rights while in prison, as candidate in the 2018 presidential elections.\"[163][164]\n\n\nOn 2 August 2018, Pope Francis received three former allies of Lula in Rome: Celso Amorim, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and Carlos Ominami. At the conclusion of the hour-long meeting,[165] Pope Francis was given a copy of Lula's biography *The Truth Will Win* by Amorim. Later, he addressed a handwritten note to Lula (posted on his Twitter account) with the following text: \"To Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva with my blessing, asking him to pray for me, Francisco\".[166] In the same month, President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff, who had previously served as Chief of Staff to President Lula da Silva from 2005 to 2010, confirmed that the Pope also sent her an unofficial letter, the content of which was not disclosed.[167]\n\n\n\n### Operation Zelotes\n\n[edit]\n\nLula, along with his former chief of staff Gilberto Carvalho\u00a0[pt] and five others, was indicted in a corruption probe as part of Operation Zelotes\u00a0[pt] regarding payment of R$6 million in bribes (US\u00a0$1.5 million). \n\n\nAccording to prosecutors, they helped pass Provisional Measure 471 (which was later converted into Law 12,218/2010) in 2009 in order to benefit the automotive companies CAOA and MMC.[168] Judge Frederico Botelho de Barros Viana of the 10th Federal Court of Brasilia acquitted all the accused on 21 June 2021, stating that the prosecution could not convincingly demonstrate that the defendants were involved in a criminal conspiracy.[169]\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency\n\n[edit]\n\n### Health\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula in April 2016\n![](image)Lula with Brazilian politician Fernando Haddad in September 2016\nOn 29 October 2011, through the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital of S\u00e3o Paulo, it was announced that Lula had a malignant tumor in his larynx. He had chemotherapy to counteract the tumor, and on 16 November, his press office released photos of his wife shaving his beard and hair, leaving him bald, although he retained his moustache.[170] It was the first time that he had been seen without his beard since he left office.[171] He was treated with radiation, and the cancer went into remission. Lula announced his recovery in March 2012, as well as his return to politics. Fellow politician Dilma Rousseff, then president of Brazil, welcomed the news.[172] Contrary to rumors, Lula stated in early 2013 that he was not a presidential candidate, supporting Dilma Rousseff for a second term.[173]\n\n\nThe appointment raised concerns[*from whom?*] about his arrest and investigation.[174]\n\n\nOn 21 January 2021, Lula said that he tested positive for COVID-19 while participating in the filming of an Oliver Stone documentary in Cuba, five days after arriving on the island. He did not need hospital admission and was able to recover.[175] On 13 March 2021, Lula received his first dose of the CoronaVac vaccine.[176]\n\n\n\n### 2018 presidential campaign\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula with Brazilian politicians Manuela d'\u00c1vila and Marcelo Freixo in April 2018\n![](image)Lula with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez in November 2021\nIn 2017, Lula announced he would stand as the Workers' Party candidate for president again in the 2018 election. In September, he led a caravan of supporters which travelled through the states of Brazil, starting with Minas Gerais, whose governor was Lula's political ally Fernando Pimentel.[177] While traveling through the South of Brazil, the caravan became the target of protests. In Paran\u00e1, a campaign bus was shot, and in Rio Grande do Sul, rocks were thrown at pro-Lula militants.[178]\n\n\nDespite Lula's imprisonment in April 2018, the Workers' Party kept Lula as the party's presidential candidate. In a poll conducted by Ibope in June 2018, Lula led with 33% of vote intentions, with the PSL candidate Jair Bolsonaro polling second with 15%.[179] Lula negotiated a national coalition with the PCdoB and regional alliances with the Socialist Party.[180]\n\n\nThe Workers' Party officially nominated Lula as its candidate on 5 August 2018, in S\u00e3o Paulo. Actor S\u00e9rgio Mamberti read a letter written by Lula, who was unable to attend because of his prison sentence. Former S\u00e3o Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad was named as Lula's running mate and intended to represent Lula in events and debates. In the event that Lula were declared ineligible, Haddad would replace Lula as candidate, with Manuela d'\u00c1vila replacing Haddad as the vice presidential candidate.[181]\n\n\nIn response to an appeal considering Lula as a political prisoner, the UN Human Rights Committee ruled on 17 August 2018 that it had requested the Brazilian government to allow Lula to exercise his political rights.[182]\n\n\nIn a 26 August poll, Lula had 39 percent of vote intentions within one month of the first round. The same opinion polling put Lula ahead of all his challengers in a second round run-off, including the nearest one, PSL candidate Jair Bolsonaro, by 52 to 32.[183]\n\n\nLula's candidacy was denied by the Superior Electoral Court on 31 August 2018, when the majority of the seven-judge panel voted to bar Lula from running in the presidential race.[184] On 11 September 2018, Lula officially dropped out of the election and was replaced by Fernando Haddad, whom Lula endorsed.[185]\n\n\n\n## Second presidency (2023\u2013present)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Second presidency of Lula da Silva\n\n### 2022 election\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: 2022 Brazilian general election and Lula da Silva 2022 presidential campaign\n\n![](image)Lula with President of Argentina Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez in October 2022\nIn May 2021, Lula stated that he would run for a third term in the October 2022 general election, against the incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro,[186][187][188] with opinion polls at the end of July 2021 suggesting he would comfortably beat Bolsonaro.[188] He was 17% ahead of Bolsonaro in a poll in January 2022.[189]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Lula announced that his running mate would be Geraldo Alckmin, a three-term governor of S\u00e3o Paulo state who ran against Lula in the 2006 presidential elections.[190]\n\n\nOn 2 October, the vote of the first round, Lula was in first place with 48.43% of the electorate, qualifying for the second round with Bolsonaro, who received 43.20% of the votes. Lula was elected in the second round on 30 October, three days after his seventy-seventh birthday. He became the first president of Brazil elected to three terms and the first since Get\u00falio Vargas to serve in non-consecutive terms. He is also the first candidate to unseat an incumbent president. He was sworn in on 1 January 2023.[191][192]\n\n\n\n### Tenure\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula and US President Joe Biden at the White House on 10 February 2023\n![](image)Lula and the Chinese President Xi Jinping, April 2023\nLula said that his main commitments were: the reconstruction of the country in the face of the economic crisis; democracy, sovereignty and peace; economic development and stability; fighting poverty; education; implementation of a National System of Culture and the expansion of housing programs.[193]\n\n\n\n#### Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n[edit]\n\nLula took a non-aligned stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, describing it in a way that Ukraine compared to a \"Russian attempt to distort the truth\".[194][195] While highlighting the human cost of the war, as well as its impact on food security,[196] cost of living and global supply chains,[197] and condemning the invasion, Lula repeatedly attacked NATO and the European Union as the cause of the war, accusing the former of \"claiming for itself the right to install military bases in the vicinity of another country.\"[198] In April 2023 Lula condemned Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity and said Russia should withdraw from Ukrainian territory it has occupied since February 2022.[199] Refusing to send arms to Ukraine, he also put blame on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying \"This guy is as responsible as Putin for the war,\" during an interview in May 2022.[198] Later in April 2023, he suggested that Ukraine should \"give up Crimea\" in exchange for peace and Russia's withdrawal from Ukrainian territory it occupied after February 2022, saying Zelenskyy \"can not want everything\".[200][201]\n\n\nLula has also insisted in seeking peace, which is a binding foreign policy principle under the current pacifist Brazilian Constitution of 1988 (See Article 4, VI, VII), as he turned down Brazilian military weaponry sales proposed by Germany to be sent to Ukraine.[202] Lula said that the countries of the Global South, including Brazil, India, Indonesia and China \"want peace\", but both Putin and Zelenskyy \"are convinced that they are going to win the war\" and do not want to talk about peace, so the war could be very long.[203]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima on 20 May 2023\nIn April 2023, Lula declared after a state visit to China that \"the United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace\". U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby responded by accusing Lula of \"parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda\", describing his comments as \"simply misguided\" and \"suggesting the United States and Europe are somehow not interested in peace, or that we share responsibility for the war\".[204]\n\n\nOn 26 April, in a joint press conference at the Palace of Moncloa, Spanish PM Pedro S\u00e1nchez raised further questions about Lula's position when the former stressed that the victimized country needed to be supported.[205][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] Lula was interviewed by Pepa Bueno for a Spanish daily, and he said of the UN Security Council, which has included the People's Republic of China as a permanent member only since 25 October 1971, that it is frozen in the era of 1945 and that he wants to use this as reason to reform it. In May 2023, he declined an invitation to the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum, saying that he \"can't visit Russia at the moment\", while confirming that he had spoken to Putin.[206]\n\n\n\n#### Israel\u2013Hamas war\n\n[edit]\n\nLula condemned the Hamas attack on Israel carried out on 7 October 2023.[207] On 11 October 2023, he called for a ceasefire in the Israel\u2013Hamas war, stating, it was \"urgently needed in defense of Israeli and Palestinian children\".[208] Lula urged Hamas to release kidnapped Israeli children and Israel to stop bombing the Gaza Strip and allow Palestinian children and their mothers to leave the war zone.[209] On 25 October 2023, Lula stated, \"It's not a war, it's a genocide.\"[210]\n\n\n\n#### Economy\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Bolsa Fam\u00edlia\n\nIn March 2023 Lula reinforced the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia program. The program was created during the first term of Lula and then significantly cut by Jair Bolsonaro. The program should help around 60 million Brazilians suffering from poverty. The first goal is to eradicate hunger affecting 33.1 million people in Brazil.[211] According to the World Bank estimates, the reinforced program will reduce the poverty rate in Brazil to 24.3% - the level before COVID-19 pandemic.[212]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023 Brazilian economy grew by 1.9%. In the second quarter by 0.9%, 3 times more than expected, while many of the neighbors of Brazil saw a shrinkage in their economy. The possible reasons of this phenomena include reducing inflation, good harvest, improving credit rating. The economic policy of Lula regarding taxation, spendings, public ownership of some companies probably played a major role in this. Explaining his economic philosophy Lula once said: \"\u201c[Brazilians] need to understand that the money that exists in this country needs to circulate in the hands of many people,\u201d \u201cWe do not want the concentration of wealth. We want more people to have access to credit to make the wheel of the economy turn. The growing economy needs to be distributed.\u201d[213]\n\n\n\n#### Environment\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Launch of the Global Biofuel Alliance at the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit\nLula has pledged to end illegal logging, with Greenpeace Brazil spokesperson R\u00f4mulo Batista stating that \"[a]ddressing the crisis will require rebuilding the manpower of environmental agencies that were gutted by the far-right populist [Jair Bolsonaro], a process which cannot happen overnight\".[214] In the first 4 months of 2023, Amazon deforestation rate has seen a significant decrease, being reported 40.4% lower in comparison to the same period of 2022. It is unclear if the trend will continue, as the peak of deforestation comes generally in July\u2013September, but experts see it \"as a positive signal\".[215][216]\n\n\nIn the first 7 months of 2023 the deforestation rate in the Amazon has fallen by 42% in \"a sharp reversal relative to the trend under the Bolsonaro administration\". In July 2023 the deforestation rate was 66% lower than in July 2022. In the beginning of August Lula will participate in the Belem summit. At the summit, the leaders of the 8 Amazonian nations, are expected to renew the Amazon cooperation treaty.[217] The result, in July is especially important because usually the clearing season begins in this month. The decision of several banks to not give credit to loggers and the new policy of the EU to achieve \"deforestation-free trade\" helped to achieve this result.[218] However, there are concerns that illegal loggers have partly moved their action from the Amazon rainforest to Cerrado where the environmental destruction has increased.[219] In the first 8 months of 2023 deforestation rate declined by 48% what prevented the release of 196 million tons CO2 to the atmosphere. Financing from the Amazon Fund and cooperation between the Amazonian nations played a significant role in it.[220]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the Amazon rainforest near Manaus, Brazil\nLula pledged to recognize 14 new indigenous reserves. Six were recognized as of May 2023.[221] Lula and the American president Joe Biden committed to work together on the issue.[222] In April Biden pledged to give 500 million dollars to the Amazon Fund which was frozen during the rule of Bolsonaro and became active when Lula returned to power, as a \"part of the two nations' efforts to deal with climate change.\"[223] According to John Kerry, the overall financial help from US to Brazil for stopping deforestation through different channels will be around 2 billion US dollars.[224]\n\n\nIn June, Lula presented a road map for achieving zero deforestation by the year 2030. It is a part of a bigger plan: \"The Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon\". This plan was largely responsible for the 83% decrease in the Amazon deforestation rate in the years 2004 through 2012 but it was suspended during Bolsonaro's presidency. The plan includes different measures for creating a sustainable economy in the Amazon region, like bioeconomy, rural credits and more. Lula also pledged to return the climate targets of the country in the Paris agreement to the level they were before Bolsonaro government: \"reduce carbon emission by 37% by 2025 and 43% by 2030\".[225]\n\n\n\n## Political positions and philosophy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Lulism\n\n![](image)Lula visits the Yanomami people in the Brazilian state of Roraima in January 2023\nIn Brazil, *liberal* is often avoided by leftists because of connotations with pro-business policies during neoliberalism or the military dictatorship.

He appointed the minister of finance, Mikhail Kasyanov, as prime minister.[94] The first major challenge to Putin's popularity came in August 2000, when he was criticized for the alleged mishandling of the *Kursk* submarine disaster.[95] That criticism was largely because it took several days for Putin to return from vacation, and several more before he visited the scene.[95]\n\n\nBetween 2000 and 2004, Putin set about the reconstruction of the impoverished condition of the country, apparently winning a power-struggle with the Russian oligarchs, reaching a 'grand bargain' with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit support for\u2014and alignment with\u2014Putin's government.[96][97]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n444. **^** \"President Putin bestows Order of Friendship on Filipino\". 22 November 2019.\n445. **^** \"Rodrigo Duterte tells Vladimir Putin: 'I just want to be friends'\". *The Independent*. 28 November 2016.\n446. **^** Nile Bowie (10 September 2019). \"The ties that bind Mahathir to Moscow\". *Asia Times*.\n447. **^** Don Kirk (20 July 2000). \"Putin Is Acclaimed On Pyongyang Visit\u00a0: After Decades of Sullen Isolation, North Korea Emerges as a Key Player\". *The New York Times*.\n448. **^** \"Putin Condemns Myanmar Violence After Mass Rally in Chechnya\". *Moscow Times*. 5 September 2017.

Given United Russia's near-total dominance of Russian politics, many observers believed that Putin was assured of a third term. The move was expected to see Medvedev stand on the United Russia ticket in the parliamentary elections in December, with a goal of becoming prime minister at the end of his presidential term.[133]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLeonid Bershidsky analyzed Putin's interview with the *Financial Times* and concluded, \"Putin is an imperialist of the old Soviet school, rather than a nationalist or a racist, and he has cooperated with, and promoted, people who are known to be gay.\"[424] Putin spoke favorably of artificial intelligence in regards to foreign policy, \"Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind. It comes with colossal opportunities, but also threats that are difficult to predict. Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.\"[425]\n\n\n\n### Asia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: India\u2013Russia relations, China\u2013Russia relations, Indonesia\u2013Russia relations, and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNumerous Kremlinologists have accused Putin of seeking to create a cult of personality around himself, an accusation that the Kremlin has denied.[621] Some of Putin's activities have been criticised for being staged;[622][623] outside of Russia, his macho image has been the subject of parody.[624][625][626] Putin's height has been estimated by Kremlin insiders to be between 155 and 165 centimetres (5\u00a0feet 1\u00a0inch and 5\u00a0feet 5\u00a0inches) tall but is usually given at 170 centimetres (5\u00a0feet 7\u00a0inches).[627][628]\n\n\nThere are many songs about Putin,[629] and Putin's name and image are widely used in advertisement and product branding.[619] Among the Putin-branded products are Putinka vodka, the PuTin brand of canned food, the *Gorbusha Putina* caviar, and a collection of T-shirts with his image.[630] In 2015, his advisor Mikhail Lesin was found dead after \"days of excessive consumption of alcohol\", though his death was later ruled as the result of an accident.[631]\n\n\n\n### Public recognition in the West\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 31 December 2022, President Putin gave a New Year's address before a group of soldiers and other members of the Russian armed forces. Questions were raised about whether or not these were actual soldiers or actors. The BBC used facial recognition to identify at least five of the people in the New Year's address as not servicemen but allies or employees of Putin's. A blonde woman standing behind Putin has been identified as Larisa Sergukhina, a member of the United Russia party in the regional parliament for the Novgorod region. Ms Sergukhina has appeared as a soldier, sailor and member of a church congregation in other past public appearances by President Putin.[691]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Electoral history of Vladimir Putin\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\n### Family\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Family of Vladimir Putin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n495. **^** \"Russia walks away from CFE arms treaty\". *fijilive.com*. 12 December 2007.

In January 2010, the 8th North Caucasus Federal District (shown here in purple) was split from the Southern Federal District. In March 2014, the new 9th Crimean Federal District was formed after the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. In July 2016, it was incorporated into the Southern Federal District.\nAccording to Stephen White, under the presidency of Putin, Russia made it clear that it had no intention of establishing a \"second edition\" of the American or British political system, but rather a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions and circumstances.[333] Some commentators have described Putin's administration as a \"sovereign democracy\".[334][335][336] According to the proponents of that description (primarily Vladislav Surkov), the government's actions and policies ought above all to enjoy popular support within Russia itself and not be directed or influenced from outside the country.[337]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn September 2019, Putin's administration interfered with the results of Russia's nationwide regional elections and manipulated it by eliminating all candidates in the opposition. The event that was aimed at contributing to the ruling party, United Russia's victory, also contributed to inciting mass protests for democracy, leading to large-scale arrests and cases of police brutality.[212]\n\n\nOn 15 January 2020, Medvedev and his entire government resigned after Putin's 2020 Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly. Putin suggested major constitutional amendments that could extend his political power after presidency.[213][214] At the same time, on behalf of Putin, he continued to exercise his powers until the formation of a new government.[215] Putin suggested that Medvedev take the newly created post of deputy chairman of the Security Council.[216]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Z symbol on a billboard reads Template:Lang-ru, 24 September 2022.\nAssessments of Putin's character as a leader have evolved during his long presidency. His shifting of Russia towards autocracy and weakening of the system of representative government advocated by Boris Yeltsin has met with criticism.[642] Russian dissidents and western leaders now frequently characterise him as a \"dictator\". Others have offered favourable assessments of his impact on Russia.\n\n\nPutin was described in 2015 as a \"dictator\" by political opponent Garry Kasparov,[643] and as the \"Tsar of corruption\" in 2016 by opposition activist and blogger Alexei Navalny.[644] He was described as a \"bully\" and \"arrogant\" by former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton,[645][646][647] and as \"self-centered\" by the Dalai Lama.[648] In 2015, opposition politician Boris Nemtsov said that Putin was turning Russia into a \"raw materials colony\" of China.[649]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n309. **^** Cooper, Helene; Gibbons-Neff, Thomas; Schmitt, Eric; Barnes, Julian E.

In 1996, he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and then as secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. Following Yeltsin's resignation, Putin became acting president and, in less than four months, was elected to his first term as president. He was subsequently reelected in 2004. Due to constitutional limitations of two consecutive presidential terms, Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012 under Dmitry Medvedev.

For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by the conservative right-wing journalist Alexander Prokhanov, stresses (i) Russian nationalism, (ii) the restoration of Russia's historical greatness, and (iii) systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.[404] Vladislav Surkov, a senior government official, has been one of the key economics consultants during Putin's presidency.[405]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Putin held a meeting in Sochi with German chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline in May 2018.\nThe NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011 prompted a widespread wave of criticism from several world leaders, including Putin, who said that the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 is \"defective and flawed\", adding: \"It allows everything. It resembles medieval calls for crusades.\"[505]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the parliamentary elections on 4 December 2011, tens of thousands of Russians engaged in protests against alleged electoral fraud, the largest protests in Putin's time. Protesters criticized Putin and United Russia and demanded annulment of the election results.[134] Those protests sparked the fear of a colour revolution in society.[135] Putin allegedly organized a number of paramilitary groups loyal to himself and to the United Russia party in the period between 2005 and 2012.[136]\n\n\n\n### 2012\u20132018: Third presidential term\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Vladimir Putin 2012 presidential campaign\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Harvey, Bob. \"Metro \u2014 Putin and Me\". *metromag.co.nz*.

He said the result of it is that \"no one feels safe! Because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them. Of course such a policy stimulates an arms race\".[491] This came to be known as the Munich Speech, and NATO secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer called the speech \"disappointing and not helpful.\"[492]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Levada Center survey showed that 58% of surveyed Russians supported the 2017 Russian protests against high-level corruption.[600]\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, state-controlled TV, where most Russians get their news, presented the invasion as a \"special military operation\" and liberation mission, in line with the government's narrative.[601][602][603] The Russian censorship apparatus *Roskomnadzor* ordered the country's media to employ information only from state sources or face fines and blocks.[604] The Russian media was banned from using the words \"war\", \"invasion\" or \"aggression\" to describe the invasion,[602] with media outlets being blocked as a result.[605]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom 2003, when Russia strongly opposed the U.S. when it waged the Iraq War, Putin became ever more distant from the West, and relations steadily deteriorated.

Russia's chief rabbi, Berel Lazar, said Putin \"paid great attention to the needs of our community and related to us with a deep respect\".[370] In 2016, Ronald S. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress, also praised Putin for making Russia \"a country where Jews are welcome\".[371]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPutin opposed any foreign intervention in the Syrian civil war. In June 2012, in Paris, he rejected the statement of French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande who called on Bashar al-Assad to step down. Putin echoed Assad's argument that anti-regime *militants* were responsible for much of the bloodshed. He also talked about previous NATO interventions and their results, and asked \"What is happening in Libya, in Iraq? Did they become safer? Where are they heading? Nobody has an answer\".[560]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2000, Putin launched the \"Programme for the Socio-Economic Development of the Russian Federation for the Period 2000\u20132010\", but it was abandoned in 2008 when it was 30% complete.[348] Fueled by the 2000s commodities boom including record-high oil prices,[11][12] under the Putin administration from 2000 to 2016, an increase in income in USD terms was 4.5 times.[349] During Putin's first eight years in office, industry grew substantially, as did production, construction, real incomes, credit, and the middle class.[350][351] A fund for oil revenue allowed Russia to repay Soviet Union's debts by 2005. Russia joined the World Trade Organization in August 2012.[352]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn cultural and social affairs Putin has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow, head of the Church, endorsed his election in 2012 stating Putin's terms were like \"a miracle of God.\"[406] Steven Myers reports, \"The church, once heavily repressed, had emerged from the Soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions... Now Kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state.\"[407]\n\n\nMark Woods, a Baptist Union of Great Britain minister and contributing editor to *Christian Today*, provides specific examples of how the Church has backed the expansion of Russian power into Crimea and eastern Ukraine.[408] Some Russian Orthodox believers consider Putin a corrupt and brutal strongman or even a tyrant. Others do not admire him but appreciate that he aggravates their political opponents. Still others appreciate that Putin defends some although not all Orthodox teachings, whether or not he believes in them himself.[409]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n395. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Stengel, Richard (20 May 2022). \"Putin May Be Winning the Information War Outside of the U.S. and Europe\". *TIME*.\n396. **^** Scott Gehlbach, \"Reflections on Putin and the Media\". *Post-Soviet Affairs* 26#1 (2010): 77\u201387.\n397. **^** \"How Putin Silences Dissent: Inside the Kremlin's Crackdown\". *Foreign Affairs*.

It also showed aerial footage of the estate via a drone and a detailed floorplan of the palace that Navalny said was given by a contractor, which he compared to photographs from inside the palace that were leaked onto the Internet in 2011.

His grandfather, Spiridon Putin (1879\u20131965), was a personal cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.[25][26] Putin's birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers: Albert, born in the 1930s, died in infancy, and Viktor, born in 1940, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 during the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi Germany's forces in World War II.[27][28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSubsequently, demonstrations against Ukrainian Rada legislative actions by pro-Russian groups in the Donbas area of Ukraine escalated into the Russo-Ukrainian War between the Ukrainian government and the Russia-backed separatist forces of the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.

At the end of the day it is a two-ended stick and the second end will come back and hit them in the face\".[497] In March 2014, Putin used Kosovo's declaration of independence as a justification for recognizing the independence of Crimea, citing the so-called \"Kosovo independence precedent\".[498][499]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n\nThe practice of the system is characterized by Swedish economist Anders \u00c5slund as manual management, commenting: \"After Putin resumed the presidency in 2012, his rule is best described as 'manual management' as the Russians like to put it.

A member of the House of Representatives, he previously served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2012 to 2017 and as acting Minister of Defense in 2017. From 2017 to 2020, he also chaired the LDP Policy Research Council.\n\n\nBorn into a political family, Kishida spent part of his childhood in the United States, where he attended elementary school in New York City. After beginning his career in finance, Kishida entered politics and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1993 as a member of the LDP. Kishida was appointed to various posts in the cabinets of prime ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda from 2007 to 2008, and was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2012 after Abe regained the premiership following the 2012 general election, serving for five years and becoming the longest-serving Foreign Affairs Minister in Japanese history. Kishida resigned from the Abe cabinet in 2017 in order to head the LDP's Policy Research Council. Kishida also assumed control of the LDP's more moderate K\u014dchikai faction in 2012 following the retirement of faction boss Makoto Koga.\n\n\nLong considered a potential future prime minister, Kishida ran in the 2020 LDP leadership election, but lost to Yoshihide Suga. He ran again for the party leadership in 2021, this time winning in a second round run-off against opponent Taro Kono. Kishida was confirmed as Prime Minister by the National Diet four days later on 4 October 2021. He led the LDP to victory in the 2021 general election later that same month, albeit at a slightly reduced majority.\n\n\nKishida has been described as a moderate conservative and has stated that his premiership will focus on a \"new model of capitalism\", by seeking to implement redistributive policies to expand the middle class. On foreign policy he has continued strengthening the Quad Security Dialogue in pursuit of the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy, taken steps to repair ties with South Korea and in 2022 instructed the cabinet to increase Japan's military budget by 65% by 2027. His premiership has seen political scandals related to the LDP's links to the Unification Church which came to public attention after the assassination of Shinzo Abe in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nKishida was born to a political family in Shibuya, Tokyo, on 29 July 1957.[1][2][3] His father, Fumitake Kishida, was a government official in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and director of The Small and Medium Enterprise Agency. Since the Kishida family was from Hiroshima, the family returned there every summer. Many members of the Kishida family had died in the atomic bombing and Fumio grew up hearing stories from the atomic bomb survivors.[4] Both his father Fumitake and grandfather Masaki Kishida were former politicians who were members of the House of Representatives.[3] Former Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yoichi Miyazawa is his cousin[5][6] and former prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa is a distant relative.[3]\n\n\nHe went to P.S. 013 Clement C. Moore elementary school in the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens, New York, because his father was posted to a job in the U.S. at the time.[7] He also attended K\u014djimachi Elementary School and K\u014djimachi Junior High School. Kishida graduated from Kaisei Academy, where he played on the baseball team.[8]\n\n\nFollowing several rejections from the University of Tokyo, Kishida studied law at Waseda University and graduated in 1982.[2][8] At Waseda, he was friends with future politician Takeshi Iwaya.[9][10]\n\n\n\n## Political career\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, September 2014\nAfter working at now-defunct Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and then as a secretary to a member of the House of Representatives, Kishida was elected to the House of Representatives in the 1993 general election, representing the Hiroshima 1st district.[11]\n\n\nKishida served as Minister of Okinawa Affairs from 2007 to 2008, firstly in the Abe Cabinet and later in the Fukuda cabinet.[12] He was appointed state minister in charge of consumer affairs and food safety in the cabinet of then prime minister Yasuo Fukuda in 2008.[3] Kishida was also state minister in charge of science and technology in the Fukuda cabinet.[12]\n\n\nHe was close to Makoto Koga, leader of the K\u014dchikai faction, one of the oldest inside the LDP, and assumed control of it in October 2012 after Makoto Koga announced his retirement from politics.[3]\n\n\n\n### Abe government\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in March 2017\nFollowing the LDP's victory in the 2012 general election, Kishida was named foreign minister in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe on 26 December 2012.[11][13] He became the longest-serving foreign minister in postwar history, surpassing Abe's father Shintaro Abe.[14] He helped to arrange U.S. President Barack Obama's historic visit to Hiroshima in May 2016, and gained attention in 2017 when he appeared alongside comedian Piko Taro to promote a United Nations program.[9]\n\n\nHe was not in favor of the appointment of Toshihiro Nikai as LDP secretary-general by Abe in 2016 against the wishes of Kishida's own faction, which was seen as an attempt at blocking generational change inside the LDP.[15]\n\n\nIn 2017, Kishida left the Cabinet to take over the chairmanship of the LDP Policy Research Council, a position traditionally seen as a stepping stone to leadership of the party.[16] He sought this position in order to improve his chances to succeed Abe, as the foreign minister post had relatively little influence within the party.[14]\n\n\nKishida considered running in the 2018 LDP presidential election, but he was persuaded by Abe not to run, with a suggestion that Abe would later support Kishida as his successor.[17] By mid-2020, several senior LDP lawmakers had shifted their support from Kishida to Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga. Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso was also popular for sending stimulus payments to households during the COVID-19 pandemic.[18] Kishida ran in the 2020 LDP presidential election but lost out to Suga, who became prime minister;[19] Kishida was not offered a position in the Suga cabinet, although his faction obtained two cabinet seats.[20]\n\n\n\n## Prime Minister of Japan (2021\u2013present)\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida is elected by the Diet, 4 October 2021.\nSee also: 2021 Liberal Democratic Party (Japan) leadership election and First Kishida Cabinet\n\nFollowing Yoshide Suga's announcement on 3 September 2021 that he would resign, following low approval ratings (at one point below 30%), and a new wave of COVID-19 infections, Kishida and Taro Kono of Shik\u014dkai faction were in the lead to replace him.[21] Suga's decision to not seek re-election as head of the LDP triggered another leadership election in September, just a little more than a year after the previous election in 2020. Throughout the race, Kono was heavily favored to win as he remained in first place among various LDP polls, and he received endorsements by Suga and others.[22]\n\n\nOn 29 September 2021, Kishida defeated Taro Kono in a runoff vote to become the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and replaced outgoing party leader Yoshihide Suga. He received a total of 257 votes (60.19%), from 249 parliamentary members and eight rank-and-file members, to become Japan's next prime minister.[23]\n\n\n\n### 2021 general election and Second Cabinet\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 2021 Japanese general election and Second Kishida Cabinet\n\nThe First Kishida Cabinet took office on 4 October 2021 and consisted of 21 members, including 13 who joined the Cabinet for the first time while also including 2 veterans, Toshimitsu Motegi and Nobuo Kishi, who retained their respective posts from the previous cabinet under Suga;[24] however, on the same day, Kishida announced he would call a general election for 31 October 2021.[25] Kishida gave his first speech as prime minister on 8 October 2021, vowing to fight and end the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan as well as announcing measures to counter the perceived threats by China and North Korea.[26]\n\n\nFollowing the 2021 Japanese general election, Kishida maintained the premiership, although the LDP lost 25 seats.[27] He formed the Second Kishida Cabinet by replacing Toshimitsu Motegi with Yoshimasa Hayashi as the Foreign Minister; Motegi became the party's Secretary-General.[28]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2022, Kishida instructed his government to increase \"national security-related spending\" to 2 percent of Japan's GDP, while increasing the military budget from 5.4 trillion yen ($40 billion) in 2022 to 8.9 trillion yen ($66 billion) by 2027, up 65%. This would lead to a spending a total of around 43 trillion yen ($321 billion) between 2023-2027, up 56% from 2019\u20132023.[29]\n\n\nKishida set child care as his government's priority for the year 2023. He emphasized the potential consequences of declining birth rates in Japan, and stated that his administration would increase monetary child benefits given to parents.[30] He announced a plan to double the country's children-related budget by June 2023, and instructed government ministers in the administration to outline child care plans by the end of March 2023.[31][32] On 1 June, Kishida's government officially set aside \u00a53.5 trillion annually for child care, but was criticized for lack of specific details in his child care plan.[33][34]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Kishida fired an aide after the aide made homophobic comments in local media. According to the report, Masayoshi Arai stated that Japanese people would flee the country if same-sex marriage were permitted. Arai also claimed that Japanese people do not want to have members of the LGBT community as their neighbors.[35]\n\n\nOn 13 March 2023, Kishida's government ended the request for citizens to wear face masks in public, a policy initiated to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan that was made 3 years earlier.[36] On 27 April, Kishida's Health Minister, Katsunobu Kat\u014d, announced that the government would downgrade the classification of COVID-19 to be on par with \"seasonal flu\", by 8 May.[37]\n\n\nKishida appointed Kazuo Ueda as Governor of the Bank of Japan in April 2023, who stated he planned to continue the ultra easy monetary policy introduced by the outgoing Governor Haruhiko Kuroda.[38] A few weeks before his next cabinet reshuffle, Kishida stated he wanted to raise the hourly minimum wage in Japan to about \u00a51,500 ($10.29) by 2030.[39]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of Japan\n\n![](image)Kishida at the 2022 Quadrilateral Security Dialogue meeting with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese, US president Joe Biden and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi\nIn keeping with the Free and Open Indo-Pacific policy, Kishida has visited Quad nations such as India and Australia to ensure the status quo in the region remains unchanged.[40] Kishida has also visited nations in Europe, along with Canada and the United States, with Japan hosting the 49th G7 summit in May 2023.[41] Kishida has condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and visisted Kyiv in a historic trip.[42] In November 2022, he accused China of violating Japan's sovereignty in the East China Sea and criticised the persecution of the Uyghur minority in China's Xinjiang province.[43] Kishida supported Bangladesh's efforts to repatriate Rohingya refugees to Myanmar.[44] Kishida attended the 2022 NATO summit in Spain, as well as the 2023 NATO summit in Lithuania.[45]\n\n\nIn October 2023, Kishida condemned Hamas' actions during the Israel\u2013Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Defense and the G7\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: G7 and 49th G7 summit\n\n![](image)Fumio Kishida at the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima, May 2023\nIn November 2022, Kishida instructed his government to increase military spending to 2 percent of Japan's GDP, up from 1 percent previously, by 2027. Following this resolution by the cabinet, Kishida began a tour of members of the Group of Seven in January 2023. Kishida first met with President Emanuel Macron of France on 9 January 2023.[47] The following day, he met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and agreed on a \"strategic partnership\".[48] On 11 January 2023, Kishida met with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in London, where the two signed a joint defence pact.[49] The following day, Kishida met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in Ottawa to discuss trade and other issues.[50] On 13 January, Kishida visited President Joe Biden of the United States in Washington, D.C.;[51] the previous day Japan's Foreign Minister and Defense Minister met with their American counterparts, where they affirmed the Japan-United States alliance remained unchanged.[52]\n\n\nIn 2023 Japan chaired the Group of Seven, with the 49th G7 summit being hosted in Hiroshima Prefecture in May of that year.[53] As the host leader, Kishida invited various leaders from the \"Global South\", including Vietnamese Prime Minister Ph\u1ea1m Minh Ch\u00ednh, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, among others.[54][55] With the backdrop of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kishida also invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[56] On 19 May 2023, Kishida and the other G7 leaders arrived at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, where they paid respects and visited the museum.[57] That day, the leaders also issued a joint statement on Ukraine, and affirmed their support for Ukraine and the rule of law.[58] The summit concluded on 21 May, and was ultimately considered a success by Kishida.[59][60][61]\n\n\n\n#### Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Russian invasion of Ukraine and 2023 visit by Fumio Kishida to Ukraine\n\n![](image)Kishida inspecting the burial place in the city of BuchaOn 24 February 2022, following the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kishida joined other leaders of the G7 nations in imposing economic sanctions on Russia. Kishida's proposed sanctions were much harsher than the largely symbolic sanctions imposed by the government of Shinzo Abe on Russia following the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. Liberal Democratic Party leaders feared that a lackluster response by Japan to the Ukrainian crisis would result in a lack of support from Japan's European allies in the event of potential Chinese attack against Taiwan.[62] In March 2022, Kishida announced that Japan would accept Ukrainian refugees.[63]\n\n\nIn December 2022 the Kishida government announced a $320 billion increase in military spending, due in part to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[64][65] On January 14, 2023, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called for Kishida to commit \"seppuku\" after he and Joe Biden warned Russia against using a nuclear weapon in Ukraine.[66]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Kishida said Japan would provide roughly $5.5 billion in aid to Ukraine during the invasion.[67] Kishida invited President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to a virtual meeting of G7 leaders, which was held on 24 February 2023, the first anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The G7 announced it would introduce \"new coordinated economic actions\" in efforts to support Ukraine.[68] Kishida was the last G7 leader to visit Kyiv during the invasion; pressure grew for him to do so following Biden's visit in February 2023.[69] On 21 March 2023, Kishida visited Ukraine and met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.[70] Kishida also visited Bucha in Ukraine's Kyiv Oblast, the site of a civilian massacre that was perpetrated by Russia.[71] Kishida was praised for the visit, and said he was \"outraged by the cruelty\".[72] In May 2023, Japan announced it would provide 100 military vehicles to the Ukrainian military.[73] Kishida led G7 leaders in announcing a joint declaration of support for Ukraine, during the 2023 Vilinius summit for NATO.[74]\n\n\n\n#### Indonesia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Indonesia-Japan relations\n\n![](image)Fumio meet President Jokowi in Tokyo, July 2022.\nOn 27 July 2022 Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Wednesday he and President Joko Widodo had agreed during talks to cooperate in a variety of fields, including energy and maritime security. Japan also agreed to provide 43.6 billion yen ($318.25 million) in loans to Indonesia for use in infrastructure projects and disaster prevention, Reuters reported. At the outset of the meeting in Tokyo, Kishida told Jokowi that Japan hopes to work with Indonesia to realize a free and open Indo-Pacific region, a vision that Japan is pursuing amid China's rise. Jokowi, meanwhile, conveyed his condolences over the death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this month, saying the late former leader helped advance bilateral relations to a strategic partnership.[75]\n\n\nOn 14 November 2022 President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) commended Japan's support for Indonesia's G20 Presidency as well as for other concrete projects that have been established.\nPM Kishida also praised Jokowi for welcoming him to a side meeting ahead of the implementation of the G20 Summit to be held on November 15\u201316.\nRegarding the 65th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Japan and Indonesia in 2023, Kishida believes that the partnership between the two countries will continue to strengthen.[76]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Japan\u2013South Korea relations and Camp David Principles\n\n![](image)Kishida meeting with South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol in 2023\nOn relations between Japan and South Korea, both Kishida and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol have taken steps to mend and expand ties, while attempting to settle historical issues stemming from World War II and the Japanese occupation of Korea.[77] In remarks on 1 March 2023, Yoon said that Japan had gone from 'aggressor to partner'.[78] On 16 March 2023 Kishida held a summit with Yoon in Tokyo to settle war time labor disputes, among other issues.[79][80]\n\n\nOn 7 May 2023, Kishida arrived in Seoul for a two day trip to South Korea.[81] The reciprocal trip was the first between leaders of Japan and South Korea in 12 years.[82] During his visit, Yoon said that the historical issues had to be \"completely settled\".[83] While in Seoul, Kishida expressed sympathies to Koreans who lived under the Japanese Empire.[84] Kishida was criticized by some in South Korea for not directly apologizing during the meeting.[85] The meetings were praised by US President Joe Biden, calling it a \"groundbreaking new chapter of cooperation and partnership\" between both nations.[86]\n\n\nKishida invited President Yoon to attend the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima as an invitee.[54] President Biden also invited Kishida and Yoon to meet in Washington D.C. during the G7 Hiroshima summit for further talks.[87] Kishida met with Yoon and Biden on 18 August during a historic summit hosted by Biden at Camp David in the United States. The three announced the Camp David Principles, a set of strategies to counter the influence of China, North Korea, and Russia as well as limit the risk of economic disruptions in the future.[88] All three nations agreed to further expand military ties, which involved intelligence sharing, annual military drills, and a wider security pact.[89] Biden again praised both leaders for their \"...political courage... to work together.\"[90] The summit additionally reaffirmed a shared goal of a \"free and open Indo-Pacific\", a concept first introduced by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2016.[91] During the summit, Kishida also promised Biden $2 million in relief aid for the wildfires in Hawaii.[92] The summit was a first of its kind and was hailed as the beginning of a new era by the US.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Africa\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with Kenyan President William Ruto, 2 May 2023\nKishida has attempted to deepen ties between Japan and African nations, while also promoting peace and stability in the region. In August 2022, while addressing a summit in Tunisia, Kishida promised $30 billion in aid for the development of African countries for the next 3 years.[94][95]\n\n\nLater on 30 April 2023, Kishida began an African tour and visited the League of Arab States based in Egypt, and met with President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi; Kishida offered a yen loan to fund a metro line project in Cairo.[96] The next day on 1 May, Kishida visited Ghana. During a meeting with President Nana Akufo-Addo, Kishida emphasized the importance of Japanese investment in the country, and bilateral relations in the international arena.[97] Ghana and Japan both agreed to pursue reforms in the UN Security Council as well.[98] While in Ghana, Kishida pledged $500 million in more financial aid to Africa, in perceived contrast from China's Belt and Road Initiative in the continent.[99] On 3 May, Kishida arrived in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. He met with Kenyan President William Ruto, who agreed to deepen cooperation and to bolster economic and energy ties.[100] The two condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and reiterated their desire for a peaceful Indo-Pacific.[101] Kishida announced that Japan would continue to give assistance for infrastructure in Kenya. Ruto and Kishida signed an agreement allowing Kenyans to access jobs in Japan, bolstering economic relations.[102]\n\n\n\n### Assassination of Shinzo Abe and cabinet reshuffle\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Assassination of Shinzo Abe and Second Kishida Cabinet (First Reshuffle)\n\n![](image)Kishida delivering the memorial address at the state funeral of Shinzo Abe\nAfter the assassination of Shinzo Abe on 8 July 2022, Kishida condemned the assassination,[103] but refused to suspend political campaigning so as to demonstrate that democracy would not be impeded by violence. He later blamed insufficient police protection for allowing the murder to occur.[104] Because of media reports on the ties between the LDP and the Unification Church, a Korean cult accused of scamming Japanese followers (including the suspect's mother) out of much of their wealth, Kishida reshuffled his Cabinet on 10 August 2022, which included removing Abe's brother, Nobuo Kishi, from the role of Minister of Defense.[105] Taro Kono was made the Minister of Digital Affairs. While the majority of members of the LDP, including Shinzo Abe and Nobuo Kishi, were related to the church to various degrees, there were no evidences of Kishida having any direct tie with the church or any of its affiliated entities.[106] However, it was reported in the 1 September issue of *Sh\u016bkan Bunshun* that Mineo Nakayama\u00a0[ja], the president of a Kumamoto circle for backing Kishida's bid for the premiership, was also a chairperson of a Unification Church-affiliated group which was advocating for building the Japan-Korea Undersea Tunnel. Both Kishida and Nakayama denied any knowledge of the tunnel advocacy group being related to the Unification Church.[107]\n\n\n\n### Assassination attempt\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Attempted assassination of Fumio Kishida\n\nSee also: 2023 Japan by-elections\n![](image)Kishida (the day after the attack) during a press conference\nOn 15 April 2023, a man threw a cylindrical explosive at Kishida shortly before he was due to make a campaign speech in Wakayama. The device exploded after a short delay during which Kishida was evacuated from the scene unharmed. Ryuji Kimura, a 24-year-old man from Hyogo Prefecture, was arrested at the scene, with cameras showing him holding what appeared to be a second cylindrical object as he was tackled to the ground. The incident took place as Kishida was talking with a candidate of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party just before his scheduled speech. Kishida immediately left by car after the incident and continued with his stump speech elsewhere in the city. He stated at an event later in the day that \"elections are a bedrock of democracy,\" adding that it was extremely unforgivable that such violence took place.[108][109] Kimura was indicted by Wakayama prosecutors on 7 September 2023 for attempted murder, among other charges.[110]\n\n\n\n### Fukushima water release\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Discharge of radioactive water of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant\n\nIn April 2021, the government of Yoshihide Suga, Kishida's predecessor, announced that the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) would eventually begin to discharge stored and treated water from the dismantled Fukushima nuclear plant into the ocean, a process that would take 30 years.[111] Kishida's government confirmed they would continue with the water release, in August 2023.[112] Proceeding the water dump, Kishida's government reached an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the levels of tritium in the stored water that would be discharged, and received a comprehensive report affirming the safety of the operation from Rafael Grossi, the IAEA's Secretary-General, in July 2023.[113] Later in August, Grossi stated that the levels of tritium were vastly below the safety standards recommended by the IAEA, and confirmed the water wasn't toxic.[114] Before the dumping, the Ministry of Environment confirmed IAEA standards were being followed, and the levels of radioactive tritium in the water would remain below IAEA dilution regulations.[115] TEPCO announced that dumping had begun on 24 August 2023, beginning the discharge of the water. No errors were reported in the release.[116]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kishida inspecting the Fukushima nuclear plant, 20 August 2023.\nFollowing the announcement of the water release, there was positive and negative feedback from both inside Japan and internationally. Domestic organizations, such as the National Federation of Fisheries Cooperative Associations, were opposed to the plan.[112] The strongest foreign backlash came from China, which was opposed to the dumping. The Chinese central government placed an outright ban on all Japanese fish products, which accounted for the largest of Japan's fish exports.[117] China was heavily criticized for the ban, and was also accused of hypocrisy and spreading disinformation, as they had released nuclear waste water previously that contained significantly higher levels of tritium.[118] In the days following the release, a number of phone calls regarding the water release from Chinese speakers were made harassing people, companies, and government agencies in Japan.[119] Kishida said the calls were \"deplorable\", and appealed to China to urge its government to ask its citizens to stop the harassing calls.[120] The phone calls came as protests occurred\u00a0 in China, as well in South Korea and Japan.[121] The Foreign Ministry issued a travel advisory urging Japanese citizens to use caution in China, citing an escalation of harassments and violent protests. Sanae Takaichi, the Minister of State for Economic Security, said the government would consider filing a World Trade Organization complaint in response to the import bans imposed by China.[122] The United States affirmed their support for the water release; American ambassador Rahm Emanuel even visited Fukushima and ate seafood to demonstrate a show of support.[123] In South Korea, various protest were held against the decision. However, the South Korean government did not oppose the plan, and President Yoon also ate seafood from Fukushima to encourage others that it was safe.[124]\n\n\nThrough the early stages of the release, the Environment Ministry conducted numerous tests concerning the levels of tritium in the water as well as in the fish, and stated the levels remained low.[125] The effects on the fish markets were expected to be severe, and Kishida promised to financially support local fisheries.[126] On August 30, Kishida, along with three cabinet ministers, publicly ate fish sashimi from Fukushima in an effort to dispel fears of radioactive contamination.[127] He called it \"safe and delicious\".[128]\n\n\n\n## Political views\n\n[edit]\n\nKishida is the leader of the moderate K\u014dchikai faction.[1][129] and has been described as a moderate conservative[130] and a centrist politician.[131][10]\n\n\nIn the Diet he is president of the parliamentary league for Public Interest Capitalism[132] and the parliamentary league to Create a New Capitalism,[133] is associated with the Nippon Kaigi parliamentary league[134] and is a founding member of the \"Realization of Selective Surnames System\" Diet group which has the aim of allowing married couples to keep different surnames if they wish.[135]\n\n\n\n### Economic policy\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 2021 LDP presidential race, he called for Japan to strive for a new form of capitalism to reduce income disparity, saying neoliberalism and deregulation had widened economic gaps in society.[136][137] In a parliamentary session on 20 February 2022 he reiterated that the benefits of growth should not belong to a limited group adding that \"[c]apitalism isn't sustainable unless it is something that belongs to all stakeholders\".[138]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, February 2017Kishida is seen as dovish on foreign policy and lukewarm about revising Japan's pacifist constitution.[139][1] Following the political philosophy of his own faction, Kishida has pledged a \"humane diplomacy\" based on the Peace Constitution, the Japan\u2013U.S. alliance, and the Self-Defense Forces and that he will seek to strengthen Japan\u2013U.S. relations and to promote the free and open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy while counterbalancing Chinese political assertiveness and military presence in the region.[1] Regarding Chinese influence over Taiwan and Hong Kong, Kishida has stated that the Taiwan Strait may be the \"next major diplomatic problem\" following \"China's clampdown on Hong Kong\" and that Japan should seek more cooperation with Taiwan.[140]\n\n\nIn 2017, while serving as foreign minister, Kishida pressured China to push North Korea towards denuclearization.[141] During the race for the leadership of the LDP, Kishida also addressed the issue of Japanese abductees by North Korea and supported a summit between Japan and North Korea to end the issue.[142] Kishida also took a stronger stance than other contenders regarding China and North Korea, saying that Japan should strengthen its defenses, while at the same time recognizing that there is a clash between authoritarianism and democracy in the region, especially with regard to the status of Taiwan.[143]\n\n\nFumio Kishida has requested that the German government remove Friedensstatue\u00a0[de], a variant of the Statue of Peace, in Berlin. The request has caused considerable controversy in South Korea.[144][145][146][147]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear policy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kishida delivering a speech in October 2017Kishida is in favor of retaining nuclear power technology, which he says should be considered as a clean energy option, while also calling for the establishment of a $90.7 billion university fund to further stimulate science and promotion of renewable energy.[136]\n\n\nBeing a representative from Hiroshima, Kishida has consistently advocated for Japanese diplomacy to promote nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).[1] In the wake of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kishida rejected former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's proposal for Japan to consider hosting U.S. nuclear weapons as a deterrent, calling it \"unacceptable\" given the country's stance of maintaining the three non-nuclear principles.[148]\n\n\n\n### Social issues\n\n[edit]\n\nKishida stated support for discussions toward allowing married Japanese couples to choose between unified single surnames or separate last names,[149] while on the topic of same-sex marriage Kishida has stated he has not come to support it, saying instead that the public's opinion should be understood before the Diet decides.[150][151] In 2023 he stated that Japan must \"be extremely careful in considering the matter as it could affect the structure of family life in Japan\".[152] In the Diet's budget committee on February 28, 2023, responding to an opposition lawmaker question, he stated that \"I don't think disallowing same-sex couples to marry is unjust discrimination by the state\", repeating his position that a same-sex marriage ban \"is not unconstitutional\" and denying that he is discriminatory adding \"I have never stated I'm against it\". His comment sparked criticism from opposition lawmakers and LGBTQ activists, who questioned whether Kishida was backpedaling from an earlier meeting that month with LGBTQ representatives to show consideration to ultra-conservatives in his party who oppose sexual diversity.[153]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1988, Kishida married Yuko Kishida, the daughter of a Japanese real estate investor, in an arranged marriage. The couple have three sons.[154] In one presentation, Yuko was featured in the LDP messaging immediately after he became the *de facto* PM-designate.[8][155] He is a fan of the manga series *Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba* and has pledged to financially support the Japanese animation industry during his premiership.[156] He is also a fan of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp baseball team.[10]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Kishida dismissed his eldest son, Shotaro Kishida, from his role as policy secretary, effective 1 June 2023, for misuse of government resources.[157] Photos had surfaced of Shotaro hosting parties at the Prime Minister's official residence and of him posing as the Prime Minister. Chief Cabinet Secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, called the actions \"inappropriate\".[158]\n\n\n\n## Honours\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau (29 October 2014).[159]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Spain: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (31 March 2017)[160]\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Akimoto, Daisuke (7 September 2021). \"The Arrival of Kishida Diplomacy?\". *The Diplomat*.

He is the former husband of Titiek Suharto, the late President Suharto's second daughter. They were married in 1983 and divorced in 1998 during the Indonesian political crisis.[3]\n\n\nPrabowo graduated from the Indonesian Military Academy in 1970 and served in the Special Forces (Kopassus) until his appointment as chief of the Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad) in 1998. That same year, he was dishonorably discharged from the military and subsequently banned from entering the United States because of alleged human rights violations. He has been described as a right-wing nationalist.[4][5][6]\n\n\nIn early 2008, Prabowo's inner circle, including Fadli Zon, established the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra). In the 2009 presidential election, he ran unsuccessfully for the vice-presidency as Megawati Sukarnoputri's running mate.[7] He contested the 2014 presidential election[8] and was defeated by Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo, which he initially disputed.[9] He made another unsuccessful run for the presidency in 2019 with Sandiaga Uno as his running mate and with the support of Gerindra, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), the National Mandate Party (PAN), the Democratic Party and Berkarya Party.[10][11] His refusal to accept the result saw his followers stage protests that sparked deadly riots in Jakarta.[12]\n\n\nOn 10 October 2021, Gerindra announced Prabowo as their candidate in the 2024 Indonesian presidential election.[13] In June 2022, Prabowo initially declined the party's nomination, stating that he wanted to give the opportunity to another politician to run for the presidency.[14][15] Despite his declining the bid, Gerindra insisted on his nomination.[16] On 12 August 2022, Prabowo announced that he accepted Gerindra's nomination to contest the 2024 presidential election.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Prabowo, 12 years old (standing right), with his siblings and grandparents, Margono Djojohadikusumo and Siti Katoemi Wirodihardjo\nPrabowo's father, Sumitro Djojohadikusumo (1917\u20132001), was an economist who served as former President Suharto's minister for the economy and minister for research and technology.[18] Sumitro named Prabowo after his own younger brother, a martyr hero who died in a battle against the Japanese in Lengkong, Tangerang during the Indonesian National Revolution.[19] Prabowo's mother, Dora Maria Sigar (1921\u20132008), was a Protestant Christian of Minahasan descent, who originated from the Sigar-Maengkom family in Langowan, North Sulawesi.[20] They were married in Utrecht, Netherlands.[21]\n\n\nPrabowo has two older sisters, Bianti Djiwandono, who was born in 1948, and Maryani Djojohadikusumo, who was born in 1950.[21] His only brother, Hashim Djojohadikusumo, was born in 1954.[21] They were descendants of Prince Diponegoro.[21] Prabowo's eldest sister, Bianti, is married to Joseph Soedradjad Djiwandono, Governor of Bank Indonesia from 1993 until 1998. While her older sister, Maryani, is married to Didier Leaistre, an entrepreneur from France.[21] Hashim's *pribumi* conglomerate business interests stretch from Indonesia to Canada and Russia.[22] Between 1966 and 1968, the family lived in London, where Prabowo attended and graduated from The American School in London.[23] Sumitro subsequently encouraged his son to attend a military academy. One of Prabowo's role models was Turkish military figure Atat\u00fcrk, and according to peers and observers, Prabowo was talented with a passion for stratagems and had an appetite for political power.[19]\n\n\nPrabowo's grandfather, Margono Djojohadikusumo, was the founder of Bank Negara Indonesia, the first leader of Indonesia's Provisional Supreme Advisory Council (*Dewan Pertimbangan Agung Sementara*), and a member of the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (*Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan* ).[24]\n\n\nPrabowo married Suharto's daughter, Siti Hediati Hariyadi, in 1983. They have a son, Didit Hediprasetyo, who lived in Boston before settling in Paris to pursue a career in design. Prabowo is uncle to Rahayu Saraswati Djojohadikusumo.[25]\n\n\n\n## Military career\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Indonesian occupation of East Timor and Papua conflict\n\nPrabowo enrolled in Indonesia's Military Academy in Magelang in 1970.[26] He graduated in 1974 with others who would gain senior leadership positions such as Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.[26]\n\n\nIn 1976, Prabowo served in the Indonesian National Army Special Force *Kopassus* and was assigned as the commander of Group 1 Komando Pasukan Sandhi Yudha (Kopassandha), which was one of the Indonesian Army's Nanggala commando units in East Timor, the former Portuguese territory that Indonesia had invaded the previous year.[26] Prabowo, then 26 years old, was the youngest Nanggala commander.[26] Prabowo led the mission to capture the vice president of Fretilin, who was the first Prime Minister of East Timor, Nicolau dos Reis Lobato.[26] Guiding Prabowo was Antonio Lobato \u2013 Nicolau's younger brother. On 31 December 1978, Prabowo's company found and fatally shot Nicolau in the stomach as he was being escorted in Maubisse, fifty kilometres south of Dili.[26]\n\n\nIn 1985 Prabowo attended the Advanced Infantry Officers Course at Fort Benning, in the United States for commando training.[27] In the early 1990s, as the commander of Kopassus Group 3, the now Major General Prabowo attempted to crush the East Timorese independence movement by using irregular troops (hooded \"ninja\" gangs dressed in black and operating at night) and, in main towns and villages, militias trained and directed by Kopassus commanders. Human rights abuses rose. The Army's 1997 campaign was called Operation Eradicate.[28]\n\n\nIn 1996, Prabowo led the Mapenduma Operation in the mountainous terrain of Papua, Indonesia. The goal of the operation was the release of 11 scientific researchers, who had been taken hostage by the Free Papua Movement (OPM). The researchers were five Indonesians, four Britons, one Dutchman and his pregnant German wife. Two of the Indonesian male hostages were killed shortly before the rescue operation. The mission involved covert support from British Military Attache and SAS veteran Colonel Ivor Helberg.[29] Following the hostage transfer, Kopassus under Prabowo began a reprisal campaign against villages perceived to support OPM, in one incident at Geselema village attacking the villagers with a military helicopter disguised as a Red Cross helicopter.[30]\n\n\nOn 20 March 1998, Prabowo was appointed head of the 27,000-strong Army Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad), that Suharto had commanded in 1965.[31]\n\n\n\n### Role in 1998 riots and the Fall of Suharto\n\n[edit]\n\nLess than three months after his appointment as head of Kostrad, on the first day of the May 1998 riots, Prabowo urged the commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces, Wiranto, to let him bring his Strategic Reserve units from outside Jakarta into the city to help restore order.[32] Hundreds of men trained by Kopassus (Prabowo's former command) were flown from Dili to Yogyakarta in chartered planes, and then on to Jakarta by train.[33] Prabowo publicly urged Indonesians to join him to fight \"traitors to the nation\".[34] On the morning of 14 May, Kopassus troops escorted young thugs from Lampung in southern Sumatra into the capital.[35] Thus Prabowo was accused of using his contacts in his former command to import and create trouble, while Wiranto had declined to give Prabowo's current command, Kostrad, permission to quell the existing trouble, in line with classic Javanese tactic to stir chaos to discredit a rival and/or seize power.[33]\n\n\nTroops under Prabowo's command kidnapped and tortured at least nine democracy activists in the months before the May 1998 Riots.[36] In one testimony, a former detainee told of being tortured for days in an unidentified location, allegedly a military camp where most of their time was spent blindfolded, while being forced to answer repeated questions, mainly concerning their political activities. The abuse included being punched, terrorised physically and mentally, and given electric shocks.[37] Later, in 2009, two of the nine men were candidates for Gerindra, Prabowo's political party, and another served as his media adviser.[38] Prabowo was also suspected of organising the kidnappings of another 13 activists (all of whom remain \"missing\") between February 1997 and May 1998.[39]\n\n\nLater investigations into the May riots revealed that violence in Jakarta was the result of an internal struggle within the military elite to become Suharto's successor.[40] Many believed Prabowo, as Strategic Reserve commander, sought to become his father-in-law's successor and coveted the commander of the Armed Forces position held by General Wiranto, who was favoured to succeed Suharto. Together with Operations Commander for Greater Jakarta (**Panglima Komando Operasi Jakarta Raya**, Pangkoops Jaya) Major General Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, Prabowo aimed to terrorise opponents of the government and to show that Wiranto was \"an incompetent commander who could not control disorder\".[41][42] During August and September, the fact-finding team interviewed Prabowo, Sjafrie, and other military commanders regarding their movements during the Jakarta riots. Prabowo asserted that he was unsure of the precise movements of military forces in the capital and deferred to Sjafrie.[43] In its final report, the fact-finding team suspected that, on the night of 14 May, Prabowo met with several Armed Forces and prominent civilian figures at the Kostrad headquarters to discuss organization of the violence.[44] However, this was later refuted by several people who attended the meeting, including prominent human rights lawyer Adnan Buyung Nasution and Joint Fact-Finding Team member Bambang Widjojanto.[45] Further testimonies by Prabowo[46] in the years following the investigation contradicted the team's report and led to scepticism of the team's allegations.[47]\n\n\nOn 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation from the presidency and Vice President B. J. Habibie took over as president.\n\n\nOn the afternoon following Habibie's inauguration as president, Prabowo demanded of Habibie that he be put in charge of the Army in place of Wiranto. However, Habibie and Wiranto demoted Prabowo from Kostrad commander instead, and the following day, announced Wiranto's promotion to Minister of Defense and Security and the Indonesian National Armed Forces (ABRI, later renamed TNI) commander. A furious Prabowo went to the Presidential Palace packing a sidearm and with trucks of his Kostrad troops. On being blocked from entering the Habibie's office, he instead went to Suharto who rebuked him.[48][49][50][51] Prabowo was visited by Wiranto at his home over the weekend of 23\u201324 May and subsequently reassigned to a non-combat role at the Armed Forces Command and General Staff College in Bandung.[52]\n\n\nFollowing an ABRI investigation,[53] Prabowo acknowledged responsibility for the kidnapping of the activists.[54] He was discharged from military service in August. He and Wiranto denied that the discharge was a result of disciplinary action.[55] In August 1998, the Dewan Kehormatan Perwira (Officers Council of Honor) tried and found Prabowo guilty of \"misinterpreting orders\" in the kidnapping of anti-Suharto activists in 1998.[53] He was discharged from military services and went into a voluntary exile in Jordan[55] where he knew that country's new young King Abdullah as a fellow commander of special forces.[54] In an interview with *Asiaweek* magazine in 2000, Prabowo said \"I never threatened Habibie. I was not behind the riots. That is a great lie. I never betrayed Pak Harto. I never betrayed Habibie. I never betrayed my country...There was a certain group that wanted to make me a scapegoat, maybe to hide their involvement.\"[53] Rights groups have long questioned Prabowo's eligibility to run for president, noting that he was discharged dishonorably from the Army in August 1998 for \"misinterpreting orders\" in the abduction of the democracy activists. While that was the military's official statement, observers have long believed that it was a coup conspiracy that saw Prabowo, then the commander of the Army Strategic Reserves, given his marching orders.[56]\n\n\nAs a 2014 presidential candidate, Prabowo's past came under renewed scrutiny, with many organizations calling for him to step down. On 19 April, he was critized by a poet made by Fahmi Habcyi which linked him to the disappearance of Widji Thukul and urged him to return Thukul as his wife is devastated hoping for her husband to return.[57] A coalition, which consisted of Imparsial, Kontras, the Setara Institute, and the Human Rights Working Group (HRWG), combined under the Civil Society Coalition Against Forgetting, visited the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) in Jakarta on 7 May 2014 to urge the commission to re-investigate Prabowo.[58] A 27 June 2014 report indicated that an investigative journalist, Allan Nairn, had been threatened with arrest \"for revealing the former general's role in human rights abuses.\"[59]\n\n\n\n## Business career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter being discharged from the military, Prabowo joined his brother Hashim Djojohadikusumo's business. He purchased Kiani Kertas, a paper pulp and plantation company based in Mangkajang, East Kalimantan.[60] Prior to Prabowo's purchase, Kiani was owned by Bob Hasan, a businessman close to former President Suharto.[60] Today, Prabowo's Nusantara Group controls 27 companies in Indonesia and abroad. Prabowo's companies include Nusantara Energy (oil and natural gas, coal), Tidar Kerinci Agung (palm oil plantations) and Jaladri Nusantara (fishery industry).[61]\n\n\nPrabowo rebranded Kiani Kertas to Kertas Nusantara. The company was established in 1990 and is part of the Nusantara Energy. It controls an area of 3,400 hectares used for paper mills, employee housing, private schools, and various company facilities.[62] Kiani has been awarded ISO 900\u20132005 status as one of the highest quality management companies. It is reported that Kiani Kertas has been experiencing financial difficulties, and in early 2014, workers took to the streets to demand their wages which had not been paid in five months.[63]\n\n\nPrabowo was the wealthiest presidential candidate in the 2009 election, with assets of Rp 1.5\u00a0trillion (about US$150\u00a0million) and US$7.5\u00a0million.[64]\n\n\nIn 2007, PT Ridlatama, whose majority stakeholder was British-based Churchill PLC, conducted a geo-survey eastern Kalimantan for coal. Two months after the survey yielded positive results, East Kutai officials granted mining licenses to Nusantara Energy (a subsidiary of the Nusantara Group, a conglomerate owned by Prabowo's family) to operate in the area surveyed by Ridlatama. In 2010, Ridlatama's license was revoked, effectively completing Nusantara's take over of Churchill's operations. Churchill appealed to the Supreme Court of Indonesia but lost the case. In 2012, Churchill filed a case against the government of Indonesia at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, demanding $2\u00a0billion in compensation. Indonesia argued that ICSID had no authority to arbitrate. In 2014 ICSID ruled that it had the authority and the case is still ongoing.[65][66][67][68]\n\n\nIn 2014, the regent of East Kutai, Isran Noor, publicly endorsed Prabowo as a presidential candidate.[69] He also considered pressing criminal charges against Churchill, alleging that Churchill forged its license.[70]\n\n\n\n## NGOs\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Prabowo opens the 2011 Pencak Silat SEA Games tournament held in Taman Mini, Jakarta. He is the Chairman of Indonesia's pencak silat organization. \n* The Indonesian Farmers' Association was established in 1973 to advocate for the farmers' rights. Prabowo was elected President of HKTI in 2004,[71][72] and he was reappointed in 2010 for a second term.[73]\n* The Indonesian Traditional Market Traders Association (APPSI) is a non-profit organization advocating for the welfare of traders in Indonesia's traditional markets. Prabowo was elected as president of APPSI in 2008.[74]\n* Pencak silat is one of Indonesia's traditional martial arts. The Indonesian Pencak Silat Association (IPSI) oversees the regulation of the sport in Indonesia, develops athletes, and organises tournaments. Prabowo was elected as president of IPSI in 2004 and was re-elected in 2012 for a third consecutive term.[75]\n\n\n## Politics\n\n[edit]\n\nUsing his connections to President Suharto, Prabowo and his brother worked to silence journalistic and political critics in the 1990s. Hashim unsuccessfully pressured Goenawan Mohamad to sell his outspoken and banned *Tempo* magazine to him.[76] As a lieutenant colonel, Prabowo invited Gus Dur to his battalion headquarters in 1992 and warned him to stick to religion and to stay out of politics, or face unspecified actions if he continued to oppose the president.[77] He later warned the intellectual Nurcholish Madjid (Cak Nur) to resign from the KIPP, the election monitoring unit set up by Goenawan Mohamad, which armed forces commander Feisal Tanjung had denounced as \"obviously unconstitutional\".[78]\n\n\nIn 2004, Prabowo was one of five contenders vying to become Golkar party's presidential candidate. He received the lowest number of votes, just 39, and was eliminated in the first round.[79] The second round of voting was won by Wiranto.\n\n\n\n### Establishment of the Great Indonesia Movement Party\n\n[edit]\n\nIn early 2008, Prabowo's inner circle, including Fadli Zon, established the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), which nominated Prabowo for the presidency in the 2009 elections.[80] However, having won 26 out of 560 seats in the Indonesian parliament, the party did not have the required numbers, and Prabowo ran as a vice presidential candidate to Megawati Soekarnoputri, daughter of Indonesia's first president Sukarno. The pair, referred to colloquially by the Indonesian media as *Mega\u2013Pro*, earned 27% of the vote and lost to Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his running mate, economist Boediono.[81]\n\n\n\n### 2014 presidential election\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 2014 Indonesian presidential election\n\nIn November 2011, Prabowo announced his intention to run in the 2014 presidential elections.[8] Surveys published by the Center for Policy Studies and Strategic Development (Puskaptis)[82] and by the Indonesian Survey Institute published on 23 February 2012[83] gave him the lead \u2013 but observers and activists cast doubt on the polls.[84]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Gerindra named Prabowo its 2014 presidential candidate.[85] The party's slogan was then changed to *Gerindra Menang Prabowo Presiden* (Gerindra Wins, Prabowo Becomes President).[86] Prabowo said he would run an investment-friendly administration if he won and that Indonesia needed more energy exploration. Furthermore, he said he had been in close contact with labour unions and believed rising worker discontent could be managed with a wise national budget.[87] He promised to use military-style efficiency to push through chronically delayed infrastructure projects, as well as to create jobs in the archipelago's backwaters by improving agricultural productivity.[88] Another pillar to Prabowo's platform was that he was solidly secular, and his party planned to protect the rights of minority religious groups in the Muslim-majority country.[88]\n\n\nAccording to numerous quick counts after the 9 April legislative election, Gerinda came in third place, positioning Prabowo as one of two leading presidential candidates for the election to be held 9 July, the other being Jakarta governor, Joko Widodo.[89] On Tuesday, 20 May 2014, Golkar, along with the United Development Party (PPP), the National Mandate Party (PAN), the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), and the Crescent Star Party (PBB), officially endorsed Prabowo to run for the 2014 presidential election; the coalition collected 48.9% of votes and 52.1 seats in the parliament.[90] The day before, Prabowo had picked former Coordinating Minister for Economics Hatta Rajasa as his vice-presidential running mate.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prabowo accepts the Great Indonesia Party's nomination for the 2014 presidential election in Lembah Hambalang, on 17 March 2012[85]\nOn 22 July 2014, the day that the KPU was due to announce its official tally, Prabowo withdrew from the race after having insisted on his victory since the initial quick counts were released, although the majority showed Jokowi ahead. He attributed this withdrawal to Indonesia \"fail[ing] in its duty to democracy\" because of \"massive cheating that is structured and systematic\",[92] and stated that he and Hatta \"exercise our constitutional right to reject the presidential election and declare it unconstitutional\".[93] His speech, aired live, implied he would challenge the results in the Constitutional Court.[92] Later reports indicated confusion over whether Prabowo had resigned from the election or simply rejected the count.[94]\n\n\nAccording to Douglas Ramage of the Jakarta-based Bower's Asia Group, this was the first time since *reformasi* began in 1998 that the legitimacy of an election was questioned; he declared the country was entering \"uncharted territory\".[93] The legality of a Prabowo challenge is questionable, as \u2013 if he withdrew \u2013 he is no longer considered a presidential candidate.[93] If he can make the challenge, according to *The Jakarta Post*, the gap between the two is sufficient to make such a challenge difficult.[95] Under the presidential election law, Prabowo could face up to six years in prison and a 100\u00a0billion rupiah ($10\u00a0million) fine for withdrawing.[92][93] Later that evening, Joko Widodo was officially announced as president and began to receive congratulations from world leaders.[96]\n\n\nFollowing the announcement, the value of the Indonesian rupiah dropped by 0.3%, and the JSX Composite fell by 0.9%.[94] Observers denied Prabowo's allegations of cheating, finding that the elections were \"generally fair and free\"; Maswadi Rauf of the University of Indonesia stated that there was \"no sign of significant fraud\", and that Prabowo's withdrawal simply reflected \"the real attitudes of the elite, who are not yet ready to accept losing\".[97] On 21 August 2014, the Indonesian Constitutional Court rejected his claim of fraud, confirming his election loss.[98]\n\n\n\n### 2019 presidential election\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Prabowo Subianto 2019 presidential campaign\n\nOn 12 April 2018, Prabowo announced he would contest Indonesia's 2019 presidential election if he could obtain sufficient support from other political parties.[99] Indonesian media had speculated on whether Prabowo would become a presidential candidate or a \"king-maker\" giving his support to another candidate.[100] Prabowo's brother Hashim in March 2018 said health and logistical factors had to be considered before the party announces a presidential candidate.[101]\n\n\nIn April 2018, John McBeth reported Maritime Coordinating Minister Luhut Panjaitan had held a series of meetings with Prabowo, culminating in the proposal of a joint Widodo-Prabowo ticket for the 2019 election. Luhut reportedly lost his enthusiasm after Prabowo allegedly said he would want to be in charge of the military and seven seats in any new cabinet.[102] Fadli Zon denied Luhut and Prabowo had discussed politics, claiming they merely spoke about Europe's move to limit imports of Indonesian palm oil. Gerindra official Andre Rosiade also dismissed the report as a hoax.[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Prabowo and Indonesian President Joko Widodo on 11 October 2019\nOn 10 August 2018, Prabowo registered at the KPU office for the 2019 presidential election with Sandiaga Uno as his running mate and with the support of Gerindra, PKS, PAN, the Democratic Party and Berkarya Party.[10] The Democratic Party had wanted Prabowo to choose Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono as his running mate.[104] Following the election, 'quick counts' conducted at polling stations by independent institutions authorised by the government indicated Widodo had won by a margin of about 10%, but Prabowo claimed victory, insisting a real count by his side showed he received 62% of the vote.[105] His unsubstantiated claims of widespread cheating prompted his supporters to stage protests in Jakarta, resulting in riots that left eight people dead and 737 injured.[106][107] The Constitutional Court in June 2019 unanimously rejected Prabowo's appeal against the election result.[108]\n\n\nOn 23 October 2019, Prabowo was inaugurated as Indonesia's Minister of Defense by president Joko Widodo.[109]\n\n\n\n### Minister of Defense\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Prabowo with U.S. defense secretary Mark Esper in November 2019\n![](image)Prabowo inspecting Indonesian soldiers in October 2021\n![](image)Prabowo with U.S. defense secretary Lloyd Austin in June 2022\nShortly after his inauguration, Prabowo began advocating for a \"total people's war\" doctrine for Indonesia's national defense.[110]\n\n\nFollowing an incident in late 2019 where Chinese vessels violated Indonesian EEZ off the Natuna Islands, Prabowo called for a cautious response, referring to China as a \"friendly nation\",[111] for which he was criticised by netizens for being \"too soft\".[112] He also ordered the deployment of additional navy vessels in the region in response to the incident.[113]\n\n\nPrabowo is planning to massively expand Indonesia's domestic ability to manufacture ammunition, as Indonesia's capacity to manufacture is only 450 million ammunition per year, despite a demand at one billion ammunition annually.[114] Prabowo is looking to strengthen Indonesia's military by acquiring newer fighter aircraft such as General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon from the United States and Dassault Rafale from France.[115]\n\n\nDespite the controversy of his inaction in Natuna Island, a poll by Indo Barometer on early January show that Prabowo is the most popular minister in Jokowi's cabinet.[116]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Prabowo visited the United States despite his previous ban from entering the country, in his capacity as Minister of Defense after being invited by his US counterpart Mark Esper and a visa was issued for him. Several human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, had previously called for the Trump administration to cancel the visit.[117] Prior to this, Prabowo also visited China in December 2019.[118]\n\n\nOn 3 June 2023, Prabowo proposed a multi-point peace plan to end the war between Russia and Ukraine at a defense summit in Singapore.[119][120] Prabowo's proposal was criticised by EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov.[121]\n\n\n\n### 2024 presidential election\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Prabowo Subianto 2024 presidential campaign\n\nOn 7 January 2023, Prabowo launched his presidential campaign.[122]\n\n\n\n## Controversies\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies**.

A video clip of the speech was posted to Gerindra's official Facebook page on 18 March 2018. When asked which studies Prabowo was referring to, Gerindra official Elnino M. Husein Mohi said, \"Prabowo has read various writings of people that are outside the country, intellectual observers that exist. You can also see them online.\"[124] It was subsequently revealed the \"studies\" were actually a 2015 science-fiction war novel called *Ghost Fleet* by American authors August Cole and P.W. Singer. A note by the authors at the start of the book states: \"The following was inspired by real-world trends and technologies. But, ultimately, it is a work of fiction, not prediction.\"[125] Bemused by Prabowo citing the book, Singer posted on Twitter: \"Indonesian opposition leader cites #GhostFleet in fiery campaign speeches... There have been many unexpected twists and turns from this book experience, but this may take the cake.\"[126]\n\n\n\n### Haiti gaffe\n\n[edit]\n\nIn late 2018, Prabowo was ridiculed after erroneously stating that Haiti, a republic in the Caribbean, is an African country. In a speech made on 23 December 2018 in Solo, Central Java, Prabowo said the Indonesian government had driven part of Indonesia's wealth offshore. \"If this continues to go on, Indonesia will continue to be impoverished,\" he said. \"We, Indonesians, are on par with African impoverished countries such as Rwanda, Haiti, and small islands like Kiribati, which we don't even know where it's located,\" he added.[127]\n\n\n\n### 2019 presidential debate\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 17 January 2019, in the first debate between the candidates in Indonesia's April 2019 presidential election, Prabowo said some Indonesian governors deserve higher salaries considering the size of their provinces. He gave the example of Central Java province, which he claimed is larger than Malaysia (in population) . Local media reports pointed out that Central Java is 32,544.12 square kilometres, while Malaysia is 330,323 square kilometres.[128] After the media reported on the error, Prabowo's campaign team claimed he had actually been referring to the population totals of Malaysia and Central Java.[129]\n\n\nIn the same debate, Prabowo claimed that terrorist attacks in Indonesia were caused by poverty and perpetrated by non-Muslims disguised as Muslims, sent by other countries and controlled by foreigners. Media reports refuted his claims, pointing out that some Indonesian terrorist bombers were not poor and were not manipulated by foreigners.[130]\n\n\n\n## Honours\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image) Prabowo as chief of Indonesian Armed Forces Command and Staff School (Sesko ABRI) in his uniform with multiple decorations\nAs an Indonesian Army officer, Prabowo received the following awards and decorations:\n\n\n\n### National Honours\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![](image) Grand Meritorious Military Order Star, 1 Class (Template:Lang-id)\n* ![](image) Army Meritorius Service Star, 1 Class (Template:Lang-id)\n* ![](image) Navy Meritorius Service Star, 1 Class (Template:Lang-id)\n* ![](image) Air Force Meritorius Service Star, 1 Class (Template:Lang-id)\n* ![](image) Army Meritorius Service Star, 2nd Class (Template:Lang-id)\n* ![](image) Grand Meritorious Military Order Star, 3rd Class (Template:Lang-id)\n* ![](image) Army Meritorious Service Star, 3rd Class (Template:Lang-id)\n* ![](image) Military Long Service Medal, 24 Years (Template:Lang-id)\n* ![](image) Military Operation Service Medal in Aceh (Template:Lang-id)\n* ![](image) Military Instructor Service Medal (Template:Lang-id)\n* ![](image)![](image) Military Operation Service Medal IX Raksaka Dharma (Template:Lang-id) w/ 1 gold star\n* ![](image)![](image)![](image) Timor Military Campaign Medal (Template:Lang-id) w/ 2 gold star\n* ![](image) Role Model Medal (Template:Lang-id)\n\n\n### Foreign Honours\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Ribbon\n | Distinction\n | Country\n | Date\n | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Commander of the National Order of Merit | ![](image)\u00a0France | 1997\n | [131] |\n| ![](image) | Knight of the Royal Order of Sahametrei | ![](image)\u00a0Cambodia | *Unknown* |  |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of Military Merit | ![](image)\u00a0Jordan | *Unknown* | [132] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Commander of the Order of Malacca | ![](image)\u00a0Malaysia | 26 July 2022\n | [133] |\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n### Citations\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Prasetia, Andhika; Rizqo, Kanavino Ahmad (23 October 2019). \"Kenalkan Prabowo Jadi Menhan, Jokowi: Beliau Lebih Tahu Tugasnya dari Saya\".

A member of the Workers' Party, he previously served as the 35th president of Brazil from 2003 to 2010.[2]\n\n\nOf working-class origin, Lula migrated as a child from Pernambuco to S\u00e3o Paulo with his family. As a teenager, he began his career as a metalworker and became a trade unionist. During the military dictatorship in Brazil, he led major workers' strikes between 1978 and 1980, and helped start the Workers' Party in 1980, during Brazil's political opening. Lula was one of the main leaders of the Diretas J\u00e1 movement, which demanded democratic elections. In the 1986 Brazilian legislative election, he was elected as a federal deputy in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, with the most votes nationwide. He ran his first major campaign in the 1989 Brazilian presidential election, losing in the second round to Fernando Collor de Mello. He went on to lose two other presidential elections in 1994 and 1998 to Fernando Henrique Cardoso, before becoming president in the 2002 Brazilian presidential election, in which he defeated Jos\u00e9 Serra in the runoff. In 2006,\nhe was re-elected as president, defeating Geraldo Alckmin in the second round.[3]\n\n\nDescribed as left-wing,[4][5][6] his first presidency, which coincided with the first pink tide in the region, was marked by the consolidation of social welfare programs such as Bolsa Fam\u00edlia and Fome Zero, which propelled Brazil to leave the United Nations' Hunger Map.[7] During his two terms in office, he undertook radical reforms in the country, which eventually led to growth in GDP, reduction in public debt and inflation, and helping 20 million Brazilians escape poverty.[8] Poverty, inequality, illiteracy, unemployment, infant mortality, and child labor rates fell significantly, while the minimum wage and average income increased, and access to school, university, and health care was expanded. He also played a prominent role in foreign policy, both on a regional level (as part of the BRICS) and as part of global trade and environmental negotiations.[9] Lula was considered one of the most popular politicians in the history of Brazil, and was one of the most popular in the world while president.[10][11][12] Although popular, his first term was marked by notable scandals, such as the Mensal\u00e3o scandal and Esc\u00e2ndalo dos sanguessugas\u00a0[pt]. After the 2010 Brazilian general election, he was succeeded by his former Chief of Staff, Dilma Rousseff.[13]\n\n\nAfter his first presidency, Lula remained active in politics, and began giving lectures in Brazil and abroad. In 2016, he was appointed as Rousseff's Chief of Staff, but the appointment was suspended by the Supreme Federal Court.[14][15] In July 2017, Lula was convicted on charges of money laundering and corruption in a controversial trial that was later nullified in April 2021 by the Supreme Court Justices, due to the court lacking proper jurisdiction over his case.[16][17] Lula attempted to run in the 2018 Brazilian presidential election but was disqualified under Brazil's Ficha Limpa law.[18] Before the annulment of his cases, he was sentenced to nine and a half years in prison, and after an unsuccessful appeal, Lula was arrested in April 2018 and spent 580 days in jail, until being released in November 2019, when the Supreme Federal Court ruled that his imprisonment was unlawful.[19][20][21][22] In March 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal judge presiding over the case, Sergio Moro, who served as Minister of Justice and Public Security in the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro,[23] was biased,[24] and all of the cases Moro had brought against Lula were annulled in June 2021. Following the court ruling, Lula was legally allowed to make another run for president in the 2022 elections, defeating Bolsonaro in the runoff.[25] He became the first Brazilian president to have been elected to a third term, and the first to have defeated an incumbent president in an election. At age 77, he was sworn in on 1 January 2023, as the oldest Brazilian president at the time of inauguration.[26][27][4] A week later, the Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes was attacked in an invasion led by pro-Bolsonaro rioters; Lula condemned the attack.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nLuiz In\u00e1cio da Silva was born on 27 October 1945 (registered with a date of birth of 6 October 1945) in Caet\u00e9s (then a district of Garanhuns), located 250\u00a0km (150 miles) from Recife, capital of Pernambuco, a state in the Northeast of Brazil. He was the seventh of eight children of Aristides In\u00e1cio da Silva and Eur\u00eddice Ferreira de Melo, a couple of farmers who experienced the famine in one of the poorest parts of the agreste.[28] Two weeks after Lula's birth, his father moved to Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo, with Valdomira Ferreira de G\u00f3is, a cousin of Eur\u00eddice. He was raised Roman Catholic.[29] Lula's mother was of Portuguese and partial Italian descent.[30]\n\n\nIn December 1952, when Lula was seven years old, his mother moved the family to S\u00e3o Paulo to rejoin her husband. After a journey of 13 days in a *pau-de-arara* (open truck bed), they arrived in Guaruj\u00e1 and discovered that Aristides had formed a second family with Valdomira. Aristides's two families lived in the same house for some time, but they did not get along very well, and four years later, Eur\u00eddice moved with her children to a small room behind a bar in S\u00e3o Paulo. After that, Lula rarely saw his father, who died an alcoholic in 1978.[31]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLula has been married three times. In 1969, he married Maria de Lourdes, who died of hepatitis in 1971 while pregnant with their first son, who also died.[32] In 1974, Lula had a daughter, Lurian, with his then girlfriend, Miriam Cordeiro. The two were never married, and he only began participating in his daughter's life when she was already a young adult.[33] In 1974, Lula married Marisa Let\u00edcia Rocco Casa, a widow, with whom he then had three sons. He also adopted Marisa's son from her first marriage. Lula and Marisa remained married for 43 years, until her death on 2 February 2017 after a stroke.[34] Still in 2017, he met and started a relationship with Ros\u00e2ngela da Silva, known as Janja, but it only became public in 2019 while he was serving time in jail in Curitiba, Paran\u00e1, due to corruption charges that were later dropped.[35] Lula and Janja married on 18 May 2022.[36]\n\n\n\n## Education and work\n\n[edit]\n\nLula has had little formal education. He did not learn to read until he was ten years old[37] and quit school after the second grade to work and help his family. His first job at age 8 was still in Guaruj\u00e1 as a street vendor.[3] When he was 12, he worked as shoeshiner and street vendor in S\u00e3o Paulo. In 1960, when he was 14, he got his first formal job in a warehouse.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula da Silva lost part of his left little finger in a work-related accident when he was a metalworker in the late 1960s\nIn 1961, he started working as an apprentice of press operator while studying in a vocational course in a metallurgical industry that produced screws. In this period, Lula had his first contact with strike movements.[39] After the movement failed in the negotiations, Lula left the company for another metallurgical industry. There, age 19, he lost his left pinkie finger in an accident, while working as a press operator in the factory.[37] After the accident, he had to run to several hospitals before he received medical attention. This experience increased his interest in participating in the Workers' Union. Around that time, he became involved in union activities and held several important union posts.[38][40]\n\n\n\n## Union career\n\n[edit]\n\nInspired by his brother Frei Chico, Lula joined the labour movement when he worked at Villares Metals S.A\u00a0[pt], rising steadily through the ranks. He was elected in 1975, and reelected in 1978, as president of the Steel Workers' Union of S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo and Diadema. Both cities are located in the ABCD Region, home to most of Brazil's automobile manufacturing facilities, including Ford, Volkswagen, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz and others, and are among the most industrialized in the country. In the late 1970s, when Brazil was under military rule, Lula helped organize union activities, including major strikes. Labour courts found the strikes illegal, and Lula was jailed for a month. Due to this, and like other people imprisoned for political activities under the military government, Lula was awarded a lifetime pension after the fall of the military regime.[41]\n\n\n\n## Political career\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula speaking at the plenary of the Chamber of Deputies in 1989\nOn 10 February 1980, a group of academics, intellectuals, and union leaders, including Lula, founded the *Partido dos Trabalhadores* (PT) or Workers' Party, a left-wing party with progressive ideas created in the midst of Brazil's military government.\n\n\nIn 1982, he added the nickname Lula to his legal name.[42] In 1983, he helped found the Central \u00danica dos Trabalhadores (CUT) union association. In 1984, PT and Lula joined the popular *Diretas J\u00e1!* (*Direct [Elections] Now!*) campaign, demanding a direct popular vote for the next Brazilian presidential election. According to the 1967 constitution, Presidents were at that time elected by both Houses of Congress in joint session, with representatives of all State Legislatures; this was widely recognised as a mere sham as, since the March 1964 coup d'\u00e9tat, each \"elected\" President had been a retired general chosen in a closed military caucus. Lula and the PT supported the public demand for a change in the electoral system. But the campaign was defeated by a vote in Congress that rejected an amendment calling direct elections for the following year, and, in 1985, a civilian president, Tancredo Neves, was elected by the same indirect procedure, with Lula's support. Only four years later, as a direct result of *Diretas J\u00e1!* and after years of popular struggle, the 1989 elections were the first in 29\u00a0years to elect a president by direct popular vote.\n\n\n\n### Elections\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula and mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo Jos\u00e9 Serra, whom he defeated in the 2002 presidential elections\nLula first ran for office in 1982, for the state government of S\u00e3o Paulo, and lost. In the 1986 elections, Lula won a seat in Congress with the most votes nationwide.[43] The Workers' Party helped write the country's post-military government Constitution, ensuring strong constitutional guarantees for workers' rights, but failed to achieve a proposed push for agrarian reform in the Constitutional text. Under Lula's leadership, the PT took a stance against the Constitution in the 1988 Constituent Assembly, reluctantly agreeing to sign the agreed draft at a later stage.\n\n\nIn 1989, still as a Congressman, Lula ran as the PT candidate in the first democratic elections for president since 1960. Lula and Leonel Brizola, two popular left-wing candidates, were expected to tie for first place. Lula was viewed as the more left-leaning of the two, advocating immediate land reform and a default on the external debt. A minor candidate, Fernando Collor de Mello, former governor of Alagoas, quickly amassed support among the nation's elite with a more business-friendly agenda. Collor became popular taking emphatic anti-corruption positions; he eventually beat Lula in the second round of the 1989 elections. In 1992, Collor resigned, under threat of impeachment for his alleged embezzlement of public money.\n\n\nLula refused to run for re-election as a Congressman in 1990, busying himself with expanding the Workers' Party organizations around the country. As the political scene in the 1990s came under the sway of the Brazilian real monetary stabilization plan, which ended decades of rampant inflation, former PSDB Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso defeated Lula in 1994 and again, by an even wider margin, in 1998.\n\n\nA 2010 article in *The Washington Post* said that, before winning the presidency, Lula had been a \"strident union organizer known for his bushy beard and Che Guevara T-shirts\".[44] In the 2002 campaign, Lula forswore both his informal clothing style and his platform plank of linking the payment of Brazil's foreign debt to a prior thorough audit. This last point had worried economists, businessmen and banks, who feared that even a partial Brazilian default along with the existing Argentine default would have a massive ripple effect through the world economy. Embracing political consultant Duda Mendon\u00e7a's advice to pursue a more media-friendly image, Lula led the field in the first round of the 2002 election, held on 6 October, with a nearly two-to-one margin over PSDB candidate Jos\u00e9 Serra. He then defeated Serra in the runoff, to become the country's first leftist president following the fall of the military dictatorship in Brazil, with 61.3 percent of the vote.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the 1 October 2006 general elections, Lula came within a few thousand votes of being reelected in a single round (to date, Cardoso is the only person to win a first-round victory since the return of direct elections in 1989). He faced a run-off on 29 October and won by a substantial margin over the PSDB's Geraldo Alckmin, albeit with a slightly smaller share of the vote than he'd won in the 2002 runoff (60.83 percent vs 61.3 percent).[45] In an interview published 26 August 2007, he said that he had no intention to seek a constitutional change so that he could run for a third consecutive term; he also said that he wanted \"to reach the end of [his] term in a strong position in order to influence the succession.\"[46]\n\n\nIn early September 2018, Brazil's top electoral court banned former president Lula da Silva from running for president on the 2018 general election due to his corruption conviction, in accordance with Lei da Ficha Limpa. Instead, Fernando Haddad ran for president on the Workers Party ticket and was defeated by Jair Bolsonaro, after securing nearly 45 percent of the popular vote in a run-off between the candidates.[47]\n\n\n\n## First presidency (2003\u20132011)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: First presidency of Lula da Silva\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nLula at the beginning of his first (left) and second term (right)\n\nLula served two terms as president from 2003 through 2010 and left office on 1 January 2011. During his farewell speech he said he felt an additional burden to prove that he could handle the presidency despite his humble beginnings. \"If I failed, it would be the workers' class which would be failing; it would be this country's poor who would be proving they did not have what it takes to rule.\"[48]\n\n\n\n### Political orientation\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of the politics series on |\n| Lulism |\n| ![Margaret Thatcher](image) |\n| Philosophy\n* **Social democracy**\n* **Social liberalism**\n\n\n* Anti-imperialism\n* Democratic socialism\n* Keynesianism\n* Left-wing populism\n* Liberal socialism\n* Globalisation\n* Socialism of the 21st century\n* Progressivism\n |\n| People\n* Dilma Rousseff\n* Jos\u00e9 Alencar\n* Ol\u00edvio Dutra\n* Jos\u00e9 Dirceu\n* Gleisi Hoffmann\n* Fernando Haddad\n* Chico Buarque\n* Guido Mantega\n* Celso Amorim\n |\n| Organisations\n* **Workers' Party**\n* Unified Workers' Central\n* Sao Paulo Forum\n* Community of Latin American and Caribbean States\n* Union of South American Nations\n* Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization\n |\n| * ![icon](image) Socialism portal\n* ![icon](image) Organised labour portal\n* ![icon](image) Politics portal\n* ![flag](image) Brazil portal\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n![](image)Lula climbs the ramp leading to the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto with Vice President Jos\u00e9 Alencar for the official ceremony marking the beginning of their second term in 2007.\nVery few of the proposed reforms were actually implemented during Lula's terms of office. Some wings of the Worker's Party disagreed with the increasing moderation in focus since the late eighties and have since left the party to form parties, such as the Workers' Cause Party, the United Socialist Workers' Party and during Lula's presidency the Socialism and Liberty Party. Alliances with old, traditional oligarch politicians, like former presidents Jos\u00e9 Sarney and Fernando Collor, have been a cause of disappointment for some.[49]\n\n\n\n### Social projects\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

From very early on his leading program was to eradicate hunger, following the lead of projects already put into practice by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, but expanded by the new *Fome Zero* (\"Zero Hunger\") program.[50] The program combined a series of programs with the goal of ending hunger in Brazil through the construction of water cisterns in Brazil's semi-arid region of Sert\u00e3o, countering teenage pregnancy, strengthening family agriculture, distributing a minimum amount of cash to the poor and many other measures.\n\n\nLula launched a housing aid program that was far superior in scope to the policies developed until then. More than 15 billion euros were invested in water purification and the urbanization of favelas, and more than 40 billion in housing. As a priority, the government proposed to relocate the poor populations that occupy the \"risk zones\", prone to floods or landslides, and then to extend the electricity network, to launch work to relocate the streets and to improve the precarious housing. The government undertook to democratize access to real estate credit.[51]\n\n\nDuring Lula's first term, child malnutrition decreased by 46%. In May 2010, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) awarded Lula da Silva the title of \"World Champion in the Fight against Hunger\".[52]\n\n\nThe largest assistance program was *Bolsa Fam\u00edlia* (Family Allowance), which was based upon the previous *Bolsa Escola* (School Allowance), which was conditional on school attendance, first introduced in the city of Campinas by then-mayor Jos\u00e9 Roberto Magalh\u00e3es Teixeira. Not long thereafter, other municipalities and states adopted similar programs. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso later federalized the program in 2001. In 2003, Lula formed *Bolsa Fam\u00edlia* by combining *Bolsa Escola* with additional allowances for food and kitchen gas. This was preceded by the creation of a new ministry \u2013 the Ministry of Social Development and Eradication of Hunger. This merger reduced administrative costs and bureaucratic complexity for both the families involved and the administration of the program.\n\n\n*Fome Zero* has a government budget and accepts donations from the private sector and international organizations. The *Bolsa Fam\u00edlia* program has been praised internationally for its achievements, despite internal criticism accusing it of having turned into an electoral weapon.\n\n\nAlong with projects such as *Fome Zero* and *Bolsa Fam\u00edlia*, another Lula administration flagship program was the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC). The PAC had a total budget of 646\u00a0billion reais ($367 billion) by 2010, and was the Lula administration's main investment program. It was intended to strengthen Brazil's infrastructure, and consequently to stimulate the private sector and create more jobs. The social and urban infrastructure sector was scheduled to receive 84.2\u00a0billion reais ($47.9 billion).\n\n\nA number of other social projects were introduced during Lula's first presidency.[53]\n\n\n\n### Education\n\n[edit]\n\nA number of educational initiatives were also launched during Lula's first presidency. A free school meals system was extended to reach 37 million pupils while a programme called \"University for All\" was launched which aimed to provide \"whole or partial remission of student fees for low-income students.\"[54] In 2006, a reform was introduced extending primary education from 8 to 9 years as a means of improving the accessibility of education for the poor. The total length of primary and secondary education in Brazil increased from 11 to 12 years as a result. A Fund for the Maintenance and Development of Basic Education (FUNDEB) was also set up to close the gap between the quality of education in public and private schools. A basic education development index to measure the quality of education in state schools was also introduced, which was based on a school pass rate and on the performance of pupils in a test of knowledge. The PED conditioned the disbursement of public funds to state schools on the schools' performance, and in 200 the government set aside $500 million for the PED and a further $3 billion for the 2008 \u2013 2010 period. The PED was also aimed at high schools and continuing education.[55]\n\n\n\n### Economy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula on a visit to the Brazilian Aluminium Company\n![](image)Construction site of the Santo Ant\u00f4nio Dam, with funding from the Growth Acceleration Program\nAs Lula gained strength in the run-up to the 2002 elections, the fear of drastic measures, and comparisons with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, increased internal market speculation. This led to some market hysteria, contributing to a drop in the value of the real, and a downgrade of Brazil's credit rating.[56]\n\n\nLula also chose Henrique Meirelles of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, a prominent market-oriented economist, as head of the Brazilian Central Bank. As a former CEO of the BankBoston he was well known to the market.[57] Meirelles was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 2002 as a member of the opposing PSDB, but resigned as deputy to become Governor of the Central Bank.[57]\n\n\nLula and his cabinet followed, to an extent, the lead of the previous government,[58] by renewing all agreements with the International Monetary Fund, which were signed by the time Argentina defaulted on its own deals in 2001. His government achieved a satisfactory primary budget surplus in the first two years, as required by the IMF agreement, exceeding the target for the third year. In late 2005, the government paid off its debt to the IMF in full, two years ahead of schedule.[59]\n\n\nThe Brazilian economy was generally not affected by the mensal\u00e3o scandal, which related to vote buying in the Brazilian Congress.[60] In early 2006, Antonio Palocci resigned as finance minister due to his involvement in an abuse of power scandal. Lula then appointed Guido Mantega, a member of the PT and an economist by profession, as finance minister. Mantega, a former Marxist who had written a PhD thesis (in Sociology) on the history of economic ideas in Brazil from a left-wing viewpoint, was known for his criticism of high interest rates, something he claimed satisfied banking interests. Mantega was also supportive of a higher level of employment by the state. Not long after the start of his second term, Lula's government announced the Growth Acceleration Program (**Programa de Acelera\u00e7\u00e3o de Crescimento**, PAC), an investment program to solve many of the problems that prevented the Brazilian economy from expanding more rapidly. The measures included investment in the creation and repair of roads and railways, simplification and reduction of taxation, and modernization of the country's energy production to avoid further shortages. The money pledged to be spent on this program was considered to be around R$ 500\u00a0billion (US\u00a0$260 billion) over four years. Prior to taking office, Lula had been a critic of privatization. His administration created public-private partnership concessions for seven federal roadways.[61]\n\n\nAfter decades with the largest foreign debt among emerging economies, Brazil became a net creditor for the first time in January 2008.[62] By mid-2008, both Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's had elevated the classification of Brazilian debt from speculative to investment grade. Banks made record profits under Lula's government.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula and his wife Marisa Let\u00edcia review troops during the 2007 Independence Day military parade.\nLula's second term was much more confident; Lula was then not only the undisputed object of popular affection, as the first president to bring a modest well-being to many people, but also in complete control of his own administration. His two leading ministers were gone. Palocci was no longer needed to calm the nerves of overseas investors and Lula had never liked and somewhat feared Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, a virtuoso of cold political calculation and intrigue. Their joint elimination freed Lula for sole command in Brasilia. When, midway through his second term its test came, he handled it with aplomb. The crash of Wall Street in 2008 might have been a tsunami in the US and Europe, he declared, but in Brazil it would be no more than a little 'ripple' (\"*uma marolinha*\"). The phrase was seized on by the Brazilian press as proof of reckless economic ignorance and irresponsibility.[64] In 2008, Brazil enjoyed economic good health to fight the global financial crisis with a large economic stimulus lasting, at least, until 2014.[65] The Lula administration's economic policies also helped to significantly raise living standards, with the percentage of Brazilians belonging to the consumerist middle class rising from 50% to 73% of the population.[*citation needed*] According to *The Washington Post*: \n\n\n> Under Lula, Brazil became the world's eighth-largest economy, more than 20 million people rose out of acute poverty and Rio de Janeiro was awarded the 2016 Summer Olympics, the first time the Games will be held in South America.\n> \n> \u2014\u200a*The Washington Post*, October 2010[44]\n> \n\n\n### Environmental policy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The deforestation rate in Brazil declined significantly during Lula's time in office, a decline that reversed in the time of Bolsonaro.[66][67]\nIn terms of environmental protection, the creation of conservation areas and indigenous reserves led to a substantial decrease (around 75%) in deforestation starting in 2004.[68]\n\n\nInitially, Lula's administration pushed for progressive policies that significantly curbed deforestation in the Amazon. Despite this, he did not support legislation that would have required the country to phase out its fossil fuels.\n\n\nDuring his 2022 election campaign, he focused more on environmental issues and espoused more environmentally conscious policies.[69]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Brazil\n\n![](image)Lula and the Finnish President Tarja Halonen, 2023\n![](image)Lula and the U.S. President George W. Bush in the G8 Japan 2008\n![](image)Lula with BRIC leaders in 2010\nLeading a large and competitive agricultural state, Lula generally opposed and criticized farm subsidies, and this position has been seen as one of the reasons for the walkout of developing nations and subsequent collapse of the Canc\u00fan World Trade Organization talks in 2003 over G8 agricultural subsidies.[70] Brazil played an important role in negotiations regarding internal conflicts in Venezuela and Colombia, and concentrated efforts on strengthening Mercosur.[71] During the Lula administration, Brazilian foreign trade increased dramatically, changing from deficits to several surpluses after 2003. In 2004, the surplus was US$29\u00a0billion, due to a substantial increase in global demand for commodities. Brazil also provided UN peace-keeping troops and led a peace-keeping mission in Haiti.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula meeting with President of Russia Vladimir Putin in 2005\n![](image)Lula meeting with the Supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei\n![](image)United States President Barack Obama greets Lula in the Oval Office.\nIn 2003, Lula condemned the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, saying that the United States had no right \"to decide unilaterally what is good and what is bad for the world.\"[73] He said that \"the behaviour of the United States in relation to Iraq has weakened the United Nations.\"[74]\n\n\nAccording to *The Economist* of 2 March 2006, Lula had a pragmatic foreign policy, seeing himself as a negotiator, not an ideologue, a leader adept at reconciling opposites. As a result, he befriended both Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and U.S. President George W. Bush.[75] Lula also gained increasing stature in the Southern hemisphere through economic growth in Brazil. In 2008, he was said to have become a \"point man for healing regional crises\", as in the escalation of tensions between Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador. Former Finance Minister, and current advisor, Delfim Netto, said: \"Lula is the ultimate pragmatist.\"[76]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in 2008\n![](image)Lula and his wife Marisa Leticia with the Former French President Jacques Chirac in Brazil, 2006\n![](image)Lula brokered together with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan the Iran nuclear deal in 2010.\nHe travelled to more than 80 countries during his presidency.[77] A goal of Lula's foreign policy was for the country to gain a seat as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. In this he was unsuccessful.[77] Lula was considered to have pulled off a major coup with Turkey in regards to getting Iran to send its uranium abroad in contravention of western calls.[77][78]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula and Pope Benedict XVI in S\u00e3o Paulo, 2007\n![](image)Lula with President of Mexico Felipe Calder\u00f3n during an official ceremony in Mexico City\n![](image)Lula and First Lady Marisa Let\u00edcia pictured in the Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada\nThe condemnation of Iranian Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani for the crime of adultery, with a sentence of execution by stoning, led to calls for Lula da Silva's intervention on her behalf. On the issue, Lula commented that \"I need to respect the laws of a [foreign] country. If my friendship with the president of Iran and the respect that I have for him is worth something, if this woman has become a nuisance, we will receive her in Brazil.\" The Iranian government declined the offer.[79][80] Lula da Silva's actions and comments sparked controversy. Mina Ahadi, an Iranian Communist politician, welcomed Lula da Silva's offer of asylum for Ashtiani, but also reiterated a call for an end to stoning altogether and requesting a cessation of recognition and support for the Iranian government.[81][82][83][84] Jackson Diehl, deputy editorial page editor of *The Washington Post*, called Lula da Silva the \"best friend of tyrants in the democratic world\" and criticised his actions.[79] Shirin Ebadi, Iranian human rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate viewed Lula da Silva's intervention in a more positive light, calling it a \"powerful message to the Islamic Republic\".[85] In the final month of his first administration, his government officially recognized Palestine as a state,[86] with a number of Latin American countries following suit.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Corruption scandals and controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of scandals in Brazil\n\n### Mensal\u00e3o\n\n[edit]\n\nLula's administration was plagued by numerous corruption scandals,[87][88] notably the Mensal\u00e3o scandal and Esc\u00e2ndalo dos sanguessugas\u00a0[pt] in his first term. Brazilian attorney general \u00c1lvaro Augusto Ribeiro Costa presented charges against 40 politicians and officials involved in the Mensal\u00e3o affair, including several charges against Lula himself. Lula stated on Brazilian public television that he knew nothing about the scandals.[89] Top officials involved, such as Roberto Jefferson, Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, Luiz Gushiken and Humberto Costa have corroborated this; but one of his own party members, Arlindo Chinaglia, alleged that Lula had been warned about the matter.[90] Having lost numerous government aides in the face of political turmoil, Lula survived largely unscathed in the eyes of the public, with overwhelming approval rates.\n\n\n\n### Politicking\n\n[edit]\n\nHis administration was heavily criticized for relying on local, right-of-centre political barons, like Jos\u00e9 Sarney, Jader Barbalho, Renan Calheiros and Fernando Collor to ensure a majority in Congress. Another frequent reproach was his ambiguous treatment of the left wing of the PT. Analysts felt that he would occasionally give in to left-wing calls for tighter government control on media and increased state intervention: in 2004, he pushed for the creation of a \"Federal Council of Journalists\" (CFJ) and a \"National Cinema Agency\" (Ancinav), the latter designed to overhaul funding for electronic communications. Both proposals ultimately failed amid concerns over the effect of state control on free speech.[91][92]\n\n\n\n### Statement on the Great Recession\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore a G-20 summit in London in March 2009, Lula caused an uproar by declaring that the economic crisis was caused by \"the irrational behavior of white people with blue eyes, who before seemed to know everything, and now have shown they don't know anything.\"[93]\n\n\n\n### Cesare Battisti\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen wanted Italian terrorist Cesare Battisti was arrested in Rio de Janeiro on 18 March 2007 by Brazilian and French police officers, Brazilian Minister of Justice Tarso Genro granted him status as a political refugee, a controversial decision which divided Italy and the Brazilian and international press. On 5 February 2009, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in support of Italy and held a minute's silence in memory of Battisti's victims. On 18 November 2009, the Brazilian Supreme Court declared the refugee status illegal and allowed Battisi's extradition, but also stated that the Brazilian constitution gave the president personal powers to deny the extradition if he chose to, effectively putting the final decision in the hands of Lula.[94] Lula barred Battisti's extradition.[95] On 31 December 2010, Lula's last day in office, the decision not to allow extradition was officially announced. Battisti was released on 9 June 2011 from prison after the Brazilian Constitutional Court denied Italy's request to extradite him. Italy planned to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.[96] Battisti was extradited in December 2018.[97]\n\n\n\n### Operation Car Wash: corruption investigation and prosecution\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Demonstrators gather in front of the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto, the presidential palace, to protest against Lula's appointment as Chief of Staff of the Presidency, 16 March 2016.\n![](image)Lula is sworn in as Chief of Staff by President Dilma Rousseff on 17 March 2016.\nIn 2014, Brazil began *Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Lava Jato* (English: Operation Car Wash), resulting in several arrests and convictions, including nine suits against Lula.\n\n\nIn April 2015, the Public Ministry of Brazil opened an investigation into allegations of influence peddling by Lula, which alleged that between 2011 and 2014 he had lobbied for government contracts in foreign countries for the Odebrecht company and had also persuaded the Brazilian Development Bank to finance the projects in Ghana, Angola, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic.[98] In June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, president of Odebrecht, was arrested on charges that he had paid politicians $230 million in bribes.[99] Three other company executives were also arrested, as well as the chief executive of Andrade Gutierrez, another construction conglomerate.[100]\n\n\nOn 4 March 2016, as part of \"Operation Car Wash\", Brazilian authorities raided Lula's home.[101][102] After the raid, the police detained Lula for questioning.[103][104] A police statement alleged that Lula had collaborated in illegal bribes from the oil company Petrobras to benefit his political party and presidential campaign.[103] Prosecutor Carlos Fernando said, \"The favors to Lula from big construction companies involved in the fraud at Petrobras were many and hard to quantify\".[105] Lula said that he and his party were being politically persecuted.[106][107][108]\n\n\nOn 16 March 2016, Rousseff appointed Lula as her chief of staff, a position comparable to that of prime minister. This would have shielded him from arrest due to the immunity that went with the position.[109] Cabinet ministers in Brazil are among close to seven hundred senior government officials enjoying special judicial standing, which means they can only be tried by Brazil's Supreme Federal Court. Supreme Court Judge Gilmar Mendes suspended Lula da Silva's appointment on the grounds that Rousseff was trying to help Lula circumvent prosecution.[110][111]\n\n\nOn 14 September 2016, prosecutors filed corruption charges against Lula, accusing him of being the mastermind or 'maximum commander of the scheme'.[112] On 19 September 2016, 13th Circuit (Paran\u00e1) federal judge Sergio Moro, who was leading the corruption probe, accepted an indictment for money laundering against Lula and his wife Marisa Leticia Lula da Silva. On 11 May 2017, Lula answered a summons by appearing in Curitiba and was questioned by Moro. The closed-court hearing lasted five hours. Thousands of Lula supporters went to Curitiba, together with Dilma Rousseff. After the hearing, Lula and Rousseff gave speeches to his supporters; Lula attacked what he called bias in the Brazilian media.[113]\n\n\nLula was found guilty by the lower court of accepting R$3.7 million in bribes ($940,000 US) in the form of improvements to his beachfront house, made by construction company Grupo Metha\u00a0[pt], which in turn received lucrative contracts from the state-owned oil company Petrobras.[114] Lula also faced other charges, including money laundering, influence peddling and obstruction of justice.[115][114] On 12 July 2017, Sergio Moro sentenced Lula to nine and a half years in prison.[116] Lula remained free pending his appeal.[117] Lula's lawyer accused the judge of bias and the judge replied that nobody, not even the former president, should be above the rule of law.[117]\n\n\nOn 25 January 2018, the Appeal Court of Porto Alegre found Lula guilty of corruption and money laundering and increased his sentence to 12 years of prison[118] for one of the nine charges, while the other eight were still pending. On 26 March 2018, that same court upheld its own sentence, thus ending the case in that court.[119]\n\n\nOn 23 March 2021, the Supreme Federal Court ruled by a 3\u20132 decision that Moro, who had overseen Lula's trial in a case, was biased against him.[24] It upheld the ruling on 23 June by a 7\u20134 decision.[120] Judge Gilmar Mendes of the Supreme Federal Court on 24 June annulled the two other cases Moro had brought against Lula, reasoning that there was a link between them and the case in which Moro was declared biased. This meant that all evidence Moro had collected against Lula is inadmissible in court and fresh trials would be needed.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Prison\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 5 April 2018, Brazil's Supreme Federal Court (STF) voted 6\u20135 to deny Lula's habeas corpus petition.[122] The court ruled that Lula must begin serving the sentence relating to 12 July 2017 conviction, despite not having exhausted all of his appeals. Lula and his political party vowed to continue his campaign from prison following the court's decision that he must surrender himself by 6 April.[123] The head of Brazil's army, General Eduardo Villas Boas, called for Lula to be placed behind bars.[124] Lula failed to turn himself in at the scheduled time,[125] but he did so on the following day on 7 April 2018.[126] After the imprisonment of Lula, protesters took to the streets in cities across Brazil.[127] Lula's imprisonment led to the formation of the Free Lula Movement.\n\n\nOn 8 July 2018, federal judge for the 4th region Rog\u00e9rio Favreto ordered Lula's release. Moro immediately stated that Favreto did not have the power to release Lula and Favreto's ruling was overturned the same day by the Judge Pedro Gebran Neto, president of the 4th regional court.[128]\n\n\nOn 9 June 2019, *The Intercept* published leaked Telegram messages between the judge in Lula's case, Sergio Moro, and the Operation Car Wash lead prosecutor, Deltan Dallagnol, in which they allegedly conspired to convict Lula to prevent his candidacy for the 2018 presidential election.[129][130]\n[131][132][133][134][135] Moro was accused of lacking impartiality in Lula's trial.[136] Following the disclosures, the resumption of legal proceedings was determined by the Supreme Court.[137] Moro denied any wrongdoing or judicial misconduct during the course of Operation Car Wash and his investigation of the former president, claiming that the conversations leaked by *The Intercept* were misrepresented by the press and that conversations between prosecutors and judges are normal.[138] Moro became Minister of Justice and Public Security after the election of president Jair Bolsonaro, and it is disputed whether an agreement was in place prior to Bolsonaro's election.\n\n\nThe information published by *The Intercept* prompted reactions both in Brazil and overseas. A group of seventeen lawyers, ministers of Justice, and high court members from eight countries reacted to the leaks by describing former President Lula as a political prisoner and calling for his release.[139] United States Senator Bernie Sanders said Lula should be released and his conviction annulled. Ro Khanna asked the Trump administration to investigate Lula's case, saying that \"Moro was a bad actor and part of a larger conspiracy to send Lula to jail\".[140] American political commentator Michael Brooks, a vocal advocate for the former president, stated that Lula's imprisonment and Moro's alleged political motives had rendered the results of the 2018 election \"fundamentally illegitimate\".[141]\n\n\nOn 8 November 2019, Lula was released from prison after 580 days when the Brazilian Supreme Court ended mandatory imprisonment of convicted criminals after their first appeal failed.[142][143][144]\nOn 27 November, the Federal Regional Tribunal of Region 4[pt] in Porto Alegre increased Lula's sentence to 17 years.[145]\n\n\nJudge Edson Fachin of the Supreme Federal Court annulled all convictions against Lula on 8 March 2021, ruling that the court in Curitiba which convicted him lacked jurisdiction to do so, and ordered a retrial in Brasilia.[146] A full Supreme Court bench later upheld the ruling by an 8\u20133 decision on 15 April.[147]\n\n\n\n#### UN Human Rights Committee\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court refused to consider alleged violations of fundamental human rights by Judge Moro, Lula's defense lawyers appealed to the United Nations Human Rights Committee.[148] In the lawsuit, the lawyers requested that the Committee provide an opinion on the accusations that Moro violated Lula's right to privacy, his right to not be arbitrarily arrested and his right to the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. They presented as proof of abusive practices:\n\n\n\n1. Coercive conduct against Lula on 4 March 2016.\n2. The leaking of confidential data to the press.\n3. The leaking of illegally obtained phone conversation recordings to the press.\n4. An abusive strategy of temporary and preemptive imprisonments in order to obtain plea-bargaining deals implicating the former president.\n\n\nBecause the judge's chief of staff had posted on her Facebook page a petition calling for Lula's imprisonment[149] and the presiding judge of the appellate panel had praised Moro's decision to convict Lula for corruption, before Moro had issued his decision,[150] an op-ed in *The New York Times* concluded that \"Brazil's democracy is now weaker than it has been since military rule ended\".[151] The newspaper was joined by a number of international intellectuals, activists and political leaders, from Noam Chomsky to a group of twelve United States Congressmen,[152] who complained that the legal proceedings appeared to be designed to prevent Lula (the front-runner in opinion polls) from running for president in 2018.[153][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nOn 28 July 2016, Lula filed a 39-page petition with the UN's Human Rights Committee outlining alleged abuses of power. The petition stated that \"Lula is a victim of abuse of power by a judge, with the complicity of prosecutors and the media\".[154] The petition was the first ever taken against Brazil which ratified the committee's protocol in 2009.\n\n\n\n![](image)Protests related to 2016 Lula's coercive testimony\nThe UN accepted the case[155] and Brazil was given six months to respond to the petition. The committee was made of 18 international jurists.[156] In November 2016, Lula's legal team filed additional evidence of abuses by the Brazilian justice system,[157] and another document was filed on 5 October 2017, in Geneva, Switzerland, reporting other facts, such as Judge Moro's attendance at the premiere of a film that depicted former President Lula as guilty, despite the lack of any definitive decision against him at that time.[158]\n\n\nFollowing Judge Moro's issuance of an arrest warrant for the ex-President, on 6 April 2018, Lula appealed to the UN's Human Rights Committee to ask the government to prevent his arrest until he had exhausted all appeals.[159] Lula argued that the Brazilian Supreme Court had narrowly adopted its ruling with only six votes against five, which \"shows the need for an independent court to examine if the presumption of innocence was violated\" in his case. The Human Rights Committee received a request for \"interim measures\" and was deliberating the request.[160] The UN Human Rights Committee denied the request seeking emergency action against his imprisonment.[161]\n\n\nOn 28 May 2018, the Committee initiated a formal investigation into violations against basic judicial guarantees in Lula's case.[162] In August, the UN Human Rights Committee \"requested Brazil to take all necessary measures to ensure that Lula can enjoy and exercise his political rights while in prison, as candidate in the 2018 presidential elections.\"[163][164]\n\n\nOn 2 August 2018, Pope Francis received three former allies of Lula in Rome: Celso Amorim, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez and Carlos Ominami. At the conclusion of the hour-long meeting,[165] Pope Francis was given a copy of Lula's biography *The Truth Will Win* by Amorim. Later, he addressed a handwritten note to Lula (posted on his Twitter account) with the following text: \"To Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva with my blessing, asking him to pray for me, Francisco\".[166] In the same month, President of Brazil Dilma Rousseff, who had previously served as Chief of Staff to President Lula da Silva from 2005 to 2010, confirmed that the Pope also sent her an unofficial letter, the content of which was not disclosed.[167]\n\n\n\n### Operation Zelotes\n\n[edit]\n\nLula, along with his former chief of staff Gilberto Carvalho\u00a0[pt] and five others, was indicted in a corruption probe as part of Operation Zelotes\u00a0[pt] regarding payment of R$6 million in bribes (US\u00a0$1.5 million). \n\n\nAccording to prosecutors, they helped pass Provisional Measure 471 (which was later converted into Law 12,218/2010) in 2009 in order to benefit the automotive companies CAOA and MMC.[168] Judge Frederico Botelho de Barros Viana of the 10th Federal Court of Brasilia acquitted all the accused on 21 June 2021, stating that the prosecution could not convincingly demonstrate that the defendants were involved in a criminal conspiracy.[169]\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency\n\n[edit]\n\n### Health\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula in April 2016\n![](image)Lula with Brazilian politician Fernando Haddad in September 2016\nOn 29 October 2011, through the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital of S\u00e3o Paulo, it was announced that Lula had a malignant tumor in his larynx. He had chemotherapy to counteract the tumor, and on 16 November, his press office released photos of his wife shaving his beard and hair, leaving him bald, although he retained his moustache.[170] It was the first time that he had been seen without his beard since he left office.[171] He was treated with radiation, and the cancer went into remission. Lula announced his recovery in March 2012, as well as his return to politics. Fellow politician Dilma Rousseff, then president of Brazil, welcomed the news.[172] Contrary to rumors, Lula stated in early 2013 that he was not a presidential candidate, supporting Dilma Rousseff for a second term.[173]\n\n\nThe appointment raised concerns[*from whom?*] about his arrest and investigation.[174]\n\n\nOn 21 January 2021, Lula said that he tested positive for COVID-19 while participating in the filming of an Oliver Stone documentary in Cuba, five days after arriving on the island. He did not need hospital admission and was able to recover.[175] On 13 March 2021, Lula received his first dose of the CoronaVac vaccine.[176]\n\n\n\n### 2018 presidential campaign\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula with Brazilian politicians Manuela d'\u00c1vila and Marcelo Freixo in April 2018\n![](image)Lula with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez in November 2021\nIn 2017, Lula announced he would stand as the Workers' Party candidate for president again in the 2018 election. In September, he led a caravan of supporters which travelled through the states of Brazil, starting with Minas Gerais, whose governor was Lula's political ally Fernando Pimentel.[177] While traveling through the South of Brazil, the caravan became the target of protests. In Paran\u00e1, a campaign bus was shot, and in Rio Grande do Sul, rocks were thrown at pro-Lula militants.[178]\n\n\nDespite Lula's imprisonment in April 2018, the Workers' Party kept Lula as the party's presidential candidate. In a poll conducted by Ibope in June 2018, Lula led with 33% of vote intentions, with the PSL candidate Jair Bolsonaro polling second with 15%.[179] Lula negotiated a national coalition with the PCdoB and regional alliances with the Socialist Party.[180]\n\n\nThe Workers' Party officially nominated Lula as its candidate on 5 August 2018, in S\u00e3o Paulo. Actor S\u00e9rgio Mamberti read a letter written by Lula, who was unable to attend because of his prison sentence. Former S\u00e3o Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad was named as Lula's running mate and intended to represent Lula in events and debates. In the event that Lula were declared ineligible, Haddad would replace Lula as candidate, with Manuela d'\u00c1vila replacing Haddad as the vice presidential candidate.[181]\n\n\nIn response to an appeal considering Lula as a political prisoner, the UN Human Rights Committee ruled on 17 August 2018 that it had requested the Brazilian government to allow Lula to exercise his political rights.[182]\n\n\nIn a 26 August poll, Lula had 39 percent of vote intentions within one month of the first round. The same opinion polling put Lula ahead of all his challengers in a second round run-off, including the nearest one, PSL candidate Jair Bolsonaro, by 52 to 32.[183]\n\n\nLula's candidacy was denied by the Superior Electoral Court on 31 August 2018, when the majority of the seven-judge panel voted to bar Lula from running in the presidential race.[184] On 11 September 2018, Lula officially dropped out of the election and was replaced by Fernando Haddad, whom Lula endorsed.[185]\n\n\n\n## Second presidency (2023\u2013present)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Second presidency of Lula da Silva\n\n### 2022 election\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: 2022 Brazilian general election and Lula da Silva 2022 presidential campaign\n\n![](image)Lula with President of Argentina Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez in October 2022\nIn May 2021, Lula stated that he would run for a third term in the October 2022 general election, against the incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro,[186][187][188] with opinion polls at the end of July 2021 suggesting he would comfortably beat Bolsonaro.[188] He was 17% ahead of Bolsonaro in a poll in January 2022.[189]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Lula announced that his running mate would be Geraldo Alckmin, a three-term governor of S\u00e3o Paulo state who ran against Lula in the 2006 presidential elections.[190]\n\n\nOn 2 October, the vote of the first round, Lula was in first place with 48.43% of the electorate, qualifying for the second round with Bolsonaro, who received 43.20% of the votes. Lula was elected in the second round on 30 October, three days after his seventy-seventh birthday. He became the first president of Brazil elected to three terms and the first since Get\u00falio Vargas to serve in non-consecutive terms. He is also the first candidate to unseat an incumbent president. He was sworn in on 1 January 2023.[191][192]\n\n\n\n### Tenure\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lula and US President Joe Biden at the White House on 10 February 2023\n![](image)Lula and the Chinese President Xi Jinping, April 2023\nLula said that his main commitments were: the reconstruction of the country in the face of the economic crisis; democracy, sovereignty and peace; economic development and stability; fighting poverty; education; implementation of a National System of Culture and the expansion of housing programs.[193]\n\n\n\n#### Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\n[edit]\n\nLula took a non-aligned stance on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, describing it in a way that Ukraine compared to a \"Russian attempt to distort the truth\".[194][195] While highlighting the human cost of the war, as well as its impact on food security,[196] cost of living and global supply chains,[197] and condemning the invasion, Lula repeatedly attacked NATO and the European Union as the cause of the war, accusing the former of \"claiming for itself the right to install military bases in the vicinity of another country.\"[198] In April 2023 Lula condemned Russia's violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity and said Russia should withdraw from Ukrainian territory it has occupied since February 2022.[199] Refusing to send arms to Ukraine, he also put blame on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying \"This guy is as responsible as Putin for the war,\" during an interview in May 2022.[198] Later in April 2023, he suggested that Ukraine should \"give up Crimea\" in exchange for peace and Russia's withdrawal from Ukrainian territory it occupied after February 2022, saying Zelenskyy \"can not want everything\".[200][201]\n\n\nLula has also insisted in seeking peace, which is a binding foreign policy principle under the current pacifist Brazilian Constitution of 1988 (See Article 4, VI, VII), as he turned down Brazilian military weaponry sales proposed by Germany to be sent to Ukraine.[202] Lula said that the countries of the Global South, including Brazil, India, Indonesia and China \"want peace\", but both Putin and Zelenskyy \"are convinced that they are going to win the war\" and do not want to talk about peace, so the war could be very long.[203]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lula and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the 49th G7 summit in Hiroshima on 20 May 2023\nIn April 2023, Lula declared after a state visit to China that \"the United States needs to stop encouraging war and start talking about peace\". U.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby responded by accusing Lula of \"parroting Russian and Chinese propaganda\", describing his comments as \"simply misguided\" and \"suggesting the United States and Europe are somehow not interested in peace, or that we share responsibility for the war\".[204]\n\n\nOn 26 April, in a joint press conference at the Palace of Moncloa, Spanish PM Pedro S\u00e1nchez raised further questions about Lula's position when the former stressed that the victimized country needed to be supported.[205][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] Lula was interviewed by Pepa Bueno for a Spanish daily, and he said of the UN Security Council, which has included the People's Republic of China as a permanent member only since 25 October 1971, that it is frozen in the era of 1945 and that he wants to use this as reason to reform it. In May 2023, he declined an invitation to the Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum, saying that he \"can't visit Russia at the moment\", while confirming that he had spoken to Putin.[206]\n\n\n\n#### Israel\u2013Hamas war\n\n[edit]\n\nLula condemned the Hamas attack on Israel carried out on 7 October 2023.[207] On 11 October 2023, he called for a ceasefire in the Israel\u2013Hamas war, stating, it was \"urgently needed in defense of Israeli and Palestinian children\".[208] Lula urged Hamas to release kidnapped Israeli children and Israel to stop bombing the Gaza Strip and allow Palestinian children and their mothers to leave the war zone.[209] On 25 October 2023, Lula stated, \"It's not a war, it's a genocide.\"[210]\n\n\n\n#### Economy\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Bolsa Fam\u00edlia\n\nIn March 2023 Lula reinforced the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia program. The program was created during the first term of Lula and then significantly cut by Jair Bolsonaro. The program should help around 60 million Brazilians suffering from poverty. The first goal is to eradicate hunger affecting 33.1 million people in Brazil.[211] According to the World Bank estimates, the reinforced program will reduce the poverty rate in Brazil to 24.3% - the level before COVID-19 pandemic.[212]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023 Brazilian economy grew by 1.9%. In the second quarter by 0.9%, 3 times more than expected, while many of the neighbors of Brazil saw a shrinkage in their economy. The possible reasons of this phenomena include reducing inflation, good harvest, improving credit rating. The economic policy of Lula regarding taxation, spendings, public ownership of some companies probably played a major role in this. Explaining his economic philosophy Lula once said: \"\u201c[Brazilians] need to understand that the money that exists in this country needs to circulate in the hands of many people,\u201d \u201cWe do not want the concentration of wealth. We want more people to have access to credit to make the wheel of the economy turn. The growing economy needs to be distributed.\u201d[213]\n\n\n\n#### Environment\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Launch of the Global Biofuel Alliance at the 2023 G20 New Delhi summit\nLula has pledged to end illegal logging, with Greenpeace Brazil spokesperson R\u00f4mulo Batista stating that \"[a]ddressing the crisis will require rebuilding the manpower of environmental agencies that were gutted by the far-right populist [Jair Bolsonaro], a process which cannot happen overnight\".[214] In the first 4 months of 2023, Amazon deforestation rate has seen a significant decrease, being reported 40.4% lower in comparison to the same period of 2022. It is unclear if the trend will continue, as the peak of deforestation comes generally in July\u2013September, but experts see it \"as a positive signal\".[215][216]\n\n\nIn the first 7 months of 2023 the deforestation rate in the Amazon has fallen by 42% in \"a sharp reversal relative to the trend under the Bolsonaro administration\". In July 2023 the deforestation rate was 66% lower than in July 2022. In the beginning of August Lula will participate in the Belem summit. At the summit, the leaders of the 8 Amazonian nations, are expected to renew the Amazon cooperation treaty.[217] The result, in July is especially important because usually the clearing season begins in this month. The decision of several banks to not give credit to loggers and the new policy of the EU to achieve \"deforestation-free trade\" helped to achieve this result.[218] However, there are concerns that illegal loggers have partly moved their action from the Amazon rainforest to Cerrado where the environmental destruction has increased.[219] In the first 8 months of 2023 deforestation rate declined by 48% what prevented the release of 196 million tons CO2 to the atmosphere. Financing from the Amazon Fund and cooperation between the Amazonian nations played a significant role in it.[220]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the Amazon rainforest near Manaus, Brazil\nLula pledged to recognize 14 new indigenous reserves. Six were recognized as of May 2023.[221] Lula and the American president Joe Biden committed to work together on the issue.[222] In April Biden pledged to give 500 million dollars to the Amazon Fund which was frozen during the rule of Bolsonaro and became active when Lula returned to power, as a \"part of the two nations' efforts to deal with climate change.\"[223] According to John Kerry, the overall financial help from US to Brazil for stopping deforestation through different channels will be around 2 billion US dollars.[224]\n\n\nIn June, Lula presented a road map for achieving zero deforestation by the year 2030. It is a part of a bigger plan: \"The Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon\". This plan was largely responsible for the 83% decrease in the Amazon deforestation rate in the years 2004 through 2012 but it was suspended during Bolsonaro's presidency. The plan includes different measures for creating a sustainable economy in the Amazon region, like bioeconomy, rural credits and more. Lula also pledged to return the climate targets of the country in the Paris agreement to the level they were before Bolsonaro government: \"reduce carbon emission by 37% by 2025 and 43% by 2030\".[225]\n\n\n\n## Political positions and philosophy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Lulism\n\n![](image)Lula visits the Yanomami people in the Brazilian state of Roraima in January 2023\nIn Brazil, *liberal* is often avoided by leftists because of connotations with pro-business policies during neoliberalism or the military dictatorship. He advocated \"socialism of the 21st century\", but Lulism is considered to be substantially similar to social liberalism.[226][227][228] Although he showed a moderate centre-left liberal tendency economically, he highlighted his closeness with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and negatively evaluated Juan Guaid\u00f3 during the Venezuelan crisis.[229] He is \"personally against\" abortion, but maintains that it should be treated as a public health issue.[230][231]\n\n\n\n## Honours and awards\n\n[edit]\n\nThe list of Lula's awards since 2003:\n\n\n\n* In 2008 he was awarded the UNESCO F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Peace Prize.[232]\n* In 2012 he received the Four Freedoms Award.\n\n\n### National honours\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Honour | Date & Comment | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross | 2003 \u2013 automatic upon taking presidential office\n | [233] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Rio Branco | 2003 \u2013 automatic upon taking presidential office\n | [234] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Military Merit | 2003 \u2013 automatic upon taking presidential office\n | [235] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Naval Merit | 2003 \u2013 automatic upon taking presidential office\n |  |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Aeronautical Merit | 2003 \u2013 automatic upon taking presidential office\n |  |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Military Judicial Merit\n | 2003 \u2013 automatic upon taking presidential office\n |  |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit | 2013\n | [236] |\n\n\n### Foreign honours\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Country | Honour | Date | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Algeria | Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit | 7 February 2006\n | [237] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Benin | Grand Cross of the National Order of Benin | 17 March 2013\n | [238] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Bolivia | Collar of the Order of the Condor of the Andes | 17 December 2007\n | [239] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Cape Verde | Grand Cross of Am\u00edlcar Cabral Order\n | 29 July 2004\n | [240] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Colombia | Grand Cross of the Order of Boyac\u00e1 | 14 December 2005\n | [241] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Cuba | Grand Cross of the Order of Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes\n | 20 December 2019\n | [242] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | Knight of the Order of the Elephant | 12 September 2007\n | [243] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Ecuador | Grand Collar of the National Order of San Lorenzo | 6 June 2013\n | [244] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Gabon | Grand Cross of the Order of the Equatorial Star | 28 July 2004\n | [245] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Ghana | Companion of the Order of the Star of Ghana | 13 April 2005\n | [246] |\n| ![Medalha Am\u00edlcar Cabral](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Guinea-Bissau | Member of the Order of Am\u00edlcar Cabral\n | 25 August 2010\n | [247] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Guyana | Member of the Order of Excellence of Guyana | 25 November 2010\n | [248] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | Collar of the Order of the Aztec Eagle | 3 August 2007\n | [249] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Norway | Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav | 7 October 2003\n |  |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Norway | Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit | 13 September 2007\n |  |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Palestine | Grand Collar of the State of Palestine | 2010\n |  |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Panama | Grand Cross of the Order of Omar Torrijos Herrera | 10 August 2007\n | [250] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Peru | Grand Cross with Diamonds of the Order of the Sun | 25 August 2003\n | [251] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and Sword | 5 March 2008\n | [252] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | Grand Collar of the Order of Liberty | 23 July 2003\n | [252] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | Grand Collar of the Order of Cam\u00f5es | 22 April 2023\n | [252] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | Knight of the Collar of the Order of Isabella the Catholic | 2003\n | [253] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | Chain of the Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud | 2009\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0South Africa | Member of the Order of the Companions of O.
