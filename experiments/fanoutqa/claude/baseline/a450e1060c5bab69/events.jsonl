Liu is the founder of Lenovo, the world's largest personal computer vendor by unit sales.[1][2] He remains one of the leaders of the company.\n\n\n\n\n## Business activities\n\n[edit]\n\n### Lenovo\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Lenovo\n\nBy the early 1980s, Liu had achieved relative success as a computer scientist but still felt frustrated with his career. While his work on magnetic data storage was important, it lacked direct practical applications. He said, \"We were the top computer technology research organization in China. We developed the first electron-tube computer and the first transistor computer. But we only produced one of each. Then we went on to develop something different. The work was just filed away.\" Liu was also anxious about his economic circumstances; in 1984, Liu had a growing family but an income of only 100RMB per month.[3]\n\n\nLiu founded Lenovo (originally called Legend), in 1984 with a group of ten other engineers in Beijing with 200,000 yuan and an office roughly 20 square yards in size. Liu came up with the idea to start Lenovo in response to a lack of funding at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Liu's superior arranged for the academy to loan him and the other co-founders the afore-mentioned 200,000 yuan. Of this time, Liu said, \"It wasn't easy. The lowest thing you could do in the early '80s, as a scientist, was to go into business. China had a strict planned economy and there was barely room for a freewheeling company like ours.\"[3]\n\n\nLiu emphasized developing an effective working relationship with his superiors at the CAS from the very start. Despite its rhetoric of market-oriented reform, the Chinese government was reluctant to relax state control of the economy. Liu feared that his company might fail due to government micro-management. Liu also worried about dealing with local government officials and party cadres. He said, \"We were totally immersed in the environment of a planned economy. I didn't care that the investment was small, but I knew I must have control over finances, human resources and decision-making.\" Liu's superiors immediately granted his request for autonomy.[3]\n\n\nLenovo's founders, all scientists and engineers, faced difficulty from their lack of familiarity with market-oriented business practices, traditional Chinese ambivalence towards commerce, and anti-capitalist communist ideology. During this period many Chinese intellectuals felt that commerce was immoral and degrading. The fact that in the 1980s entrepreneurs were drawn from lower classes, and often dishonest as well, made the private sector even more unattractive. This was readily apparent to Liu and his collaborators due to their proximity to Zhongguancun, where the proliferation of fly-by-night electronics traders lead to the area being dubbed \"Swindlers Valley.\"[3]\n\n\nTheir first significant transaction, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon invested money in developing a circuit board that would allow IBM PCs to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. In 1990, Lenovo started to assemble and sell computers under its original brand name, Legend.[4][3]\n\n\nLenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" Lenovo's early difficulties were compounded by the fact that its staff had little business experience. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market,\" Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting—but also very dangerous,\" said Liu.[3]\n\n\nLiu received government permission to open a subsidiary in Hong Kong and was allowed to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, supported his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. In order to save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. In order to keep up appearances they rented hotel rooms for meetings.[3]\n\n\nLenovo became a publicly traded company after listing in Hong Kong in 1994, raising nearly US$30 million. Prior to Lenovo's IPO, many analysts were optimistic. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. During the first day of trading the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America, and Australia; expand and improve production and research and development; and increase working capital. Lenovo's Hong Kong and Mainland China business units conducted a merger and secondary offering in 1997.[3]\n\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"[3]\n\n\nLiu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration for Lenovo. In an interview with The Economist he said, \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo served as Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.[5] Speaking about Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"[4]\n\n\nLenovo's later takeover of IBM's personal computing business made him the first Chinese CEO to lead the takeover of a major American firm.[6] During an interview, Liu acknowledged the major risks involved with the IBM deal. \"We had three serious risks. Number one: After the acquisition, would clients buy from the new owner? Number two: Would employees continue to work for the new owner? Number three: Would there be potential conflicts between the Chinese management and the Western management?\"[6]\n\n\nBusiness ethics were a key challenge for Liu in establishing and expanding Lenovo. Liu says that at first he behaved \"like a kind of dictator\" and spent much time yelling. He had five corrupt executives imprisoned. Being late for a meeting could be punished by having to stand in silence before the group, a punishment that Liu accepted three times himself. Lenovo's culture gradually changed and Liu was able to relax his authoritarian style. Lenovo became an employer of choice for Chinese engineers and managers with overseas education.[5]\n\n\n\n### Legend Holdings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Legend Holdings\n\nIn June 2012, Liu stepped down as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo. In the years just prior to his resignation, Liu focused on improving Legend's growth, building-up its core assets, and conducting a public stock offering between 2014 and 2016. Legend's major assets include Lenovo, Legend Capital, a real-estate venture called Raycom, Digital China, and Hony Capital.[7][8]\n\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Liu said that his vision for Legend was for it \"to become an industry in its own right\" and that he wants it \"to become the top enterprise across industries...not only in China, but in the whole world.\" Liu said that he realized that his vision was extremely ambitious and may have to be left to his successors to implement.[9]\n\n\nLiu said in an interview with *Forbes* that he hoped to diversify away from IT-related businesses and that Legend Holding's assets would be mainly concentrated in information technology, real estate, services, coal processing, and agriculture. He said agriculture \"will become the next strategic development area for Legend Holdings.\" Liu said agriculture is just one part of what he sees as \"huge\" opportunities in sectors that cater to Chinese consumers. In the same interview, Liu said that Legend's focus would continue to remain on China. \"Whatever we do has to fit into something we are doing in China,\" said Liu when referring to plans for overseas investment.[8] Liu said in July 2012 that he plans to take Legend Holdings public with a listing in Hong Kong. Forbes speculated that Liu may be trying to \"create a Chinese version of General Electric.\"[10]\n\n\nLiu led an initial public offering for Legend on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2015. The offering received regulatory approval in June of that year. Liu said in an interview that he planned to float Legend's stock on a domestic Chinese exchange before his retirement.[11]\n\n\nIn 2019, Liu Chuanzhi, the 75-year-old founder of Lenovo Group, has resigned as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of the world's largest personal computer supplier.[12]\n\n\n\n### Joyvio\n\n[edit]\n\nJoyvio is Legend Holdings' vehicle for investment in the food industry. Legend has invested more than 1 billion yuan in Joyvio. Joyvio will pursue complete vertical integration from farming all the way to retailing. Joyvio's first product was blueberries. In November 2013, its product range was expanded to kiwifruit. The kiwifruit has been named \"Liu Kiwi,\" in honor of Liu Chuanzhi. Liu is responsible for Legend's move into food. Since 2011, Joyvio has acquired farms around the world including blueberry fields in Shandong and Chile and kiwifruit plantations in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, and Chile. The firm had plans to start selling cherries and grapes from the United States, Australia, and Chile by the end of 2013.[13]\n\n\nJoyvio took advantage of Legend's experience in information technology to set up a tracking system to ensure the quality and safety of its products. Customers can scan codes on its packages in order to find out what farm the product came from, who supervised production, what tests were performed, and information on soil and water quality. The company is also applying the OEM business model common in the technology industry in order to work effectively with small family farms and agricultural cooperatives. Joyvio holds training exercises with farmers in order to prepare them to deal quickly and effectively with bad weather.[13]\n\n\nJoyvio entered the imported wine business in late 2013.[14]\n\n\nJoyvio announced on 30 March 2014 that it had acquired a 60 per cent share of Hangzhou Longguan Tea Industrial Company for about 30 million yuan or about US$4.83 million. Longguan was previously a fully state-owned enterprise operating under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Longguan produces Hangzhou's famous Longjing tea. The company had sales of 32.45 million yuan in 2012. According to the company's annual report it has been growing 40 to 50 per cent per year. Joyvio has taken over day-to-day control of Longguan. Liu Chuanzhi said he aims to bring innovation and commercial methods to the tea industry. Liu said that Joyvio would invest in other well-known tea brands and related products.[15]\n\n\n\n### Other positions\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2013, Liu served as a senior advisor at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.\n\n\n\n## Education and early career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1962, Liu applied to be a military pilot and passed all the associated exams. Despite his father's revolutionary credentials, Liu was declared unfit for military service because a relative had been denounced as a rightist. In autumn of the same year, Liu entered the People's Liberation Army Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, now known as Xidian University. Due to his political and class background, Liu was deemed unsuitable for such sensitive subjects and assigned to study radar. During his studies Liu received an introduction to computing.[3]\n\n\nLiu was labeled an \"intellectual element\" during the Cultural Revolution. In 1966, he told his classmates that the revolution was a terrible idea and was sent to a state-owned rice farm near Macau in Guangdong as a result. From there he was sent to a farm in Hunan dedicated to reform through hard labor. Liu returned to Beijing where he took up a post in 1970 as an engineer-administrator at the Computer Institute that had earlier developed the Number 104, Number 109, and Number 111 mainframe computers. Liu worked on the development of the Number 757 mainframe computer. In 1984, he resigned to become a cadre in the personnel office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.[3] He remained there until he co-founded Legend in 1984.[5]\n\n\n\n## Political opinions\n\n[edit]\n\nUnlike many other Chinese business leaders, Liu has often spoken out on political issues. Liu has criticized others' tendency for silence. He said, \"when it comes to the inappropriate actions the government takes, businessmen don't have the courage or capacity to go against them; second, they lack the social responsibility to care for the whole world and what they do is to 'mind their own business.'\"[6]\n\n\nDuring an interview with *Caijing* in October 2012, he advocated for what he called \"elite selection\" of political leaders. He said, \"I'm not sure how practical it would be to have universal voting in the near future. I hope the country's leaders could be elected by the elites of the society.\" Liu is also deeply concerned with the rule of law. He said, \"My biggest worry is an unlawful world. I tell my employees to be careful all the time; don't disrespect the government or bribe anyone - even so, I'm still not at peace because there are always some corrupt individuals coming along to cause problems.\"[6]\n\n\nIn December 2013 Liu expressed optimism about economic reform in China. He said, \"Now if the market is to play a central role and the government only plays the referee, only you will decide if you are going to win the race.\"[16]\n\n\n\n## Public service and awards\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2002, Liu served as vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.[17] Since 2004, Liu has served as director of the Computer Technology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Liu was a delegate to the 16th National Congress of Chinese Communist Party and a deputy to the 9th and 10th sessions of the National People's Congress, China's highest legislative body.[18]\n\n\nLiu has been named \"Asian Businessman,\" one of the \"Global 25 Most Influential Business Leaders,\" and many other awards. He received Second National Technology Entrepreneurs Gold Award in 1990. He was named a Model Worker and Man of Reform in China, both in 1995. He was named one of the \"Ten Most Influential Men of the Commercial Sector\" in China in 1996. Liu was named one of the \"Stars of Asia\" by *BusinessWeek* magazine in 2000. In 2001, Liu was selected by *Time Magazine* as one of the \"25 Most Influential Global Executives.\" In 2012, *Forbes* named Liu one of the 10 most important business leaders in China.[10]\n\n\nLiu is a member of the China Entrepreneurs Club (CEC). The CEC was founded in 2006. Its purpose is to strengthen the sense of social responsibility among China's young entrepreneurs.[19]\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n[edit]\n\nLiu was born in 1945 in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, where his paternal grandfather was head of a traditional Chinese bank.[20][21] Liu's grandfather sent his father, Liu Gushu (柳谷书), to study in Shanghai. Liu Gushu abandoned scholarship and passed an exam for employment with the Bank of China. Liu Gushu was a \"patriotic capitalist\" who worked secretly for the Communist Party before the revolution of 1949. He became a senior executive with the Bank of China and later became a patent lawyer and chairman of the China Technology Licensing Company. Liu Chuanzhi's maternal grandfather served as finance minister for the warlord Sun Chuanfang.[3] After the Communist victory in 1949, Liu's family moved to Beijing, where they lived in a traditional courtyard home located on a hutong in the Wangfujing area. Liu's father continued his work with the Bank of China and joined the Chinese Communist Party. Liu's father developed a reputation as an honest and skilled banker.[3][22]\n\n\nLiu is married and has three children. Liu's daughter Liu Qing (柳青) is an alumna of Peking University. Liu Qing joined Didi Chuxing as chief operating officer in July 2014 after working at Goldman Sachs for 12 years.[23]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Mary Ma, former CFO of Lenovo\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Canalys Newsroom - Global PC shipments pass 340 million in 2021 and 2022 is set to be even stronger\".\n2. **^** \"Gartner Says Worldwide PC Shipments Declined 5% in Fourth Quarter of 2021 but Grew Nearly 10% for the Year\".\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** Ling, Zhijun (2006). *The Lenovo Affair*.

Liu is the founder of Lenovo, the world's largest personal computer vendor by unit sales.[1][2] He remains one of the leaders of the company.\n\n\n\n\n## Business activities\n\n[edit]\n\n### Lenovo\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Lenovo\n\nBy the early 1980s, Liu had achieved relative success as a computer scientist but still felt frustrated with his career. While his work on magnetic data storage was important, it lacked direct practical applications. He said, \"We were the top computer technology research organization in China. We developed the first electron-tube computer and the first transistor computer. But we only produced one of each. Then we went on to develop something different. The work was just filed away.\" Liu was also anxious about his economic circumstances; in 1984, Liu had a growing family but an income of only 100RMB per month.[3]\n\n\nLiu founded Lenovo (originally called Legend), in 1984 with a group of ten other engineers in Beijing with 200,000 yuan and an office roughly 20 square yards in size. Liu came up with the idea to start Lenovo in response to a lack of funding at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Liu's superior arranged for the academy to loan him and the other co-founders the afore-mentioned 200,000 yuan. Of this time, Liu said, \"It wasn't easy. The lowest thing you could do in the early '80s, as a scientist, was to go into business. China had a strict planned economy and there was barely room for a freewheeling company like ours.\"[3]\n\n\nLiu emphasized developing an effective working relationship with his superiors at the CAS from the very start. Despite its rhetoric of market-oriented reform, the Chinese government was reluctant to relax state control of the economy. Liu feared that his company might fail due to government micro-management. Liu also worried about dealing with local government officials and party cadres. He said, \"We were totally immersed in the environment of a planned economy. I didn't care that the investment was small, but I knew I must have control over finances, human resources and decision-making.\" Liu's superiors immediately granted his request for autonomy.[3]\n\n\nLenovo's founders, all scientists and engineers, faced difficulty from their lack of familiarity with market-oriented business practices, traditional Chinese ambivalence towards commerce, and anti-capitalist communist ideology. During this period many Chinese intellectuals felt that commerce was immoral and degrading. The fact that in the 1980s entrepreneurs were drawn from lower classes, and often dishonest as well, made the private sector even more unattractive. This was readily apparent to Liu and his collaborators due to their proximity to Zhongguancun, where the proliferation of fly-by-night electronics traders lead to the area being dubbed \"Swindlers Valley.\"[3]\n\n\nTheir first significant transaction, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon invested money in developing a circuit board that would allow IBM PCs to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. In 1990, Lenovo started to assemble and sell computers under its original brand name, Legend.[4][3]\n\n\nLenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" Lenovo's early difficulties were compounded by the fact that its staff had little business experience. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market,\" Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting—but also very dangerous,\" said Liu.[3]\n\n\nLiu received government permission to open a subsidiary in Hong Kong and was allowed to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, supported his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. In order to save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. In order to keep up appearances they rented hotel rooms for meetings.[3]\n\n\nLenovo became a publicly traded company after listing in Hong Kong in 1994, raising nearly US$30 million. Prior to Lenovo's IPO, many analysts were optimistic. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. During the first day of trading the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America, and Australia; expand and improve production and research and development; and increase working capital. Lenovo's Hong Kong and Mainland China business units conducted a merger and secondary offering in 1997.[3]\n\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"[3]\n\n\nLiu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration for Lenovo. In an interview with The Economist he said, \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo served as Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.[5] Speaking about Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"[4]\n\n\nLenovo's later takeover of IBM's personal computing business made him the first Chinese CEO to lead the takeover of a major American firm.[6] During an interview, Liu acknowledged the major risks involved with the IBM deal. \"We had three serious risks. Number one: After the acquisition, would clients buy from the new owner? Number two: Would employees continue to work for the new owner? Number three: Would there be potential conflicts between the Chinese management and the Western management?\"[6]\n\n\nBusiness ethics were a key challenge for Liu in establishing and expanding Lenovo. Liu says that at first he behaved \"like a kind of dictator\" and spent much time yelling. He had five corrupt executives imprisoned. Being late for a meeting could be punished by having to stand in silence before the group, a punishment that Liu accepted three times himself. Lenovo's culture gradually changed and Liu was able to relax his authoritarian style. Lenovo became an employer of choice for Chinese engineers and managers with overseas education.[5]\n\n\n\n### Legend Holdings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Legend Holdings\n\nIn June 2012, Liu stepped down as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of Lenovo. In the years just prior to his resignation, Liu focused on improving Legend's growth, building-up its core assets, and conducting a public stock offering between 2014 and 2016. Legend's major assets include Lenovo, Legend Capital, a real-estate venture called Raycom, Digital China, and Hony Capital.[7][8]\n\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Liu said that his vision for Legend was for it \"to become an industry in its own right\" and that he wants it \"to become the top enterprise across industries...not only in China, but in the whole world.\" Liu said that he realized that his vision was extremely ambitious and may have to be left to his successors to implement.[9]\n\n\nLiu said in an interview with *Forbes* that he hoped to diversify away from IT-related businesses and that Legend Holding's assets would be mainly concentrated in information technology, real estate, services, coal processing, and agriculture. He said agriculture \"will become the next strategic development area for Legend Holdings.\" Liu said agriculture is just one part of what he sees as \"huge\" opportunities in sectors that cater to Chinese consumers. In the same interview, Liu said that Legend's focus would continue to remain on China. \"Whatever we do has to fit into something we are doing in China,\" said Liu when referring to plans for overseas investment.[8] Liu said in July 2012 that he plans to take Legend Holdings public with a listing in Hong Kong. Forbes speculated that Liu may be trying to \"create a Chinese version of General Electric.\"[10]\n\n\nLiu led an initial public offering for Legend on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2015. The offering received regulatory approval in June of that year. Liu said in an interview that he planned to float Legend's stock on a domestic Chinese exchange before his retirement.[11]\n\n\nIn 2019, Liu Chuanzhi, the 75-year-old founder of Lenovo Group, has resigned as chairman of Legend Holdings, the parent company of the world's largest personal computer supplier.[12]\n\n\n\n### Joyvio\n\n[edit]\n\nJoyvio is Legend Holdings' vehicle for investment in the food industry. Legend has invested more than 1 billion yuan in Joyvio. Joyvio will pursue complete vertical integration from farming all the way to retailing. Joyvio's first product was blueberries. In November 2013, its product range was expanded to kiwifruit. The kiwifruit has been named \"Liu Kiwi,\" in honor of Liu Chuanzhi. Liu is responsible for Legend's move into food. Since 2011, Joyvio has acquired farms around the world including blueberry fields in Shandong and Chile and kiwifruit plantations in Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, and Chile. The firm had plans to start selling cherries and grapes from the United States, Australia, and Chile by the end of 2013.[13]\n\n\nJoyvio took advantage of Legend's experience in information technology to set up a tracking system to ensure the quality and safety of its products. Customers can scan codes on its packages in order to find out what farm the product came from, who supervised production, what tests were performed, and information on soil and water quality. The company is also applying the OEM business model common in the technology industry in order to work effectively with small family farms and agricultural cooperatives. Joyvio holds training exercises with farmers in order to prepare them to deal quickly and effectively with bad weather.[13]\n\n\nJoyvio entered the imported wine business in late 2013.[14]\n\n\nJoyvio announced on 30 March 2014 that it had acquired a 60 per cent share of Hangzhou Longguan Tea Industrial Company for about 30 million yuan or about US$4.83 million. Longguan was previously a fully state-owned enterprise operating under the jurisdiction of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. Longguan produces Hangzhou's famous Longjing tea. The company had sales of 32.45 million yuan in 2012. According to the company's annual report it has been growing 40 to 50 per cent per year. Joyvio has taken over day-to-day control of Longguan. Liu Chuanzhi said he aims to bring innovation and commercial methods to the tea industry. Liu said that Joyvio would invest in other well-known tea brands and related products.[15]\n\n\n\n### Other positions\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2013, Liu served as a senior advisor at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.\n\n\n\n## Education and early career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1962, Liu applied to be a military pilot and passed all the associated exams. Despite his father's revolutionary credentials, Liu was declared unfit for military service because a relative had been denounced as a rightist. In autumn of the same year, Liu entered the People's Liberation Army Institute of Telecommunication Engineering, now known as Xidian University. Due to his political and class background, Liu was deemed unsuitable for such sensitive subjects and assigned to study radar. During his studies Liu received an introduction to computing.[3]\n\n\nLiu was labeled an \"intellectual element\" during the Cultural Revolution. In 1966, he told his classmates that the revolution was a terrible idea and was sent to a state-owned rice farm near Macau in Guangdong as a result. From there he was sent to a farm in Hunan dedicated to reform through hard labor. Liu returned to Beijing where he took up a post in 1970 as an engineer-administrator at the Computer Institute that had earlier developed the Number 104, Number 109, and Number 111 mainframe computers. Liu worked on the development of the Number 757 mainframe computer. In 1984, he resigned to become a cadre in the personnel office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.[3] He remained there until he co-founded Legend in 1984.[5]\n\n\n\n## Political opinions\n\n[edit]\n\nUnlike many other Chinese business leaders, Liu has often spoken out on political issues. Liu has criticized others' tendency for silence. He said, \"when it comes to the inappropriate actions the government takes, businessmen don't have the courage or capacity to go against them; second, they lack the social responsibility to care for the whole world and what they do is to 'mind their own business.'\"[6]\n\n\nDuring an interview with *Caijing* in October 2012, he advocated for what he called \"elite selection\" of political leaders. He said, \"I'm not sure how practical it would be to have universal voting in the near future. I hope the country's leaders could be elected by the elites of the society.\" Liu is also deeply concerned with the rule of law. He said, \"My biggest worry is an unlawful world. I tell my employees to be careful all the time; don't disrespect the government or bribe anyone - even so, I'm still not at peace because there are always some corrupt individuals coming along to cause problems.\"[6]\n\n\nIn December 2013 Liu expressed optimism about economic reform in China. He said, \"Now if the market is to play a central role and the government only plays the referee, only you will decide if you are going to win the race.\"[16]\n\n\n\n## Public service and awards\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2002, Liu served as vice-chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce.[17] Since 2004, Liu has served as director of the Computer Technology Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Liu was a delegate to the 16th National Congress of Chinese Communist Party and a deputy to the 9th and 10th sessions of the National People's Congress, China's highest legislative body.[18]\n\n\nLiu has been named \"Asian Businessman,\" one of the \"Global 25 Most Influential Business Leaders,\" and many other awards. He received Second National Technology Entrepreneurs Gold Award in 1990. He was named a Model Worker and Man of Reform in China, both in 1995. He was named one of the \"Ten Most Influential Men of the Commercial Sector\" in China in 1996. Liu was named one of the \"Stars of Asia\" by *BusinessWeek* magazine in 2000. In 2001, Liu was selected by *Time Magazine* as one of the \"25 Most Influential Global Executives.\" In 2012, *Forbes* named Liu one of the 10 most important business leaders in China.[10]\n\n\nLiu is a member of the China Entrepreneurs Club (CEC). The CEC was founded in 2006. Its purpose is to strengthen the sense of social responsibility among China's young entrepreneurs.[19]\n\n\n\n## Family\n\n[edit]\n\nLiu was born in 1945 in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, where his paternal grandfather was head of a traditional Chinese bank.[20][21] Liu's grandfather sent his father, Liu Gushu (柳谷书), to study in Shanghai. Liu Gushu abandoned scholarship and passed an exam for employment with the Bank of China. Liu Gushu was a \"patriotic capitalist\" who worked secretly for the Communist Party before the revolution of 1949. He became a senior executive with the Bank of China and later became a patent lawyer and chairman of the China Technology Licensing Company. Liu Chuanzhi's maternal grandfather served as finance minister for the warlord Sun Chuanfang.[3] After the Communist victory in 1949, Liu's family moved to Beijing, where they lived in a traditional courtyard home located on a hutong in the Wangfujing area. Liu's father continued his work with the Bank of China and joined the Chinese Communist Party. Liu's father developed a reputation as an honest and skilled banker.[3][22]\n\n\nLiu is married and has three children. Liu's daughter Liu Qing (柳青) is an alumna of Peking University. Liu Qing joined Didi Chuxing as chief operating officer in July 2014 after working at Goldman Sachs for 12 years.[23]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Mary Ma, former CFO of Lenovo\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Canalys Newsroom - Global PC shipments pass 340 million in 2021 and 2022 is set to be even stronger\".\n2. **^** \"Gartner Says Worldwide PC Shipments Declined 5% in Fourth Quarter of 2021 but Grew Nearly 10% for the Year\".\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** Ling, Zhijun (2006). *The Lenovo Affair*.

In 1916 the family moved to San Francisco after his father, Albion Walter Hewlett, took a similar position at Stanford Medical School, located at the time in San Francisco. He attended Lowell High School and was the 1929-1930 Battalion Commander of the school's Army JROTC program. He was accepted at Stanford University as a favor to his late father who died of a brain tumor in 1925.[1]\n\n\nHewlett received his bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 1934, a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1936, and a post-masters engineering degree in electrical engineering from Stanford in 1939. He joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity during his time at Stanford. Hewlett also had dyslexia, which caused him to struggle with reading and taking notes.[2]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Hewlett-Packard\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett attended undergraduate classes taught by Fred Terman at Stanford and became acquainted with David Packard. Packard and he began discussing forming a company in August 1937, and founded Hewlett-Packard Company as a partnership on January 1, 1939. A flip of a coin decided the ordering of their names.[3] Their first big breakthrough came when Disney purchased eight audio oscillators designed by Hewlett which were used for the production of the film *Fantasia*.[4]\n\n\nThe company incorporated in 1947 and tendered an initial public offering in 1957.[1] Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were proud of their company culture which came to be known as the HP Way. The HP Way is a corporate culture that claimed to be centered not only on making money but also on respecting and nurturing its employees. Hewlett was president of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1954.[5]\n\n\nHe was president of HP from 1964 to 1977 and served as CEO from 1968 to 1978, after which he was succeeded by John A. Young. He remained chairman of the executive committee until 1983, and then served as vice chairman of the board until 1987.\n\n\nA young Steve Jobs, then age 12,[6] called Hewlett (whose number was in the phone book) and requested any available parts for a frequency counter he was building. Hewlett, impressed with Jobs' initiative, offered him a summer job assembling frequency counters.[7] Jobs then considered HP one of the companies that he admired, regarding it among the handful of companies (Disney and Intel were the others) that were built “to last, not just to make money”.[8] Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple along with Jobs, unsuccessfully attempted five times to sell the Apple I computer to HP while working there. The early Apple computers were built with HP parts, under a legal release from HP.[9] Of the missed opportunity, Hewlett reportedly said, \"You win some, you lose some.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### Military service\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett served in the Army during World War II as a Signal Corps Officer. He then led the electronics section of the Development Division, a new part of the War Department Special Staff. After the war he was part of a special team that inspected Japanese Industry.[11]\n\n\n\n### Other companies\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett was a Director for Hexcel Products Incorporated (became Hexcel, founded by his wife Flora's brother in law Roscoe \"Bud\" Hughes) from 1956 to 1965, and worked on their executive committee. Hewlett served as a Director of Chase Manhattan Bank (became JPMorgan Chase) from 1969 to 1980. Hewlett was also elected to the board of directors for Chrysler Corporation in 1966, a position he held until 1983.[12]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting in the 1960s Hewlett committed much of his time and wealth towards numerous philanthropic causes. In 1966, William Hewlett and his wife Flora founded the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which became one of the largest private foundations in the United States. Aside from the foundation Hewlett gave millions of dollars to universities, schools, museums, non-profit organizations and other organizations. Stanford University was a large recipient of his philanthropy.[12]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett married Flora Lamson in 1939, and had 5 children with her: Eleanor, Walter, James, William and Mary. They had 12 grandchildren. His wife died in 1977. In 1978, Hewlett married Rosemary Kopmeier Bradford.\n\n\nHe was a committed conservationist and avid outdoorsman. As an amateur photographer and botanist, he took many photographs and samples of wildflowers. Some of these were donated to the California Academy of Sciences.[13]\n\n\nHewlett died of heart failure in Palo Alto, California on January 12, 2001 (aged 87),[14][15] and was interred at Los Gatos Memorial Park, San Jose, California.[16]\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, the William R. Hewlett Teaching Center at Stanford was named in his honor. The building is located in the Science and Engineering Quad, adjacent to the David Packard Electrical Engineering Building.[17]\n\n\n\n## Awards\n\n[edit]\n\n* member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1970)[18]\n* IEEE Founders Medal (1973)\n* Vermilye Medal (1975)\n* member, National Academy of Sciences (1977)[19]\n* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1981)[20]\n* member, American Philosophical Society (1981)[21]\n* National Medal of Science (1983)\n* National Inventors Hall of Fame (1992)[22]\n* Lemelson-MIT Prize Lifetime Achievement Award (1995)\n* The 3rd Annual Heinz Award Chairman's Medal (with David Packard) (1997)[23]\n* Entrepreneur Walk of Fame (2011)\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** David Packard (1995). *The HP Way*.

In 1916 the family moved to San Francisco after his father, Albion Walter Hewlett, took a similar position at Stanford Medical School, located at the time in San Francisco. He attended Lowell High School and was the 1929-1930 Battalion Commander of the school's Army JROTC program. He was accepted at Stanford University as a favor to his late father who died of a brain tumor in 1925.[1]\n\n\nHewlett received his bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 1934, a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1936, and a post-masters engineering degree in electrical engineering from Stanford in 1939. He joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity during his time at Stanford. Hewlett also had dyslexia, which caused him to struggle with reading and taking notes.[2]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Hewlett-Packard\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett attended undergraduate classes taught by Fred Terman at Stanford and became acquainted with David Packard. Packard and he began discussing forming a company in August 1937, and founded Hewlett-Packard Company as a partnership on January 1, 1939. A flip of a coin decided the ordering of their names.[3] Their first big breakthrough came when Disney purchased eight audio oscillators designed by Hewlett which were used for the production of the film *Fantasia*.[4]\n\n\nThe company incorporated in 1947 and tendered an initial public offering in 1957.[1] Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were proud of their company culture which came to be known as the HP Way. The HP Way is a corporate culture that claimed to be centered not only on making money but also on respecting and nurturing its employees. Hewlett was president of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1954.[5]\n\n\nHe was president of HP from 1964 to 1977 and served as CEO from 1968 to 1978, after which he was succeeded by John A. Young. He remained chairman of the executive committee until 1983, and then served as vice chairman of the board until 1987.\n\n\nA young Steve Jobs, then age 12,[6] called Hewlett (whose number was in the phone book) and requested any available parts for a frequency counter he was building. Hewlett, impressed with Jobs' initiative, offered him a summer job assembling frequency counters.[7] Jobs then considered HP one of the companies that he admired, regarding it among the handful of companies (Disney and Intel were the others) that were built “to last, not just to make money”.[8] Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple along with Jobs, unsuccessfully attempted five times to sell the Apple I computer to HP while working there. The early Apple computers were built with HP parts, under a legal release from HP.[9] Of the missed opportunity, Hewlett reportedly said, \"You win some, you lose some.\"[10]\n\n\n\n### Military service\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett served in the Army during World War II as a Signal Corps Officer. He then led the electronics section of the Development Division, a new part of the War Department Special Staff. After the war he was part of a special team that inspected Japanese Industry.[11]\n\n\n\n### Other companies\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett was a Director for Hexcel Products Incorporated (became Hexcel, founded by his wife Flora's brother in law Roscoe \"Bud\" Hughes) from 1956 to 1965, and worked on their executive committee. Hewlett served as a Director of Chase Manhattan Bank (became JPMorgan Chase) from 1969 to 1980. Hewlett was also elected to the board of directors for Chrysler Corporation in 1966, a position he held until 1983.[12]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nStarting in the 1960s Hewlett committed much of his time and wealth towards numerous philanthropic causes. In 1966, William Hewlett and his wife Flora founded the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which became one of the largest private foundations in the United States. Aside from the foundation Hewlett gave millions of dollars to universities, schools, museums, non-profit organizations and other organizations. Stanford University was a large recipient of his philanthropy.[12]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nHewlett married Flora Lamson in 1939, and had 5 children with her: Eleanor, Walter, James, William and Mary. They had 12 grandchildren. His wife died in 1977. In 1978, Hewlett married Rosemary Kopmeier Bradford.\n\n\nHe was a committed conservationist and avid outdoorsman. As an amateur photographer and botanist, he took many photographs and samples of wildflowers. Some of these were donated to the California Academy of Sciences.[13]\n\n\nHewlett died of heart failure in Palo Alto, California on January 12, 2001 (aged 87),[14][15] and was interred at Los Gatos Memorial Park, San Jose, California.[16]\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, the William R. Hewlett Teaching Center at Stanford was named in his honor. The building is located in the Science and Engineering Quad, adjacent to the David Packard Electrical Engineering Building.[17]\n\n\n\n## Awards\n\n[edit]\n\n* member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1970)[18]\n* IEEE Founders Medal (1973)\n* Vermilye Medal (1975)\n* member, National Academy of Sciences (1977)[19]\n* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (1981)[20]\n* member, American Philosophical Society (1981)[21]\n* National Medal of Science (1983)\n* National Inventors Hall of Fame (1992)[22]\n* Lemelson-MIT Prize Lifetime Achievement Award (1995)\n* The 3rd Annual Heinz Award Chairman's Medal (with David Packard) (1997)[23]\n* Entrepreneur Walk of Fame (2011)\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** David Packard (1995). *The HP Way*.

He is the founder, chairman, and CEO of Dell Technologies, one of the world's largest technology infrastructure companies.[1] He is the 18th richest person in the world according to the *Bloomberg Billionaires Index*, with a net worth of $65 billion as of November 2023.[2]\n\n\nIn 2011, his 243.35 million shares of Dell stock were worth $3.5 billion, giving him 12% ownership of the company.[3] His remaining wealth of roughly $10 billion is invested in other companies and is managed by DFO Management, which incorporates his initials.[4] In January 2013 it was announced that he had bid to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest management buyout since the Great Recession. Dell Inc. officially went private in October 2013.[5] The company once again went public in December 2018.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDell was born in 1965 in Houston to a Jewish family. His parents were Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[7] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist. Michael attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[8] He would go on to attend Memorial High School.[9] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight.[10] In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[11]\n\n\nDell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[12] Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the *Houston Post* in the summer.[13] Dell's parents wanted him to be a doctor and in order to please them, he took up pre-med at the University of Texas in 1983.[14] Dell continued learning to target specific populations for newspaper subscriptions rather than just making cold calls.[15] He discovered that people who were most likely to get a subscription were newlyweds and people moving to a new home. After collecting the contact information of this population from public records, he sent direct mail appeals and earned $18,000 in one year.[13] He hired several employees, and after earning a gross profit of nearly $200,000 in his first year of business, Dell dropped out of the University of Texas at age 19.[16]\n\n\n\n## Business career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A PC's Limited Turbo PC signed by Dell\n![](image)Michael Dell lecturing at the Oracle OpenWorld, San Francisco 2010\nWhile a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building.[9][17] He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[18][19][20]\n\n\nIn January 1984, Dell believed that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel.[21] In January 1984, Dell registered his company as \"PC's Limited\". Dell’s strategy was to sell directly to customers by manufacturing computers only after they were ordered.[22] Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 worth of PC upgrades, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as \"Dell Computer Corporation\" and relocated to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few people as order takers, a few more to fill the orders, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff consisting of \"three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables\". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[23][24]\n\n\nIn 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in *Fortune* magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[25] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon[*when?*] reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[26] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, surpassing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitors' sales were shrinking.[27]\n\n\nIn 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[28] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[29]\n\n\nIn 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the company.[30]\n\n\nOn October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the \"highest-valued tech acquisition in history\".[31][32] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[33]\n\n\n\n## Penalty[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[34] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each and former CFO James Schneider agreed to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[34]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nAccolades for Dell include \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" (at age 24) from *Inc.* magazine;[35] \"Top CEO in American Business\" from *Worth* magazine; \"CEO of the Year\" from *Financial World*, *IndustryWeek* and *Chief Executive* magazines. Dell also received the 1998 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[36] and the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[37]\n\n\n\n## Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nDell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[38]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Governor Greg Abbott named Dell to the Strike Force to Open Texas – a group \"tasked with finding safe and effective ways to slowly reopen the state\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.[39] He also serves as an advisor on the COVID-19 Technology Task Force, a technology industry coalition founded in March 2020 collaborating on solutions to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.[40]\n\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\nDell's 1999 book, *Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry* (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[41]\n\n\nDell's second book, *Play Nice But Win: A CEO's Journey from Founder to Leader* (by Portfolio), is a story of inside battles that defined him as a leader. The book was written in collaboration with James Kaplan.[42]\n\n\n\n## Wealth[edit]\n\n\n*Forbes* estimated Dell's net worth at $71.5 billion as of October 2023.[43]\n\n\nIn February 2018, it was reported that in 2014, Dell had paid $100.5 million for Manhattan's One57 penthouse, which was then a record for the most expensive home ever sold in the city.[44]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989, in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[45][46][47]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to complement the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[48] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.[49] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa.[50] Dell is also behind the founding of the Dell Jewish Community Campus in the Northwest Hills neighborhood of Austin.[51]\n\n\nBy 2011, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa.[52] Today the foundation has over $466 million in assets under management.[53]\n\n\nIn 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[54]\n\n\nIn 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[55]\n\n\nIn 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[56]\n\n\nIn 2017, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Dell, a Houston native, pledged $36 million to relief efforts.[57]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Dell donated $1 billion to his foundation, which focuses on child poverty; it makes both impact investments and charitable donations.[58]\n\n\nIn 2018, Dell Technologies returned to public markets through a complicated financial restructuring.[59]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation donated $100 million to support small businesses and others endure the COVID-19 pandemic and help finding treatments for coronavirus.[60]\n\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation donated $38 million to three non-profit organizations that are devoted to housing homeless people in Austin.[61]\n\n\nIn 2023, it was noted that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation has donated over $2.43 billion so far.[62]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Surrounding oneself with the best talent\". *Industr*.

He is the founder, chairman, and CEO of Dell Technologies, one of the world's largest technology infrastructure companies.[1] He is the 18th richest person in the world according to the *Bloomberg Billionaires Index*, with a net worth of $65 billion as of November 2023.[2]\n\n\nIn 2011, his 243.35 million shares of Dell stock were worth $3.5 billion, giving him 12% ownership of the company.[3] His remaining wealth of roughly $10 billion is invested in other companies and is managed by DFO Management, which incorporates his initials.[4] In January 2013 it was announced that he had bid to take Dell Inc. private for $24.4 billion in the biggest management buyout since the Great Recession. Dell Inc. officially went private in October 2013.[5] The company once again went public in December 2018.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDell was born in 1965 in Houston to a Jewish family. His parents were Lorraine Charlotte (née Langfan), a stockbroker,[7] and Alexander Dell, an orthodontist. Michael attended Herod Elementary School in Houston.[8] He would go on to attend Memorial High School.[9] In a bid to enter business early, he applied to take a high school equivalency exam at age eight.[10] In his early teens, he invested his earnings from part-time jobs in stocks and precious metals.[11]\n\n\nDell purchased his first calculator at age seven and encountered an early teletype terminal in junior high. At age 15, after playing with computers at Radio Shack, he got his first computer, an Apple II, which he promptly disassembled to see how it worked.[12] Dell attended Memorial High School in Houston, selling subscriptions to the *Houston Post* in the summer.[13] Dell's parents wanted him to be a doctor and in order to please them, he took up pre-med at the University of Texas in 1983.[14] Dell continued learning to target specific populations for newspaper subscriptions rather than just making cold calls.[15] He discovered that people who were most likely to get a subscription were newlyweds and people moving to a new home. After collecting the contact information of this population from public records, he sent direct mail appeals and earned $18,000 in one year.[13] He hired several employees, and after earning a gross profit of nearly $200,000 in his first year of business, Dell dropped out of the University of Texas at age 19.[16]\n\n\n\n## Business career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A PC's Limited Turbo PC signed by Dell\n![](image)Michael Dell lecturing at the Oracle OpenWorld, San Francisco 2010\nWhile a freshman pre-med student at the University of Texas, Dell started an informal business putting together and selling upgrade kits for personal computers in Room 2713 of the Dobie Center residential building.[9][17] He then applied for a vendor license to bid on contracts for the State of Texas, winning bids by not having the overhead of a computer store.[18][19][20]\n\n\nIn January 1984, Dell believed that the potential cost savings of a manufacturer selling PCs directly had enormous advantages over the conventional indirect retail channel.[21] In January 1984, Dell registered his company as \"PC's Limited\". Dell’s strategy was to sell directly to customers by manufacturing computers only after they were ordered.[22] Operating out of a condominium, the business sold between $50,000 and $80,000 worth of PC upgrades, kits, and add-on components. In May, Dell incorporated the company as \"Dell Computer Corporation\" and relocated to a business center in North Austin. The company employed a few people as order takers, a few more to fill the orders, and, as Dell recalled, a manufacturing staff consisting of \"three guys with screwdrivers sitting at six-foot tables\". The venture's capitalization cost was $1,000.[23][24]\n\n\nIn 1992, aged 27, he became the youngest CEO of a company ranked in *Fortune* magazine's list of the top 500 corporations.[25] In 1996, Dell started selling computers over the Web, the same year his company launched its first servers. Dell Inc. soon[*when?*] reported about $1 million in sales per day from dell.com.[26] In the first quarter of 2001, Dell Inc. reached a world market share of 12.8 percent, surpassing Compaq to become the world's largest PC maker. The metric marked the first time the rankings had shifted over the previous seven years. The company's combined shipments of desktops, notebooks and servers grew 34.3 percent worldwide and 30.7 percent in the United States at a time when competitors' sales were shrinking.[27]\n\n\nIn 1998, Dell founded MSD Capital L.P. to manage his family's investments. Investment activities include publicly traded securities, private equity activities, and real estate. The firm employs 80 people and has offices in New York, Santa Monica and London. Dell himself is not involved in day-to-day operations.[28] On March 4, 2004, Dell stepped down as CEO, but stayed as chairman of Dell Inc.'s board, while Kevin Rollins, then president and COO, became president and CEO. On January 31, 2007, Dell returned as CEO at the request of the board, succeeding Rollins.[29]\n\n\nIn 2013, Michael Dell with the help of Silver Lake Partners, Microsoft, and a consortium of lenders took Dell, Inc. private. The deal was reportedly worth $25 billion and faced difficulties during its execution. Notable resistance came from Carl Icahn, but after several months he stepped aside. Michael Dell received a 75% stake in the company.[30]\n\n\nOn October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire the enterprise software and storage company EMC Corporation. At $67 billion, it has been labeled the \"highest-valued tech acquisition in history\".[31][32] The acquisition was finalized September 7, 2016.[33]\n\n\n\n## Penalty[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010 Dell Inc. agreed to pay a $100 million penalty to settle SEC charges[34] of disclosure and accounting fraud in relation to undisclosed payments from Intel Corporation. Michael Dell and former CEO Kevin Rollins agreed to pay $4 million each and former CFO James Schneider agreed to pay $3 million to settle the charges.[34]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nAccolades for Dell include \"Entrepreneur of the Year\" (at age 24) from *Inc.* magazine;[35] \"Top CEO in American Business\" from *Worth* magazine; \"CEO of the Year\" from *Financial World*, *IndustryWeek* and *Chief Executive* magazines. Dell also received the 1998 Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[36] and the 2013 Franklin Institute's Bower Award for Business Leadership.[37]\n\n\n\n## Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nDell serves on the Foundation Board of the World Economic Forum, the executive committee of the International Business Council, the U.S. Business Council. He previously served as a member of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[38]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Governor Greg Abbott named Dell to the Strike Force to Open Texas – a group \"tasked with finding safe and effective ways to slowly reopen the state\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.[39] He also serves as an advisor on the COVID-19 Technology Task Force, a technology industry coalition founded in March 2020 collaborating on solutions to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.[40]\n\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\nDell's 1999 book, *Direct from Dell: Strategies That Revolutionized an Industry* (by HarperBusiness), is an account of his early life, his company's founding, growth and missteps, as well as lessons learned. The book was written in collaboration with Catherine Fredman.[41]\n\n\nDell's second book, *Play Nice But Win: A CEO's Journey from Founder to Leader* (by Portfolio), is a story of inside battles that defined him as a leader. The book was written in collaboration with James Kaplan.[42]\n\n\n\n## Wealth[edit]\n\n\n*Forbes* estimated Dell's net worth at $71.5 billion as of October 2023.[43]\n\n\nIn February 2018, it was reported that in 2014, Dell had paid $100.5 million for Manhattan's One57 penthouse, which was then a record for the most expensive home ever sold in the city.[44]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDell married Susan Lieberman on October 28, 1989, in Austin, Texas; the couple reside there with their four children.[45][46][47]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn 1999, Michael and Susan Dell established the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, which focuses on, among other causes, grants, urban education, childhood health and family economic stability. In 2006, the foundation provided $50 million in grants to three health-related organizations associated with the University of Texas: the Michael & Susan Dell Center for Advancement of Healthy Living, the Dell Pediatric Research Institute to complement the Dell Children's Medical Center, as well as funding for a new computer science building at the University of Texas at Austin campus.[48] In 2013, the foundation provided an additional $50 million commitment to establish the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin.[49] Since 1999, the MSDF has committed $1.23 billion to non-profits and social enterprises in the United States, India and South Africa.[50] Dell is also behind the founding of the Dell Jewish Community Campus in the Northwest Hills neighborhood of Austin.[51]\n\n\nBy 2011, the foundation had committed more than $650 million to children's issues and community initiatives in the United States, India and South Africa.[52] Today the foundation has over $466 million in assets under management.[53]\n\n\nIn 2002, Dell received an honorary doctorate in Economic Science from the University of Limerick in honor of his investment in Ireland and the local community and for his support for educational initiatives.[54]\n\n\nIn 2012, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation committed $50 million for medical education. The Dell Medical School began enrolling students in 2016.[55]\n\n\nIn 2014, he donated $1.8 million to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces.[56]\n\n\nIn 2017, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, Dell, a Houston native, pledged $36 million to relief efforts.[57]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Dell donated $1 billion to his foundation, which focuses on child poverty; it makes both impact investments and charitable donations.[58]\n\n\nIn 2018, Dell Technologies returned to public markets through a complicated financial restructuring.[59]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation donated $100 million to support small businesses and others endure the COVID-19 pandemic and help finding treatments for coronavirus.[60]\n\n\nIn 2021, it was announced that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation donated $38 million to three non-profit organizations that are devoted to housing homeless people in Austin.[61]\n\n\nIn 2023, it was noted that the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation has donated over $2.43 billion so far.[62]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Surrounding oneself with the best talent\". *Industr*.

Its products include desktop computers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones, networking equipment, monitors, wi-fi routers, projectors, motherboards, graphics cards, optical storage, multimedia products, peripherals, wearables, servers, workstations and tablet PCs. The company is also an original equipment manufacturer (OEM).\n\n\nAsus is the world's 5th-largest PC vendor by unit sales as of January 2023.[8] Asus appears in *BusinessWeek*'s \"InfoTech 100\" and \"Asia's Top 10 IT Companies\" rankings, and it ranked first in the IT Hardware category of the 2008 Taiwan Top 10 Global Brands survey with a total brand value of US$1.3 billion.[9]\n\n\nAsus has a primary listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the ticker code *2357* and formerly had a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker code *ASKD*.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe company is usually referred to as *ASUS* or *Huáshuò* in Chinese (traditional Chinese: 華碩; simplified Chinese: 华硕, literally \"Eminence by the Chinese\"[10]). According to the company website, the name *ASUS* originates from Pegasus, the winged horse of Greek mythology.[11] Only the last four letters of the word were used to give the name a high position in alphabetical listings.[12]\nAs its marketing taglines, ASUS has used *Rock Solid. Heart Touching* (2003–2009) and subsequently *Inspiring Innovation Persistent Perfection* (2009–2013). Since 2013, the company's tagline has been *In Search of Incredible.*[13]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAsus was founded in Taipei in 1989[14] by T.H. Tung, Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao,[15] all four having previously worked at Acer as hardware engineers. At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer hardware business. Intel Corporation would supply any new processors to more established companies like IBM first, and Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering prototypes. According to company history, Asus created a motherboard prototype for using an Intel 486, but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with its own 486 motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem and it turned out that Asus' motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.[16][17]\n\n\nIn September 2005, Asus released the first PhysX accelerator card.[18] In December 2005, Asus entered the LCD TV market with the TLW32001 model.[19] In January 2006, Asus announced that it would cooperate with Lamborghini to develop the VX laptop series.[20]\n\n\nOn 9 March 2006, Asus was confirmed as one of the manufacturers of the first Microsoft Origami models, together with Samsung and Founder Technology.[21] On 8 August 2006, Asus announced a joint venture with Gigabyte Technology.[22] On 5 June 2007, Asus announced the launch of the Eee PC at COMPUTEX Taipei. On 9 September 2007, Asus indicated support for Blu-ray, announcing the release of a BD-ROM/DVD writer PC drive, BC-1205PT.[23] ASUS subsequently released several Blu-ray based notebooks.\n\n\nIn January 2008, Asus began a major restructuring of its operations, splitting into three independent companies: Asus (focused on applied first-party branded computers and electronics); Pegatron (focused on OEM manufacturing of motherboards and components); and Unihan Corporation (focused on non-PC manufacturing such as cases and molding).[24][25] In the process of the restructuring, a highly criticized pension-plan restructuring effectively zeroed out the existing pension balances. The company paid out all contributions previously made by employees.[26]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2008, the Open Handset Alliance announced that Asus had become one of 14 new members of the organization. These \"new members will either deploy compatible Android devices, contribute significant code to the Android Open-Source Project, or support the ecosystem through products and services that will accelerate the availability of Android-based devices.\"[27]\n\n\nOn 1 June 2010, Asus spun off Pegatron Corp.[28]\n\n\nIn October 2010, Asus and Garmin announced that they would be ending their smartphone partnership as a result of Garmin deciding to exit the product category.[29] The two companies had produced six Garmin-ASUS branded smartphones over the prior two years.[29]\n\n\nIn December 2010, Asus launched the world's thinnest notebook, the Asus U36, with Intel processor voltage standard (not low voltage) Intel Core i3 or i5 with a thickness of only 19 mm.[30]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Asus officially ended production of its Eee PC series due to declining sales caused by consumers increasingly switching to tablets and Ultrabooks.[31][32] In April 2022, the company unveiled its new logo.[33][34]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Asus US headquarters in Fremont, California\n![](image)An Asus shop in Hong Kong\nAsus has its headquarters in Beitou District, Taipei, Taiwan.[35]\n\n\nAs of 2009[update], Asus had manufacturing facilities in Taiwan (Taipei, Luzhu, Nangang, Guishan), mainland China (Suzhou, Chongqing), Mexico (Ciudad Juárez) and the Czech Republic (Ostrava). The Asus Hi-Tech Park, located in Suzhou, covers 540,000 m2 (5,800,000 sq ft).[36]\n\n\nAsus operates around 50 service sites across 32 countries and has over 400 service partners worldwide.[37]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\nAsus' products include 2-in-1s, laptops, tablet computers, desktop computers, smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), servers, computer monitors, motherboards, graphics cards, sound cards, DVD drives, computer networking devices, computer cases, computer components and computer cooling systems.\n\n\nOne of Asus main lineup is the Vivo lineup consisting of laptops (VivoBooks), All-in-Ones (Vivo AiO), desktops (VivoPC), Stick PCs (VivoStick), Mini PCs (VivoMini), smartwatches (VivoWatch), computer mouse (VivoMouse) and tablets (VivoTab).[38]\n\n\n\n* ![ASUS ZenFone](image)\n\nASUS ZenFone\n* ![An Asus Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card](image)\n\nAn Asus Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card\n* ![An Asus x21 ultrabook](image)\n\nAn Asus x21 ultrabook\n* ![An Asus motherboard](image)\n\nAn Asus motherboard\n\n\n### Smartphones[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asus ZenFone\n\nAsus also launched many Android-based smartphones, predominantly with Intel rather than ARM processors and often with two sim slots. Asus is currently very influential in big mobile markets like India, China, and other Asian countries. It is known as the ZenFone series. Before the ZenFone line, Asus released feature phones such as the Asus v70 and smartphones running on Windows Mobile during the mid-2000s.\n\n\n**First Generation (2014)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone 4 (available in either 4-inch or 4.5-inch variant)\n* ZenFone 5\n* ZenFone 6\n\n\n**Second Generation (2015)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone Zoom\n* ZenFone C\n* ZenFone 2\n* ZenFone 2 Laser\n* ZenFone Max\n* ZenFone Selfie\n* ZenFone Go[39]\n* ZenFone 2E – made specifically for AT&T and released in 2015[40]\n\n\n**Third Generation (2016)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone AR\n* ZenFone 3 series\n\n\n**Fourth Generation (2017)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone 4 series\n\n\n**Fifth Generation (2018)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone 5 series\n* ZenFone Max series (M1 and M2)\n* ZenFone Live series (L1 and L2)\n* ROG Phone series\n\n\n**Sixth Generation (2019)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone 6 series\n* ROG Phone 2 series\n\n\nAdditionally, Asus also produced some hybrid devices with smartphones that can be docked in a tablet screen, known as **Padfone** series.

As of December 2011[update] the line consisted of the CG Series (designed for gaming), the CM series (for entertainment and home use) and the CS and CP slimline series.[50]\n\n\n\n### Digital media receivers[edit]\n\n\nAsus sells digital media receivers under the name ASUS O!Play.[51]\n\n\n\n### GPS devices[edit]\n\n\nAsus produces the R700T GPS device, which incorporates Traffic Message Channel.[52]\n\n\n\n### Republic of Gamers (ROG) [edit]\n\n\n![](image)Republic of Gamers (old logo)\nFile:Republic of Gamers (ROG).pngRepublic of Gamers (new logo)\n![](image)ASUS promotional model and ROG products\n**Republic of Gamers** (**ROG**) is a brand used by ASUS since 2006, encompassing a range of computer hardware, personal computers, peripherals, and accessories. \n\n\nAMD graphics cards were marketed under the *Arez* brand due to the Nvidia's GeForce Partner Program.[53]\n\n\nIn 2013 ASUS launched the RAIDR Express, a PCI express-based RAID 0 SSD subsystem with two SSDs on one PCB.[54]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Asus announced the ROG Flow Z13 during ROG's CES 2022 launch event. Equipped with the high-performance Intel's Core i9 processor and Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphic performance, making the biggest innovation breakthroughs in tablet markets. It is the world's first RTX 30 series computer in tablet form factor.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Asus ROG Ally handheld gaming computer\nIn June 2023, Asus released the ROG Ally, a handheld device designed to compete with the Steam Deck. The Ally possesses a 7-inch (diagonal), 1080p touchscreen display with a 120 Hz refresh rate capability and a 16:9 aspect ratio, versus the Steam Deck's panel that only manages 800p and 60 Hz with a 16:10 aspect ratio.[56]\n\n\n\n### The Ultimate Force (TUF)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ASUS TUF Gaming X3\n**The Ultimate Force** (**TUF**) is a brand used by ASUS since about 2010.[57] The brand is for ASUS affordable, mid-range gaming products.\n\n\n\n### Sound cards[edit]\n\n\nAsus released its first sound card, the Xonar DX, in February 2008. The Xonar DX was able to emulate the EAX 5.0 effects through the ASUS GX software while also supporting Open AL and DTS-connect.[58] In July 2008 ASUS launched the Xonar D1, which offered largely similar features to the Xonar DX but connected to the motherboard through the PCI interface instead of the PCI-E ×1 connection of the Xonar DX.[59] ASUS then released the Xonar HDAV 1.3, which was the first solution enabling loss-less HD audio bit streaming to AV receivers.[60]\n\n\nIn May 2009, Asus launched the Essence ST sound card, targeted at high-end audiophiles, and featuring 124 dB SNR rating and precision audio clock tuning.[61] In the same month, Asus refreshed the HDAV family by releasing the HDAV 1.3 slim, a card targeted for HTPC users offering similar functionality to HDAV 1.3 but in a smaller form.[62] During Computex 2010, ASUS introduced its Xonar Xense, an audio bundle composed of the Xense sound card and a special edition of the Sennheiser PC350 headset.[63][64] In August 2010, ASUS released the Xonar DG sound card targeted at budget buyers and offering 5.1 surround sound support, 105 dB SNR rating, support for Dolby headphone and GX 2.5 support for emulating EAX 5.0 technology.[65][66]\n\n\n\n### ASUS VivoPC line[edit]\n\n\nAsus entered the box-PC market with the Vivo PC line in November 2013.[67] ASUS VivoPCs come without a pre-installed Windows operating system.\n\n\nOn 23 October 2013, ASUS launched two models of VivoPCs in India.[68] VivoPC was initially announced with Intel Celeron processor equipped VM40B model. But in India, the company released VivoPC along with a new model called VC60 which is equipped with Intel Core series processors.[69]\n\n\n\n### Portable monitors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Asus released the MB168B, a USB 3.0-powered, portable external monitor. The base model shipped with a resolution of 1366 × 768, while the MB168B+ had a resolution of 1920 × 1080.[70] At the time of its release, the MB168B+ was the only 1080p portable monitor. According to Asus, it is the \"world's slimmest and lightest USB monitor\".[70]\n\n\n\n### Desktop monitors[edit]\n\n\n* ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDM\n* ROG Swift OLED PG42UQ\n* ROG Swift OLED PG48UQ\n* ROG Swift PG279QM (2560x1440, 240Hz, IPS)\n* ROG Swift PG27AQN (2560x1440, 360Hz, IPS)\n* ROG Swift PG279Q[71]\n* ROG Swift PG348Q\n* ROG Swift PG35VQ[72]\n* ROG Swift PB27UQ\n* ROG Strix XG27AQ\n* ROG Strix XG27AQM\n* ROG Strix XG27AQMR\n* ROG Strix XG27AQV\n* MX34VQ\n* VZ279Q\n\n\n### Motherboards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Q-Connector\nAsus motherboards sometimes include a **Q-Connector** which sits in between the motherboard front panel connectors and the front panel cables. The Q-Connector is marked with bigger text than the front panel connectors on the motherboard, as well as protruding from the motherboard, limiting obstruction from heatsinks and other connectors.[73][74]\n\n\nThe Q-connector allows the many front-panel connections to be removed as a single unit for maintenance. This greatly reduces the risk of incorrect connections when reassembling.[75]\n\n\n\n## Other initiatives[edit]\n\n\n### Esports[edit]\n\n\nAsus ROG has been an active advocate for esports, having established some of their very own professional gaming teams.[76]\n\n\nIn January 2021, ROG announced the establishment of a new esports academy in India, with plans to scout and train professional gamers for the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) PC game.[77] The initiative will provide shortlisted gamers with coaching, gaming equipment, and stipends to prepare them for competitive esports tournaments on both the national and international levels.[78]\n\n\n\n## Environmental record[edit]\n\n\n### Green ASUS[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Asus launched Green ASUS,[79] a company-wide sustainable computing initiative overseen by a steering committee led by Jonney Shih, the Chairman of Asus. According to the company, Asus pursues green policies in \"Design, Procurement, Manufacturing, and Marketing.\"[80]\n\n\n\n### Recognition[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Asus obtained IECQ (IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components) and HSPM (Hazardous Substance Process Management) certification for its headquarters and all of its manufacturing sites.[81]\n\n\nIn 2007, Oekom Research, an independent research institute specializing in corporate responsibility assessment, recognized Asus as a \"highly environmental friendly company\" in the \"Computers, Peripherals and Office Electronics Industry\".[82]\n\n\nIn October 2008, Asus received 11 Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) Gold Awards for its products,[83] including four of its N-Series notebooks, namely the N10, N20, N50, and N80. In the following month, it received EU Flower certification for the same N-Series notebooks at an award ceremony held in Prague.[82] In December 2008, Det Norske Veritas conferred the world's first EuP (Energy-using Product) certification for portable notebooks on these machines.[82]\n\n\n\n### Recycling campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2008, Asus launched its \"PC Recycling for a Brighter Future\"[84][85]\nprogram in collaboration with Intel and with Tsann Kuen Enterprise Co. The program collected more than 1,200 desktop computers, notebooks and CRT/LCD monitors, refurbished them and donated them to 122 elementary and junior high schools, five aboriginal communities and the Tzu Chi Stem Cell Center.\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2008, *PC Pro* discovered through a reader that Asus had accidentally shipped laptops that contained cracked and unlicensed software.[86] Both physical machines and recovery CDs contained confidential documents from Microsoft and other organizations, internal Asus documents, and sensitive personal information including CVs. At the time, an Asus spokesperson promised an investigation at \"quite a high level\", but declined to comment on how the files got on the machines and recovery media.[87] It was demonstrated that an unattended installation of Windows Vista could accidentally copy material from a flash drive with a parameter in the \"unattend.xml\" file on the personal flash drive being used to script the installation.[88][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nIn February 2014, a security vulnerability in the AiCloud functions on a number of Asus routers was compromised to distribute a text file warning of a vulnerability, disclosed in June 2013, allowing the ability to \"traverse to any external storage plugged in through the USB ports on the back of the router\" via the open internet. Before making the vulnerability public, the researcher was told by Asus that the behavior was \"not an issue\", but the vulnerability was reportedly patched shortly before the breach.[89] The IP addresses of 12,937 routers, and 3,131 AiCloud accounts were also leaked by the hackers.[90] The U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint about the breach for the company's \"failure to employ reasonable security practices has subjected consumers to substantial injury\", alleging that Asus had also failed to perform basic penetration tests, allowed users to maintain a default admin password for the AiDisk feature and failed to notify users of security updates in a timely fashion. As a result, it was also deemed that Asus had misled consumers over the security and protection that its routers provided. In February 2016, Asus settled the complaint, agreeing to implement a \"comprehensive security program\", including independent audits every two years for the next 20 years.[91][90]\n\n\n\nIn March 2019, Kaspersky Lab researchers disclosed a supply chain attack that affected the Asus Live Update software bundled on its laptops, dubbed **ShadowHammer**. Kaspersky stated that between June and November 2018, Asus servers had been compromised to distribute a modified version of Live Update, signed with an Asus signature, that contained a backdoor. It deployed a further payload if the device's network adapter matched an entry on an internal target list of around 600 MAC addresses. In response to ShadowHammer, Asus released a patched version of Live Update with improved security measures. Kaspersky and Symantec estimated that between 500,000 and 1 million devices were infected with the backdoor, although Asus attempted to downplay the severity of the breach by noting the extremely targeted nature of the attack. The breach did not affect the similar, identically named software associated with its motherboards.[92][93][94]\n\n\n\nIn April 2019, ESET disclosed that a group known as BlackTech had performed targeted attacks with malware known as Plead, distributed via the updater for the Asus WebStorage service. ESET stated that the group was likely using a man-in-the-middle attack via a vulnerability in routers, in combination with the updater using an unencrypted HTTP connection.[95]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Asus recalled some of its Z690 Maximus Hero motherboards due to a manufacturing flaw, where a RAM capacitor was installed backward—causing them to burn out associated MOSFETs and prevent the motherboard from detecting memory.[96]\n\n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ASUS initially refused to join a widespread withdrawal of businesses from the Russian market. In mid-March, the company did announce it was halting its operations in Russia, following a social media boycott and government pressure.[97][98]\n\n\nIn April 2023, a post on the PCMasterRace subreddit began gaining popularity regarding the user's AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, which had visible burning, along with the socket of the Asus motherboard.[99] This sparked the attention of both people interested in PCs, who initially thought it was an issue with the 3D V-Cache Technology (as there had been previous user reports similar to this incident),[99] as well as enthusiast YouTube channels such as Gamers Nexus, who ran tests to successfully recreate the burning of their CPU.[100] They realised that the cause of the burning was due to a voltage error in the BIOS. In May, Asus responded to the incidents by releasing a Beta BIOS, which was supposed to fix the error. However, not only did the new BIOS not fix the issue; by installing it, the user voided their warranty as it was a Beta BIOS, which Asus clearly stated in the BIOS's description.[100][101][102] Later that month, Asus responded to the public backlash by reversing course, releasing a statement informing users that they will continue to honor warranty on motherboards that have been updated to beta BIOS versions, as well as extend motherboard warranty coverage to uses of AMD EXPO, Intel XMP, and DOCP memory overclocking technologies.[103][104]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Taiwan portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* ASRock\n* Biostar\n* DFI\n* Elitegroup Computer Systems\n* EVGA Corporation\n* Fastra II\n* Gigabyte Technology\n* Micro-Star International\n* List of companies of Taiwan\n* List of wireless router firmware projects\n* Tomato (firmware)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"ASUSTek Computer Inc.

Its products include desktop computers, laptops, netbooks, mobile phones, networking equipment, monitors, wi-fi routers, projectors, motherboards, graphics cards, optical storage, multimedia products, peripherals, wearables, servers, workstations and tablet PCs. The company is also an original equipment manufacturer (OEM).\n\n\nAsus is the world's 5th-largest PC vendor by unit sales as of January 2023.[8] Asus appears in *BusinessWeek*'s \"InfoTech 100\" and \"Asia's Top 10 IT Companies\" rankings, and it ranked first in the IT Hardware category of the 2008 Taiwan Top 10 Global Brands survey with a total brand value of US$1.3 billion.[9]\n\n\nAsus has a primary listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange under the ticker code *2357* and formerly had a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker code *ASKD*.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe company is usually referred to as *ASUS* or *Huáshuò* in Chinese (traditional Chinese: 華碩; simplified Chinese: 华硕, literally \"Eminence by the Chinese\"[10]). According to the company website, the name *ASUS* originates from Pegasus, the winged horse of Greek mythology.[11] Only the last four letters of the word were used to give the name a high position in alphabetical listings.[12]\nAs its marketing taglines, ASUS has used *Rock Solid. Heart Touching* (2003–2009) and subsequently *Inspiring Innovation Persistent Perfection* (2009–2013). Since 2013, the company's tagline has been *In Search of Incredible.*[13]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAsus was founded in Taipei in 1989[14] by T.H. Tung, Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao,[15] all four having previously worked at Acer as hardware engineers. At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer hardware business. Intel Corporation would supply any new processors to more established companies like IBM first, and Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering prototypes. According to company history, Asus created a motherboard prototype for using an Intel 486, but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with its own 486 motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem and it turned out that Asus' motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.[16][17]\n\n\nIn September 2005, Asus released the first PhysX accelerator card.[18] In December 2005, Asus entered the LCD TV market with the TLW32001 model.[19] In January 2006, Asus announced that it would cooperate with Lamborghini to develop the VX laptop series.[20]\n\n\nOn 9 March 2006, Asus was confirmed as one of the manufacturers of the first Microsoft Origami models, together with Samsung and Founder Technology.[21] On 8 August 2006, Asus announced a joint venture with Gigabyte Technology.[22] On 5 June 2007, Asus announced the launch of the Eee PC at COMPUTEX Taipei. On 9 September 2007, Asus indicated support for Blu-ray, announcing the release of a BD-ROM/DVD writer PC drive, BC-1205PT.[23] ASUS subsequently released several Blu-ray based notebooks.\n\n\nIn January 2008, Asus began a major restructuring of its operations, splitting into three independent companies: Asus (focused on applied first-party branded computers and electronics); Pegatron (focused on OEM manufacturing of motherboards and components); and Unihan Corporation (focused on non-PC manufacturing such as cases and molding).[24][25] In the process of the restructuring, a highly criticized pension-plan restructuring effectively zeroed out the existing pension balances. The company paid out all contributions previously made by employees.[26]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2008, the Open Handset Alliance announced that Asus had become one of 14 new members of the organization. These \"new members will either deploy compatible Android devices, contribute significant code to the Android Open-Source Project, or support the ecosystem through products and services that will accelerate the availability of Android-based devices.\"[27]\n\n\nOn 1 June 2010, Asus spun off Pegatron Corp.[28]\n\n\nIn October 2010, Asus and Garmin announced that they would be ending their smartphone partnership as a result of Garmin deciding to exit the product category.[29] The two companies had produced six Garmin-ASUS branded smartphones over the prior two years.[29]\n\n\nIn December 2010, Asus launched the world's thinnest notebook, the Asus U36, with Intel processor voltage standard (not low voltage) Intel Core i3 or i5 with a thickness of only 19 mm.[30]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Asus officially ended production of its Eee PC series due to declining sales caused by consumers increasingly switching to tablets and Ultrabooks.[31][32] In April 2022, the company unveiled its new logo.[33][34]\n\n\n\n## Operations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Asus US headquarters in Fremont, California\n![](image)An Asus shop in Hong Kong\nAsus has its headquarters in Beitou District, Taipei, Taiwan.[35]\n\n\nAs of 2009[update], Asus had manufacturing facilities in Taiwan (Taipei, Luzhu, Nangang, Guishan), mainland China (Suzhou, Chongqing), Mexico (Ciudad Juárez) and the Czech Republic (Ostrava). The Asus Hi-Tech Park, located in Suzhou, covers 540,000 m2 (5,800,000 sq ft).[36]\n\n\nAsus operates around 50 service sites across 32 countries and has over 400 service partners worldwide.[37]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\nAsus' products include 2-in-1s, laptops, tablet computers, desktop computers, smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), servers, computer monitors, motherboards, graphics cards, sound cards, DVD drives, computer networking devices, computer cases, computer components and computer cooling systems.\n\n\nOne of Asus main lineup is the Vivo lineup consisting of laptops (VivoBooks), All-in-Ones (Vivo AiO), desktops (VivoPC), Stick PCs (VivoStick), Mini PCs (VivoMini), smartwatches (VivoWatch), computer mouse (VivoMouse) and tablets (VivoTab).[38]\n\n\n\n* ![ASUS ZenFone](image)\n\nASUS ZenFone\n* ![An Asus Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card](image)\n\nAn Asus Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics card\n* ![An Asus x21 ultrabook](image)\n\nAn Asus x21 ultrabook\n* ![An Asus motherboard](image)\n\nAn Asus motherboard\n\n\n### Smartphones[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Asus ZenFone\n\nAsus also launched many Android-based smartphones, predominantly with Intel rather than ARM processors and often with two sim slots. Asus is currently very influential in big mobile markets like India, China, and other Asian countries. It is known as the ZenFone series. Before the ZenFone line, Asus released feature phones such as the Asus v70 and smartphones running on Windows Mobile during the mid-2000s.\n\n\n**First Generation (2014)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone 4 (available in either 4-inch or 4.5-inch variant)\n* ZenFone 5\n* ZenFone 6\n\n\n**Second Generation (2015)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone Zoom\n* ZenFone C\n* ZenFone 2\n* ZenFone 2 Laser\n* ZenFone Max\n* ZenFone Selfie\n* ZenFone Go[39]\n* ZenFone 2E – made specifically for AT&T and released in 2015[40]\n\n\n**Third Generation (2016)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone AR\n* ZenFone 3 series\n\n\n**Fourth Generation (2017)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone 4 series\n\n\n**Fifth Generation (2018)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone 5 series\n* ZenFone Max series (M1 and M2)\n* ZenFone Live series (L1 and L2)\n* ROG Phone series\n\n\n**Sixth Generation (2019)**\n\n\n\n* ZenFone 6 series\n* ROG Phone 2 series\n\n\nAdditionally, Asus also produced some hybrid devices with smartphones that can be docked in a tablet screen, known as **Padfone** series.

Two days later, it was released.[42] Asus has also been working with Microsoft in developing Windows 8 convertible tablets.[43] In 2013, Asus revealed an Android-based tablet computer that, when attached to a keyboard, becomes a Windows 8 device, which it called the Transformer Book Trio.[44] The keyboard can be attached to a third-party monitor, creating a desktop-like experience. Asus is also known for the following tablet computer lines:\n\n\n\n* Eee Pad Transformer\n* Eee Pad Slider\n* Eee Slate\n* Memo Pad 8\n* VivoTab\n* ZenPad: 7.0 Z370CG, C 7.0 Z170MG/Z170CG, 8.0 Z380KL, 8.0 Z380C\\*, S 8.0 Z580CA\\*, 10 Z300C\\* (Released 2015); 8.0 Z380M\\*, Z8 ZT581KL, 3 8.0 Z581KL, 10 Z300M\\*, 3S 10 Z500M\\*, Z10 ZT500KL (2016); 3S 8.0 Z582KL, Z8s ZT582KL, 3S 10 Z500KL (2017) (\\* no SIM) [45]\n\n\n### Asus Server[edit]\n\n\nGPU Rack Server\n* ESC8000 G3 (Up to 8 GPU high density & hybrid computing)\n* ESC4000 G3/G3s\n\n\n2-Way Rack Server\n* RS720Q-E8-RS8-P\n* RS720Q-E8-RS12\n* RS700-E8-RS8 V2\n* RS700-E8-RS4 V2\n* RS500-E8-RS4 V2\n* RS500-E8-RS4 V2\n* RS400-E8-PS2-F\n* RS400-E8-PS2\n* RS720-E8-RS24-ECP\n* RS540-E8-RS36-ECP\n* RS520-E8-RS12-E V2\n* RS520-E8-RS8-E V2\n\n\n1-Way Rack Server\n* RS300-E9-PS4\n* RS300-E9-RS4\n* RS200-E9-PS2-F\n* RS200-E9-PS2\n* RS100-E9-PI2\n\n\n2-Way Tower Server\n* TS700-E8 V3 Series\n* TS500-E8-PS4 V2\n\n\n1-Way Tower Server\n* TS300-E9-PS4\n* TS100-E9-PI4\n\n\n### Desktop & All-in-One PCs[edit]\n\n\nTower PCs\n* VivoPC\n* ROG series\n* Gaming series\n\n\nMini PCs\n* Asus Tinker Board\n* VivoMini\n\n\nChrome Devices\n* Chromebox\n* Chromebit\n\n\nAll-in-One PCs\n* Zen AiO\n* Vivo AiO\n* Portable AiO\n\n\n### Eee line[edit]\n\n\nFrom its launch in October 2007 and until the line was discontinued in January 2013, the Eee PC netbook garnered numerous awards, including Forbes Asia's Product of the Year,[46] Stuff Magazine's Gadget of the Year and Computer of the Year,[47] NBC.com's Best Travel Gadget, Computer Shopper's Best Netbook of 2008, PC Pro's Hardware of the Year, PC World's Best Netbook, and DIME magazine's 2008 Trend Award Winner.\n\n\nAsus subsequently added several products to its Eee lineup, including:\n\n\n\n* EeeBox PC, a compact nettop\n* Eee Top, an all-in-one touchscreen computer housed in an LCD monitor enclosure,\n* Eee Stick, a plug-and-play wireless controller for the PC platform that translates users' physical hand motions into corresponding movements onscreen\n* Eee Pad Transformer, is a tablet computer that runs the Android operating system.[48]\n* Eee Pad Transformer Prime, the successor to the original Transformer.\n\n\nOn 6 March 2009, Asus debuted its Eee Box B202, which PCMag saw as \"the desktop equivalent of the ASUS EeePC\", (the \"Asus Eee Box\" computer line was later renamed in 2010 to \"ASUS EeeBox PC\").[49]\n\n\n\n### Essentio Series[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Asus N55 S Package\nEssentio is a line of desktop PCs. As of December 2011[update] the line consisted of the CG Series (designed for gaming), the CM series (for entertainment and home use) and the CS and CP slimline series.[50]\n\n\n\n### Digital media receivers[edit]\n\n\nAsus sells digital media receivers under the name ASUS O!Play.[51]\n\n\n\n### GPS devices[edit]\n\n\nAsus produces the R700T GPS device, which incorporates Traffic Message Channel.[52]\n\n\n\n### Republic of Gamers (ROG) [edit]\n\n\n![](image)Republic of Gamers (old logo)\nFile:Republic of Gamers (ROG).pngRepublic of Gamers (new logo)\n![](image)ASUS promotional model and ROG products\n**Republic of Gamers** (**ROG**) is a brand used by ASUS since 2006, encompassing a range of computer hardware, personal computers, peripherals, and accessories. \n\n\nAMD graphics cards were marketed under the *Arez* brand due to the Nvidia's GeForce Partner Program.[53]\n\n\nIn 2013 ASUS launched the RAIDR Express, a PCI express-based RAID 0 SSD subsystem with two SSDs on one PCB.[54]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Asus announced the ROG Flow Z13 during ROG's CES 2022 launch event. Equipped with the high-performance Intel's Core i9 processor and Nvidia's GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphic performance, making the biggest innovation breakthroughs in tablet markets. It is the world's first RTX 30 series computer in tablet form factor.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Asus ROG Ally handheld gaming computer\nIn June 2023, Asus released the ROG Ally, a handheld device designed to compete with the Steam Deck. The Ally possesses a 7-inch (diagonal), 1080p touchscreen display with a 120 Hz refresh rate capability and a 16:9 aspect ratio, versus the Steam Deck's panel that only manages 800p and 60 Hz with a 16:10 aspect ratio.[56]\n\n\n\n### The Ultimate Force (TUF)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ASUS TUF Gaming X3\n**The Ultimate Force** (**TUF**) is a brand used by ASUS since about 2010.[57] The brand is for ASUS affordable, mid-range gaming products.\n\n\n\n### Sound cards[edit]\n\n\nAsus released its first sound card, the Xonar DX, in February 2008. The Xonar DX was able to emulate the EAX 5.0 effects through the ASUS GX software while also supporting Open AL and DTS-connect.[58] In July 2008 ASUS launched the Xonar D1, which offered largely similar features to the Xonar DX but connected to the motherboard through the PCI interface instead of the PCI-E ×1 connection of the Xonar DX.[59] ASUS then released the Xonar HDAV 1.3, which was the first solution enabling loss-less HD audio bit streaming to AV receivers.[60]\n\n\nIn May 2009, Asus launched the Essence ST sound card, targeted at high-end audiophiles, and featuring 124 dB SNR rating and precision audio clock tuning.[61] In the same month, Asus refreshed the HDAV family by releasing the HDAV 1.3 slim, a card targeted for HTPC users offering similar functionality to HDAV 1.3 but in a smaller form.[62] During Computex 2010, ASUS introduced its Xonar Xense, an audio bundle composed of the Xense sound card and a special edition of the Sennheiser PC350 headset.[63][64] In August 2010, ASUS released the Xonar DG sound card targeted at budget buyers and offering 5.1 surround sound support, 105 dB SNR rating, support for Dolby headphone and GX 2.5 support for emulating EAX 5.0 technology.[65][66]\n\n\n\n### ASUS VivoPC line[edit]\n\n\nAsus entered the box-PC market with the Vivo PC line in November 2013.[67] ASUS VivoPCs come without a pre-installed Windows operating system.\n\n\nOn 23 October 2013, ASUS launched two models of VivoPCs in India.[68] VivoPC was initially announced with Intel Celeron processor equipped VM40B model. But in India, the company released VivoPC along with a new model called VC60 which is equipped with Intel Core series processors.[69]\n\n\n\n### Portable monitors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Asus released the MB168B, a USB 3.0-powered, portable external monitor. The base model shipped with a resolution of 1366 × 768, while the MB168B+ had a resolution of 1920 × 1080.[70] At the time of its release, the MB168B+ was the only 1080p portable monitor. According to Asus, it is the \"world's slimmest and lightest USB monitor\".[70]\n\n\n\n### Desktop monitors[edit]\n\n\n* ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDM\n* ROG Swift OLED PG42UQ\n* ROG Swift OLED PG48UQ\n* ROG Swift PG279QM (2560x1440, 240Hz, IPS)\n* ROG Swift PG27AQN (2560x1440, 360Hz, IPS)\n* ROG Swift PG279Q[71]\n* ROG Swift PG348Q\n* ROG Swift PG35VQ[72]\n* ROG Swift PB27UQ\n* ROG Strix XG27AQ\n* ROG Strix XG27AQM\n* ROG Strix XG27AQMR\n* ROG Strix XG27AQV\n* MX34VQ\n* VZ279Q\n\n\n### Motherboards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Q-Connector\nAsus motherboards sometimes include a **Q-Connector** which sits in between the motherboard front panel connectors and the front panel cables. The Q-Connector is marked with bigger text than the front panel connectors on the motherboard, as well as protruding from the motherboard, limiting obstruction from heatsinks and other connectors.[73][74]\n\n\nThe Q-connector allows the many front-panel connections to be removed as a single unit for maintenance. This greatly reduces the risk of incorrect connections when reassembling.[75]\n\n\n\n## Other initiatives[edit]\n\n\n### Esports[edit]\n\n\nAsus ROG has been an active advocate for esports, having established some of their very own professional gaming teams.[76]\n\n\nIn January 2021, ROG announced the establishment of a new esports academy in India, with plans to scout and train professional gamers for the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) PC game.[77] The initiative will provide shortlisted gamers with coaching, gaming equipment, and stipends to prepare them for competitive esports tournaments on both the national and international levels.[78]\n\n\n\n## Environmental record[edit]\n\n\n### Green ASUS[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Asus launched Green ASUS,[79] a company-wide sustainable computing initiative overseen by a steering committee led by Jonney Shih, the Chairman of Asus. According to the company, Asus pursues green policies in \"Design, Procurement, Manufacturing, and Marketing.\"[80]\n\n\n\n### Recognition[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Asus obtained IECQ (IEC Quality Assessment System for Electronic Components) and HSPM (Hazardous Substance Process Management) certification for its headquarters and all of its manufacturing sites.[81]\n\n\nIn 2007, Oekom Research, an independent research institute specializing in corporate responsibility assessment, recognized Asus as a \"highly environmental friendly company\" in the \"Computers, Peripherals and Office Electronics Industry\".[82]\n\n\nIn October 2008, Asus received 11 Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) Gold Awards for its products,[83] including four of its N-Series notebooks, namely the N10, N20, N50, and N80. In the following month, it received EU Flower certification for the same N-Series notebooks at an award ceremony held in Prague.[82] In December 2008, Det Norske Veritas conferred the world's first EuP (Energy-using Product) certification for portable notebooks on these machines.[82]\n\n\n\n### Recycling campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2008, Asus launched its \"PC Recycling for a Brighter Future\"[84][85]\nprogram in collaboration with Intel and with Tsann Kuen Enterprise Co. The program collected more than 1,200 desktop computers, notebooks and CRT/LCD monitors, refurbished them and donated them to 122 elementary and junior high schools, five aboriginal communities and the Tzu Chi Stem Cell Center.\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2008, *PC Pro* discovered through a reader that Asus had accidentally shipped laptops that contained cracked and unlicensed software.[86] Both physical machines and recovery CDs contained confidential documents from Microsoft and other organizations, internal Asus documents, and sensitive personal information including CVs. At the time, an Asus spokesperson promised an investigation at \"quite a high level\", but declined to comment on how the files got on the machines and recovery media.[87] It was demonstrated that an unattended installation of Windows Vista could accidentally copy material from a flash drive with a parameter in the \"unattend.xml\" file on the personal flash drive being used to script the installation.[88][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nIn February 2014, a security vulnerability in the AiCloud functions on a number of Asus routers was compromised to distribute a text file warning of a vulnerability, disclosed in June 2013, allowing the ability to \"traverse to any external storage plugged in through the USB ports on the back of the router\" via the open internet. Before making the vulnerability public, the researcher was told by Asus that the behavior was \"not an issue\", but the vulnerability was reportedly patched shortly before the breach.[89] The IP addresses of 12,937 routers, and 3,131 AiCloud accounts were also leaked by the hackers.[90] The U.S. Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint about the breach for the company's \"failure to employ reasonable security practices has subjected consumers to substantial injury\", alleging that Asus had also failed to perform basic penetration tests, allowed users to maintain a default admin password for the AiDisk feature and failed to notify users of security updates in a timely fashion. As a result, it was also deemed that Asus had misled consumers over the security and protection that its routers provided. In February 2016, Asus settled the complaint, agreeing to implement a \"comprehensive security program\", including independent audits every two years for the next 20 years.[91][90]\n\n\n\nIn March 2019, Kaspersky Lab researchers disclosed a supply chain attack that affected the Asus Live Update software bundled on its laptops, dubbed **ShadowHammer**. Kaspersky stated that between June and November 2018, Asus servers had been compromised to distribute a modified version of Live Update, signed with an Asus signature, that contained a backdoor. It deployed a further payload if the device's network adapter matched an entry on an internal target list of around 600 MAC addresses. In response to ShadowHammer, Asus released a patched version of Live Update with improved security measures. Kaspersky and Symantec estimated that between 500,000 and 1 million devices were infected with the backdoor, although Asus attempted to downplay the severity of the breach by noting the extremely targeted nature of the attack. The breach did not affect the similar, identically named software associated with its motherboards.[92][93][94]\n\n\n\nIn April 2019, ESET disclosed that a group known as BlackTech had performed targeted attacks with malware known as Plead, distributed via the updater for the Asus WebStorage service. ESET stated that the group was likely using a man-in-the-middle attack via a vulnerability in routers, in combination with the updater using an unencrypted HTTP connection.[95]\n\n\nIn January 2022, Asus recalled some of its Z690 Maximus Hero motherboards due to a manufacturing flaw, where a RAM capacitor was installed backward—causing them to burn out associated MOSFETs and prevent the motherboard from detecting memory.[96]\n\n\nFollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, ASUS initially refused to join a widespread withdrawal of businesses from the Russian market. In mid-March, the company did announce it was halting its operations in Russia, following a social media boycott and government pressure.[97][98]\n\n\nIn April 2023, a post on the PCMasterRace subreddit began gaining popularity regarding the user's AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, which had visible burning, along with the socket of the Asus motherboard.[99] This sparked the attention of both people interested in PCs, who initially thought it was an issue with the 3D V-Cache Technology (as there had been previous user reports similar to this incident),[99] as well as enthusiast YouTube channels such as Gamers Nexus, who ran tests to successfully recreate the burning of their CPU.[100] They realised that the cause of the burning was due to a voltage error in the BIOS. In May, Asus responded to the incidents by releasing a Beta BIOS, which was supposed to fix the error. However, not only did the new BIOS not fix the issue; by installing it, the user voided their warranty as it was a Beta BIOS, which Asus clearly stated in the BIOS's description.[100][101][102] Later that month, Asus responded to the public backlash by reversing course, releasing a statement informing users that they will continue to honor warranty on motherboards that have been updated to beta BIOS versions, as well as extend motherboard warranty coverage to uses of AMD EXPO, Intel XMP, and DOCP memory overclocking technologies.[103][104]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Taiwan portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* ASRock\n* Biostar\n* DFI\n* Elitegroup Computer Systems\n* EVGA Corporation\n* Fastra II\n* Gigabyte Technology\n* Micro-Star International\n* List of companies of Taiwan\n* List of wireless router firmware projects\n* Tomato (firmware)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"ASUSTek Computer Inc.
