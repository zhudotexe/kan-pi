They have been a member of FIFA since 1923 and a member of CONMEBOL since 1916.\n\n\nBrazil is the most successful national team in the FIFA World Cup, being crowned winner five times: 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002. The *Sele\u00e7\u00e3o* also has the best overall performance in the World Cup competition, both in proportional and absolute terms, with a record of 76 victories in 114 matches played, 129 goal difference, 247 points, and 19 losses.[11][12] It is the only national team to have played in all World Cup editions without any absence nor need for playoffs,[13] and the only team to have won the World Cup in four different continents: once in Europe (1958 Sweden), once in South America (1962 Chile), twice in North America (1970 Mexico and 1994 United States), and once in Asia (2002 South Korea/Japan). Brazil was also the most successful team in the now-defunct FIFA Confederations Cup, winning it four times, in 1997, 2005, 2009, and 2013. With the capture of the gold medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics,[14] Brazil has become one of only two countries, the other being France, to have won all men's FIFA 11-player competitions at all age level.[15][16][17][18][14]\n\n\nIn ranking standings, Brazil have the highest average football Elo rating, and the fourth all-time peak football Elo rating, established in 1962.[19] In FIFA's ranking system Brazil holds the record for most Team of the Year first ranking wins with 13.[20] Many commentators, experts, and former players have considered the Brazil team of 1970 to be the greatest team of all time.[21][22][23][24][25] Other Brazilian teams are also highly estimated and regularly appear listed among the best teams of all time, such as the Brazil teams of 1958\u201362 and the squads of the 1994\u201302 period, with honorary mentions for the gifted 1982 side.[26][27][28][29] In 1996, the Brazil national team achieved 35 consecutive matches undefeated, a feat which they held as a world record for 25 years.[30]\n\n\nBrazil has developed many rivalries through the years, with the most notable ones being with Argentina\u2014known as the \"*Supercl\u00e1ssico das Am\u00e9ricas\"* in Portuguese, Italy\u2014known as the *\"Cl\u00e1ssico Mundial\"* in Portuguese or the *World Derby* in English,[31][32] Uruguay due to the traumatic Maracanazo,[33] and the Netherlands due to several important meetings between the two teams at several World Cups.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Brazil national football team\n\n### Early history (1914\u20131922)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first Brazil national team, 1914\n![](image)Brazil's first match at home against Exeter City in 1914\nIt is generally believed that the inaugural game of the Brazil national football[34] team was a 1914 match between a Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo select team and the English club Exeter City, held in Fluminense's stadium.[35][36] Brazil won 2\u20130 with goals by Oswaldo Gomes and Osman,[35][36][37] though it is claimed that the match was a 3\u20133 draw.[38][39]\n\n\nIn contrast to its future success, the national team's early appearances were not brilliant. Other early matches played during that time include several friendly games against Argentina (being defeated 3\u20130), Chile (first in 1916) and Uruguay (first on 12 July 1916).[40] However, led by the goalscoring abilities of Arthur Friedenreich, they were victorious at home in the South American Championships in 1919, repeating their victory, also at home, in 1922.\n\n\n\n### First World Cup and title drought (1930\u20131949)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1930, Brazil played in the first World Cup, held in Uruguay. The squad defeated Bolivia but lost to Yugoslavia, being eliminated from the competition at group stage.[41] They lost in the first round to Spain in 1934 in Italy, but reached the semi-finals in France in 1938, being defeated 2\u20131 by eventual winners Italy. Brazil were the only South American team to participate in this competition.\n\n\nThe 1949 South American Championship held in Brazil ended a 27-year streak without official titles.[42] The last one was in the 1922 South American Championship, also played on Brazilian soil.[42]\n\n\n\n### The 1950 *Maracanazo*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brazil national team at the 1950 World Cup. National Archives of Brazil.\nAfter that, Brazil first achieved international prominence when it hosted the 1950 FIFA World Cup. The team went into the last game of the final round, against Uruguay at Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3 in Rio, needing only a draw to win the World Cup. Uruguay, however, won the match and the Cup in a game known as \"the Maracanazo\". The match led to a period of national mourning.[43]\n\n\nFor the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, Brazil was then almost completely renovated, with the team colours changed (to a new design by Aldyr Schlee) from all white to the yellow, blue and green of the national flag, to forget the Maracanazo, but still had a group of star players. Brazil reached the quarter-final, where they were beaten 4\u20132 by tournament favourites Hungary in one of the ugliest matches in football history, known as the \"Battle of Berne\".[44]\n\n\n\n### Pel\u00e9 and the First Golden Era (1958\u20131970)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Brazil national team at the 1959 Copa Am\u00e9rica\nFor the 1958 World Cup, Brazil were drawn in a group with England, the USSR and Austria. They beat Austria 3\u20130 in their first match, then drew 0\u20130 with England. Before the match, coach Vicente Feola made three substitutions that were crucial for Brazil to defeat the Soviets: Zito, Garrincha and Pel\u00e9. From the kick-off, they kept up the pressure relentlessly, and after three minutes, which were later described as \"the greatest three minutes in the history of football\",[45] Vav\u00e1 gave Brazil the lead. They won the match by 2\u20130. Pel\u00e9 scored the only goal of their quarter-final match against Wales, and they beat France 5\u20132 in the semi-final. Brazil then beat Sweden 5\u20132 in the final, winning their first World Cup and becoming the first nation to win a World Cup title outside of its own continent. Pel\u00e9 described it tearfully as a nation coming of age.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Defending champions Brazil at the 1962 FIFA World Cup\nIn the 1962 World Cup, Brazil earned its second title with Garrincha as the star player, a mantle and responsibility laid upon him after the regular talisman, Pel\u00e9, was injured during the second group match against Czechoslovakia and unable to play for the rest of the tournament.[47][48]\n\n\nIn the 1966 World Cup, Brazil had their worst performance in a World Cup. The 1966 tournament was remembered for its excessively physical play, and Pel\u00e9 was one of the players most affected. Against Portugal, several violent tackles by the Portuguese defenders caused forward player Pel\u00e9 to leave the match and the tournament. Brazil lost this match and was eliminated in the first round of the World Cup for the first time since 1934. They have not failed to reach the knockout stages of the competition since. Brazil became the second nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown following Italy in 1950. After the 1998, 2002, 2010, 2014 and 2018 World Cups, France, Italy, Spain and Germany were also added to this list. After the tournament, Pel\u00e9 declared that he did not wish to play in the World Cup again. Nonetheless, he returned in 1970.[49]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1970 FIFA World Cup-winning Brazil team, considered by many distinguished commentators as the greatest football team ever\nBrazil won its third World Cup in Mexico in 1970. It fielded what has been widely considered the best World Cup football squad ever,[21][22][23][26] led by Pel\u00e9 in his last World Cup finals, captain Carlos Alberto Torres, Jairzinho, Tost\u00e3o, G\u00e9rson and Rivellino. Even though Garrincha had retired, this team was still a force to be reckoned with. They won all six of their games\u2014against Czechoslovakia, England and Romania during group play, and against Peru, Uruguay and Italy in the knockout rounds. Jairzinho was the second top scorer with seven goals, and is the only player to score in every match in a World Cup; Pel\u00e9 finished with four goals. Brazil lifted the Jules Rimet trophy for the third time (the first nation to do so), which meant that they were allowed to keep it. A replacement was then commissioned, though it would be 24 years before Brazil won it again.[50]\n\n\n\n### The dry spell (1974\u20131990)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the international retirement of Pel\u00e9 and other stars from the 1970 squad, Brazil was not able to overcome the Netherlands at the 1974 World Cup in West Germany, and finished in fourth place after losing the third place game to Poland.[51]\n\n\nIn the second group stage of the 1978 World Cup, Brazil competed with tournament hosts Argentina for top spot and a place in the finals. In their last group match, Brazil defeated Poland 3\u20131 to go to the top of the group with a goal difference of +5. Argentina had a goal difference of +2, but in its last group match, it defeated Peru 6\u20130, and thus qualified for the final in a match accused of ultimately-unproven match fixing. Brazil subsequently beat Italy in the third place play-off, and were the only team to remain unbeaten in the tournament.\n\n\nAt the 1982 World Cup, held in Spain, Brazil were the tournament favorites, and easily moved through the early part of the draw, but a 3\u20132 defeat in Barcelona to Italy, in a classic World Cup match, eliminated them from the tournament in the match that they refer to as \"Sarri\u00e1's Tragedy\", referencing the stadium's name.[52][53] The 1982 team, with a midfield of S\u00f3crates, Zico, Falc\u00e3o and \u00c9der, is remembered as perhaps the greatest team never to win a World Cup.[27]\n\n\nSeveral players, including S\u00f3crates and Zico, from 1982 returned to play at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. Brazil, still a very good team and more disciplined defensively than four years earlier, met the Michel Platini-led France in the quarter-finals in a classic of Total Football. The game played to a 1\u20131 draw in regulation time, and after a goalless extra time, it all came down to a penalty shoot-out, where Brazil was defeated 4\u20133.\n\n\nAfter a 40-year hiatus, Brazil was victorious in the 1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica, this being their fourth victory in four tournaments hosted in Brazil. This achievement ended Brazil's 19-year streak without a championship. The last one was in the 1970 World Cup.\n\n\nAt the 1990 World Cup in Italy, Brazil was coached by Sebasti\u00e3o Lazaroni, who had been the coach in the 1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica. With a defensive scheme, whose main symbol was midfielder Dunga, forward Careca and three centre-backs, the team lacked creativity but made it to the second round. Brazil was eliminated by Diego Maradona-led Argentina in the round of 16 in Turin, losing to their South American archrivals 1\u20130.[54]\n\n\n\n### The Second Golden Era (1994\u20132002)[edit]\n\n\nBrazil went 24 years without winning a World Cup or even participating in a final. Their struggles ended at the 1994 tournament in the United States, where a solid side headed by Rom\u00e1rio and Bebeto in attack, captain Dunga in midfield, goalkeeper Cl\u00e1udio Taffarel and defender Jorginho, won the World Cup for a then-record fourth time. Highlights of their campaign included a 1\u20130 victory over the United States in the round of 16 at Stanford University, a 3\u20132 win over the Netherlands in the quarter-finals in Dallas, and a 1\u20130 victory over Sweden in the semi-finals at Pasadena's Rose Bowl. This set up Brazil\u2013Italy in the final in Pasadena. A game played in searing heat which ended as a goalless draw, with Italy's defence led by Franco Baresi keeping out Rom\u00e1rio, penalty kicks loomed, and Brazil became champions with Roberto Baggio missing Italy's last penalty.[55] Despite the triumph, the 1994 World Cup winning team is not held in the same high esteem in Brazil as their other World Cup winning teams. *FourFourTwo* magazine labelled the 1994 team \"unloved\" in Brazil due to their pragmatic, defensive style over the more typical Brazilian style of attacking flair.[50]\n\n\nEntering the 1998 World Cup as defending champions, Brazil finished runner-up. Having topped their group and won the next two rounds, Brazil beat the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-final following a 1\u20131 draw. Player of the tournament Ronaldo scored four goals and made three assists en route to the final. The build up to the final itself was overshadowed by Ronaldo suffering a convulsive fit only hours before kick off.[56] The starting line up without Ronaldo was released to a shocked world media, but after pleading that he felt fine and requested to play, Ronaldo was reinstated by the coach, before giving a below par performance as France, led by Zidane won 3\u20130.[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)2002 World Cup winning Brazil national football team airplane in Brazilian team livery\nFuelled by the \"Three R's\" (Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho), Brazil won its fifth championship at the 2002 World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan. Brazil beat all three opponents in group play in South Korea and topped the group. In Brazil's opening game against Turkey, in Ulsan, Rivaldo fell to the ground clutching his face after Turkey's Hakan \u00dcnsal had kicked the ball at his legs. Rivaldo escaped suspension but was fined \u00a35,180 for play-acting, and became the first player ever to be punished in FIFA's crackdown on diving. In their knockout round matches in Japan, Brazil defeated Belgium 2\u20130 in Kobe in the round of 16. Brazil defeated England 2\u20131 in the quarter-finals in Shizuoka, with the winning goal coming from an unexpected free-kick by Ronaldinho from 40 yards out.[58] The semi-final was against Turkey in Saitama; Brazil won 1\u20130.

The team had five wins in five matches.\nOn 6 June 2013, Brazil was ranked 22nd in the FIFA ranking, their lowest-ever rank.[74] Brazil entered the 2013 Confederations Cup with the objective of defending their title.

Brazil prevailed 3\u20132 on penalties, with Neymar, David Luiz and Marcelo converting their kicks, and goalkeeper J\u00falio C\u00e9sar saving three times.[82]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brazil line up against Colombia at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Late in the match, Neymar was stretchered off after Juan Camilo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga's knee had made contact with the forward's back. Neymar was taken to hospital and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra, ruling him out for the remainder of the tournament.[83] Prior to this, Neymar had scored four goals, provided one assist, and been named man of the match twice. Brazil faced further problems ahead of their semi-final against Germany, as Thiago Silva was to serve a one-match suspension for receiving his second yellow card of the tournament in the quarter-final.[84]\n\n\nThe *Sele\u00e7\u00e3o* went on to lose 1\u20137 to the Germans \u2013 their biggest ever defeat at the World Cup and first home loss in a competitive match since 1975.[85] Towards the end of the match, the home crowd began to \"*ol\u00e9*\" each pass from the German team, and booed their own players off the pitch after the final whistle.[86] The match has been nicknamed the *Mineirazo*, making reference to the nation's previous World Cup defeat on home soil, the Maracanazo against Uruguay in 1950, and the Est\u00e1dio do Mineir\u00e3o where the match took place.[87] Brazil subsequently lost 0\u20133 to the Netherlands in the third-place play-off match.[88][89] The team ended the tournament with the worst defensive record of the 32 competing nations, having conceded 14 goals.[90] The only other countries to concede 12 or more goals in the current World Cup format are North Korea and Saudi Arabia.[91] Following these results, Scolari announced his resignation.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Return of Dunga (2014\u20132016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brazil's 1994 World Cup winning captain Dunga was coach from 2006 to 2010 and 2014 to 2016.\nOn 22 July 2014, Dunga was announced as the new manager of Brazil, returning to the position for the first time since the team's exit at the 2010 World Cup.[93]\n\n\nDunga's first match in his second reign as Brazil's manager was a friendly match against 2014 World Cup quarter-finalists Colombia at Sun Life Stadium in Miami on 5 September 2014, with Brazil winning the match 1\u20130 through an 83rd-minute Neymar free-kick goal.[94] Dunga followed this up with wins against Ecuador (1\u20130),[95] in the 2014 Supercl\u00e1sico de las Am\u00e9ricas against Argentina (2\u20130),[96] against Japan (4\u20130),[97] against Turkey (0\u20134),[98] and against Austria (1\u20132).[99] Dunga continued Brazil's winning streak in 2015 by defeating France 3\u20131 in another friendly.

This was followed by an emphatic 7\u20131 victory over Haiti, with Philippe Coutinho scoring a hat-trick.[105] Needing only a draw to progress to the knockout stage of the tournament, Brazil suffered a controversial 1\u20130 loss to Peru, with Ra\u00fal Ruid\u00edaz scoring in the 75th minute by guiding the ball into the net with his arm.[106] This loss, Brazil's first loss to Peru since 1985,[107] saw Brazil eliminated from the tournament in the group stage for the first time since 1987.[108][109][110]\n\n\n\n#### Tite era (2016\u20132022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brazil team prior to their group game against Costa Rica at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia\n![](image)Brazil supporters at the 2018 World Cup\nOn 14 June 2016, Tite replaced Dunga as manager of Brazil.[111] Tite, who had managed Corinthians, the 2015 Brazilian champions and 2012 Club World Cup champions, was confirmed as his replacement six days later.[112] Tite's debut was marked with a 3\u20130 away victory against Ecuador on 2 September,[113] followed by a 2\u20131 win over Colombia, a 5\u20130 win against Bolivia and a 0\u20132 victory away against Venezuela, bringing Brazil to the top of the World Cup Qualifiers leaderboard for the first time since 2011.[114] Brazil then defeated Paraguay 3\u20130 to become the first team, other than the hosts Russia, to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.[115]\n\n\nBrazil started their 2018 World Cup campaign with a draw against Switzerland \u2013 Brazil's goal coming from a 25-yard bending strike from Philippe Coutinho \u2013 their first non-win in an opener since 1978.[116] In the following match against Costa Rica on 22 June, goals from Coutinho and Neymar in stoppage time saw Brazil win 2\u20130.[117] They won their final group game 2\u20130 over Serbia with goals from Paulinho and Thiago Silva, meaning qualification for the last 16 as group winners.[118] On 2 July, goals from Neymar and Roberto Firmino saw Brazil 2\u20130 win over Mexico to advance to the quarter-finals.[119] On 6 July, Brazil were eliminated from the 2018 World Cup by Belgium in the quarter-finals, losing 2\u20131, with Fernandinho scoring an own goal for Belgium while Renato Augusto scored the only goal for Brazil.[120][121][122]\n\n\nIn spite of World Cup failure, the CBF continued to trust Tite and allowed him to continue his job as coach of Brazil for the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica held at home. However, Brazilian perpetration for the tournament at home was hampered by the injury of Neymar in a friendly match where Brazil thrashed 2019 AFC Asian Cup champions Qatar 2\u20130.[123] Despite this loss, Tite managed Brazil to their first Copa Am\u00e9rica title since 2007. Brazil overcame Bolivia after a goalless first half[124] and Peru in a celebratory 5\u20130 demolition.[125] Between these matches, Brazil drew Venezuela in a 0\u20130 draw with three goals ruled out by VAR.[126] Brazil met Paraguay in the quarter-finals where they won a 4\u20133 penalty shootout after a goalless draw.[127] In the semi-finals Brazil beat neighboring Argentina 2\u20130 to set up a rematch with Peru.[128] In the final, Brazil managed to defeat the Peruvians once again 3\u20131 to conquer their ninth Copa Am\u00e9rica title.[129]\n\n\nOn 8 June 2021, Brazil beat Paraguay 2\u20130 in a World Cup qualifier in Asunci\u00f3n \u2013 the first time they had won in the country since 1985.[130] In the 2022 World Cup, Brazil finished first in their group, having beaten Serbia 2\u20130, Switzerland 1\u20130, and losing 1\u20130 to Cameroon.[131] The team then faced South Korea in the round of 16, winning with a 3-goal margin,[132] and progressed to the quarterfinals where they eventually lost 4\u20132 on penalties to Croatia.[133] Following their exit from the World Cup, Tite resigned as head coach.[134]\n\n\n\n## Team image[edit]\n\n\n### Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Brazil national football team kits.\n\nBrazil's first team colors were white with blue collars, but following the defeat at Maracan\u00e3 in the 1950 World Cup, the colors were criticised for lacking patriotism. With permission from the Brazilian Sports Confederation, the newspaper *Correio da Manh\u00e3* held a competition to design a new kit incorporating the four colors of the Brazilian flag.[135] The winning design was a yellow jersey with green trim and blue shorts with the white trim drawn by Aldyr Garcia Schlee, a nineteen-year-old from Pelotas.[135] The new colors were first used in March 1954 in a match against Chile, and have been used ever since. Topper were the manufacturers of Brazil's kit up to and including the match against Wales on 11 September 1991; Umbro took over before the next match, versus Yugoslavia in October 1991.[136] Nike began making Brazil kits in late 1996, in time for the 1997 Copa Am\u00e9rica and the 1998 World Cup.[137]\n\n\nThe use of blue and white as the second kit colors owes its origins to the defunct latter day Portuguese monarchy and dates from the 1930s, but it became the permanent second choice accidentally in the 1958 World Cup Final. Brazil's opponents were Sweden, who also wear yellow, and a draw gave the home team, Sweden, the right to play in yellow. Brazil, who travelled with no second kit, hurriedly purchased a set of blue shirts and sewed on them the badges taken from their yellow shirts.[138]\n\n\n\n#### Kit sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Kit supplier | Period | Contractannouncement | Contractduration | Value | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *None* | 1908\u20131954\n |  |  |  |  |\n| ![](image) Athleta | 1954\u20131977\n |  | 1954\u20131977\n | None\n | [139] |\n| ![](image) Adidas | 1977\u20131981\n |  | 1977\u20131981\n |  |  |\n| ![](image) Topper | 1981\u20131991\n |  | 1981\u20131991\n |  |  |\n| ![](image) Umbro | 1991\u20131996\n |  | 1991\u20131996\n |  |  |\n| ![](image) Nike | 1997\u2013present\n | December 1996\n | 1997\u20132007\n | Total $200 million~$250 million\n | [140] |\n| Unknown\n | 2008\u20132026\n | \u20ac69.5\u00a0million per year\n | [141] |\n\n\n### Nicknames[edit]\n\n\nThe Brazil national team is known by different names in various parts of the world. Nicknames for the squad in Brazil include: *Canarinho*, meaning 'Little Canary', a reference to a species of bird commonly found in Brazil that has a vivid yellow color, this phrase was popularized by the late cartoonist Fernando \"Mangabeira\" Pieruccetti during the 1950 World Cup despite the team not wearing the color yet back then;[142] *Amarelinha* (Little Yellow One), *Sele\u00e7\u00e3o* (The National Squad), *Verde-amarela* (The Green and Yellow), *Pentacampe\u00e3o* (Five-time Champions),[143] and *Esquadr\u00e3o de Ouro* (The Golden Squad).
