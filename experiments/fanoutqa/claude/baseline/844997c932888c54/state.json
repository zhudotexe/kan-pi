He established David Chipperfield Architects in 1985,[1] which grew into a global architectural practice with offices in London, Berlin, Milan, and Shanghai.\n\n\nIn 2023, he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, considered to be the most prestigious award in architecture.[2][3] His major works include the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire (1989\u20131998); the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany; the Des Moines Public Library, Iowa (2002\u20132006); the Neues Museum, Berlin (1997\u20132009); The Hepworth Wakefield gallery in Wakefield, West Yorkshire (2003\u20132011), the Saint Louis Art Museum, Missouri (2005\u20132013); and the Museo Jumex in Mexico City (2009\u20132013).\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nChipperfield was born in London in 1953, and graduated in 1976 from Kingston School of Art in London. He studied architecture at the Architectural Association (AA) in London, receiving his diploma in architecture in 1977. He worked in the offices of several notable architects, including Douglas Stephen, Norman Foster and Richard Rogers, before founding his firm, David Chipperfield Architects, in 1985.[4][5] As a young architect Chipperfield championed the historically attuned, place-specific work of continental architects such as Moneo, Snozzi and Siza through the 9H Gallery situated in the front room of his London office.[6]\n\n\nHe first established his reputation designing store interiors in London, Paris, Tokyo and New York. Among Chipperfield's early projects in England was a shop for Issey Miyake on London's Sloane Street.[7] His shops in Japan led to commissions to design for a private museum in Chiba prefecture (1987), design for a store for the automotive company Toyota in Kyoto (1989), and the headquarters of the Matsumoto Company in Okayama (1990). His firm opened an office in Tokyo in 1989.[8] His first commission to design an actual building was for a house for the fashion photographer Nick Knight in London in 1990.[9]\n\n\nHis first completed projects in London were the gallery of botany and the entrance hall for the Natural History Museum (1993), and restaurant Wagamama, both in London. His first major project in Britain was the River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames (1989) (see below). He also began to build in Germany, designing an office building in D\u00fcsseldorf (1994\u20131997). Other projects in the 1990s included the Circus Restaurant in London (1997) and the Joseph Menswear Shop (1997). The latter shop featured a curtain of glass six meters high around the two lower floors, and an austere modernist interior with dark grey sandstone floors and white walls.[8]\n\n\nIn 1997, he began one of his most important projects, the reconstruction and restoration of the Neues Museum in Berlin, which had been largely destroyed during World War II. After 2000, he won commissions for several other major museum projects in Germany, designed several major museum projects in Germany, including the Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach (2002\u20132006), and the Galerie Am Kupfergraben 10 in Berlin (2003\u20132007). In the same period, he designed and built, at rapid speed, a new headquarters for the America's Cup in Valencia, Spain (2005\u20132006), and an enormous judicial complex in Barcelona, Spain, which consolidated the offices previously contained in seventeen different buildings into nine new immense concrete blocks. He also constructed his first project in the United States, an extension of the Museum of ethnology and natural history in Anchorage, Alaska (2003\u20132009).[8]\n\n\nUntil 2011, most of his major projects were on the continent of Europe, but in 2011 he opened two notable museum projects in Britain, the Turner Contemporary (2006\u201311) in Margate, and The Hepworth Wakefield in Wakefield. In 2013, he opened the Jumex Museum in Mexico City, and the extension of the Saint Louis Art Museum in the United States. His most remote project was the Museum of Naga, on a site in the desert 170 kilometers northeast of Khartoum in Sudan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. He designed a structure to preserve the remains of two ancient temples and an artesian well, dating to 300 B.C.-300 A.D. The building, built of the local stone, blends into reddish mountains around it.[10]\n\n\nIn 2015, Chipperfield won a competition to redesign the modern and contemporary art wing of the Metropolitan Museum in New York City. He also began his first ground-up building in New York City, the Bryant, a thirty-three storey hotel and condominium project next to Bryant Park in Manhattan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2017, he and his associates were engaged in a multitude of major projects around the world; including new flagship stores for Bally and Valentino, the reconstruction of the U.S. Embassy in London; One Pancras Square, an office and commercial complex behind King's Cross Station in London, a project for the Shanghai Expo tower in China, the new Nobel Center headquarters for the Nobel Prize in Stockholm,[11] a headquarters store for the online firm SSENSE in Montreal, the extension building for Kunsthaus Zurich,[12][13] the Haus der Kunst cultural center in Munich, the completion of the headquarters of Amorepacific in Seoul, Korea, and the Inagara Reien Project, a temple complex in Japan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Major projects (1997\u20132010)[edit]\n\n\n### River and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-Thames, UK (1989\u20131997)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)River and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-Thames, UK, (1989\u20131997)\nThe River and Rowing Museum in Henley-on-Thames is devoted particularly to the sports of rowing; the town is home to the Annual Royal Regatta Olympic boating events in 1908 and 1948. The building is a blend of modernist and traditional forms and materials. It was inspired by the form of traditional boat sheds, as well as the traditional barns of Oxfordshire. The building occupies a space of 2,300 square metres, and is lifted above the ground on concrete pillars to avoid flooding. The exterior and parts of the interior are covered in planks of non-treated oak, matching the local rural architecture. The roofs and sunscreens are of stainless steel. The entrance has glass walls, and the galleries on the ground floor receive natural light through the roof.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### Des Moines Public Library, Des Moines, Iowa, US (2002\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Des Moines Public Library, Des Moines, Iowa, US (2002\u20132006)\nThe Des Moines Public Library in Des Moines, Iowa, United States, covers an area of 110,000 square feet, and cost 32.3 million dollars to construct. The two-storey building has no front or back; instead it fans out into three wings. A glass tunnel allows passers-by to stroll through the library. Its most distinct feature is an exterior of glass panels with cooper mesh sandwiched between them; the mesh blocks eighty per cent of the sunlight, while allowing library patrons to gaze out at the park around the library. Chipperfield told Christopher Hall of *The New York Times*: \"The architecture is neutral and amorphous; almost no architecture at all, and the copper mesh is an attempt to veil the building as much as possible while allowing the outside in.\"[16][*full citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach, Germany (2002\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Museum of Modern Literature in Marbach, Germany (2002\u20132006)\nThe Museum of Modern Literature is located in the town of Marbach, Germany, the birthplace of the poet Schiller. It benefits from a panoramic view of the Neckar River. It is located next to the beaux-arts building of the national Schiller Museum, built in 1903, and a more modern building of the German Literary Archives, from the 1970s. Visitors enter through a pavilion on the top floor and descend to the reading rooms below. While the lighting on the interior is entirely artificial, to protect the manuscripts, each level has a terrace overlooking the countryside. The facades of concrete, glass and wood are designed to give the impression of both solidity and modernity. The building was awarded the Stirling Prize in 2007.[17]\n\n\n\n### America's Cup Building (Veles e Vents), Valencia, Spain (2005\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)America's Cup Building, Valencia, Spain, (2005\u20132006)\nChipperfield won a 2005 competition to construct a new headquarters for the America's Cup on the coast in Valencia, Spain. It was completed in just eleven months. The distinctive features of the 10,000 square metre building are three horizontal levels which overhang the terrace below by as much as fifteen metres, providing shade and an unobstructed view of the sea. The predominant colour inside and out is white, with panels of white metal on the ceilings, floors of white resin, and exterior trim of white-painted stainless steel. Exterior accents are provided by planks of wood.[18]\n\n\n\n### The Neues Museum, Berlin, Germany (1997\u20132009)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Neues Museum, Berlin, Germany (1997\u20132009)\nIn 1997, Chipperfield, along with Julian Harrap, won a competition for the reconstruction of the Neues Museum in Berlin, which had been severely damaged during World War II. His commission was to recreate the original volume of the museum, both by restoring original spaces and adding new spaces which would respect the historic structure of the building. Reinforced concrete was used for new galleries and the new central staircase, while recycled bricks were used in other spaces, particularly in the north wing and the south dome. In addition, some of the scars of the war on the building's walls were preserved, as an essential part of its history. As Chipperfield explained, the architects used these materials so that \"The new would reflect that which was lost, without imitating it.\" The building received the European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture in 2011.\n\n\nIn 2007, Chipperfield began a new project with the museum, to construct a new gallery, the James Simon Gallery, inspired by the colonnade of the old museum. The new section will house more than ten thousand objects from the archeological collections, including the famed bust of Queen Nefertiti. Scheduled for completion in 2017,[19][20][21] it was handed over to the museum in December 2018. The gallery opened to the public in 2019.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Major projects (2011\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n### The Hepworth Wakefield gallery (2003\u20132011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Hepworth Wakefield, Wakefield, UK (2003\u20132011)\nThe Hepworth Wakefield is a gallery devoted to the work of the sculptor Barbara Hepworth. It is composed of ten trapezoidal blocks; its upper-level galleries are lit by natural light from large windows in the pitched roofs.[23] Its windows have views of the river, historic waterfront and the city skyline. The building's fa\u00e7ade is clad with self-compacting pigmented concrete made on site, the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. The architects selected the material to emphasise the gallery's sculptural appearance. Rowan Moore of *The Guardian*, in a 2011 review of Chipperfield's body of work, criticised the Hepworth Gallery's design, which he felt resembled \"a bunker\".[24]\n\n\n\n### City of Justice complex, Barcelona, Spain (2002\u20132011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)City of Justice, Barcelona, Spain (2002\u20132011)\nThe City of Justice is a group of nine buildings with 241,500 metres of space, which consolidate courtrooms and offices which previously were scattered among seventeen different buildings. The courtrooms are on the ground floor, with offices above. Four of the buildings are connected together by a four-storey hallway. In addition to the judicial buildings, the complex, on the outskirts of Barcelona, includes a commercial centre and retail stores, and a block of low income residential housing. The facades of the buildings are all the same, made of concrete poured in place and lightly tinted in different shades. Chipperfield wrote that the purpose of the building was to \"break the image of justice as rigid and monolithic\",[25] but architectural critic Rowan Moore of *The Guardian* said it appeared \"uncomfortably prison-like.\"[24]\n\n\n\n### Saint Louis Art Museum expansion, Missouri, US (2005\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\nThe Saint Louis Art Museum project in Saint Louis, Missouri, United States (2005\u20132013) involved building a major new wing attached to a landmark of American architecture, the gallery built by beaux-arts architect Cass Gilbert in 1904. The new building by Chipperfield, with 9,000 square metres of space, harmonizes smoothly with the classic building; its ground level is the same as that of the main floor of the Gilbert Building. The walls are dark concrete were poured and polished in place, and the roof of concrete *caissons* is designed to modify the light entering the galleries.[26] To give the facade a distinctive look which also blended with the Gilbert building, Chipperfield speckled the dark grey polished concrete walls with fragments of the same kind of sandstone used in the Gilbert building. Edwin Heathcote of the *Financial Times* called it \"a gem of clarity and deceptive simplicity...It is a building designed to glow, inside and out, one that is more about the intangibility of light than about mass reinforced by shadow.\"[27][*full citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Turner Contemporary gallery, Margate, UK (2006\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Turner Contemporary in Margate, Kent, UK (2006\u20132011)\nThe Turner Contemporary gallery is located beside a beach in Margate, on the north coast of Kent in south-east England. It is devoted to the works of painter J. M. W. Turner, his contemporaries, and those he influenced. It is close to the historic boarding house where the artist often stayed. The museum is composed of six identical glass galleries, referred to as \"Cristalins\", which are interconnected. The sunlight from the south is softened by a system of shutters over the ceiling, and the buildings are raised on pylons to avoid flooding from the neighbouring sea. The fritted[*clarification needed*] fa\u00e7ades are designed to resist the dampness, corrosion and winds coming from the sea.[28]\n\n\n\n### Colecci\u00f3n Jumex, Mexico City, Mexico (2009\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colecci\u00f3n Jumex, Mexico City, Mexico (2009\u20132013)\nThe Colecci\u00f3n Jumex in Mexico City displays one of the largest private collections of contemporary art in Mexico, neighbouring a theatre and another museum in a modern neighbourhood of the city. Zoning restrictions limited the space available, so Chipperfield put the museum administration, shop, and library in existing adjoining buildings, and devoted the Museum almost entirely to exhibit space. The galleries on the upper levels receive natural light from the skylights on the roof facing toward the west. The building is supported on fourteen columns, and is built of concrete covered with plaques of travertine limestone from Xalapa, in the state of Veracruz. The floor-to-ceiling windows on the lower floors have frames of stainless steel.[29]\n\n\n\n## Style and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nChipperfield's buildings cannot be described as following one particular style, although his work is sometimes seen as a reaction against the more flamboyant projects of Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid or Santiago Calatrava. In 2005, he told Christopher Hall of *The New York Times*, \"I'm very interested in doing buildings that people are fond of, but with each project I also try to push the boundaries, to make something familiar but different. I'm not so interested in convincing the architectural community that I'm a genius.\"[30][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Andy Butler in *Designboom*, Chipperfield declared: \"The one thing you can't do in architecture, at least in my opinion, is to limit your way of thinking to a style, or a material, you have to be responsive to the circumstances of a project.\" He declared that \"architecture could not be globalized\" because it varied depending upon the culture of a city. \"However contemporary we feel that we are, we still want to find different characteristics in different places. When we are building in a city we have a responsibility in a way to join in and to understand why buildings are as they are in that city. I find it very weak for an architect to disregard the history and culture of a city and say 'I have an international style.' There's absolutely no justification for that. It's the equivalent of having no variation in a cuisine, you may as well just place all the different types of food in a blender and consume it as a protein-rich shake.\"[31][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nRowan Moore, *The Guardian*'s architecture critic, described his work as \"serious, solid, not flamboyant or radical, but comfortable with the history and culture of its setting\". He observed that \"Chipperfield stresses less glamorous questions, such as, \"how is a building going to look five or ten years later?\" and \"deals in dignity, in gravitas, in memory and in art.\" He quotes Chipperfield on his work on the Neues Museum, a project that lasted twelve years. \"How you do things is profoundly important. The quality of the Neues Museum construction is extraordinary even by German standards, and people can smell the quality. The concept would not have been so convincing without it.\" He also noted that Chipperfield \"is much sought after for projects that help define cities' modern view of themselves, often in relation to a rich or fraught history.\"[24]\n\n\nChipperfield described the style of his recent The Bryant residential tower in New York City (2013\u20132018) as \"classical elegance in terms of its symmetries and simple grids and order.\" Describing the Bryant Park, Tim McKeough of *The New York Times* wrote \"In contrast with other big-name architects who wow with audacious forms and breathtaking structural feats, Mr. Chipperfield is best-known for buildings with a pared-down aesthetic purity.\" He noted that Chipperfield's signature on the building was the facade, composed of precast terrazzo panels with a mosaic of marble and sandstone chips, polished to a matte finish, to give the building a distinctive reflective colour.[32][*full citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\nChipperfield has taught architecture in Europe and the United States, and has lectured extensively, including as Professor of Architecture at the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart from 1995 to 2001.[33] In addition, Chipperfield held the Mies van der Rohe Chair at the Escola T\u00e9cnica in Barcelona, Spain, and the Norman R. Foster Professorship of Architectural Design at the Yale School of Architecture. He is a visiting professor at the University of the Arts London (formerly London Institute). He has been on the Board of Trustees of The Architecture Foundation and is currently a trustee of the Sir John Soane's Museum in London.[34]\n\n\n\n## Selected works[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **does not include any references or sources**.

Parallel to his studies, he established the K\u00e9r\u00e9 Foundation (formerly Schulbausteine f\u00fcr Gando), and in 2005 he founded *K\u00e9r\u00e9 Architecture*. His architectural practice has been recognized internationally with awards including the Aga Khan Award for Architecture (2004) for his first building, the Gando Primary School in Burkina Faso, and the Global Holcim Award for Sustainable Construction 2012 Gold.\n\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9 has undertaken projects in various countries including Burkina Faso, Mali, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique, Togo, Sudan, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the US, and the UK.[4] In 2017 the Serpentine Galleries commissioned him to design the Serpentine Pavilion in London. He has held professorships at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, Yale School of Architecture and the Swiss Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio. In 2017 he accepted the professorship for \"Architectural Design and Participation\" at the Technical University of Munich.\n\n\nIn 2022, he won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, the first person from Africa and the first Black person to do so.[2][5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9 was born in the village of Gando, Burkina Faso. He was the first child in the village to be sent to school as his father, the village chief, wanted his eldest son to learn how to read and translate his letters. Since no school existed in Gando, K\u00e9r\u00e9 had to leave his family when he was 7 years old to live with his uncle in the city. After finishing his education, he became a carpenter and received a scholarship from the Carl Duisberg Society to do an apprenticeship in Germany as a supervisor in development aid. After completing the apprenticeship, he went on to study architecture at the Technical University of Berlin, graduating in 2004.[4]\n\n\nDuring his studies he felt it was his duty to contribute to his family and to the community which had supported him, and to give the next generation the opportunity to follow in his footsteps. In 1998, with the help of his friends, K\u00e9r\u00e9 set up the association Schulbausteine f\u00fcr Gando e.V. (now K\u00e9r\u00e9 Foundation), which loosely translates as \"Building Blocks for Gando\", to fund the construction of a primary school for his village. His objective was to combine the knowledge he had gained in Europe, with traditional building methods from Burkina Faso. He completed his studies and built the first school in Gando as his diploma project in 2004, while also opening his own architectural office K\u00e9r\u00e9 Architecture.[6][7][8][9][10][11]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9 is known for involving community in his projects and for his innovative use of vernacular materials and techniques.[12][11]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9 has worked as a lecturer at the Technical University of Berlin. In spring 2011, he lectured at Virginia Tech, Washington University, and the University of Texas. The following summer he lectured at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and in autumn 2012 he was a visiting professor at Harvard. He also taught at the Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio. K\u00e9r\u00e9 accepted a newly created professorship for Architectural design and Participation at the Technical University of Munich in 2017. He was awarded a visiting professorship at the Yale School of Architecture. In 2021 K\u00e9r\u00e9 took a position as guest professor at the Bauhaus University in Weimar, Germany.[13]\n\n\n\n### Architecture and design projects in Gando[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gando, Burkina Faso\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience**.

The village, located south east of Ouagadougou, has approximately 3000 inhabitants who live in mud huts without access to running water or electricity. According to the UN Human Development Index in 2011, Burkina Faso is the 7th-least developed country in the world. Most residents are subsistence farmers, remaining dependent on the harsh climate which has restricted rainfall between October and June, and high daytime temperatures of 45\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\n\n\n#### Gando Primary School[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Primary School in Gando\nK\u00e9r\u00e9's primary school, the first for Gando, was completed in 2001. Schools in Burkina Faso are routinely built out of concrete, an expensive and energy consumptive material to produce, ill-suited to the local climate, as the interior becomes intolerably hot. K\u00e9r\u00e9 wanted to use locally available resources and chose to build with earth in the form of mud bricks. K\u00e9r\u00e9's innovative design consisted of a wide, raised tin roof to protect the walls from rain, and allow air to circulate underneath for building cooling. The finished building was cooler and more pleasant inside than the conventional concrete school buildings. He won the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for the design in 2004.[16]\n\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9 drew preliminary building plans in the sand to communicate with villagers, many of whom were illiterate, and found they fully engaged with the project, with many generating their own suggestions for improvement. K\u00e9r\u00e9 said, \u201cOnly those who are involved in the development process can appreciate the results achieved, develop them further, and protect them\u201d.[17] The entire population of Gando took part in the construction of the school. Village members received on-site training in construction techniques. Neighboring villages, impressed by Gando's community organization and achievement, set out to build their own schools.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Gando Mango Tree Project[edit]\n\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9 initiated a project of planting mango trees to better meet the communities' needs and address several major problems in the region including malnutrition. K\u00e9r\u00e9 developed a strategy in which prior to planting the tree, a hole is filled with old bones and meat, and left for a few days. Over time, the bones and meat attract ants, which colonize the hole and eat the termites. This enables the trees to grow without needing any insecticide. For natural fertilizer, chickens are kept in the shade of the trees. K\u00e9r\u00e9 then had residents place hand-made clay pots next to the trees, with drippers targeted directly to the roots, which gave the trees a small but constant supply of water. The clay pots prevent evaporation loss and only need to be filled once a week.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Gando Secondary School[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secondary school in Gando\nConstruction of a secondary school designed by K\u00e9r\u00e9 began in May 2011. The new building complex was designed to accommodate approximately 1000 students. The layout is inspired by the traditional rural households in Burkina Faso: the classrooms are set out in a circular fashion forming a protected courtyard, shielding it from the dust and sand brought by the Harmattan winds. The structure is open on its west side, allowing a cool breeze to enter the area, an innovative air-cooling system using only natural ventilation. The school is surrounded by a bank of earth, on which trees are planted. The trees provide shade, and rainwater is gathered to provide them with water. Perforated pipes are laid underneath the earth banks, and gather moisture. Wind cools down as it blows through the pipes, and emerges in the classrooms through holes in the floor, providing a zero emissions under-floor cooling system. This design won the 2012 Global Holcim Award for Sustainable Construction Gold.[4]\n\n\nThe secondary school uses the same roof design as the primary school, with a wide corrugated iron roof raised above a clay ceiling. Air circulates between the ceiling and roof, heats up and rises, creating a suction current below. This causes the cool air from the under-floor pipes to rise, reducing room temperature by an estimated 6 \u2013 8\u00a0\u00b0C. With simple yet effective methods such as these, the school requires little electricity both for construction and maintenance. In order to combat deforestation issues Burkina Faso faces, the secondary school used wood from eucalyptus trees for construction, and mango trees were planted in their place. The mango trees need less water, produce fruit and provide more shade than eucalyptus trees.\n\n\nAs with K\u00e9r\u00e9's other projects, the secondary school uses local manpower for construction. Specialists trained by K\u00e9r\u00e9 supervise members of the local community, training them in the necessary building techniques. Rather than building the walls brick by brick, K\u00e9r\u00e9 has devised a quicker way of pouring mud and a small quantity of cement into a mould. \n\n\n\n#### Atelier Gando[edit]\n\n\nDeveloped in 2014, the Atelier is a building which functions as a community center and on-site base for building projects. A group of students from the Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio helped K\u00e9r\u00e9 plan and build the first steps of the construction.[19]\n\n\n\n### Other architecture and design projects[edit]\n\n\n#### Dano Secondary School[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secondary school in Dano, Burkina Faso\nThe secondary school project in Dano, Burkina Faso was inspired by K\u00e9r\u00e9's previous work in Gando. The excessive daytime heat was once again the major issue, but this time there were different local resources. Laterite stone, native to the region, was used as the main building material. The building was set at an east\u2013west orientation which reduces direct solar radiation onto the walls, and the sharply protruding roof creates a lot of shade. The roof design with its system of natural ventilation allows the air to circulate between the mud brick ceiling and the raised tin roof. The building consists of three classrooms, a computer room and an office. There is also an amphitheatre designed for use during break times. Finished in 2007, the building work was largely done by people trained in the Gando school projects, giving them the opportunity to use and develop their skills, while also reducing construction costs.\n\n\n\n#### Centre for Earth Architecture, Mopti[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Centre for Earth Architecture in Mopti, Mali\nThe Aga Khan Trust for Culture has spent over 10 years renovating mosques in Northern Mali. Finished in 2010, the Centre for Earth Architecture in Mopti is part of this series of projects, following the restoration of the mosque and the construction of a new sewerage system. The centre is intended to be much more than an exhibition space: the building is the product of the same ancient building techniques used in the Great Mosques in Mopti, Timbuktu and Djenn\u00e9. It demonstrates how a material that is a part of the area's heritage can be used in a modern context. The centre is made up of an exhibition hall, a community centre, public toilets and a restaurant, responding to the needs of the district management of Komoguel and visitors to the area, as well as the local community.\n\n\nFrom the top of the flood barrier, it can be seen that the building is aligned with the mosque. The building has a simple structure and its height corresponds to the neighbouring buildings without compromising the view of the mosque. When viewed from across the lake the centre manages to maintain a connection with the mosque but does not dominate the view.\n\n\nThe centre is divided into three different buildings which are connected by two roof surfaces. Clay for the building was brought from 5\u00a0km away, so that the red colour would contrast with the colour of the local buildings, which are all made using traditional mud construction. The rusty red colour of the laterite clay is due to its high iron oxide content. All the walls and barrel vaults in the centre are made out of BTC (compressed earth blocks) and are not plastered or painted. These are very well suited to the climatic conditions as they create a natural temperature buffer, making indoor temperatures much more comfortable. The overhanging roof blocks keep the walls cool and provide shaded outdoor spaces. The building is naturally ventilated through openings in the walls and vaults, therefore, mechanical air conditioning is not needed. Most vernacular buildings in Mopti have wooden ceilings filled with clay. K\u00e9r\u00e9 used a new system in this building that involves no wood \u2013 BTC vaults. He wants to promote the use of clay but to be sparing in his use of wood, as deforestation is a huge environmental issue in Mali.\n\n\n\n#### Opera Village[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Opera Village Africa\n\n![](image)Construction of the Remdoogo Opera Village in Laongo, Burkina Faso\nThe Opera House for Africa project was initiated by German film and theatre director Christoph Schlingensief. Schlingensief brought K\u00e9r\u00e9 on board to develop a housing prototype for people affected by flooding. The Remdoogo opera village was constructed on a 12-hectare site on a small rise in Laongo, one hour's drive from Ouagadougou and overlooking the West African landscape of the Sahel. A festival theatre, workshops, medical centre and guest houses were designed, as well as solar panels, a well, and a school for up to 500 children and teenagers with music and film classes. The stage and auditorium were designed and constructed in Germany and later transferred to the opera village. K\u00e9r\u00e9 used Burkinabe fabrics to cover seat rows and interior walls.\n\n\nSimple basic modules, which vary in quality and function depending on the equipment they house, comprise the entire village. Local people were employed to build the modules, and local materials such as clay, laterite, cement bricks, gum wood and loam rendering were used for construction. For reinforcing elements such as beams, columns, ring beams, and foundations, concrete was used. Due to the massive walls and large overhang of the roofs, air conditioning could be discounted in most buildings. The theatre hall was conceived as a place of encounter and exchange for people of different cultural and family backgrounds.[20]\n\n\n\n#### Zhoushan Harbour Development, China[edit]\n\n\nThe archipelago of Zhoushan in China is the site of an experimental urban rehabilitation project, led by the architect Wang Shu. Zhoushan is the Chinese capital of fishing, as it is situated at the entrance of the delta of the Yangtze River, and has a population of around one million. The aim of this project, started in 2009, was to transform the industrial harbour area, Putuo, into a touristic and cultural district. The architecture was designed to maintain a dialogue between modernity and the area's history and heritage. Sited on an island about 300 metres from the mainland, the chosen plot of land contains a dense assortment of buildings, docks and warehouses, built over several decades.\n\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9 designed an exhibition gallery, an information centre, artists\u2019 studios and a \u201ccultural creativity garden\u201d for the area. The scheme is designed around a platform that extends across the site all the way to the mountain, which borders the site to the west. This will serve as a space of transition between the man-made environment of the developed district and the natural environment beyond.\n\n\nThe best possible level of transparency is achieved by means of floor-to-ceiling glass elements. Sunlight gets into the rooms and there are unlimited views over the entire site. The southern and eastern facades are particularly exposed to the sun in summertime. Bamboo poles serve as exterior shades characterised by their natural irregular structure. Wood panels alternate with glass elements, thus the needs for both transparency and solar protection are met.\n\n\n\n#### Medical Centre, L\u00e9o[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, K\u00e9r\u00e9 Architecture embarked on a new project to build a medical centre in L\u00e9o. L\u00e9o is a town in Sicily Province in Burkina Faso situated near the border with Ghana, around 150 kilometres south of the capital city, Ouagadougou. The population of L\u00e9o is 50,000, but the medical centre will also serve the villages in the surrounding countryside. A high staff turnover rate and lack of smaller, local clinics mean that the district hospital is often overstretched and struggles to serve the whole community. The charity \u201cOperieren in Afrika\u201d decided to raise funds to build a medical clinic in L\u00e9o for small, simple operations. They will provide scholarships to trained doctors and nurses to staff the clinic, which will maintain a connection with Germany.\n\n\nAs the project had limited funding, K\u00e9r\u00e9 Architecture used pre-planned modules as the basis for the project. As in the Gando secondary school, the walls were constructed from cast earth and the roofs from the tin. The modules are arranged so that their roofs overlap, in order to provide more shade. In the final phase of the design, the space between the modules has become interior space. The \u201ccorridor\u201d of space between the rows of modules is a wide, open circulation space, with benches for people to relax on and trees for shade.\n\n\n\n#### International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum, Geneva[edit]\n\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9 was one of three architects chosen to design a permanent exhibition space at the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum, which opened in 2012 in Geneva, Switzerland. Each architect worked on a theme; Gringo Cardia (from Brazil) focused on \u201cdefending human dignity\u201d, Shigeru Ban (from Japan) focused on \u201crefusing fatality\u201d and K\u00e9r\u00e9 selected the theme \u201creconstructing the family link\u201d.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9 contributed the dark entrance passage, bounded by hemp concrete walls, that encourages the visitor to consider the frightened and suffocating emotions of family tragedy during conflict. Central to this part of the exhibition is a tower, also made of hemp concrete, which is an architectural reference to a traditional hut for a nuclear family. It lets in very little light and has a Corten steel floor with a rusty appearance. This space is a memorial to tragedies such as the Srebrenica massacre. A Tree of Messages, with metal branches, was built to serve as a reminder of the cold contrast between nature and war. The connection between nature and the family is an important sub-theme in K\u00e9r\u00e9's part of the exhibition. The Room of Witnesses is a direct contrast to the tower as here the focus is on transparency and hope rather than darkness and despair. This space emphasizes the important role eyewitness testimony plays in humanitarian action.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Other work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Serpentine Gallery Pavilion (2017) in London, the United Kingdom\nK\u00e9r\u00e9 has lectured and provided conceptual designs for projects in countries all over the world. His ideas were presented in the German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt and the Expo 2008. In Yemen he designed school building prototypes to fit the different climate regions of that country. K\u00e9r\u00e9 designed a school and community centre for the village of Pouni in Burkina Faso.\n\n\nFrom October 2010 until January 2011 models and photos of K\u00e9r\u00e9's projects were featured at an exhibition entitled \u2018Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement', at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In June 2010, K\u00e9r\u00e9 took part at the International Congress of Architecture and Society in Pamplona, entitled \u2018Architecture: more for less'.\n\n\nIn 2014 K\u00e9r\u00e9 participated to the exhibition *Sensing Spaces* at the Royal Academy of Arts. In 2016, his work was included in Alejandro Aravena's Venice Architecture Biennial, centered on low-tech construction techniques, traditional materials, and local knowledge.[21] From November 2016 to March 2017 K\u00e9r\u00e9 presented his first monographic exhibition \"Francis K\u00e9r\u00e9. Radically Simple\" in Munich at Architekturmuseum der TU Munich.[22] In 2017, the Serpentine Galleries commissioned K\u00e9r\u00e9 to design the Serpentine Pavilion in London.\n\n\nK\u00e9r\u00e9 designed Sarbal\u00e9 ke, a vibrant installation consisting of 12 towers, for the art program of the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.[23]\n\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\n* Aga Khan Award for Architecture (2004)[24][25]\n* Global Award for Sustainable Architecture (2009)[26][27][28]\n* Swiss Architectural Award (2010)[29]\n* Marcus prize for architecture (2011)[30]\n* Holcim Awards Gold 2011 Africa Middle East[31]\n* Global Holcim Awards 2012 Gold[32]\n* Schelling Architecture Award (2014)[33]\n* Kenneth Hudson Award for European Museum of the Year (2015)[34][35]\n* American Academy of Arts & Letters Arnold W.

Their projects include private and social housing, cultural and academic institutions and public spaces. They are particularly well known for their transformations of existing social housing structures and for their economical use of materials and construction techniques.\n\n\nThe two partners won the Pritzker Prize in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## Early careers of the partners\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal in 2017\nLacaton and Vassal met while they were architecture students. Their first joint project out of architecture school was in Niamey, Niger, where they built a straw hut out of locally sourced bush branches. The building proved to be highly impermanent; it was dismembered by the wind within 2 years of its construction.[1]\n\n\nMore detailed biographies of the two partners follow:\n\n\n**Anne Lacaton** was born on August 2, 1955, in Saint-Pardoux-la-Rivi\u00e8re in the Dordogne region of France. She graduated from the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'architecture et de paysage de Bordeaux in 1980 and obtained a master's degree in urban planning at the University of Bordeaux III in 1984.[2] From 1982 to 1988, she worked as a researcher and architect for the laboratory and the educational workshop of *Arc en r\u00eave* center for architecture in Bordeaux.\n\n\n\n**Jean-Philippe Vassal** was born on February 22, 1954, in Casablanca, Morocco. After graduating from the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'architecture et de paysage de Bordeaux in 1980, he relocated to Niger, West Africa, where he worked as an architect-urban planner from 1980 to 1985. Recalling his experiences in Niger, Vassal said:[1] \n\n\n> Niger is one of the poorest countries in the world, and the people are so incredible, so generous, doing nearly everything with nothing, finding resources all the time, but with optimism, full of poetry and inventiveness. It was really a second school of architecture.\n> \n> \n\nThe two partners founded Lacaton & Vassal in Bordeaux in 1987. \n\n\n## Approaches to architecture\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the Pritzker prize biography, Lacaton often visited Vassal while he was working in Niger and it was there that they first formulated the philosophy of architecture that was to guide them throughout their careers: \"...never demolish what could be redeemed and instead, make sustainable what already exists, thereby extending through addition, respecting the luxury of simplicity and proposing new possibilities.\"[1] Their aim in prioritising renovation over demolition is to give a \"second life\" to existing buildings, especially in the area of social housing.[3] Lacaton states: \"We never see the existing as a problem. We look with positive eyes because there is an opportunity of doing more with what we already have.\"[1]\n\n\nThe citation of the Pritzker Prize jury lauds the architects' \"restorative architecture\" and describes their practice of beginning \"every project with a process of discovery which includes intensely observing and finding value in what already exists... There is a humility in the approach that respects the aims of the original designers and the aspirations of the current occupants.\"[1]\n\n\nThe Pritzker Prize jury also notes that, via their humble approach to the practice of architecture, Lacaton and Vassal have reset the very idea of what it means to be an architect.[1] Their role is not to produce extravagant objects or to make flamboyant architectural statements \u2014 rather, the architect observes, improves and serves the needs of individuals and the community in a cost effective and sustainable way. \n\n\n\n## Major projects\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the Latapie house[4] (1993 in Floirac), Lacaton & Vassal applied greenhouse technologies to create a private winter garden that expanded the living space of a house at relatively low cost. The house is an example of their use of inexpensive building techniques from industry or agriculture. Indeed, greenhouses or winter gardens would become a recurring feature of their projects. Lacaton states: \"From very early on, we studied the greenhouses of botanic gardens with their impressive fragile plants, the beautiful light and transparency, and ability to simply transform the outdoor climate. It's an atmosphere and a feeling, and we were interested in bringing that delicacy to architecture.\"[1]\n\n\nLacaton & Vassal has also been successful in both defending and improving the image of social housing with the Cit\u00e9 Manifeste[5] in Mulhouse. The Cit\u00e9 Manifest was an ambitious project involving several well known architectural firms and marking the 150th anniversary of the construction of the Cit\u00e9 Muller, the first workers' housing estate in France. Lacaton & Vassal's objective for this project was to produce quality housing (they delivered 14 low income apartments) which, at equal cost, would be much larger than the apartments typically offered in social housing. An analysis conducted well after the 2005 delivery of the project shows that 10 of the 14 apartments had surface areas that were 50 per cent larger than was typical for low income houses with the same number of rooms.[6] They also provided improved floor plans and amenities (large open-plan volumes, winter gardens, customizable facilities). This project was awarded the national label \u2018Remarkable Contemporary Architecture\u2019 in July 2015.[7]\n\n\nLacaton & Vassal began design work on the Architecture School of Nantes[8] (*L\u2019\u00e9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'architecture de Nantes*), a project that was completed in 2009. Here, the areas dedicated to the functions of the school (classrooms, administration, etc.) are juxtaposed with 5,500 square meters of floor space whose functions are not predetermined -- they can be redeployed, according to the needs of the moment.[3]\n\n\nThe Bois-le-Pr\u00eatre tower,[9] giving directly onto the ring road in northern Paris, is a low income housing development built in the 1960s. Lacaton & Vassal, working with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Druot, completed renovation of the building in 2010. Without moving the occupants from the building, the architects added space to all the apartments of the complex by grafting on to the structure a series of balconies and winter gardens. In addition to improving luminosity and thermal performance, the surface area of the building went from 8,900 square meters to 12,460 square meters. In November 2011, the project received the most prestigious French architectural award, the Equerre d'argent.[3][10]\n\n\nThe FRAC Grand Large[11] is a regional museum of contemporary art. Lacaton & Vassal were asked in 2013 to install the museum in a large boathouse in the port of Dunkirk. Their approach to this project was to preserve the original building in its entirety and to build a twin building that houses the museum. The original building is now available to be used either in conjunction with the museum or for other public purposes.[3]\n\n\nLacaton & Vassal were project managers for the redevelopment of the art d\u00e9co-style Palais de Tokyo[12] (a modern art museum in western Paris). In two phases (2003 and 2014), they rehabilitated 14,000 square meters of usable space, essentially by eliminating partitions and false ceilings. The renovation improves the luminosity and the flow through the space, while also revealing the b\u00e9ton brut (unfinished concrete) of the original 1937 construction.[3]\n\n\n\n## More recognition\n\n[edit]\n\nLacaton & Vassal was nominated in 1997 for the 5th prize of the European Union for contemporary architecture Mies-van-der-Rohe in Barcelona. \n\n\nThey received the national grand prize for Young Talent architecture, from the Ministry of Culture, in 1999; almost ten years later, they won the 2008 Grand Prix National de l'Architecture.\n\n\nIn 2018, the Global Award for Sustainable Architecture rewarded their sustainable approach to enhancing buildings and promoting ownership by residents.\n\n\nIn March 2021, Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal were awarded the Pritzker Prize for the entire body of their work.[1]\n\n\n\n## Completed projects\n\n[edit]\n\n* Latapie house, Floirac (1993)\n* Centre de jour pour post-adolescents, B\u00e8gles (1994)\n* Archeological Museum, Saintes (1995)\n* Place Aucoc, Bordeaux (1996)\n* Pierre-Mend\u00e8s-France University of Grenoble (first stage, 1995 / second stage, 2001) nomination for the \u00c9querre d'argent du Moniteur.\n* House in Dordogne (1997)\n* House in L\u00e8ge-Cap-Ferret (1998)\n* House in Coutras (2000)\n* Contemporary creation exhibit space in the Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2001)\n* Caf\u00e9 Una de l\u2019Architekturzentrum, Vienna (2001)\n* Office building, Nantes (2001)\n* Residential building, Floirac (\u00e9tudes en cours, 2003)\n* Residential building, *Cit\u00e9 manifeste* \u00e0 Mulhouse (2005), awarded the label \u2018Architecture contemporaine remarquable\u2019 in July 2015\n* House, Keremma (2005)\n* University building for management studies, Bordeaux (2006)\n* Cave Castelmaure, Embres-et-Castelmaure (2007)\n* Exhibition hall, Paris Nord Villepinte (2007)\n* School of Architecture, Nantes (2009)\n* Transformation de la tour Bois-le-Pr\u00eatre, Paris (2009)\u00a0; \u00c9querre d'argent 2011\n* Am\u00e9nagement des friches du Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2012)\n* FRAC Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Dunkerque (2013)\n* Le Grand Sud, polyvalent hall, Lille (2013)\n* GHI-Quartier du Grand Parc\u00a0: transformation of 3 towers that had been slated for demolition*,* Bordeaux (2016)\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** \"Anne Lacaton and Jean-Philippe Vassal | The Pritzker Architecture Prize\". *www.pritzkerprize.com*.

He was awarded the Royal Gold Medal in 1986 and the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2019. He taught at Columbia University, Harvard University, and Yale University.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\nIsozaki was born in Oita on the island of Kyushu and grew up in the era of postwar Japan,[4] the eldest of four children of Toji and Tetsu Isozaki. His father was a prominent businessmen.[2] In 1945, he witnessed the destruction of Hiroshima on the shore opposite his hometown. [2] When he accepted the Pritzker Prize in 2019 he stated: \"There was no architecture, no buildings, and not even a city. So my first experience of architecture was the void of architecture, and I began to consider how people might rebuild their homes and cities.\"[2]\n\n\nIsozaki completed his schooling at the Oita Prefecture Oita Uenogaoka High School (erstwhile Oita Junior High School). In 1954, he graduated from the University of Tokyo where he majored in Architecture and Engineering. He completed a doctoral program in architecture from the same university in 1961.[1] Isozaki also worked under Kenzo Tange before establishing his own firm in 1963.[1]\n\n\nIsozaki's early projects were influenced by European experiences with a style mixed between \"New Brutalism\" and \"Metabolist Architecture\" (Oita Medical Hall, 1959\u20131960), according to Reyner Banham. His style continued to evolve with buildings such as the Fujimi Country Club (1973\u201374) and Kitakyushu Central Library (1973\u201374). Later he developed a more modernistic style with buildings such as the Art Tower of Mito (1986\u201390) and Domus-Casa del Hombre (1991\u20131995) in Galicia, Spain. In 1983, he supported an apparently unbuildable entry for a sports club in Hong King by the then-unknown architect Zaha Hadid.[2] In 1985 he designed the interior of New York City's Palladium nightclub.[6] The Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles, completed in 1986, was his second international project and his best known work in the U.S.[4]\n\n\nIn 2005, Arata Isozaki founded the Italian branch of his office, Arata Isozaki & Andrea Maffei Associates. Two major projects from this office are the Allianz Tower CityLife office tower, a redevelopment project in the former trade fair area in Milan and the new Town Library in Maranello, Italy.[7]\n\n\nDespite designing buildings both inside and outside Japan, Isozaki was sometimes described as an architect who refused to be stuck in one architectural style, highlighting \"how each of his designs is a specific solution born out of the project\u2019s context.\"[8] Isozaki won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2019.[3]\n\n\nIsozaki died on 28 December 2022, at the age of 91.[9]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* Annual Prize, Architectural Institute of Japan in 1967 and 1975[10]\n* Mainichi Art Award in 1983\n* RIBA Gold Medal in 1986[10]\n* International Award \"Architecture in Stone\" in 1987\n* Arnold W.
