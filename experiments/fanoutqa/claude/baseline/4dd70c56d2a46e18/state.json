Born and raised in Rheinfelden, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Mutter started playing the violin at age five and continued studies in Germany and Switzerland. She was supported early in her career by Herbert von Karajan and made her orchestral debut with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1977. Since Mutter gained prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, she has recorded over 50 albums and performed as a soloist with leading orchestras worldwide and as a recitalist. Her primary instrument is the Lord Dunn\u2013Raven Stradivarius violin. \n\n\nMutter's repertoire includes traditional classical violin works from the Baroque period to the 20th century, but she also is known for performing, recording, and commissioning new works by present-day composers. As an advocate of contemporary music, she has had several works composed especially for her, by Thomas Ad\u00e8s, Unsuk Chin, Sebastian Currier, Henri Dutilleux, Sofia Gubaidulina, Witold Lutos\u0142awski, Norbert Moret, Krzysztof Penderecki, Andr\u00e9 Previn, Wolfgang Rihm, J\u00f6rg Widmann, and John Williams. \n\n\nMutter has received numerous awards and prizes, including four Grammy Awards (1994, 1999, 2000, and 2005), Echo Klassik awards (2009, 2014), the Grand Decoration of Honour of Austria (2007), the Grand Cross Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2009), France's Legion of Honour (2009), Spain's Gold Medal of Merit in the Fine Arts (2016), Romania's Grand Cross National Order of Merit (2017), Poland's Gold Medal for Merit to Culture \u2013 Gloria Artis (2018), Japan's Praemium Imperiale (2019), the Polar Music Prize (2019), and holds honorary memberships at the Royal Academy of Music (1986) and American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2013). \n\n\nMutter founded the Association of Friends of the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation e.V. in 1997 and the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation in 2008, which support young string musicians. She frequently gives benefits concerts and, since 2021, has been the president of the German Cancer Aid. \n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nMutter was born in the German town of Rheinfelden, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Her parents were Karl Wilhelm Mutter and Gerlinde Mutter and she was raised with two older brothers. While Mutter's father was a journalist, who edited a newspaper in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, her mother was the first woman in her family to graduate from college. Although no one in her family played a musical instrument, Mutter's family was passionate about classical music.[1]\n\n\nMutter began playing the piano at the age of five, and shortly afterwards took up the violin. At the age of six, Mutter won the National Music Prize, and in 1972, she gave her first concert with the Winterthurer Stadtorchester.[2] Inspired by a recording of violinist Yehudi Menuhin and Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, she began studying with Erna Honigberger, a pupil of Carl Flesch. After Honigberger's death in 1974, she continued her studies with Aida Stucki\u00a0[de] at the Winterthur Conservatory.[3]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### 1970s\u20131980s\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image) Anne-Sophie Mutter with Aida Stucki\nMutter's playing began to receive attention and she stopped attending school to devote herself full-time to music. Conductor Herbert von Karajan arranged for her to play with the Berlin Philharmonic. Only 13 years old at the time, she made her public debut on stage in 1976 at the Lucerne Festival, where she played Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 4 in D major. In 1977, she performed at the Salzburg Festival and with the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Daniel Barenboim. Critics praised the level of maturity in Mutter's performance, with one reviewer of *Die Welt* writing, \"\"She played it ravishingly, and above all, she did not play it at all like a child prodigy. Her technique is fully mature.\"[4]\nAt 15, Mutter made her first recording of the Mozart Third and Fifth violin concerti with Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic.[3]\n\n\nMutter started to perform outside Europe in the early 1980s. In 1980, Mutter made her American debut with the New York Philharmonic playing Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto under Zubin Mehta. That same year she also made her debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra performing Beethoven's Romance in G major and Mozart's Third Violin Concerto under Georg Solti, and her debut with the National Symphony Orchestra playing Mozart's Third Violin Concerto under Mstislav Rostropovich.[5][6] The following year Mutter made her debut at Carnegie Hall playing Mozart's Fifth Violin Concerto with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti,[7] and made her debut with the Boston Symphony Orchestra performing Bruch's Violin Concerto under Seiji Ozawa in 1983.[8] Mutter's Japanese debut was in Tokyo (1981) with the Berlin Philharmonic under Karajan, followed by her Russian debut in Moscow (1985).[9]\n\n\nAfter three years of her debut with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1980, in which she played Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto under Claudio Abbado, Mutter was named the honorary President of Oxford University's Mozart Society.[10][11] \nIn 1985, at the age of 22, she was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Music (London) and head of its faculty of international violin studies and in 1986 an honorary member.[12]\n\n\nBeginning in the late 1980s, Mutter expanded her repertoire and devoted herself more to contemporary works, a focus that would become a significant component of her career. In 1986, Mutter premiered Witold Lutos\u0142awski's Chain 2, Dialogue for Violin and Orchestra, with the Zurich Collegium Musicum.[13] Norbert Moret composed his Violin Concert En r\u00eave for Mutter in 1988.[14]\n\n\nIn 1988, she also made a grand tour of Canada and the United States, performing as a soloist with orchestras[15][16] and giving solo recitals with pianist Lambert Orkis. Mutter made her recital debuts in New York (at Carnegie Hall), Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Montreal, Toronto, and other cities and debuted with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.[17][18][19][20] Mutter premiered music by Krzysztof Penderecki and Andr\u00e9 Previn and performed classic works such as Beethoven's Violin Concerto and violin sonatas by Beethoven, Brahms, Franck, and Tartini.[21][22][23][24]\n\n\n\n### 1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nBy the 1990s, Mutter had established herself as an international star, transitioning from *Wunderkind* to mature artist[25][26][27] The press described her as a \"master of the violin\" and \"musician of near peerless virtuosity and unimpeachable integrity,\" with critics noting her glamorous image.[28][29][30] One author of *Der Spiegel* wrote in regards to Mutter's rise to fame: \"In the meantime, the entire classical music world knows these tones and this musical master: Anne-Sophie Mutter, now 25, is probably the only world star made in Germany in today's instrumentalist trade and the first violinist from [Germany] who can keep up with the world's violin standard. After Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's flight of fancy, no other serious musician from Germany \u2013 gender notwithstanding \u2013 has succeeded in rising more quickly from the first floor to the penthouse of the international guild of interpreters. In her line of work she is at the top: Frau Fiddler on the roof.\"[31]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Mutter premiered Wolfgang Rihm's Gesungene Zeit (1992), Sebastian Currier's Aftersong (1994) and Krzysztof Penderecki's Violin Concert No. 2 *Metamorphosen* (1995).[32] That same decade, Mutter released some of her best-selling albums, including Carmen Fantasie with James Levine and the Vienna Philharmonic (1993) and Vivaldi's Four Seasons with Karajan and the Vienna Philharmonic (recorded in 1984, published in 1994) and another Vivaldi's Four Seasons album with the Trondheim Soloists (1999).[33][34]\n\n\nIn 1998 she played and recorded for CD and DVD the complete set of Beethoven's Violin Sonatas (released 1999), accompanied by Lambert Orkis; these were broadcast on television in many countries. Mutter devoted an entire year to performing all ten of Beethoven's violin sonatas in the \"Beethoven: Face to Face\" tour in cities throughout North America and Europe, including additional modern pieces.[35][36] Music critic Anthony Tommasini of the *New York Times* wrote on a concert of the Beethoven tour, \"Ms. Mutter's playing had its trademark qualities: rich yet focused tone, striking varieties of sound, articulate yet supple rhythmic play. But her increasing work in recent years with living composers has brought a new kind of intellectual energy to her playing, for she was particularly attentive to the bold turns in this youthful music.\"[37]\n\n\n\n### 2000s\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the turn of the century, Mutter continued supporting new music and began collaborating with composer and conductor Andr\u00e9 Previn, who dedicated several works to Mutter. Mutter premiered a Tango Song and Dance in 2002, which Previn composed for her.[38] Mutter also gave the first permanence and recording of Previn's Violin Concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra the same year,[39] of which the recording became a critical success.[40][41] Mutter toured with orchestras under the direction of Previn, performing his concerto and later premiering Previn's double concerto for violin and contrabass in 2007 with Roman Patkol\u00f3.[42] Two years later, she premiered his Second Piano Trio with Lynn Harrell and Previn and Concerto for Violin and Viola with Yuri Bashmet.[43][44]\n\n\nOther contemporary works dedicated to Mutter that she premiered included Henri Dutilleux's Nocturne for violin and orchestra *Sur le m\u00eame accord* (2002) under Kurt Masur conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Sofia Gubaidulina's violin concerto (2007) under Sir Simon Rattle with the Berlin Philharmonic.[45][46][47]\n\n\nFor Mozart's 250th Anniversary from 2005 to 2006, Mutter toured throughout Europe, North America, and Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, performing Mozart's complete Violin Concertos, the Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra and complete Piano Trios. Mutter performed with Lambert Orkis and Andr\u00e9 Previn as pianists. Five DVD and CD recordings containing the works performed on tour and the complete Violin sonatas of Mozart were released.[48][49]\n\n\nIn October 2006, on French television, Mutter appeared to indicate that she would be retiring when she turned 45, in 2008.[50] However the following month she said that her words were \"misinterpreted\" and that she would continue to play as long as she felt she could \"bring anything new, anything important, anything different to music\".[51]\n\n\n\n### 2010s-present\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Mutter with Lambert Orkis (2021)\nMutter performed classical and contemporary works during the 2010s, touring Europe, North America, Asia, South America, and Australia. For her yearly tours and performances, she continued her collaborations with Lambert Orkis and performed the major concertos of the classical repertoire.[52][53][54][55][56] She premiered Wolfgang Rihm's \"Lichtes Spiel\" with the New York Philharmonic and \"Dyade\" with double bass player Roman Patkol\u00f3 in 2010 and Sebastian Currier's \"Time Machines\" with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Alan Gilbert in 2011 to critical acclaim.[57][58]\n\n\nIn 2011, Mutter established the Mutter Virtuosi, composed of select students and graduates of the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation (established 2008) that perform with Mutter. The chamber ensemble has toured multiple times throughout different continents in the 2010s, performing modern works and classics such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons.[59] As part of Deutsche Grammophon's series to introduce classical music to broader audiences, Mutter and the Mutter Virtuosi performed works by Bach, Vivaldi, Gershwin and John Williams in a night club at Berlin's venue Neue Heimat in 2015. The performance was recorded for The Club Album \u2013 Live from the Yellow Lounge.[60]\n\n\nMutter gave the world premiere of Previn's \"Violin Concerto no. 2 for Violin and String Orchestra with the Trondheim Soloists in 2012,[61] the premier of Sebastian Currier's \"Ringtone Variations\" for violin and double bass in 2013,[62] and the premiere of John Williams' Markings for solo violin, strings and harp with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Andris Nelsons in 2017.[63] In 2018, Mutter premiered Previn's The Fifth Season,[64] Krzysztof Penderecki's Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 2, and his *Duo concertante per violino e contrabbasso*.[65]\n\n\nIn 2018, Mutter gave a concert with pianist Lang Lang titled the Berlin Concert with the Staatskapelle Berlin under Manfred Honeck for the 120 Anniversary of Deutsche Grammophon.[66] For the anniversary, Mutter also gave concerts in Seoul, South Korea, and Tokyo, Japan. The following year, Mutter performed for the 20th anniversary of the Oxford Philharmonic Orchestra with Maxim Vengerov and Martha Argerich.[67]\n\n\nIn 2019, Mutter joined John Williams to perform William's works for solo violin and orchestra, titled \"Across The Stars\". The tour and album contained works from William's film scores, with such notable pieces as the Star Wars themes, Rey and Yoda, and Hedwig's Theme from Harry Potter.[68] The same year, Mutter toured Europe with the West\u2013Eastern Divan Orchestra, playing Beethoven's Triple Concerto with Daniel Barenboim and Yo-Yo Ma. The tour included stops in Buenos Aires and Berlin, and resulted in the release of a CD by Deutsche Grammophon.[69][70] In March 2019, Mutter premiered Sebastian Currier's Ghost Trio with Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott and Lambert Orkis at Carnegie Hall.[71]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Mutter stopped during a performance of Beethoven's Violin Concerto with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra to ask a cellphone user to stop recording. The incident received significant press coverage and refueled debates about concert cellphone etiquette.[72][73][74][75][76]\n\n\nMutter has recently premiered several pieces that have been dedicated to her, including J\u00f6rg Widmann's string quartet *Studie \u00fcber Beethoven* in Tokyo (2020), John Williams' Concerto for Violin and Orchestra No. 2 in Tanglewood with the Boston Symphony Orchestra (2021), Unsuk Chin's violin duet *Gran Cadenza* (2021) in Regensburg with violinist Ye-Eun Choi and Thomas Ad\u00e8s' work for violin and orchestra Air -Homage to Sibelius (2022) at the Lucerne Festival with the Lucerne Festival Contemporary Orchestra.[77][78][79] Mutter's 2023 Virtuosi tour has also included works by Joseph Bologne in an effort to revive the composer's legacy.[80][81]\n\n\n\n## Repertoire\n\n[edit]\n\nMutter's works include traditional classic pieces that are part of the violin repertoire. Mutter has performed and made recordings of the major violin concertos by Bach, Bart\u00f3k, Berg, Brahms, Bruch, Beethoven, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, and Vivaldi. Her repertoire includes performances and recordings of the double and triple concertos by Brahms and Beethoven, violin romances by Beethoven, Bruch, and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, and popular orchestral works by Massenet, Sarasate, and Saint Sa\u00ebns, and standard solo works by Bach and Paganini. Part of her repertoire encompasses chamber works such as the complete violin sonatas by Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart, other sonatas by Bart\u00f3k, Franck, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev and Tartini, trios by Beethoven and Mozart, and string quartets by Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn, and Schubert's Trout Quintet and Fantasy in C Major.[82]\n\n\nThough her repertoire includes many classical works, Mutter is particularly known for her performances of contemporary music. Several pieces have been specially written for or dedicated to her, including Henri Dutilleux's *Sur le m\u00eame accord*, Krzysztof Penderecki's Second Violin Concerto, Witold Lutos\u0142awski's *Chain 2* and the orchestral version of *Partita*, and Wolfgang Rihm's *Gesungene Zeit* (\"Time Chant\"), *Lichtes Spiel*, and *Dyade* and Sofia Gubaidulina's Violin Concerto No. 2 \"In tempus praesens,\" among others. Mutter premiered Andr\u00e9 Previn's Violin Concerto \"Anne-Sophie\", whose recording received a Grammy Award.[83] Mutter's recordings of Penderecki's Violin Concerto No. 2, *Metamorphosen*, and Rihm's *Time Chant* also received Grammy Awards.[84]\n\n\nWorld renowned film score composer and five times Academy Awards winner John Williams composed original music for her, including a pi\u00e8ce for violin, strings and harp called \"Markings\" (2017), a collection of arrangements of movie themes composed by him for violin and orchestra (recorded by Mutter and Williams with the Recording Arts Orchestra of Los Angeles in \"Across the Stars\", 2019[85]) and Williams' second violin concerto (composed 2021, to be recorded by Mutter with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the author as conductor, in 2022[86]). Mutter also appeared as soloist in John Williams' debut concert with the Wiener Philharmoniker on 28 and 29 January 2020, recorded by Deutsche Grammophon and released in the live album \"John Williams in Vienna\", which became the best-selling album of orchestral music in 2020.[87]\n\n\n\n## Playing style and appearance\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Anne-Sophie Mutter, 2021\nAnne-Sophie Mutter is known for her versatile technique, dynamic range of style, richness of tone and articulate, colorful sound.[88][89][90] Critics have noted Mutter's personal and thorough interpretation of the music and dedication to the musical works she plays, as she often studies the letters, original scores, and other historical documents by the composer to guide her interpretation.[91][92][93][94] Mutter often divides critics: some praise the sublimity, gracefulness, dexterity, intellectual energy, and sophistication of her music, while others view her playing overly refined, idiosyncratic and caught up in minute details and maintain that Mutter over-interprets works and imposes herself on the music.[95][96][97][98]\n\n\nMutter is known for performing in strapless gowns. Mutter explained that she felt having fabric on her shoulder made it too slippery to hold her violin firmly while she was playing.[99][100]\n\n\n\n## Instruments\n\n[edit]\n\nShe owns two Stradivarius violins: the Emiliani of 1703, and the Lord Dunn-Raven Stradivarius of 1710,[101][102] of which Mutter primarily performs on the latter.[103] Mutter acquired the Emilinia from John & Arthur Beare in London in 1979 and the Lord Dunn-Raven from Bein & Fushi in Chicago in 1984.[104][105][106] She also owns a Finnigan-Klaembt dated 1999 and a Regazzi dated 2005.[107]\n\n\nMutter has described her Stradivarius violin as her soul mate, saying \"It sounded the way I (had) always been hoping. It's the oldest part of my body and my soul. The moment I am on stage, we are one, musically.\" Mutter ascribes the personal fit of her Stradivarius violin to the \"depths of the colors and the incredible amount of dynamic range.\"[108] She prefers the Lord Dunn-Raven, stating that the Emilia lacks \"a dimension: It has no edginess. I miss the unbridled power. I need this roughness for the eruptive moments of the Beethoven sonatas. You need it for Brahms, Sibelius and contemporary works.\"[109]\n\n\n\n## Public engagement\n\n[edit]\n\nThroughout her career, Mutter has held many benefit concerts for various organizations such as Save the Children Japan, Save the Children Yemen, Artists against Aids, the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Hanna and Paul Gr\u00e4b Foundation's Haus der Diakonie in Wehr-\u00d6flingen, the Bruno Bloch Foundation, Beethoven Fund for Deaf Children, SOS Children's Villages in Syria and others.[110] In 2018, Mutter gave a benefit concert commemorating a liberation concert in May 1945 for Holocaust survivors by Jewish musicians at the St. Ottilien Archabbey.[111] In 2022, the New York Philharmonic and Mutter performed Jewish music, including Previn's violin concerto at Peenem\u00fcnde, a former Nazi army research center site.[112][113] Since March 2022, Mutter has been giving benefit concerts for Ukrainians in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[114]\n\n\nMutter founded the Association of Friends of the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation e.V. in 1997 and further established the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation in 2008, which supports young stringed instrument players and provides scholarships for talented individuals.[115] Mutter initiated the foundation based on her belief that \"Music should grip people, move people; it should tell stories; it should have an impact.\" Since 2011, the ensemble group Mutter's Virtuosi performs with Mutter and includes students supported by the foundation that also commissions new works for its students.[116] Notable former scholarship holders and Mutter's Virtuosi members include violinists Timothy Chooi, Fanny Clamagirand, Vilde Frang, Sergey Khachatryan, Arabella Steinbacher, Noa Wildschut, and Nancy Zhou and cellists Pablo Ferr\u00e1ndez, Maximilian Hornung, Linus Roth, Daniel M\u00fcller-Schott, and Kian Soltani, among others.[117][118]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Mutter voiced her concerns about the impact of lockdowns on musicians, particularly classical musicians, and called for the German government to provide financial support.[119][120]\n\n\nIn 2021, Anne-Sophie Mutter was elected president of the German Cancer Aid.[121]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1989, Mutter married her first husband, Detlef Wunderlich, with whom she had two children, Arabella and Richard. Wunderlich died of cancer in 1995.[122] She dedicated her 1999 recording, *Vivaldi: The Four Seasons*, to his memory.[123] She married the pianist, composer, and conductor Andr\u00e9 Previn in 2002.[124][125] The couple divorced in 2006,[126] but continued to collaborate musically and maintained their friendship.[127]\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Mutter receives honorary doctorate from NTNU in Trondheim (2010)\n* Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance:\n\t+ Anne-Sophie Mutter and Lambert Orkis for *Beethoven: The Violin Sonatas (Nos. 1\u20133, Op. 12; Nos. 1\u20133, Op. 30; \"Spring\" Sonata)* (2000)\n* Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Soloist(s) Performance (with orchestra):\n\t+ Anne-Sophie Mutter and Andr\u00e9 Previn (conductor) for *Previn: Violin Concerto \"Anne-Sophie\"/Bernstein: Serenade* (2005)\n\t+ Anne-Sophie Mutter, Krzysztof Penderecki (conductor) and the London Symphony Orchestra for *Penderecki: Violin Concerto No. 2, Metamorphosen*  (1999)\n\t+ Anne-Sophie Mutter, James Levine (conductor) and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for *Berg: Violin Concerto/Rihm: Time Chant* (1994)\n* Naming of Anne-Sophie-Mutter-Weg in Wehr, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (Eng: Anne-Sophie Mutter way) (27 August 1988)[128]\n* Order of Merit of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (1999)\n* Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art (1999)[129]\n* Sonning Award (2001; Denmark)\n* Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art (2002)\n* Herbert von Karajan Music Prize (Baden-Baden, 2003)[130]\n* Knight of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2005)\n* Victoires de la Musique Classique (2006)\n* Grand Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria (2007)[131]\n* Ernst von Siemens Music Prize (2008)\n* Mendelssohn Prize (Music category) (Leipzig, 2008)\n* Merit Cross 1st Class of the Federal Republic of Germany (*Verdienstkreuz 1.

Bach, and her innovative interpretations of popular and jazz compositions by Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, The Beatles, and others.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography and early career[edit]\n\n\nMullova was born in Zhukovsky, 45\u00a0km from Moscow, in Soviet Russia.[3] At the age of four, she was encouraged to start her violin training by her father Yuri Mullov, the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute physicist and engineer.[1] After studying at the Central Music School of Moscow\u00a0[de] and at the Moscow Conservatory under Leonid Kogan, she won first prize at the 1980 International Jean Sibelius Violin Competition in Helsinki and the gold medal at the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1982. She remembered the whole experience of the Soviet quasi-religious state-sponsored musical education as an overly stressful nightmare full of hypocrisy: \"Naturally, I have never believed in communism. But everything was a play. I knew I wanted to leave, and I was pretending to be a naive girl\".[4][a]\n\n\n\n## Defection[edit]\n\n\nDuring a tour of Finland in 1983, Mullova and her lover, Vakhtang Jordania, who posed as her accompanist so they could defect together, left the hotel in Kuusamo, after Jordania told the KGB officer who was watching them that Mullova was too sick from drinking to attend the afterparty. The Stradivari violin owned by the Soviet Union was left behind on the hotel bed. YLE journalist Jyrki Koulumies,[20][21] accompanied by photographer Caj Sundman, drove them in a rented car across the border via Haparanda to Lule\u00e5, Sweden where they flew to Stockholm.\n\n\nAt that time, the Swedish police treated the young, on-the-run musicians just like any other political defectors from the Eastern Bloc: they suggested that the couple stay in a safehouse over the weekend until the American Embassy opened so they could apply for political asylum upon relocation. So for two days they sat under pseudonyms in a safehouse not even daring to go outside, because their photographs were on the front page of every Swedish and international newspaper. Two days later they arrived in Washington, D.C., with American visas in their pockets.\n\n\n\n## Life in the West[edit]\n\n\nMullova has made many recordings including her debut release of the Tchaikovsky and Jean Sibelius violin concertos which was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque.\n\n\nShe formed the Mullova Chamber Ensemble in the mid-1990s. The ensemble has toured Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands and has recorded the Bach violin concertos on Philips Classics. She was nominated for a 1995 Grammy Award for her recording of the Bach Partitas, and she won a 1995 Echo Klassik award, a Japanese Record Academy Award and a Deutsche Schallplattenkritik prize for her recording of the Brahms violin concerto. Her recording of the Brahms B major Trio (no. 1) and Beethoven's Archduke Trio with Andr\u00e9 Previn and Heinrich Schiff was released in 1995, receiving a further Diapason d'Or.\n\n\nMullova's international career as a soloist has included performances with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the Philharmonia, the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Symphony, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, the San Francisco Symphony and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. She has also performed as soloist and director with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.\n\n\nMullova plays the Jules Falk Stradivarius from 1723 and a violin made in 1750 by Giovanni Battista Guadagnini. Her bows include a Baroque style bow by a Walter Barbiero,[22] one of the finest makers of modern bows, a Dodd and a Voirin.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMullova currently lives in Holland Park, London, England, with her husband, cellist Matthew Barley, and three children: the jazz bassist Misha Mullov-Abbado, from her relationship with conductor and pianist Claudio Abbado;[23] Katia, from her relationship with violinist Alan Brind; and Nadia, who is a dancer in the Royal Ballet,[24] from her marriage to Barley.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## Selected discography[edit]\n\n\n* *Beethoven Violin Sonatas Nos. 3, 9* (Onyx 4050).

Classical music performers were household names rivaled to movie stars and popular singers through its constant presence on a Soviet TV, just like the ballet dancers[6] and Kabalevsky's then-famous credo quote \"Beauty Evokes Kindness\" (Russian: \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0435, romanized:\u00a0*Prekrasnoe probuzhdaet dobroe*)[7] Vladimir Lenin's self-proclaimed atheism, as a lack of transcendental ideals that are important to the others, was perceived as wishful thinking because of Maxim Gorky's 1924 testimony about the leader's admiration for Issay Dobrowen's performance of the \"preterhuman music\" of one of Beethoven's 32 sonatas, all of them being the \"New Testament\" of Moscow Conservatory piano department (with *The Well-Tempered Clavier* as \"Old Testament\"; all-Soviet famous Hans von B\u00fclow statement[8]).[9]\n  \n  \n\nThe oppressive musical education system, as mentioned by Mullova, included thousands of state-sponsored regional non-special complementary children musical schools raising the professional classical music consumers mostly, after a full 8-year-course, and not only the professional musicians. The stable existence of multiple pre-professionally trained listeners has created additional pressure for the performers, sometimes have returned to classical music \"from the front door\" many years and even decades after the graduation from the musical school.[10][11] As an example of attitude, Ludwig van Beethoven's classical song *Marmotte\u00a0[ru]* has become a point of Soviet children's early, elementary school or kindergarten age introduction to the \"unfading ethical ideal\".[12] The Soviet ideology was based on \"another myth about Beethoven: a democrat, sansculotte, a man of the revolutionary era, a rebel, a revolutionary\".[13] Beethoven was ubiquitously wrongly referenced by kids with the false patronymic \"Ludwig Ivanovich\", from 'van', although his father's name was also a variation of \"Ivan\", and it has become a popular in-joke.[14]\n  \n  \n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the system was financially \"abandoned by the state to face the merciless fate\" and, as a repentance for his collaboration with the Soviet authorities and a certain level of animosity, a lack of solidarity, towards his fellow composers Prokofiev and Shostakovich, Kabalevsky has been excluded from a shortlist of worthy Soviet-era composers.[7] By 2019, the number of classical music fans was reduced to a fourth-place overall, 22 percent, behind the Russian/Soviet pop and \"criminals' songs\" (30 percent). It was still more than a number of people who attend religious services at least once a month, as of 2008.[15][16] However, according to the Greek conductor Teodor Currentzis, the ongoing cultural genocide of instrumentalists and their admirers by the Russian officials is far from complete, yet close: \"Russia has the best audience, the most educated\".[17][18][19]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The goddess of victory lives in London\" (in Russian).

Recognized as a child prodigy, she first played as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic and the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1989. She enrolled at Juilliard School to study music, graduated in 1999, and continued university studies. Especially during the 1990s and early to mid-2000s, Chang had major roles as a soloist with many of the world's major orchestras.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nChang was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and raised in Cherry Hill and Voorhees Township, New Jersey.[3][4] Her mother Myoung-Jun Chang is a composer and her father Min-Soo Chang was a violinist and music teacher.[5] Chang's parents moved to the United States from South Korea in 1979 for her father's advanced music degree at Temple University. Her mother took composition classes at the University of Pennsylvania. Chang has said that although she \"never actually lived in Korea... I do still feel very strongly it's where my roots are.\"[6] Her younger brother Michael (born 1987) has a degree from Princeton University.[7][8]\nIn 1986, when Chang was 5 years old, she auditioned for and was accepted to the Juilliard School by performing the Bruch Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor.[9] Chang spent her weekends attending music classes at Juilliard and shopping in New York City with her parents.[10][11] When Chang was 6 years old, she started studying with Isaac Stern outside school.[12] In 1989, she began working with Dorothy DeLay at her studio in New York[13] where her father had received his musical lessons, and at the Aspen Music Festival and School.[14] A former student and assistant to DeLay, Hyo Kang, also provided training to Chang.[15][16]\n\n\nFollowing her 1999 high school graduation in New Jersey, she returned to Juilliard for university and studied with DeLay.[17]\n\n\nChang learned from a family environment to naturally speak Korean.[18][19]\n\n\nDue to her musical accomplishments, Chang is among a very small number of professional figures recognized as a child prodigy.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Early work\n\n[edit]\n\nHer mother trained her to play one-finger melodies on the piano at age 3. For her fourth birthday, she was given a 1/16-sized violin. Upon hearing her play at a dinner party, Philadelphia Orchestra concertmaster Norman Carol asked music director Riccardo Muti to listen to her. At age 8, she auditioned alongside Muti and Zubin Mehta, who was the music director of the New York Philharmonic. Both granted her immediate engagements.[22][23][24]\n\n\nIn 1991, when Chang was 10 years old, she recorded her first album, *Debut*;[25] it was released by EMI Classics on August 18, 1992 and quickly reached the Billboard chart of classical best-sellers.[26] Chang quickly rose to fame and became known on an international scale, performing up to 150 concerts a year. In 2006, *Newsweek* ranked her as one of the Top Eight Achieving Females in the United States. In the interview accompanying the feature, she commented: \"I think having a career at such an early age kept me focused. We schedule at least two to three years in advance in the classical industry. I felt so grounded and so grateful to already know what it was that I wanted to do with my life.\"[27]\n\n\n\n### 2002\u20132005\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Chang in Italy at the 2005 Festival I suoni delle Dolomiti, performing outdoors\nIn 2002, she performed in Pyongyang, North Korea. Chang commented: \"The concert was full of government officials. Every single last seat. It was invitation only, but it was an unbelievable experience. Frightening and exhilarating at the same time. And I just thought about how lucky I am. I am so fortunate to be a musician, and at that moment, I genuinely felt that music is the one and only universal language.\"[27][28]\n\n\nChang took part in watchmaker Movado's global advertising campaign \"The Art of Time\" with Pete Sampras and composer Wynton Marsalis. For the 2004 Olympics, she was selected to carry the Olympic Torch in New York.[29] In 2005, Yale University dedicated a chair in Sprague Hall in Chang's name.[29] Following this, Chang toured for a year with the Berlin Philharmonic and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in a Sextet programme of summer festivals leading to a concert at the Berlin Philharmonie.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### 2007\u2013present\n\n[edit]\n\nChang played a recital at Carnegie Hall on April 7, 2007, accompanied by the British pianist Ashley Wass.[32] She has continued to perform with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Esa-Pekka Salonen and make appearances with the former at both the Hollywood Bowl and Walt Disney Concert Hall throughout 2008.[33] On March 27 and 28 2008 she played for San Antonio, Texas audiences at the Majestic Theater, a performance which was preceded by an appearance (to meet and inspire young as well as seasoned musicians at no charge) at Antonio Strad Violin in the same city.[34] From May 2009 to June 2010, she held recital tours across Europe, North America and Asia with pianist Andrew von Oeyen; a July 2010 recording of the two was eventually released.[35] In the February 12, 2010 program, she held her recital at the Barbican Hall in London.[36] Chang made an appearance at the University of Southern California in March 2010, where she played Max Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1 in G minor, Op. 26. She performed at the Hollywood Bowl in August 2010.[37][38]\n\n\n\n## Instruments\n\n[edit]\n\nSarah Chang owns several violins,[39] and her main violin is the 1717 Guarneri del Gesu by the Cremonese luthier, Giuseppe Guarneri del Ges\u00f9 which she inherited from her mentor, Isaac Stern.[21][40] In another interview in 2013, she told the reporter that she bought the violin from Stern, not received it.[12]\n\n\nChang uses a variety of bows: she has said that she prefers a Pajeot for Mozart and Bach; a Sartory for the Tchaikovsky and Sibelius concerti; and two Dominique Peccattes for other music.[21][41]\n\n\n\n## Public image\n\n[edit]\n\nChang has performed with the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chicago Symphony, the Boston Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, the Montr\u00e9al Symphony Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, the Vienna Philharmonic, orchestras in London, England, and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
