The best-of-seven playoffs was played between the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat and the Western Conference champion Denver Nuggets. The series started on June 1, and concluded on June 12.[1]\n\n\nThe Nuggets defeated the Heat in four of five games, winning their first championship in franchise history after 47 seasons in the NBA. Denver's Nikola Joki\u0107 was unanimously voted the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP),[2][3][4] after averaging 30.2 points, 14.0 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 1.4 blocks while shooting 58.3% from the field and 42.1% from the 3-point line.[5] Joki\u0107 is the lowest-selected player to ever win Finals MVP, being the 41st pick of the 2014 NBA draft.[6] This marked the first NBA Finals appearance for Denver. This was also the second Finals to feature a No. 8 seed, along with the 1999 NBA Finals.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Miami Heat[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022\u201323 Miami Heat season\n\n![](image)Head coach Erik Spoelstra led the eighth-seeded Heat to their sixth NBA Finals under his tenure.\nAfter losing in game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals as the top seed in the Eastern Conference the previous season,[8] the Heat barely qualified for the playoffs in 2023. They regressed from their 53\u201329 record the previous season and finished with a record of 44\u201338, their worst since the 2018\u201319 season. Additionally, they finished the regular season ranked dead last in points per game and were the only team in the league to qualify for the playoffs with a negative point differential.[9] Although they finished 7th in the regular season standings, Miami had to go through two play-in games to extend their season, losing to the Atlanta Hawks in the first and defeating the Chicago Bulls in the second, earning the 8th seed in the NBA playoffs.[10]\n\n\nIn the first round, they faced the Milwaukee Bucks, the team with the best record in the league and the betting favorites to win the championship.[11] The Heat took game 1 on the road after Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo suffered a lower back contusion in the first half that ruled him out for the remainder of game 1, as well as the next two games.[12] The Heat also lost star power of their own, as they lost starter Tyler Herro in game 1 with a broken hand, and Victor Oladipo with a torn left patellar tendon in game 3.[13] Despite their setbacks, the Heat still managed to take a 2\u20131 series lead. In game 4, the Heat trailed by 12 with under six minutes remaining, but they went on a pivotal 30\u201313 run down the stretch, with Jimmy Butler scoring a career-high 56 points in a 119\u2013114 victory to put the Bucks on the brink of elimination.[14] The Heat then overcame a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit in game 5 to become the sixth 8-seeded team to defeat a 1-seeded team in playoff history.[15] Butler, who averaged just 22.9 points in the regular season, finished the first round averaging 37.6 points on 60% from the field.[16]\n\n\nLater in the conference semifinals, they defeated the New York Knicks in six games to clinch their third conference finals appearance in the last four seasons, where they faced the Boston Celtics, who finished with the second-best record in the league.[17] The Heat led the series 3\u20130 before the Celtics won the next three games to force a game 7, in hopes of becoming the first team to overcome a 3\u20130 series deficit.[18] Miami won game 7 on the road by a score of 103\u201384, earning their seventh overall NBA Finals appearance.[19] Butler was named the Eastern Conference Finals MVP, while Caleb Martin, who averaged just 9.6 points in the regular season, finished the conference finals averaging 19.3 points.[20] The Heat became the first eight-seeded team since the 1999 New York Knicks to reach the NBA Finals, and the first eighth-seeded team to reach the Finals in a full 82-game regular season.[7] Outside of Butler and Bam Adebayo, the Heat got a majority of their playoff production from undrafted players such as Martin, Gabe Vincent, Duncan Robinson, and Max Strus, as well as veterans Kyle Lowry, Cody Zeller, and Kevin Love, the latter of whom Miami acquired in February 2023 after he was bought out by the Cleveland Cavaliers.[21]\n\n\n\n### Denver Nuggets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022\u201323 Denver Nuggets season\n\n![](image)Jamal Murray returned to the playoffs after a two-year absence caused by injury.\nThe Nuggets have had several years of recent success. In 2020, they reached their first Western Conference Finals appearance since 2009; however, they fell to the Los Angeles Lakers, who went on to win the 2020 NBA Finals. Denver could not get over the hump after this, largely due to injuries to key players. Jamal Murray, who was crucial to the Nuggets' playoff runs in 2019 and 2020, tore his ACL a month before the start of the 2021 playoffs as the Nuggets were swept by the Phoenix Suns in the second round.[22] The 2021\u201322 season proved to be challenging as well, as the Nuggets had to play without Murray and lost starting forward Michael Porter Jr. to season-ending back surgery nine games into the season.[23] Despite this, Denver still finished the season with a 48\u201334 record and earned the sixth seed, led by back-to-back MVP Nikola Joki\u0107[24] and starting power forward Aaron Gordon, who the Nuggets acquired in the middle of the 2020\u201321 season from the Orlando Magic for Gary Harris, R. J. Hampton, and a 2025 first-round pick.[25] In the first round of the playoffs, the Nuggets lost in five games to the Golden State Warriors, who went on to win the 2022 NBA Finals.\n\n\nThe Nuggets entered the 2022\u201323 season with Murray and Porter Jr. healthy again. During the offseason, they traded for starting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and rotation player Ish Smith from the Washington Wizards in exchange for Mont\u00e9 Morris and Will Barton.[26] Denver also signed Bruce Brown in free agency and added young talent through the 2022 NBA draft, selecting Christian Braun and trading for Peyton Watson, giving up draft picks and JaMychal Green.[27] With a healthy roster, the Nuggets finished the season with a 53\u201329 record and clinched the top seed in the Western Conference for the first time in franchise history.[28]\n\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Nuggets won in five games over the eighth-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves. Denver then faced the fourth-seeded Phoenix Suns, who previously swept them in the conference semifinals in 2021. After going up 2\u20130 in the series, Phoenix won both their home games to tie the series at 2\u20132, despite a career-high 53 points from Joki\u0107 in game 4. The Nuggets then won game 5 in Denver and beat Phoenix on the road to advance in six games. Denver reached their second conference finals in four years, where they faced the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers, who previously defeated them in their first seven postseason matchups. The Nuggets defeated the Lakers in four games, marking their first sweep of an opponent in franchise history en route to reaching the Finals for the first time in their history. Joki\u0107 was awarded Western Conference Finals MVP, as he surpassed Wilt Chamberlain for the most triple-doubles in a single postseason.[29] Playing in their 47th season in the NBA, the Nuggets became the last of the four teams from the American Basketball Association (ABA) that merged with the NBA to reach the NBA Finals.[30] The franchise appeared in the championship round once in the ABA in 1975\u201376, the league's final season before the merger.[31]\n\n\n\n### Road to the Finals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2022\u201323 NBA season and 2023 NBA playoffs\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Eastern Conference |\n| --- |\n| #

The Nuggets trailed for just 34 seconds in the game, and its largest lead was 24. Michael Porter Jr. recorded his seventh double-double of the playoffs, while Aaron Gordon set the tone by scoring 12 of his 16 points in the opening quarter. Bam Adebayo had 26 points and 13 rebounds for Miami, who made just 41% of their field goals and 33% of their three-pointers. Denver remained unbeaten at home in the playoffs, while the Heat had been 3\u20130 in their series openers.[34] Miami also dropped to 1\u20136 all-time in Game 1 of the NBA Finals.[34]\n\n\nJoki\u0107 had 10 points and 10 assists by halftime, when Denver was up 59\u201342.[34] Through the first three quarters, Miami guarded him with Adebayo, Cody Zeller, and a zone defense, forcing Joki\u0107 to become a passer.[35] The Heat went on an 11\u20130 run to start the fourth quarter, cutting an 84\u201363 deficit to 84\u201374.[34] Nuggets coach Michael Malone countered by having Joki\u0107 post up closer to the basket, and he scored 12 points in the final period.[35] Miami came within nine points after a 3-pointer by Haywood Highsmith with 2:34 remaining, but did not come any closer. Highsmith finished with 18 points off the bench, while Gabe Vincent hit five 3-pointers for Miami.[34]\n\n\nJoki\u0107 had 27 points on 67% shooting to go along with 14 assists and 10 rebounds, joining Jason Kidd of the then-New Jersey Nets as the only NBA players with a triple-double in their finals debuts.[35] Joki\u0107 and Murray also became the second pair of teammates to each put up at least 25 points and 10 assists in a finals game since Magic Johnson and James Worthy in 1987.[36] The Heat's Caleb Martin shot just 1 of 7, and Max Strus was 0 for 10, missing all nine of his 3-pointers.[34] Jimmy Butler, who entered the finals averaging 28.5 points this postseason, scored a playoff-low 13 points.[37] Additionally, Miami was just 2 for 2 from on its free throws, tied for the fewest free throws made in a playoff game and breaking the record for fewest attempts in a playoff game.[34]\n\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 4 8:00 pm (6:00 pm MDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Miami Heat** **111**, Denver Nuggets 108\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **26**\u201323, 25\u2013**34**, 24\u2013**26**, **36**\u201325 |\n| **Pts:** Gabe Vincent 23**Rebs:** Kevin Love 10**Asts:** Jimmy Butler 9 |  | **Pts:** Nikola Joki\u0107 41**Rebs:** Nikola Joki\u0107 11**Asts:** Jamal Murray 10 |\n| ***Series tied, 1\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Ball Arena, Denver, Colorado**Attendance:** 19,537**Referees:**\n* No. 10 John Goble\n* No. 61 Courtney Kirkland\n* No. 15 Zach Zarba\n |\n\n![](image)The Heat opened the fourth quarter on a 15\u20132 run, with Duncan Robinson going 4-for-4 to help Miami regain the lead.\nMiami rallied from a 15-point deficit to win 111\u2013108 behind 23 points from Vincent and 21 each from Butler and Adebayo, becoming the first No. 8 seed to win an NBA Finals game on the road. The Heat built an early 21\u201310 lead with 4:56 left in the opening quarter before the Nuggets went on a 40\u201314 run over the next 12 minutes, turning the double-digit deficit into a double-digit lead. Down by eight entering the fourth quarter, the Heat outscored Denver 32\u201312 in the opening 8:21 of the fourth quarter to take a 12-point lead, then frittered most of it away and had to survive a 3-point try by Murray that missed as time expired.[38] Miami knocked down 17 of their 35 threes and converted 18 of 20 free throws after making just two in Game 1. Joki\u0107 scored a game-high 41 points but recorded a playoff-low four assists as the Nuggets lost their first home game since March 30.[38]\n\n\nWith Martin dealing with an illness, Miami elected to insert Kevin Love, who did not play in Game 1, into the starting lineup.[38] Strus, who was 0 for 10 in Game 1, had four 3-pointers in the first quarter as the Heat jumped out to an early 11-point lead, but the Nuggets reclaimed momentum early in the second quarter with four 3-pointers in a 70-second span as Miami trailed by as much as 15 in the first half.[38] Despite an 18-point third quarter from Joki\u0107, the Heat hung around to trail by eight entering the fourth quarter. Coming into the game, Denver was undefeated in the playoffs when leading by double digits and boasted a 37\u20131 record for the season when leading by at least eight points going into the final quarter.[38]\n\n\nMiami opened the first 2:43 of the fourth quarter with a 15\u20132 scoring run, highlighted by Duncan Robinson going 4 for 4 from the field to give the Heat their first lead of the second half. Miami managed to build a 12-point advantage with under 3:30 remaining but had to weather a late surge from the Nuggets, who cut the lead to three with 35 seconds remaining. After a missed 3-pointer from Butler, Denver chose not to call a timeout in the closing seconds. Murray attempted a last-second 3-point shot that could have tied the game, but it fell short. Murray finished with 18 points and 10 assists, while Joki\u0107 converted 16 of his 28 field goals as the Nuggets dropped to 0\u20133 this postseason when Joki\u0107 scores 40 or more points.[39]\n\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 7 8:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Denver Nuggets** **109**, Miami Heat 94\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 24\u201324, **29**\u201324, **29**\u201320, **27**\u201326 |\n| **Pts:** Jamal Murray 34**Rebs:** Nikola Joki\u0107 21**Asts:** Joki\u0107, Murray 10 each |  | **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 28**Rebs:** Bam Adebayo 17**Asts:** Lowry, Strus 5 each |\n| ***Denver leads series, 2\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Kaseya Center, Miami, Florida**Attendance:** 20,019**Referees:**\n* No. 25 Tony Brothers\n* No. 24 Kevin Scott\n* No. 58 Josh Tiven\n |\n\n![](image)Nikola Joki\u0107 and Jamal Murray *(pictured)* became the first duo in NBA history to each record a 30-point triple-double.\nJoki\u0107 and Murray became the first pair of teammates in NBA history to each record a 30-point triple-double in the same game as the Nuggets won 109\u201394, reclaiming the series lead.[40] After a tight first half that saw neither team claim a lead bigger than five, the Heat never led in the second half, as Denver pushed the lead to double digits for the first time early in the third quarter and led by as much as 21 later in the half. The Nuggets won their fourth straight road game, while Miami lost their third straight home game after starting off 6\u20130 at home this postseason.[40]\n\n\nJoki\u0107 and Murray combined for 24 made field goals, while the entire Heat team managed 34. The duo also contributed significantly on the glass, grabbing a combined 31 rebounds to the Heat's total of 33, while their 20 assists matched Miami's total of 20.[40] For Joki\u0107, this marked his 10th triple-double of the playoffs, further extending his single-season record for triple-doubles in a single playoff run. He finished the game by converting 12 of his 21 shot attempts, while his 32 points, 21 rebounds, and 10 assists made him the first player to record 30-plus points, 20-plus rebounds, and 10-plus assists in a finals game.[41] For Murray, he finished with a game-high 34 points on 55% from the field to go along with 10 boards and 10 assists, joining Magic Johnson and Bob Cousy as the only players in finals history to record 10-plus assists in three consecutive games.[42]\n\n\nJoki\u0107 and Murray also received contributions from their teammates, as Christian Braun scored 15 points on 7-for-8 shooting in 19 minutes off the bench, while Gordon added a double-double as Denver dominated the boards (58 to 33) and points in the paint (60 to 34).[40] For Miami, Butler finished with 28 points, and Adebayo recorded 22 points and 17 rebounds but only made seven of his 21 shot attempts. Vincent and Strus shot a combined 3 for 17 as the Heat finished the game shooting 37% from the field and 31% from beyond the arc.[40] Notably, Udonis Haslem (42 years, 363 days) became the oldest player to play in the NBA Finals, coming off the bench with 29.8 seconds left in the game.[43]\n\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 9 8:30 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Denver Nuggets** **108**, Miami Heat 95\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 20\u2013**21**, **35**\u201330, **31**\u201322, 22\u201322 |\n| **Pts:** Aaron Gordon 27**Rebs:** Nikola Joki\u0107 12**Asts:** Jamal Murray 12 |  | **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 25**Rebs:** Bam Adebayo 11**Asts:** Butler, Lowry 7 each |\n| ***Denver leads series, 3\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Kaseya Center, Miami, Florida**Attendance:** 20,184**Referees:**\n* No. 48 Scott Foster\n* No. 55 Bill Kennedy\n* No. 60 James Williams\n |\n\nFile:\u0410\u0440\u043e\u043d \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d 2021 (cropped).pngAaron Gordon scored a playoff career-high 27 points to move the Nuggets to the brink of their first NBA title.\nGordon dropped a game-high 27 points on 11 of 15 from the field, Joki\u0107 chipped in 23 points and 12 rebounds, and Murray recorded 15 points and 12 assists as the Nuggets took a commanding 3\u20131 series lead back to Denver.[44] Bruce Brown came off the bench and scored 11 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, thwarting any attempt by the Heat to overcome their eighth double-digit deficit of the playoffs. The Nuggets won their fifth straight road game,[44] improving to 9\u20131 in their last ten playoff games, while Miami dropped to 2\u20136 in their last eight games,[45] as they fell into a 3\u20131 hole for the third consecutive finals appearance.[44]\n\n\nAfter neither team could claim a double-digit lead in the first half for the second consecutive game, the Nuggets led by 13 going into the fourth quarter. Similar to their game 2 victory, the Heat scored the first eight points of the quarter, and Joki\u0107 committed his fifth foul and had to go to the bench with 9:24 left.[44] Miami narrowed the lead to five with 8:42 remaining,[44] but the Nuggets held firm, as Brown scored 11 points during a 14\u20134 run down the stretch that gave Denver a 17-point lead, their largest of the night.[46] Murray, who committed seven turnovers in game 3, finished the game with 12 assists and zero turnovers, joining Magic Johnson and Robert Reid as the only players to record 12+ assists with zero turnovers in a finals game.[47]\n\n\nButler led the Heat with 25 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists, while Adebayo had 20 points, 11 rebounds, and seven turnovers.[44] Kyle Lowry chipped in with 13 points and seven assists off the bench, but the starting backcourt of Strus and Vincent scored just two points on 1 of 10 shooting as the Heat were held to under 100 points for the third time this series.[48] The Nuggets made 14 of their 28 3-pointers, while Miami shot just 32% from deep and committed 15 turnovers after having just four in game 3.[49] Joki\u0107 and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope combined for six steals and five blocks, while the entire Heat team finished with just two steals and three blocks. Joki\u0107 also became the first player in NBA history to put up at least 500 points, 250 rebounds, and 150 assists in a single postseason run.[50]\n\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 12 8:30 pm (6:30 pm MDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 89, **Denver Nuggets** **94** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **24**\u201322, **27**\u201322, 20\u2013**26**, 18\u2013**24** |\n| **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 21**Rebs:** Bam Adebayo 12**Asts:** Jimmy Butler 5 |  | **Pts:** Nikola Joki\u0107 28**Rebs:** Nikola Joki\u0107 16**Asts:** Jamal Murray 8 |\n| ***Denver wins NBA Finals, 4\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Ball Arena, Denver, Colorado**Attendance:** 19,537**Referees:**\n* No. 8 Marc Davis\n* No. 16 David Guthrie\n* No. 58 Josh Tiven\n |\n\n![](image)Nikola Joki\u0107 was awarded Finals MVP, becoming the first center to win the award since Shaquille O'Neal in 2002.\nIn a closely contested Game 5, Joki\u0107 propelled the Nuggets to their first NBA championship in franchise history with a hard-fought 94\u201389 victory over the Heat. Jokic's dominant performance, including 28 points and 16 rebounds, earned him the Finals MVP award.[51] The Nuggets struggled with their shooting throughout the game, particularly from beyond the arc, as they missed 20 of their first 22 three-point attempts;[51] however, Jokic's efficient 12 of 16 shooting from the field provided a much-needed boost, as he was the only starter across both teams to shoot over 50% from the field.[51] Joki\u0107, who averaged 30 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 9.5 assists throughout the playoffs, became the first player in NBA history to lead the league in points (600), rebounds (269), and assists (190) in a single postseason.[51]\n\n\nPrior to the game, Miami announced that Tyler Herro was listed as active for the first time since he broke his hand in the first round against the Milwaukee Bucks.[52] The Heat trailed by eight early in the first quarter, but a 31\u201313 run by Miami turned the deficit into a 10-point lead, their largest since Game 2.[53] Adebayo scored 18 of his 20 points in the first half to give the Heat their first halftime lead of the series.[54] The Nuggets, who entered the game with a series shooting average of 37.6% from three-point range, shot a historically poor 6.7% from three-point range in the first half.[51] Additionally, Denver committed 10 turnovers in the first half and missed 10 of their first 19 free throws.[51] Despite their shooting struggles, the Nuggets showed their resiliency, as they stormed back to take an 83\u201376 lead with 4:43 left in the fourth quarter.[54]\n\n\nButler, who made just two field goals in the first 43 minutes of the game, scored 13 consecutive points for Miami to give them a one-point lead with two minutes to go;[51] however, an offensive rebound and tip-in by Brown swung the momentum back in favor of the Nuggets. After a steal and two free throws from Pope, Butler missed a contested 3-pointer and Brown hit free throws in the final seconds to seal the win for Denver.[51] Murray contributed 14 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists, while Porter Jr. recorded 16 points and 13 rebounds for the Nuggets.[54] Butler finished with 21 points on 5 for 18 from the field for the Heat, and Adebayo recorded his 4th 20-point double-double of the series.[51] Although Herro was listed as available, coach Erik Spoelstra elected not to play him.[52] Miami's shooting woes ultimately proved costly, as they shot an inadequate 26% from three-point range and 34% from the field, their lowest percentage of the season.[51]\n\n\nDenver became the second original ABA franchise, along with the San Antonio Spurs, to win an NBA championship.[51] It was the Nuggets' first league championship after 56 combined years in the ABA and NBA.[55] Denver is also the first Western Conference team from outside the states of California or Texas to win the championship since the 1978\u201379 Seattle SuperSonics.[56] After this NBA championship, MLB's Colorado Rockies remain the only franchise from Colorado without a title in the \"Big Four\" sports leagues. Meanwhile, the Heat were one of two South Florida teams to lose the championship series in a \"Big Four\" sports league, as the NHL's Florida Panthers were defeated in the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals a day later, also by a series score of 4 games to 1.[57] This was also the final game of Haslem's NBA career, as he retired after the 2022\u201323 season, having played 20 seasons with the Heat.[58]\n\n\n\n\n## Rosters[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2022\u201323 Miami Heat roster\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | ---

coverage[edit]\n\n\nThe Finals were televised in the United States by ABC for the 21st consecutive year.[32][60] Game 1 received an alternate presentation anchored by Stephen A. Smith on ESPN2 and streamed on ESPN+ as *NBA in Stephen A's World*.[61]\n\n\nSame as before, the series was called by Mike Breen on play-by-play with Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson as analysts, and Lisa Salters as the sideline reporter.[62] This marked the record 15th and final NBA Finals called by the trio of Breen, Van Gundy and Jackson, and the 14th full series overall.[a] Van Gundy also set the record for calling his 17th NBA Finals as an analyst, however he was one of several personnel laid off by ESPN on June 30, 2023.[63] On July 31, Jackson was also laid off by ESPN, and on August 14, the network promoted Doris Burke and Doc Rivers to the lead broadcast team.[64]\n\n\n\n### Viewership[edit]\n\n\nSee also: NBA Finals television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(American households)\n | American audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 6.0 | 11.58 | [65] |\n| 2\n | 6.0 | 11.91 | [66] |\n| 3\n | 6.0 | 11.24 | [67] |\n| 4\n | 5.4 | 10.41 | [68] |\n| 5\n | 7.0 | 13.08 | [69] |\n| Avg | 6.1 | 11.64 |  |\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nJoki\u0107 and Murray with the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy\n![](image)\nNuggets players celebrating during parade\n\nFollowing the Nuggets win, a parade from Union Station to Civic Center Park in Denver was scheduled for 10 a.m. on June 15, with a pre-parade rally an hour before the parade. The parade was planned to emulate the celebration which followed the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals victory by the Colorado Avalanche.[70]\n\n\nDuring the celebrations in downtown Denver immediately following the Nuggets championship win, there were two shootings that resulted in at least eleven people being shot, including one suspect. On the 2000 block of Market Street, the Denver Police Department said nine victims were identified as injured, with an injured suspect located nearby, all with gunshot wounds. Another shooting was reported on 17th Street and Blake Street, with Denver police reporting one victim self-transported to a hospital.[71] Three of those shot were reported as in critical condition as of the morning of June 13, with the remainder not sustaining life-threatening injuries.[72] The celebrations in downtown Denver had been described as \"raucous\", with fireworks detonating and men climbing streetlights near Coors Field and many fans cheering in McGregor Square.[73]\n\n\nDuring the parade on June 15, a Denver police officer was struck in the lower leg by a fire truck which was transporting multiple Nuggets players, including Nikola Joki\u0107 and Jamal Murray.[74][75] Joki\u0107's wife, Natalija, was hit in the face with a beer can while riding on the fire truck during the parade.[76]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Games 1 and 2 of the 2022 NBA Finals were called by Mark Jones alongside Mark Jackson and Lisa Salters. Jeff Van Gundy returned in Game 2 while Mike Breen returned in Game 3 after undergoing quarantine due to Covid-19.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Basketball portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![flag](image)Colorado portal\n* ![flag](image)Florida portal\n\n\n1. **^** \"NBA playoffs 2023: Schedule, news, highlights, scores, more\". *ESPN*.

In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors defeated the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics in six games, winning their fourth championship in eight years. Golden State's Stephen Curry was named the Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the first time in his career.\n\n\nThe 3-seeded Warriors (53\u201329) had home-court advantage in the series based on having the better regular-season record than the 2-seeded Celtics (51\u201331). This is the 11th time that a lower-seeded team had home-court advantage, the last time being 2019.[1] It is also the second straight finals without a no. 1 seed from either conference, as well as the 15th time overall.[2][3] The Celtics won the opening game on the road and returned to Boston with the series tied 1\u20131. They won their first home game to take a 2\u20131 lead, but the Warriors won the next three games to take the series 4\u20132. Golden State won their first title since 2018 and their seventh championship overall, while Boston remained tied with the Los Angeles Lakers for the most titles in league history with 17.[4]\n\n\nThe NBA Finals returned to its normal June schedule for the first time since 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic began.[5] The series started on June 2 and concluded on June 16. Sponsored by the streaming service YouTube TV, the series was officially known as the **2022 NBA Finals presented by YouTube TV**.[6] This edition of the Finals was a rematch of the 1964 NBA Finals, in which the Celtics defeated the then-San Francisco Warriors in five games.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Boston Celtics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021\u201322 Boston Celtics season\n\n![](image)In his first year as head coach, Ime Udoka took the Celtics to their first NBA Finals in 12 years.\nDuring the 2021 offseason, the Celtics named head coach Brad Stevens president of basketball operations, replacing Danny Ainge after he announced his retirement.[8] Stevens made his first transaction in his new position trading away Kemba Walker, a 2021 first-round pick, and a 2025 second-round pick in exchange for Al Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2023 second-round pick.[9] Needing a replacement for Stevens, Brooklyn Nets assistant coach Ime Udoka was hired as the new head coach. After starting the season 16\u201319 and in 10th place in the Eastern Conference standings, the Celtics finished the regular season with a record of 51\u201331, winning 35 of their final 47 games to finish with the second-best record in the conference.[10]\n\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Celtics won in a four-game sweep over the seventh-seeded Brooklyn Nets, with numerous experts expecting a more competitive series as the Nets, with Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and initially James Harden before he was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers, were seen as the preseason favorites.[11] The Celtics then faced the 2021 Finals MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and defending champion Milwaukee Bucks, going down 3\u20132 in the series before eventually winning the series in seven games. After going down 2\u20131 in the conference finals against the first-seeded Miami Heat led by Jimmy Butler, the Celtics won in seven games, reaching the Finals for the first time since 2010 and for the 22nd time in their history.[12]\n\n\nThis marked the first time a team from the Greater Boston area reached a championship series of the four major North American sports leagues since 2019, when the Boston Bruins reached the Stanley Cup Finals.\n\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021\u201322 Golden State Warriors season\n\n![](image)Klay Thompson returned after missing the previous two seasons due to injury.\nAfter reaching the Finals for five consecutive seasons (2015\u20132019), the Warriors were struck with injuries for the next two seasons, with Klay Thompson sitting out for the entire 2019\u201320 and 2020\u201321 campaigns, and Stephen Curry playing a combined 68 games during that time span.[13] In 2021\u201322, Golden State began the season winning 18 of their first 20 games.[14] Curry became the NBA career leader in 3-pointers,[15] and Thompson returned on January 9, 2022, his first NBA game in 941 days.[16] Andrew Wiggins, acquired by the Warriors in 2020 after six seasons with Minnesota,[17] was named a starter for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game.[18] The Warriors finished as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference with a record of 53\u201329,[15][19][20]\n\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Warriors got past the sixth-seeded Denver Nuggets and 2022 league MVP Nikola Joki\u0107 in five games, with Curry coming off the bench in four of the five games after he returned from a foot injury.[21] The Warriors then eliminated the second-seeded Memphis Grizzlies and the 2022 NBA Most Improved Player, Ja Morant, beating them in six games. After defeating the Dallas Mavericks in five games in the conference finals, the Warriors advanced to the Finals for the first time in three seasons, the sixth time in eight seasons, and the twelfth time in franchise history.[22]\n\n\nThis marked the first time a team from the Bay Area reached a championship series of the four major North American sports leagues since 2020, when the San Francisco 49ers reached Super Bowl LIV.\n\n\n\n### Road to the Finals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2021\u201322 NBA season and 2022 NBA playoffs\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Eastern Conference |\n| --- |\n| #

Jaylen Brown also helped spark a 17\u20130 run in the fourth, scoring 10 of his 24 points in the final quarter. Jayson Tatum had a poor shooting performance, going 3-for-17 from the field and scoring 12 points,[24] but he finished with a career-high 13 assists, the most ever for a player in his Finals debut.[25] Boston's other four starters shot 30-for-50 (60%) in the game, along with shooting 12-for-23 (52%) from beyond the arc, as the Celtics hit their first seven three-point attempts in the fourth.[26] Marcus Smart added 18 points, and Derrick White came off the bench to score 21 points.[27]\n\n\nFor the Warriors, Stephen Curry got off to a hot start, scoring 21 points and shooting 6-for-8 from beyond the arc in the first quarter, the most three-pointers made in a single quarter in Finals history.[28] In addition, the 21 points were the most in a single quarter since Michael Jordan's 22 in the fourth quarter of Game 4 in 1993.[29] However, Curry struggled for the rest of the game, shooting 5-of-16 in the final three quarters as the Warriors blew a 92\u201380 lead heading into the fourth quarter.[30] Despite collecting 11 rebounds, Draymond Green shot just 2-for-12 from the field and 0-for-3 on free throws, fouling out with a minute to go in the fourth.[31]\n\n\nThe Celtics' comeback was the biggest in the Finals after three quarters since the Chicago Bulls overcame a 15-point deficit to beat the Portland Trail Blazers in Game 6 in 1992.[32] The win also brought the Celtics record to 8\u20132 on the road this postseason, while the Warriors dropped to 9\u20131 at home. Both teams also made a combined 40 three-pointers, the most ever in an NBA Finals game, surpassing the previous record of 35 set in 2017.[33]\n\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 5 8:00 pm (5:00 pm PDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Boston Celtics 88, **Golden State Warriors** **107** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 30\u2013**31**, 20\u2013**21**, 14\u2013**35**, **24**\u201320 |\n| **Pts:** Jayson Tatum 28**Rebs:** Al Horford 8**Asts:** Marcus Smart 5 |  | **Pts:** Stephen Curry 29**Rebs:** Kevon Looney 7**Asts:** Draymond Green 7 |\n| ***Series tied, 1\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Chase Center, San Francisco, California**Attendance:** 18,064**Referees:**\n* No. 15 Zach Zarba\n* No. 25 Tony Brothers\n* No. 58 Josh Tiven\n |\n\n![](image)Stephen Curry scored a game-high 29 points for the Warriors in Game 2.\nCurry scored 29 points and Golden State outscored Boston 35\u201314 in the third quarter to tie the series with a 107\u201388 win. The Warriors outscored the Celtics 43\u201314 from late in the second quarter to early in the fourth, transforming a tie game into a blowout.[34] Jordan Poole added 17 points for Golden State, including a 3-point shot from 39 feet (12\u00a0m), just past midcourt, with only seconds left in the third quarter, giving them a 23-point lead.[34][35] Boston committed 19 turnovers, which the Warriors converted into 33 points.[34]\n\n\nGreen had nine points, five rebounds, and seven assists for Golden State, but impacted the game with his aggressiveness on defense and physical play. He forced a jump ball on Horford 13 seconds into the game, and he was the primary defender on Brown, holding him to 5-of-17 shooting.[36][37] Tatum recovered from his poor shooting in Game 1, scoring 21 points in the first half of Game 2 on 7-of-16 shooting. Brown added 15 points in the first half, but Boston still trailed by two at halftime. In the third quarter, Tatum shot just twice in the third period, even though he played all 12 minutes. Horford scored just two points on four shots in the game after scoring 26 in the opener.[35] The Celtics made just 37.5% of their shots in the game, scoring their fewest points since December 29, when they were 16\u201319.[36]\n\n\nThe Warriors' Andre Iguodala missed the game due to inflammation in his right knee.[34] Teammate Gary Payton II, who played for the first time since fracturing his elbow one month ago in their series against Memphis, scored seven points in 25 minutes.[38]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 8 9:00 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Golden State Warriors 100, **Boston Celtics** **116** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 22\u2013**33**, 34\u2013**35**, **33**\u201325, 11\u2013**23** |\n| **Pts:** Stephen Curry 31**Rebs:** Looney, Wiggins 7 each**Asts:** Otto Porter Jr. 4 |  | **Pts:** Jaylen Brown 27**Rebs:** Robert Williams III 10**Asts:** Jayson Tatum 9 |\n| ***Boston leads series, 2\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston, Massachusetts**Attendance:** 19,156**Referees:**\n* No. 48 Scott Foster\n* No. 16 David Guthrie\n* No. 61 Courtney Kirkland\n |\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJaylen Brown (left) and Jayson Tatum (right) combined for 53 points, with Tatum scoring 15 of his 26 in the second half.[39]\n\nBrown scored 27 points and Tatum had 26 in a 116\u2013100 Boston win for a 2\u20131 series lead. The Celtics led by as many as 18 points in the first half, but Golden State again surged in the third quarter, outscoring Boston 33\u201325 behind 15 points from Curry. The Warriors briefly took the lead at 83\u201382, but the Celtics were back up at 93\u201389 at the end of the period. Boston outscored Golden State 23\u201311 in the fourth quarter.[40] The Celtics were the more physical team,[41] outscoring the Warriors 52\u201326 in the paint and outrebounding them 47\u201331.[40] Boston's Robert Williams III had 10 rebounds and four of the team's seven blocks.[41]\n\n\nCurry finished with 31 points and six 3-pointers, and Thompson added 25 points and five 3s made.[40] Green was held to two points, four rebounds, and three assists before fouling out for the second time in the series.[42] He became the first player in Finals history to foul out after playing at least 34 minutes with less than five points, five rebounds and five assists.[43] Curry was injured late in the fourth when Horford fell on his leg while chasing a loose ball.[40] Green received his sixth foul, which ejected him from the game when he pushed a Celtic from the pile; Green said Curry was howling in pain at the bottom of the pileup. The following day, Curry was confident that he would play in Game 4, saying that it was \"just a pain tolerance thing that you've got to deal with.\" He said it was not as bad as the injury that kept him out for the final 12 games of the regular season when Boston's Smart rolled over his foot when they went for a loose ball.[44]\n\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 10 9:00 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Golden State Warriors** **107**, Boston Celtics 97\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 27\u2013**28**, 22\u2013**26**, **30**\u201324, **28**\u201319 |\n| **Pts:** Stephen Curry 43**Rebs:** Andrew Wiggins 16**Asts:** Draymond Green 8 |  | **Pts:** Jayson Tatum 23**Rebs:** Robert Williams III 12**Asts:** Jayson Tatum 6 |\n| ***Series tied 2\u20132*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TD Garden, Boston, Massachusetts**Attendance:** 19,156**Referees:**\n* No. 19 James Capers\n* No. 5 Kane Fitzgerald\n* No. 42 Eric Lewis\n |\n\n![](image)Golden State went on a 11\u20133 run in the fourth quarter after head coach Steve Kerr *(pictured)* decided to bench Warriors' staple Draymond Green in favor of Kevon Looney.\nCurry scored 43 points and had 10 rebounds in a 107\u201397 win to even the series 2\u20132.

Thompson added 21 points to help the Warriors overcome an off night for Curry, who had 16 points and eight assists but went 0 for 9 from 3-point range.[50] Boston was more aggressive in double-teaming Curry beyond the 3-point line. Prior to Game 5, he had NBA-record streaks of 38 consecutive games with multiple 3-pointers, 132 straight playoff games with a least one 3-point basket, and 233 consecutive games with a 3-pointer in the regular season and postseason combined.[51] Tatum had a game-high 27 points and 10 rebounds for the Celtics, who lost consecutive games for the first time in these playoffs.[50][52]\n\n\nThe Warriors led by as many as 16 points in the first quarter. Boston whittled away at the lead with Curry on the bench, but he made a layup to give Golden State a 51\u201339 advantage at halftime. Wiggins had 16 points and seven rebounds at the break, and Green was forceful with 8 points after totaling just 17 in the first four games.

After the break, the Celtics scored the first 10 points of the second half and took the lead after a 19\u20134 run.[52] They made eight consecutive 3s after missing their first 12 of the game,[50] while Golden State missed their first eight in the second half.[52] Poole banked in a 33-foot (10\u00a0m) three-pointer to beat the third-quarter buzzer, giving the Warriors a 75\u201374 lead to enter the fourth.[50][52]\n\n\nThompson shot 7 for 14 and made five 3-pointers. The Warriors were 9 of 40 on their 3s, including 0 of 6 from Wiggins. Green, who fouled out with 3:01 left, exited with eight points, eight rebounds, and seven assists.

He also hit two 3-pointers after missing his first 12 attempts of the series.[60] For head coach Steve Kerr, he won his ninth championship overall, after winning five as a player.[63] He became the sixth coach to capture four titles, joining Phil Jackson, Red Auerbach, John Kundla, Gregg Popovich and Pat Riley.[64] The Warriors also became the first team to go from the NBA's worst record (2019\u201320) to a championship within a three-season span.[58] With the win, the Warriors earned their seventh double-digit comeback win this postseason, which tied the 2011 and 2012 Miami Heat for the most double-digit comeback wins by any team in the past 25 postseasons.[53]\n\n\nBrown led the Celtics with 34 points but Tatum finished with just 13, shooting just 6-of-18 from the field. The Celtics' bench also performed poorly, receiving just five points on 2-for-10 shooting from the field from their primary reserves\u2014White, Grant Williams, and Payton Pritchard.[65] Boston also committed 22 turnovers, dropping to 1\u20138 this postseason when committing 16 or more. Tatum set the NBA record for most turnovers in a single postseason with 100.[66] The Celtics' Finals series record dropped to 17\u20135, remaining tied with the Lakers for the most championships in league history.[67]\n\n\n\n## Rosters[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2021\u201322 Boston Celtics roster\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n

trophy[edit]\n\n\nOn April 13, the NBA released a reimagined version of the classic NBA Finals wordmark that was used between 1986 and 1995 and from 2004 to 2017. The new logo also features a depiction of the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy in the background.[69]\n\n\nThe NBA then announced on May 12 that the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy and the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Trophy have also been redesigned. Among the new changes to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, its base now consists of two disks that list the names of all the previous winning teams. The Bill Russell Trophy has been changed from a gold ball and silver net to primarily gold with silver accents.[70]\n\n\nWith NBA commissioner Adam Silver missing games 5 and 6 due to the league's health and safety protocols, the Larry O'Brien Trophy was presented to the Warriors by deputy commissioner Mark Tatum instead.[71]\n\n\n\n## Media coverage[edit]\n\n\nThe Finals was televised in the United States by ABC for the 20th consecutive year.[72]\n\n\nLead play-by-play announcer Mike Breen and lead analyst Jeff Van Gundy both missed Game 1 due to COVID-19 protocols.[73] ESPN's No. 2 play-by-play announcer, Mark Jones, filled in for Breen during games 1 and 2. Jones, Mark Jackson and Lisa Salters made history in Game 1 as the first all-African American broadcast team to cover an NBA Finals game.[74] Van Gundy returned to the broadcast booth for Game 2, followed by Breen in Game 3.[75]\n\n\nESPN put together a Megacast option for Game 1 called *NBA Finals: Celebrating 75*, hosted by Michael Eaves alongside New Orleans Pelicans guard CJ McCollum and Tim Legler. It was broadcast on ESPN2 due to ESPN's commitments to have the Women's College World Series on the main network.[76]\n\n\n\n### Viewership[edit]\n\n\nSee also: NBA Finals television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(American households)\n | American audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 6.4 | 11.90 | [77] |\n| 2\n | 6.2 | 11.91 | [78] |\n| 3\n | 6.2 | 11.52 | [79] |\n| 4\n | 6.2 | 12.06 | [80] |\n| 5\n | 7.0 | 13.03 | [81] |\n| 6\n | 7.5 | 13.99 | [82] |\n| Avg | 6.6 | 12.40 |  |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Skiver, Kevin (June 2, 2022). \"Who has home court advantage in the NBA Finals?

In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Eastern Conference champion Milwaukee Bucks defeated the Western Conference champion Phoenix Suns, 4\u20132, winning their first NBA championship in 50 years and second overall. Holding home-court advantage, the Suns led the series 2\u20130 before the Bucks won the next four games, becoming the fifth team in NBA history to win the championship after losing the first two games. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP).[1] With the COVID-19 pandemic altering the NBA's schedule for the second consecutive year, the start date of the series was pushed from its usual time in late May or early June to July 6, the second-latest start in Finals' history.[2] This was the first NBA Finals since 2010 to have neither LeBron James nor Stephen Curry as one of the players.\n\n\nMilwaukee and Phoenix were two of five teams in the league with an active championship drought of 50 years or more.[3][4][5] Prior to 2021, the Bucks won their only title in 1971, while the Suns have yet to win a title since joining the league in 1968. They were both making their third Finals appearance. Phoenix and Milwaukee each began play as expansion teams in 1968. Both teams were involved in a coin toss for the rights to the first overall pick in the 1969 NBA draft, which the Bucks won and used to select Lew Alcindor, later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, from UCLA. He led the Bucks to their first championship in 1971.[6] The 2021 Finals was the first since 1971 to not include any players who had previously won an NBA championship, and the first since 2015 that no players on the winning team had prior NBA Finals experience. The Suns' Jae Crowder was the only player in the series who previously played in the Finals, making it just the second time since the first Finals that fewer than two players had previously appeared in the championship series; no players had previously played in the Finals in the 1977 series.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Impact of COVID-19[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2020\u201321 NBA season \u00a7\u00a0Regular season, and 2021 NBA playoffs\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic impacted the NBA for the second straight year. The regular season was reduced to 72 games for each team, and was held from December 22, 2020, to May 16, 2021.[8] The playoffs started on May 22.[8]\n\n\n\n### Milwaukee Bucks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020\u201321 Milwaukee Bucks season\n\n![](image)The Bucks acquired Jrue Holiday from the New Orleans Pelicans in the offseason.\nThe Bucks finished with the league's best record in the prior two seasons before suffering disappointments in the playoffs. In the offseason, they were at risk of losing two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Award-winner Giannis Antetokounmpo in free agency.[9] To improve their roster, the Bucks acquired guard Jrue Holiday, a highly respected defensive player and an All-Star in 2013, from the New Orleans Pelicans in a four-team trade, surrendering a bounty in starting point guard Eric Bledsoe, George Hill, the rights to R. J. Hampton, and a package of future draft picks.[9][10] Milwaukee later re-signed Antetokounmpo, and had previously re-signed forward Khris Middleton and center Brook Lopez.[9][11][12] The team finished the season with a 46\u201326 record and clinched the 3-seed in the Eastern Conference.[13]\n\n\nIn the first round, the Bucks won in a four-game sweep over sixth-seeded Miami Heat, to whom they had lost in the previous season's conference semifinals.[14] However, Milwaukee lost starting guard Donte DiVincenzo for the season after he tore a ligament in his left ankle in Game 3. A two-way contributor, he was the team's sixth-leading scorer in the regular season, making 38% of his three-point field goals.[15] The Bucks then faced the second-seeded Brooklyn Nets, losing the first two games before winning the series in seven.[10][16] After taking a 2\u20131 lead in the conference finals against the fifth-seeded Atlanta Hawks, Antetokounmpo went down in game four with a hyperextension to his left knee,[17] allowing the Hawks to win game four and tie the series. Despite Antetokounmpo's absence, the Bucks were still able to close out the Hawks in six games behind the timely contributions of Lopez, Middleton, and Holiday to reach the Finals for the first time since 1974.[18]\n\n\nThis marked the first time a team from Milwaukee reached a championship series of the four major North American sports leagues since 1982 when the Brewers made the World Series.\n\n\n\n### Phoenix Suns[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020\u201321 Phoenix Suns season\n\n![](image)The Suns' Chris Paul, acquired from the Oklahoma City Thunder in the offseason, made his first Finals appearance in 16 seasons.\nThe Suns had just a .302 winning percentage in the previous five seasons entering the 2020\u201321 season, which is the worst winning percentage in the five years prior for a team advancing to the final playoff round in any of the four major American professional sports leagues.[19] During the 2020 offseason, Phoenix acquired All-Star Chris Paul from the Oklahoma City Thunder by trading away Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr., and a future first-round draft pick.[20] The Suns, led by Paul, rising star Devin Booker, 2018 first overall pick Deandre Ayton, and second-year head coach Monty Williams, finished the season with a 51\u201321 record as the No. 2 seed, their first winning season since the 2013\u201314 season, and qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2010.[21][22] They also clinched the Pacific division for the first time since 2006\u201307.[23]\n\n\nPhoenix began their playoff run by defeating the seventh-seeded and defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers in the opening round in six games.[24] In the conference semifinals, they swept the third-seeded Denver Nuggets.[25] The Suns then defeated Paul's former team, the fourth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers, in the conference finals in six games, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1993.[26] At 36 years old, Paul made his first Finals appearance after 16 seasons in the league and 10 All-NBA selections.[21]\n\n\nThis marked the first time since 2009 that a team from Phoenix made a championship series from the four major North American sports leagues, since the Arizona Cardinals reached Super Bowl XLIII.\n\n\n\n### Road to the Finals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 NBA playoffs\n\n\n\n| Milwaukee Bucks (Eastern Conference champion) |  | Phoenix Suns (Western Conference champion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Eastern Conference |\n| --- |\n| #

After he opened the third quarter with a jump shot for the first double-digit lead of the game, Paul later scored eight straight points for the Suns and scored 16 overall in the quarter. Phoenix led 88\u201368 with 2:20 remaining in the quarter after Paul passed to Deandre Ayton, who was fouled and made two free throws.[21] In his return from his knee injury, Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo returned and had 20 points, 17 rebounds in limited minutes due to foul trouble,[21] and made a chase-down block of a layup attempt by Mikal Bridges that was reminiscent of \"The Block\" by LeBron James on Andre Iguodala in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals.[27] Antetokounmpo's availability was not confirmed until almost an hour before tip-off, and he played with few signs of injury.[28]\n\n\nMilwaukee pulled to within seven points midway through the fourth quarter, but Paul passed to Booker for a 3-pointer and then stole the ball from the Bucks' Khris Middleton and hit a jumper to extend the lead to 106\u201394. Ayton finished the game with 22 points and 19 rebounds for Phoenix.[21] Middleton scored 29 on 26 shots for the Bucks, but did not attempt a free throw. Teammate Jrue Holiday shot just 4 for 14. Milwaukee center Brook Lopez was targeted on switches by the Suns, and he was on the bench for most of the second half while Antetokounmpo played center.[27]\n\n\nThe Suns had 26 free throw attempts in the game, 10 more than the Bucks.[29] Phoenix made their first 25 free throws and nearly set a record for most free throws in a game without a miss until Jae Crowder missed with 24.8 seconds left in the game. The Suns finished 25 of 26 on their free throws compared to the Bucks' 9 for 16.[29][30][31] The loss by the Bucks marked the third straight series in which they trailed.[10] This marked Phoenix\u2019 first win at home in the Finals since 1976, and the first time they ever held a series lead in the Finals.\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| July 8 9:00pm (6:00pm MST)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Milwaukee Bucks 108, **Phoenix Suns** **118** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **29**\u201326, 16\u2013**30**, **33**\u201332, 30\u201330 |\n| **Pts:** Giannis Antetokounmpo 42**Rebs:** Giannis Antetokounmpo 12**Asts:** Khris Middleton 8 |  | **Pts:** Devin Booker 31**Rebs:** Deandre Ayton 11**Asts:** Chris Paul 8 |\n| ***Phoenix leads series, 2\u20130*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Phoenix Suns Arena, Phoenix, Arizona**Attendance:** 16,583**Referees:**\n* No. 15 Zach Zarba\n* No. 25 Tony Brothers\n* No. 4 Sean Wright\n |\n\n![](image)Devin Booker led the Suns with 31 points, including seven three-pointers.\nBooker scored 31 points and Paul had 23 as the Suns won 118\u2013108 to take a 2\u20130 series lead. Phoenix made 20 of its 40 three-pointers, including seven makes from Booker.[32] Bridges added 27 points and seven rebounds for the Suns,[11] and Paul also had eight assists.[32] Antetokounmpo had 42 points and 12 rebounds for Milwaukee.[32] Phoenix was up 65\u201350 towards the start of the third period, but Antetokounmpo scored 20 points in the quarter, including a stretch of 13 consecutive points for the Bucks, to keep his team in the game.[32][33]\n\n\nThe Bucks outscored the Suns 20\u20130 in the key in the opening period, but Phoenix made eight 3-pointers and trailed just 29\u201326. With less than five minutes remaining in the first half, the game was tied at 41 before Phoenix ended with a 15\u20134 run.[32] On their last possession, the Suns made 10 passes, with every team member touching the ball, culminating in Bridges passing the ball to Ayton, who laid it in while being fouled.[32][11] Phoenix weathered Antetokounmpo's 20-point quarter in the third, when he joined Michael Jordan, Isiah Thomas, and Joe Dumars as the other players to score at least 20 in a quarter during a finals game.[11] Milwaukee cut the lead to six in the fourth quarter, but a 3-pointer by Paul and a basket by Bridges expanded the lead back to double figures,[32] and Booker made three of his 3-point shots to fend off the Bucks.[11]\n\n\nAntetokounmpo had more than twice as many field goals as any other teammate, shooting 15 for 22 from the field, and 11 for 18 from the free-throw line.[11] Holiday scored 17 for Milwaukee on just 7-for-21 shooting, and Middleton had 11 points but was 5 for 16.[32] Crowder bounced back from an 0-for-8 shooting performance in Game 1 with 11 points and 10 rebounds for Phoenix.[32]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| July 11 8:00pm (7:00pm CDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Phoenix Suns 100, **Milwaukee Bucks** **120** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **28**\u201325, 17\u2013**35**, 31\u2013**38**, **24**\u201322 |\n| **Pts:** Chris Paul 19**Rebs:** Deandre Ayton 9**Asts:** Chris Paul 9 |  | **Pts:** Giannis Antetokounmpo 41**Rebs:** Giannis Antetokounmpo 13**Asts:** Jrue Holiday 9 |\n| ***Phoenix leads series, 2\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Fiserv Forum, Milwaukee, Wisconsin**Attendance:** 16,637**Referees:**\n* No. 48 Scott Foster\n* No. 42 Eric Lewis\n* No. 60 James Williams\n |\n\nAntetokounmpo had 41 points, 13 rebounds and six assists, and Milwaukee won 120\u2013100 at home to cut Phoenix's series lead to 2\u20131.

However, he was limited by foul trouble the rest of the game. Milwaukee took control of the contest with a 30\u20139 run to end the first half and a 16\u20130 finish to the third quarter. The Suns pulled to within 74\u201370 in the third after outscoring the Bucks 14\u20135, but Milwaukee closed out the quarter with a 24\u20136 scoring run to lead 98\u201376.[35][36] The Bucks were 14 of 36 from three-point range for the game after making just 5 of 18 in the first half.[34] They limited Phoenix to just nine 3-pointers,[35] though Crowder was 6-of-7 from behind the arc and scored 18 points.[37]\u2009 The Bucks also outscored the Suns 54\u201340 in the paint,[34] and all 14 of Antetokounmpo's field goals were within 5 feet (1.5\u00a0m) of the basket.[36]\n\n\nAntetokounmpo became the second player to have consecutive Finals games with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds, joining Shaquille O'Neal in 2000.[38] He also posted his 11th game in the playoffs with at least 30 points and 10 rebounds, passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's team mark set in 1974 for most in one postseason.[35] Antetokounmpo was an improved 13 of 17 on his free throws, as Bucks fans chanted \"M-V-P\", compared to fans on the road mocking him with a sped-up timer count,[34][39] as his lengthy deliberate free throw routine could take longer than the league's 10-second rule to shoot which would result in a violation.[40]\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| July 14 9:00pm (8:00pm CDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Phoenix Suns 103, **Milwaukee Bucks** **109** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **23**\u201320, 29\u2013**32**, **30**\u201324, 21\u2013**33** |\n| **Pts:** Devin Booker 42**Rebs:** Deandre Ayton 17**Asts:** Chris Paul 7 |  | **Pts:** Khris Middleton 40**Rebs:** Giannis Antetokounmpo 14**Asts:** Giannis Antetokounmpo 8 |\n| ***Series tied, 2\u20132*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Fiserv Forum, Milwaukee, Wisconsin**Attendance:** 16,911**Referees:**\n* No. 19 James Capers\n* No. 16 David Guthrie\n* No. 61 Courtney Kirkland\n |\n\n![](image)Khris Middleton scored 40 points, including 10 straight in the closing minutes of the game.[41]\nMiddleton scored 40 points, including 10 straight for Milwaukee in the closing moments, and the Bucks won 109\u2013103 to tie the series 2\u20132. Booker rebounded from his Game 3 struggles to score a game-high 42 points, but his playing time was restricted late by foul trouble.[41] The Suns led for 37:55 of the first 44 minutes of the game.[42] With 3:42 left in the fourth and the Suns up by three Jrue Holiday attempted a layup and received a great deal of contact from Devin Booker with no call (the play was determined to be a foul by the NBA in the Last 3:30 Report after the game).[43] If Devin Booker had received the foul, it would have been his sixth, resulting in him being ejected and hugely affecting the game. This sparked a lot of controversy online, with the decision to not call the foul being criticised by fans and sports media.[44] They were up two with 2+1\u20442 minutes remaining when Middleton scored the next eight points in the contest.[45][46] He made consecutive midrange jump shots to place Milwaukee up for good at 101\u201399 with 1:28 in the game.[45][46] Jumping off the left leg that he hyperextended two weeks earlier,[45] Antetokounmpo blocked a potential game-tying alley-oop by Ayton with 1:14 left,[41][46] prompting fans and media to debate the play's standing among the greatest blocks of all-time.[47] After Paul lost his balance of his own accord and turned over the ball, Holiday picked up the loose ball and Middleton made a fast-break layup and with 27.2 seconds left for a four-point lead.[41][48][49] He capped off his run with four free throws to bring the score to 107\u2013101.[46] The Bucks outscored the Suns 33\u201321 in the fourth quarter.[49] Antetokounmpo finished with 26 points along with 14 rebounds and eight assists.[46]\n\n\nPhoenix made 51.3% of their shots compared to Milwaukee's 40.2%, but they took 19 fewer shots (78\u201397) due to turnovers and offensive rebounds, outperformed by the Bucks 17\u20135 in both.[47][42] The Bucks scored 24 points off turnovers,[47] and their offensive boards led to 19 second-chance points.[42] Crowder scored 15 points for Phoenix, while Paul was held to 10 points on 5\u201313 shooting and committed five turnovers. Holiday scored 13 on just 4 for 20 shooting, but he added seven rebounds, seven assists and only one turnover, while his defense disrupted Paul.[46][48] The Bucks also got 14 points from Lopez and 11 points and nine rebounds from Pat Connaughton.[46] Middleton and Antetokounmpo became the third set of teammates to score 40 or more points in games in the same Finals series, joining Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson with the Los Angeles Lakers (1980) and LeBron James and Kyrie Irving while with the Cleveland Cavaliers (2016).[50]\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| July 17 9:00pm (6:00pm MST)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Milwaukee Bucks** **123**, Phoenix Suns 119\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 21\u2013**37**, **43\u2013**24, **36**\u201329, 23\u2013**29** |\n| **Pts:** Giannis Antetokounmpo 32**Rebs:** Giannis Antetokounmpo 9**Asts:** Jrue Holiday 13 |  | **Pts:** Devin Booker 40**Rebs:** Deandre Ayton 10**Asts:** Chris Paul 11 |\n| ***Milwaukee leads series, 3\u20132*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Footprint Center, Phoenix, Arizona**Attendance:** 16,562**Referees:**\n* No. 8 Marc Davis\n* No. 58 Josh Tiven\n* No. 60 James Williams\n |\n\n![](image)With about 16 seconds remaining, Jrue Holiday stole the ball from Devin Booker and passed it to Giannis Antetokounmpo for an alley-oop.

The Suns were down 10 with 3+1\u20442 minutes left in the game before a basket by Paul cut it to 120\u2013119 with 56 seconds to play.[52] Holiday had 27 points, 13 assists and three steals.[12] Antetokounmpo had 32 points, nine rebounds and six assists, and Middleton finished with 29 points.[52] Booker had a game-high 40 points,[51] his second-straight contest with at least 40.[52]\n\n\nPhoenix made 14 of 19 shots in the first quarter, including a stretch of 11 straight makes,[51] and led 37\u201321 after the first period.[52] However, Milwaukee outscored them 21\u20135 to open the second quarter, tying the game at 42 on a 3-pointer by Connaughton with 7:48 left in the half.[52] Holiday scored 14 in the quarter,[52] when the Bucks scored a record 43 points in a quarter by a road team in the Finals, and they led 64\u201361 at halftime.[51] After three quarters, the Bucks had made 62.1% of their shots, rivaling Orlando's single-game Finals record of 62.5% in Game 3 of the 2009 finals against the Lakers. Milwaukee led 108\u201394 after a basket by Holiday with about nine minutes remaining in the game, but the Suns mounted their comeback to pull within one in the final minute.[52] After a Holiday miss, Booker rebounded the ball and dribbled it upcourt himself. He stopped and pivoted in the paint, when Holiday forcefully pulled the ball from his hands for the steal.[53][54] After initially intending to run down the clock,[55] Holiday instead passed it for the dunk by Antetokounmpo, who was begging for the ball.[53][54] Fouled on the play by Paul, Antetokounmpo missed the free throw,[52] making just 4 of 11 in the game.[55] However, he volleyed the ball for an offensive rebound by Middleton, who made one of two free throws for the final score of the game.[54]\n\n\nMilwaukee became the first team in the series to win on the road.[51] Antetokounmpo, Holiday and Middleton combined for 88 points, becoming the fifth trio to each score 25 points on 50% shooting in a single Finals game, and the first to accomplish the feat since the Lakers' Abdul-Jabbar (36 points), James Worthy (33), and Magic Johnson (26) in 1985.[56] Phoenix lost three straight games for only the second time in the season, the first occurring six months earlier.[55] Paul ended the game with 21 points, 11 assists and one turnover,[54] while Ayton finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds. Booker became the first player in the Finals to score at least 40 in consecutive games and lose both.[53] Antetokounmpo and him were the first pair of players to score 40+ twice in the same Finals.[56] Bucks' role player Thanasis Antetokounmpo, the older brother of Giannis, and assistant coach Josh Oppenheimer were away from the team due to COVID-19 health and safety protocols. The NBA also replaced referee Sean Wright after he entered health and safety protocols.[51]\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| July 20 9:00pm (8:00pm CDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Phoenix Suns 98, **Milwaukee Bucks** **105** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 16\u2013**29**, **31**\u201313, 30\u2013**35**, 21\u2013**28** |\n| **Pts:** Chris Paul 26**Rebs:** Jae Crowder 13**Asts:** Booker, Paul 5 each |  | **Pts:** Giannis Antetokounmpo 50**Rebs:** Giannis Antetokounmpo 14**Asts:** Jrue Holiday 11 |\n| ***Milwaukee wins NBA Finals, 4\u20132*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Fiserv Forum, Milwaukee, Wisconsin**Attendance:** 17,397**Referees:**\n* No. 48 Scott Foster\n* No. 42 Eric Lewis\n* No. 25 Tony Brothers\n |\n\n![](image)Giannis Antetokounmpo was named the Finals MVP, scoring 50 points in Game 6.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo scored a playoff career-high 50 points and added 14 rebounds and five blocks to lead the Bucks to a 105\u201398 victory to win the series in six games.[10] The 50 points tied a Finals record for the most scored by a player in a series-clinching game, set by Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks in 1958.[57][58] After his dominant performance in the series, including his third game with at least 40 points and 10 rebounds, Antetokounmpo was named the Finals MVP,[59] the youngest winner at age 26 since Kawhi Leonard (22) in 2014.[60] Antetokounmpo made 16 of his 25 shots, and was a surprising 17 for 19 on his free throws after hitting just 55.6% in the playoffs. The game was tied at 77 after three quarters before he scored 13 in the final period to lead Milwaukee to its first championship since 1971, when they were led by Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson. Paul led the Suns with 26 points.[59]\n\n\nMiddleton scored 17 and reserve Bobby Portis added 16 for the Bucks. Holiday had 12 points, 11 assists and nine rebounds. His defense helped limit Booker to 19 points on just 8-for-22 shooting, missing all seven of his 3-point attempts. Milwaukee became the fifth team (after the 1969 Boston Celtics, 1977 Portland Trail Blazers, 2006 Miami Heat, and 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers)[*citation needed*] to come back from a 2\u20130 deficit in the Finals, and the first to do so by winning the next four games since Miami defeated Dallas in 2006.[59] They also became the second team in NBA history to come back from down 2\u20130 twice in the same playoffs after the 2020\u201321 Los Angeles Clippers also did so in consecutive rounds.[61][62] The Suns have won two games in each of their three Finals appearances.[59] Paul became the first player in NBA playoff history to lose four series in which his team led 2\u20130.[63]\n\n\n\n\n## Rosters[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2020\u201321 Milwaukee Bucks roster\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| F | 34 | Antetokounmpo, Giannis\u00a0(C)\n | 6\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in (2.11\u00a0m)\n | 242\u00a0lb (110\u00a0kg)\n | 1994-12-06\n | Greece |\n| F | 43 | Antetokounmpo, Thanasis | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 219\u00a0lb (99\u00a0kg)\n | 1992-07-18\n | Greece |\n| G | 3 | Bryant, Elijah | 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m)\n | 210\u00a0lb (95\u00a0kg)\n | 1995-04-19\n | BYU |\n| G | 24 | Connaughton, Pat | 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m)\n | 209\u00a0lb (95\u00a0kg)\n | 1993-01-06\n | Notre Dame |\n| F | 25 | Diakite, Mamadi | 6\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.06\u00a0m)\n | 228\u00a0lb (103\u00a0kg)\n | 1997-01-21\n | Virginia |\n| G | 0 | DiVincenzo, Donte\u00a0![Injured](image) | 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m)\n | 203\u00a0lb (92\u00a0kg)\n | 1997-01-31\n | Villanova |\n| G | 7 | Forbes, Bryn | 6\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in (1.88\u00a0m)\n | 205\u00a0lb (93\u00a0kg)\n | 1993-07-23\n | Michigan State |\n| G | 21 | Holiday, Jrue | 6\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in (1.91\u00a0m)\n | 205\u00a0lb (93\u00a0kg)\n | 1990-06-12\n | UCLA |\n| F | 44 | Jackson, Justin\u00a0(TW)\n | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 220\u00a0lb (100\u00a0kg)\n | 1995-03-28\n | North Carolina |\n| C | 11 | Lopez, Brook | 7\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (2.13\u00a0m)\n | 282\u00a0lb (128\u00a0kg)\n | 1988-04-01\n | Stanford |\n| G | 15 | Merrill, Sam | 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m)\n | 205\u00a0lb (93\u00a0kg)\n | 1996-05-15\n | Utah State |\n| F | 22 | Middleton, Khris\u00a0(C)\n | 6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.01\u00a0m)\n | 222\u00a0lb (101\u00a0kg)\n | 1991-08-12\n | Texas A&M |\n| F | 13 | Nwora, Jordan | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 225\u00a0lb (102\u00a0kg)\n | 1998-09-09\n | Louisville |\n| F | 9 | Portis, Bobby | 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m)\n | 250\u00a0lb (113\u00a0kg)\n | 1995-02-10\n | Arkansas |\n| G | 5 | Teague, Jeff | 6\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in (1.91\u00a0m)\n | 195\u00a0lb (88\u00a0kg)\n | 1988-06-10\n | Wake Forest |\n| G/F | 66 | Toupane, Axel\u00a0(TW)\n | 6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in (2.01\u00a0m)\n | 210\u00a0lb (95\u00a0kg)\n | 1992-07-23\n | France |\n| F | 17 | Tucker, P.

In this best-of-seven playoff series, the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat, 4\u20132, winning their first NBA championship in ten years. It was the franchise's 17th title overall, tying the Boston Celtics for the most in league history.[1] The Lakers' LeBron James was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the fourth time in his career. He became the first player in league history to be named Finals MVP with three different franchises (two with the Heat, one with the Cleveland Cavaliers and one with the Lakers) and along with teammate Danny Green, jointly the third players to win the NBA Finals with three different teams.[2] Lakers president Jeanie Buss became the first female controlling owner to guide her team to an NBA title.[3][4]\n\n\nThe Lakers were the No. 1 seed in the West, while the Heat were No. 5 in the East, becoming the third-lowest seed to advance to the Finals. This was the first NBA Finals matchup between the two teams, and the first time that Finals participants had both missed the playoffs in the previous season.[5][6] James had previously played with Miami under Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra, winning back-to-back NBA titles in 2012 and 2013 in four consecutive Finals appearances from 2011 to 2014, while Heat president Pat Riley was head coach of the \"Showtime\"-era Lakers from 1981 to 1990, leading them to four NBA titles in seven Finals appearances. For the first time in six seasons, the Golden State Warriors were not in the Finals.[7]\n\n\nThe Finals were originally scheduled for June,[8] but the season was suspended in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[9] The NBA and its players later approved a plan to restart the season in late July, setting up the NBA Bubble at Walt Disney World to protect teams from the virus.[10][11] The games were played in the Bubble behind closed doors at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Bay Lake, Florida, with the Finals being played from September 30 through October 11. The Finals marked the conclusion of the NBA Bubble, which recorded no COVID-19 cases for the participating teams.[12] The 2020 Finals was the latest to begin (beating the 1999 edition which began on June 16) and the first one played in September and October, and as well held in the fall.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Season suspension and restart[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season and 2020 NBA Bubble\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the NBA announced the suspension of the 2019\u201320 season following a report that Utah Jazz All-Star center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19 just hours before the Jazz road game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.[13] On June 4, the NBA Board of Governors approved 29\u20131 (the Portland Trail Blazers were the lone dissenter) resuming the 2019\u201320 season at Walt Disney World. The National Basketball Players Association approved the plan a day later.[11] Under the plan, thirteen Western Conference teams and nine Eastern Conference teams, which include all clubs within six games of a playoff spot, played eight regular-season \"seeding\" games. A possible play-in tournament for the eighth seed in each conference would then be held if the ninth seed finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed (this play-in tournament was used in the Western conference only). The 2020 NBA playoffs were then played as a conventional post-season tournament.[10]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019\u201320 Miami Heat season\n\n![](image)Jimmy Butler was traded to Miami in the offseason.\nDuring the off-season, the Heat agreed to a four-way trade with the Los Angeles Clippers, Portland Trail Blazers, and the Philadelphia 76ers to acquire All-Star small forward Jimmy Butler from the 76ers.[14]\n\n\nMiami began the season with two undrafted players in their starting lineup, Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson.[15] In his first season with the Heat, Butler was named an All-Star for the fifth time in his career, and Bam Adebayo received his first selection, giving Miami two players in an All-Star Game for the first time since Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade in the 2015\u201316 season.[16] Before the season was suspended, the Heat clinched both their first playoff berth and Southeast Division title since the 2017\u201318 season.[17] After the season resumed, they earned the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference.[18] The Heat swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the playoffs, upset the No. 1 seed Milwaukee Bucks in five games in the Eastern Conference semifinals, and defeated the 3rd-seed Boston Celtics in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals to become the first fifth-seeded team to reach the NBA Finals.[19] Only three other times had a lower seed reached the Finals: the Houston Rockets at No. 6 in 1981 and 1995, and the No. 8 New York Knicks in 1999.[20]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019\u201320 Los Angeles Lakers season\n\n![](image)The Lakers traded for Anthony Davis from New Orleans in the offseason.\nThe Lakers were coming off of a disappointing season in 2018\u201319 in which they extended their playoff drought which began in 2014.[21] Their major free agent acquisition, LeBron James, suffered the first major injury in his career, and he missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005.[22] On the final day of the season, Magic Johnson resigned as president of basketball operations,[23] and head coach Luke Walton and the team mutually agreed to part ways a few days later.[24] During the offseason, general manager Rob Pelinka hired Frank Vogel as the Lakers' new head coach,[25] and he acquired six-time All-Star power forward Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans in a three-way trade that also included the Washington Wizards.[26][27] Pelinka was promoted to vice president of basketball operations in January 2020, while still retaining his GM role.[27] Later in the month, legendary former Lakers guard Kobe Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash along with his daughter Gianna and seven others. The Lakers dedicated the season to him.[28]\n\n\nThe Lakers clinched their first playoff berth since the 2012\u201313 season in March 2020, days before the season was suspended.[29][30] It ended the longest drought in the franchise's history.[30] After play resumed in the bubble, the Lakers clinched both their first Pacific Division title since 2012 and the top seed in the Western Conference playoffs for the first time since the 2009\u201310 season.[31] James and Davis were runner-ups for the NBA Most Valuable Player and NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award, respectively, behind Giannis Antetokounmpo, and both were named to the All-NBA First Team.[32]\n\n\nThe Lakers needed five games each to defeat the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs, the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals, and the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals.[33][34][35] The Lakers reached the Finals for the first time since 2010, while James was making his ninth trip in 10 seasons.[36]\n\n\n\n### Road to the Finals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 NBA playoffs\n\n\n\n| Miami Heat (Eastern Conference champion) |  | Los Angeles Lakers (Western Conference champion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Eastern Conference |\n| --- |\n| #

They made 13 of their first 20 three-point field goals in the game before cooling off and missing 16 of their last 18.[37]\n\n\nMiami's Jimmy Butler twisted his left ankle before the end of the first half, but he remained in the game and finished with 23 points.[38] Heat guard Goran Dragi\u0107 did not play in the second half due to a foot injury.[37] Miami center Bam Adebayo also did not finish the game after exiting in the third quarter with a shoulder injury.[37][38] Dwight Howard remained as the Lakers' starting center after he moved into the starting lineup for the last few games of the conference finals against Denver.[39]\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| October 2 9:00\u00a0pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Box score\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Miami Heat 114, **Los Angeles Lakers** **124** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 23\u2013**29**, 31\u2013**39**, **39**\u201335, 21\u201321 |\n| **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 25**Rebs:** Kelly Olynyk 9**Asts:** Jimmy Butler 13 |  | **Pts:** LeBron James 33**Rebs:** Anthony Davis 14**Asts:** Rajon Rondo 10 |\n| ***Los Angeles leads series, 2\u20130*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| AdventHealth Arena, Bay Lake, Florida**Referees:**\n* No. 19 James Capers\n* No. 16 David Guthrie\n* No. 42 Eric Lewis\n |\n\nJames scored 33 points and Davis added 32, leading the Lakers to a 2\u20130 series lead with a 124\u2013114 win over the Heat. James and Davis became the first pair of Lakers teammates to each score 30 points in a Finals game since Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal in Game 3 of the 2002 NBA Finals.[40] The team shot 51% for the game and made 22 of their first 25 two-point field goals, including a stretch of 16 straight towards the end of the first period through late in the third.[40][41] Davis made 14 of his first 15 shots.[40] Miami played short-handed without their injured starters Adebayo (neck and left shoulder) and Dragi\u0107 (torn left plantar fascia).[41]\n\n\nThe Lakers led by six points after the first quarter even though they made just three of 12 three-point attempts.[40] Trailing by 14 at the half, the Heat scored 39 points in the third period but still were down 10 entering the fourth.[41] They never got closer than 10 in the final period.[40] Rajon Rondo had 16 points, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Kyle Kuzma also added 11 for the Lakers.[41] The Lakers made 16 out of a season-high 47 three-pointers.[41] Their starters made just seven of 28 with Caldwell-Pope and Danny Green combining to make three of 19. The team made 66% of its two-point attempts.[40]\n\n\nMiami was led by Butler with 25 points and Kelly Olynyk with 24 off the bench.[40] Tyler Herro and Meyers Leonard replaced Dragi\u0107 and Adebayo in the starting lineup. Herro became the youngest player to start an NBA Finals game at 20 years, 256 days. He was eight days younger than Magic Johnson was when he started Game 1 for the Lakers in 1980 against the Philadelphia 76ers.[41]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| October 4 7:30\u00a0pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Box score\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Los Angeles Lakers 104, **Miami Heat** **115** |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 23\u2013**26**, 31\u2013**32**, 26\u2013**27**, 24\u2013**30** |\n| **Pts:** LeBron James 25**Rebs:** LeBron James 10**Asts:** LeBron James 8 |  | **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 40**Rebs:** Jimmy Butler 11**Asts:** Jimmy Butler 13 |\n| ***Los Angeles leads series, 2\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| AdventHealth Arena, Bay Lake, Florida**Referees:**\n* No. 48 Scott Foster\n* No. 25 Tony Brothers\n* No. 26 Pat Fraher\n |\n\nButler finished with 40 points, 11 rebounds and 13 assists for a triple-double to lead Miami to a 115\u2013104 win as Heat starters Adebayo and Dragi\u0107 remained sidelined.[42] Miami led for most of the game.[43] At multiple points, they looked to be taking control of the game, but the Lakers would answer. The Heat led by 13 in the first quarter before the Lakers rallied to take the lead five minutes later. Miami began the second half with a 10\u20130 run to lead by 14, but Los Angeles responded with eight straight points. The Heat were up 12 late in the third quarter before the Lakers outscored them 20\u20136 to regain the lead 91\u201389 with 8:55 remaining in the game.[42] However, the Heat outscored the Lakers 26\u201313 to finish the game and cut the Lakers' lead to 2\u20131.[44]\n\n\nButler became the third player in Finals history to record a 40+ point triple-double, joining James (then with the Cleveland Cavaliers) in 2015 and Jerry West with the Lakers in 1969.[45] Butler also became the first player to have more points, rebounds and assists in a Finals game than James, who finished with 25 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. Davis, who was in foul trouble early, was held to just 15 points and five rebounds.[43] The Lakers committed 20 turnovers, which led to 21 points for the Heat.[43] Los Angeles had 10 turnovers in the first quarter, the most of any team in the league during the season in the first period,[42] including eight combined by James and Davis, who ended the game with eight and five turnovers, respectively.[43] Herro and Olynyk both scored 17 points for Miami, while Kyle Kuzma and Markieff Morris both had 19 points off the bench for the Lakers. Miami's starters outscored the Lakers' starters 89\u201351.[42]\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| October 6 9:00\u00a0pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Box score\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Los Angeles Lakers** **102**, Miami Heat 96\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **27**\u201322, 22\u2013**25**, **26**\u201323, **27**\u201326 |\n| **Pts:** LeBron James 28**Rebs:** LeBron James 12**Asts:** LeBron James 8 |  | **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 22**Rebs:** Jimmy Butler 10**Asts:** Jimmy Butler 9 |\n| ***Los Angeles leads series, 3\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| AdventHealth Arena, Bay Lake, Florida**Referees:**\n* No. 15 Zach Zarba\n* No. 30 John Goble\n* No. 6 Tony Brown\n |\n\nDavis made a 3-pointer with 39.5 seconds remaining to give the Lakers a nine-point lead and securing the game en route to a 102\u201396 win and a 3\u20131 lead over the Heat.[46] James had 28 points, eight assists and 12 rebounds, while Davis finished with 22 points, four assists and nine rebounds. Los Angeles was sloppy again with nine first-half turnovers, including five by James alone.[47] With 8:18 remaining in the third quarter, James made a 3-pointer which put the Lakers ahead 55\u201354. The Lakers did not trail for the final 20 minutes, though Miami would remain close throughout.[46][47] With 3:05 left in the game, Butler shot a corner 3-pointer that rimmed out which would have given the Heat the lead. Seven seconds later, Caldwell-Pope made a corner 3 to give the Lakers a 93\u201388 lead. Miami then committed a shot-clock violation, and Caldwell-Pope drove for a basket for a seven-point lead.[46]\n\n\nCaldwell-Pope contributed 15 points and Green scored 10 for the Lakers.[46] Butler ended with 22 points, nine assists and 10 rebounds for the Heat. He made his first five shots for 11 points in the first quarter but did not make another field goal until the fourth quarter while being guarded by Davis and James.[47] Herro had 21 points, Duncan Robinson scored 17 and Adebayo added 15 for the Heat after missing two games.[46]\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| October 9 9:00\u00a0pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Box score\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Miami Heat** **111**, Los Angeles Lakers 108\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **25**\u201324, **35**\u201332, **28**\u201326, 23\u2013**26** |\n| **Pts:** Jimmy Butler 35**Rebs:** Jimmy Butler 12**Asts:** Jimmy Butler 11 |  | **Pts:** LeBron James 40**Rebs:** LeBron James 13**Asts:** LeBron James 7 |\n| ***Los Angeles leads series, 3\u20132*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| AdventHealth Arena, Bay Lake, Florida**Referees:**\n* No. 8 Marc Davis\n* No. 5 Kane Fitzgerald\n* No. 42 Eric Lewis\n |\n\nButler had 35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists to lead Miami to a 111\u2013108 win and stave off elimination, bringing the series to 3\u20132. The Heat weathered a dominant performance by James, who ended with 40 points on just 21 shots, 13 rebounds and seven assists.[48] With the Lakers down by one and 18.8 seconds remaining in the game, James drove into the paint, where he was surrounded by Butler and Robinson with a third defender also approaching. James passed to a wide-open Green at the top of the key, but Green missed a 3-pointer with 7.1 seconds left.[49] Morris got the offensive rebound, pump-faked, but then threw the ball out of bounds with 2.2 seconds remaining in an attempt to get the ball to Davis under the basket.[49][50]\n\n\nWith 48 seconds left in the first quarter, Davis was kicked by Miami's Andre Iguodala in his right heel, which aggravated a contusion he received in the conference finals. After lying on the floor for minutes, Davis exited the game and began the second quarter on the bench, which helped the Heat amass a 11-point lead. The Lakers drew close to make it 60\u201356 at the half. Caldwell-Pope, who scored 16 points, made a 3-pointer to give the Lakers the lead in the fourth quarter.[49] With 3:13 remaining, Robinson made a three-pointer to give the Heat a two-point lead, which began a run of either a tie or a lead change on the game's next nine scoring possessions,[51] including six straight where James and Butler traded scores.[52]\n\n\nRobinson ended with 26 points, including seven 3-pointers, which broke Gary Neal's record set in 2013 for most 3's by an undrafted player in the Finals.[53] Butler was exhausted towards the end, having rested just 48 seconds all game while also guarding James and sometimes Davis on defense.[54] He became the second player with multiple 30-point triple-doubles in the same Finals series, joining James in 2015.[53] Butler was the sixth player with multiple triple-doubles in the same Finals series along with James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain and Draymond Green.[51] He also became the first with 35 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists and five steals in a Finals game, and he was just the second NBA player to reach those marks in the playoffs, joining Gary Payton in 2000.[53] Davis scored 28 points and added 12 rebounds for the Lakers.[49] By the end of the game, he was noticeably limping after another tumble around the basket.[50][54] He and James scored 68 of the team's 108 points.[48] They combined to shoot 24 for 36, while the other Lakers were 14 for 46.[51]\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| October 11 7:30\u00a0pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Box score\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Los Angeles Lakers** **106**, Miami Heat 93\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **28**\u201320, **36**\u201316, **23**\u201322, 19\u2013**35** |\n| **Pts:** LeBron James 28**Rebs:** Anthony Davis 15**Asts:** LeBron James 10 |  | **Pts:** Bam Adebayo 25**Rebs:** Bam Adebayo 10**Asts:** Jimmy Butler 8 |\n| ***Los Angeles wins NBA Finals, 4\u20132*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| AdventHealth Arena, Bay Lake, Florida**Referees:**\n* No. 19 James Capers\n* No. 25 Tony Brothers\n* No. 16 David Guthrie\n |\n\n![](image)LeBron James was named Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.\nJames had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists to lead the Lakers to a 106\u201393 win for their 17th league championship in franchise history and first since 2010. James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.[55] Winning the fourth championship of his career,[55] he became the only player in NBA history to have been named Finals MVP with three different franchises. He won the award in a unanimous 11\u20130 vote.[56]\n\n\nLakers head coach Frank Vogel decided to start with a smaller, quicker lineup, inserting guard Alex Caruso for Howard and moving Davis to center.[1] Los Angeles never trailed in the game and ended the first quarter ahead 28\u201320.[15] They outscored Miami 36\u201316 in the second period and led by as many as 30 points in the first half.[1] The Lakers' 64\u201336 halftime lead was the second-largest margin at halftime in Finals history, behind a 30-point lead by Boston over the Lakers in Game 1 in 1985.[15] The Lakers also became the first NBA team to be undefeated in a season when leading entering the fourth quarter, going a combined 57\u20130 in the regular season and playoffs.[1]\n\n\nDavis had 19 points and 15 rebounds. Adebayo led Miami with 25 points and 10 rebounds.[15] Butler was held to only 12 points,[1] but added eight assists and seven rebounds. Dragi\u0107, who returned from his Game 1 injury, had five points off the bench on 2-of-8 shooting along with five rebounds in 19 minutes.[15]\n\n\nJames ended the series averaging 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game.[56] He and Davis became the first teammates in NBA history to both average 25 points and shoot 50% from the field in the same postseason.[57] Butler became only the second player in a Finals series to lead his team outright in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks, joining James in 2016 with the Cavaliers.[15]\n\n\nWith the Dodgers winning the World Series later in the month, Los Angeles repeated its achievement of having NBA and World Series champions in the same year, as both the Lakers and Dodgers had won in 1988. \n\n\n\n\n## Rosters[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2019\u201320 Los Angeles Lakers roster\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| F | 37 | Antetokounmpo, Kostas\u00a0(TW)\n | 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m)\n | 200\u00a0lb (91\u00a0kg)\n | 1997\u201311\u201320\n | Dayton |\n| G | 11 | Bradley, Avery\u00a0(L)\n | 6\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in (1.91\u00a0m)\n | 180\u00a0lb (82\u00a0kg)\n | 1990\u201311\u201326\n | Texas |\n| F | 12 | Cacok, Devontae\u00a0(TW)\n | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 240\u00a0lb (109\u00a0kg)\n | 1996\u201310\u201308\n | UNC Wilmington |\n| G | 1 | Caldwell-Pope, Kentavious | 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m)\n | 204\u00a0lb (93\u00a0kg)\n | 1993\u201302\u201318\n | Georgia |\n| G | 4 | Caruso, Alex | 6\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in (1.96\u00a0m)\n | 186\u00a0lb (84\u00a0kg)\n | 1994\u201302\u201328\n | Texas A&M |\n| G | 2 | Cook, Quinn | 6\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in (1.85\u00a0m)\n | 180\u00a0lb (82\u00a0kg)\n | 1993\u201303\u201323\n | Duke |\n| F/C | 3 | Davis, Anthony | 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m)\n | 253\u00a0lb (115\u00a0kg)\n | 1993\u201303\u201311\n | Kentucky |\n| F | 10 | Dudley, Jared | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 237\u00a0lb (108\u00a0kg)\n | 1985\u201307\u201310\n | Boston College |\n| G/F | 14 | Green, Danny | 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in (1.98\u00a0m)\n | 215\u00a0lb (98\u00a0kg)\n | 1987\u201306\u201322\n | North Carolina |\n| G | 5 | Horton-Tucker, Talen | 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m)\n | 234\u00a0lb (106\u00a0kg)\n | 2000\u201311\u201325\n | Iowa State |\n| C | 39 | Howard, Dwight | 6\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.08\u00a0m)\n | 265\u00a0lb (120\u00a0kg)\n | 1985\u201312\u201308\n | SW Atlanta Academy (GA) |\n| F | 23 | James, LeBron\u00a0(C)\n | 6\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.06\u00a0m)\n | 250\u00a0lb (113\u00a0kg)\n | 1984\u201312\u201330\n | St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary HS (OH) |\n| F | 0 | Kuzma, Kyle | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 221\u00a0lb (100\u00a0kg)\n | 1995\u201307\u201324\n | Utah |\n| C | 7 | McGee, JaVale | 7\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (2.13\u00a0m)\n | 270\u00a0lb (122\u00a0kg)\n | 1988\u201301\u201319\n | Nevada |\n| F | 88 | Morris, Markieff | 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in (2.03\u00a0m)\n | 245\u00a0lb (111\u00a0kg)\n | 1989\u201309\u201302\n | Kansas |\n| G | 9 | Rondo, Rajon | 6\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in (1.85\u00a0m)\n | 180\u00a0lb (82\u00a0kg)\n | 1986\u201302\u201322\n | Kentucky |\n| G/F | 21 | Smith, J.

After spending the past 11 Finals as a sideline reporter on television, Doris Burke joined the ESPN Radio commentary team, which included Marc Kestecher and Jon Barry, making her first woman to call the NBA Finals on the radio.[63]\n\n\nGame 5 of the Finals was the first NBA game to be aired on China Central Television (CCTV) in China since the disagreement between the NBA and that country over the Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweet in support of the Hong Kong anti-government protesters. NBA games had remained available for streaming on Tencent.[64]\n\n\n\n### Viewership[edit]\n\n\nSee also: NBA Finals television ratings\n\nThe 2020 NBA Finals continued the trend of declining viewership, with 7.41\u00a0million people watching Game 1, making it the lowest rated and least-watched NBA Finals game on record (tracking viewership started in 1988).[65][66] It aired opposite two Major League Baseball playoff games.[67] The drop followed the shift in other sporting events rescheduled from their traditional times of year, such as the Stanley Cup Finals, the Kentucky Derby, the U.S. Open and the Indianapolis 500.[68] The viewership further declined to a new record low of 6.609\u00a0million for Game 2.[69] Despite the lows, both Game 1 and Game 2 were the most watched program for their respective days.[67] Game 3, which aired opposite NBC's *Sunday Night Football* coverage, had its viewership continue to decrease to a new record low of approximately 5.94\u00a0million.[67]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(American households)\n | American audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 4.1 | 7.41 | [68] |\n| 2\n | 3.6 | 6.61 | [70] |\n| 3\n | 3.1 | 5.94 | [70] |\n| 4\n | 4.4 | 7.54 | [71] |\n| 5\n | 4.8 | 8.89 | [72] |\n| 6\n | 4.2 | 8.29 | [73] |\n| Avg | 4.0 | 7.45 |  |\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\nThe local victory parade for the Lakers was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[74] Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti stated on October 28, the day after the Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series, that there would be separate public celebrations for both teams, though it was uncertain how mandated social distancing would be addressed.[75]\n\n\nThe Heat would return to the NBA Finals 3 years later in 2023 but were ultimately defeated by the Denver Nuggets in five games. Prior to that the Nuggets had swept the Lakers in the Conference Finals that same year en route to winning their first ever NBA championship.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** McMenamin, Dave (October 11, 2020). \"Los Angeles Lakers lean on defense in dominant Game 6 win vs. Miami Heat, claim first NBA title in a decade\". *ESPN.com*.

In the best-of-seven playoff series held from May 30 through June 13, 2019, the Eastern Conference champion Toronto Raptors defeated the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors, 4\u20132, earning the franchise its first NBA championship as well as the first win by an NBA team based outside the United States. Acquired by the Raptors via a trade during the off-season, Kawhi Leonard was named the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second time in his career.[1]\n\n\nThis was the first NBA Finals appearance for the Raptors, and the league's first finals with games played outside of the United States.[2] Home-court advantage was awarded to Toronto, who finished the regular season with one more win (58\u201324) than Golden State (57\u201325). This was the first time in five consecutive NBA Finals appearances that the then-two-time defending NBA-champion Warriors did not have home-court advantage.[3] This meant that Games 3, 4, and 6 were held in Golden State (the last postseason home games for the Warriors in Oracle Arena) and Games 1, 2, and 5 were in Toronto. Had it been necessary, Game 7 would have been held in Toronto. Also for the first time after the past four postseasons, the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers did not meet in the championship round.[4] This was the first Finals since 2010 not to feature LeBron James, who played in the past eight Finals with the Cavaliers and the Miami Heat.[5]\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, this was the last NBA Finals until 2022 to be played in its traditional June schedule. This also was the last finals until 2023 NBA Finals in which a team made its first trip to the NBA Finals in its franchise history. For the first time in NBA History, two national anthems were performed before the game started, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" for the country of the United States and \"O Canada\" for the country of Canada.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018\u201319 Golden State Warriors season\n\nDuring the off-season, Golden State acquired DeMarcus Cousins, who was recovering from a ruptured left Achilles. He gave the Warriors a true, top-flight center for the first time under head coach Steve Kerr.[6][7] During an overtime loss to the Los Angeles Clippers in November 2018, Draymond Green cursed out teammate Kevin Durant over his upcoming free agency status after the season, and he was suspended for the much-publicized blowup.[8][9][10] In January 2019, Cousins returned, and the Warriors became the first team in 42 years with a starting lineup of five NBA All-Stars from the previous season.[6] The team finished the regular season with a 57\u201325 record, winning the Pacific Division and securing the 1st seed in the Western Conference.[11]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, Golden State defeated the Clippers in six games in the first round, despite blowing leads at home in Games 2 and 5.[10] Cousins tore his left quadriceps in Game 2, and was initially thought to be out for the remainder of the postseason.[12] With an increased urgency and in a sign of respect towards their opponent, Kerr opened the following round against the Houston Rockets by moving Andre Iguodala from the bench and starting the Hamptons Five for the first time in the season.[13][14] With the Splash Brothers\u2014Warriors guards Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson\u2014struggling with their shooting, Durant had been the team's best player in the playoffs, averaging a team-leading 35.4 points entering Game 5.[15] However, Durant left the game late in the third quarter after suffering a strained right calf;[15][16] he was later ruled out indefinitely. Led by Curry and Thompson, Golden State pulled out Game 5 without Durant, and won the series in six games thanks to Stephen Curry's 33-point second half.[16][17] In the Western Conference Finals, Golden State swept the Portland Trail Blazers 4\u20130, with three of the wins including comebacks of 15 points or more.[18][19] After starting nine consecutive games,[3] Iguodala missed the deciding Game 4 with a sore left calf injury from Game 3.[19] Curry averaged a series career-high 36.5 points, the highest average by a player in a four-game sweep in NBA history.[20] This was Golden State's fifth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals, and they were aiming to be the first since the Shaq and Kobe-led Los Angeles Lakers to win 3-peat titles. After losing the Finals to the Raptors, they became the second team to not earn a 3-peat, joining the Miami Heat who lost their quest in 2014 to the San Antonio Spurs who ended their seven-year title drought. They were the second team in NBA history to achieve this feat, joining the Boston Celtics, who played in ten straight Finals (1957\u20131966).[a]\n\n\n\n### Toronto Raptors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018\u201319 Toronto Raptors season\n\n![](image)Game 2 at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, which Golden State won\nDuring the off-season, the Raptors fired coach Dwane Casey, who was named the 2018 NBA Coach of the Year weeks later, and replaced him with assistant coach Nick Nurse. They also traded DeMar DeRozan and Jakob P\u00f6ltl to the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.[10] The move stunned the All-Star DeRozan, who had become a fan favorite in his nine seasons in Toronto.[21][22] It was a risky move for the Raptors and their president, Masai Ujiri, as Leonard was one year away from becoming a free agent,[21] and he wanted to leave the Spurs after playing in just nine games in 2017\u201318 due to tendinopathy in his left quadriceps.[10][22] However, the 2014 NBA Finals MVP made it through the season healthy while being systematically rested for 22 games.[10][22] During the season, Toronto also traded a package that included Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for one of the league's elite post-defenders, Marc Gasol.[10]\n\n\nThe Raptors lost Game 1 of the first round to the Orlando Magic, but then they won the next four games in a row and won the series in five games. After trailing 2\u20131 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference semifinals,[23] they defeated them in seven games, with Leonard hitting the game-winner at the buzzer as the ball bounced four times on the rim before falling in, the first buzzer beater in a Game 7 in the NBA playoffs.[22] Toronto advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals to face the Milwaukee Bucks. Despite trailing 2\u20130, the Raptors won the next four games to advance to the Finals in six games,[21] as Leonard outplayed the Bucks' Giannis Antetokounmpo, who won league MVP that season.[22] This was their first trip to the NBA Finals in franchise history,[24] breaking a 25-year drought for teams from Toronto appearing in the championship round of any of the four major North American professional sports leagues since Major League Baseball's Toronto Blue Jays won the 1993 World Series.[25]\n\n\n\n### Road to the Finals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 NBA playoffs\n\n\n\n| Toronto Raptors (Eastern Conference champion) |  | Golden State Warriors (Western Conference champion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Eastern Conference |\n| --- |\n| # | Team | W | L | PCT | GB | GP |\n| 1 | **z** \u2013 Milwaukee Bucks\u00a0\\* | 60 | 22 | .732 | \u2013 | 82 |\n| 2 | **y** \u2013 Toronto Raptors\u00a0\\* | 58 | 24 | .707 | 2.0 | 82 |\n| 3 | **x** \u2013 Philadelphia 76ers | 51 | 31 | .622 | 9.0 | 82 |\n| 4 | **x** \u2013 Boston Celtics | 49 | 33 | .598 | 11.0 | 82 |\n| 5 | **x** \u2013 Indiana Pacers | 48 | 34 | .585 | 12.0 | 82 |\n| 6 | **x** \u2013 Brooklyn Nets | 42 | 40 | .512 | 18.0 | 82 |\n| 7 | **y** \u2013 Orlando Magic\u00a0\\* | 42 | 40 | .512 | 18.0 | 82 |\n| 8 | **x** \u2013 Detroit Pistons | 41 | 41 | .500 | 19.0 | 82 |\n|  |\n| 9 | Charlotte Hornets | 39 | 43 | .476 | 21.0 | 82 |\n| 10 | Miami Heat | 39 | 43 | .476 | 21.0 | 82 |\n| 11 | Washington Wizards | 32 | 50 | .390 | 28.0 | 82 |\n| 12 | Atlanta Hawks | 29 | 53 | .354 | 31.0 | 82 |\n| 13 | Chicago Bulls | 22 | 60 | .268 | 38.0 | 82 |\n| 14 | Cleveland Cavaliers | 19 | 63 | .232 | 41.0 | 82 |\n| 15 | New York Knicks | 17 | 65 | .207 | 43.0 | 82 |\n\n 2nd seed in the East, 2nd best league record\n | Regular season | \n\n| Western Conference |\n| --- |\n| # | Team | W | L | PCT | GB | GP |\n| 1 | **c** \u2013 Golden State Warriors\u00a0\\* | 57 | 25 | .695 | \u2013 | 82 |\n| 2 | **y** \u2013 Denver Nuggets\u00a0\\* | 54 | 28 | .659 | 3.0 | 82 |\n| 3 | **x** \u2013 Portland Trail Blazers | 53 | 29 | .646 | 4.0 | 82 |\n| 4 | **y** \u2013 Houston Rockets\u00a0\\* | 53 | 29 | .646 | 4.0 | 82 |\n| 5 | **x** \u2013 Utah Jazz | 50 | 32 | .610 | 7.0 | 82 |\n| 6 | **x** \u2013 Oklahoma City Thunder | 49 | 33 | .598 | 8.0 | 82 |\n| 7 | **x** \u2013 San Antonio Spurs | 48 | 34 | .585 | 9.0 | 82 |\n| 8 | **x** \u2013 Los Angeles Clippers | 48 | 34 | .585 | 9.0 | 82 |\n|  |\n| 9 | Sacramento Kings | 39 | 43 | .476 | 18.0 | 82 |\n| 10 | Los Angeles Lakers | 37 | 45 | .451 | 20.0 | 82 |\n| 11 | Minnesota Timberwolves | 36 | 46 | .439 | 21.0 | 82 |\n| 12 | Memphis Grizzlies | 33 | 49 | .402 | 24.0 | 82 |\n| 13 | New Orleans Pelicans | 33 | 49 | .402 | 24.0 | 82 |\n| 14 | Dallas Mavericks | 33 | 49 | .402 | 24.0 | 82 |\n| 15 | Phoenix Suns | 19 | 63 | .232 | 38.0 | 82 |\n\n 1st seed in the West, 3rd best league record\n |\n| Defeated the 7th seeded Orlando Magic, 4\u20131 | First round\n | Defeated the 8th seeded Los Angeles Clippers, 4\u20132 |\n| Defeated the 3rd seeded Philadelphia 76ers, 4\u20133 | Conference Semifinals\n | Defeated the 4th seeded Houston Rockets, 4\u20132 |\n| Defeated the 1st seeded Milwaukee Bucks, 4\u20132 | Conference Finals\n | Defeated the 3rd seeded Portland Trail Blazers, 4\u20130 |\n\n\n### Regular season series[edit]\n\n\nThe Raptors won the regular season series 2\u20130.\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| November 29, 2018\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Golden State Warriors 128, **Toronto Raptors** **131**\u00a0(OT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Scotiabank Arena, Toronto, Ontario\n |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| December 12, 2018\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Recap\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Toronto Raptors** **113**, Golden State Warriors 93\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Oracle Arena, Oakland, California\n |\n\n## Series summary[edit]\n\n\nWinning team in **bold**.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Date\n | Road team\n | Result\n | Home team\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Game 1\n | May 30 | Golden State Warriors | 109\u2013118 (0\u20131) | **Toronto Raptors** |\n| Game 2\n | June 2 | **Golden State Warriors** | 109\u2013104 (1\u20131) | Toronto Raptors\n |\n| Game 3\n | June 5 | **Toronto Raptors** | 123\u2013109 (2\u20131) | Golden State Warriors\n |\n| Game 4\n | June 7 | **Toronto Raptors** | 105\u201392 (3\u20131) | Golden State Warriors\n |\n| Game 5\n | June 10 | **Golden State Warriors** | 106\u2013105 (2\u20133) | Toronto Raptors\n |\n| Game 6\n | June 13 | **Toronto Raptors** | 114\u2013110 (4\u20132) | Golden State Warriors\n |\n\n\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\nTimes listed are Eastern Daylight Time (UTC\u22124).

Cousins returned from a quadriceps injury to come off the bench in his first NBA Finals game.[26] After missing Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals with a left calf injury, Iguodala left near the end of this game after limping and favoring his right leg.[27] Durant, the MVP of the last two NBA Finals, traveled with the team to Toronto, but remained sidelined.[26] This was the only game in the entire series with the home team victorious.\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TSN/CTV 2, RDS, ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 2 8:00 pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Box score\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Golden State Warriors** **109**, Toronto Raptors 104\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 26\u2013**27**, 28\u2013**32**, **34**\u201321, 21\u2013**24** |\n| **Pts:** Klay Thompson 25**Rebs:** Cousins, Green 10 each**Asts:** Draymond Green 9 |  | **Pts:** Kawhi Leonard 34**Rebs:** Kawhi Leonard 14**Asts:** Pascal Siakam 4 |\n| ***Series tied, 1\u20131*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Scotiabank Arena, Toronto, Ontario**Attendance:** 20,014**Referees:**\n* No. 48 Scott Foster\n* No. 25 Tony Brothers\n* No. 14 Ed Malloy\n |\n\n![](image)Kawhi Leonard shooting a free throw in Game 2\nThompson scored a team-high 25 points, and the Warriors outscored the Raptors 18\u20130 to start the second half before holding off a late Toronto rally to win 109\u2013104.[28][29] Thompson had 18 points in the first half to keep Golden State in the game. They trailed by 11 with almost two minutes left until halftime before cutting it to 59\u201354 at the half. The Warriors' 18 unanswered points to begin the second half were the most in NBA Finals history to start a half.[29] Thompson left the game in the fourth quarter with a left hamstring injury after landing awkwardly on a three-point field goal attempt.[28][29] Toronto scored 10 straight points to pull within two points at 106\u2013104, but Iguodala cemented the win with a three-pointer with 5.9 seconds remaining in the game.[29]\n\n\nCurry finished the game with 23 points after missing his first six shots of the game.[28] Cousins, who was moved into the starting lineup, had 11 points, 10 rebounds and six assists, and Draymond Green had 17 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists to fall one assist short of his fourth straight triple-double.[29] Warriors backup center Kevon Looney missed the second half with a chest contusion.[28][29] Leonard led the Raptors with 34 points and 14 rebounds, and Fred VanVleet added 17 points. Game 1 star Siakam scored just 12 points on 5-for-18 shooting. Toronto was held to 37.2 percent shooting for the game.[28]\n\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| SN/Citytv, RDS, ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 5 9:00 pm (6:00 pm PDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Box score\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Toronto Raptors** **123**, Golden State Warriors 109\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **36**\u201329, **24**\u201323, **36**\u201331, **27**\u201326 |\n| **Pts:** Kawhi Leonard 30**Rebs:** Pascal Siakam 9**Asts:** Kyle Lowry 9 |  | **Pts:** Stephen Curry 47**Rebs:** Stephen Curry 8**Asts:** Stephen Curry 7 |\n| ***Raptors leads series, 2-1*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Oracle Arena, Oakland, California**Attendance:** 19,596**Referees:**\n* No. 8 Marc Davis\n* No. 16 David Guthrie\n* No. 5 Kane Fitzgerald\n |\n\nLeonard scored 30 points and the Raptors shot 52.4 percent and made 17 three-pointers to win 123\u2013109 on the road over the short-handed Warriors. Curry scored a playoff career-high 47 points, shooting 14 for 31 including 6 of 14 on 3-pointers,[30] while his teammates totaled 62 points on 36.7 percent shooting.[31] Golden State played without injured starters Thompson and Durant, and backup big man Looney. Toronto's Kyle Lowry had 23 points and five 3-pointers, and Danny Green added 18 points on 6 made 3s, as all five of their starters scored in double figures. VanVleet contributed 11 points off the bench.[30]\n\n\nThompson practiced earlier in the day but did not warm up for the game. Kerr had said that the Warriors were not going to play him if there was risk of further damage.[30] Looney was out with a cartilage fracture near his right collarbone.[30][32]\n\n\nThe game was not without controversy, however, when Warriors investor Mark Stevens pushed Kyle Lowry while attempting to dive for a loose ball, a gesture for which Stevens was banned from attending Warriors games in the future.\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TSN/CTV 2, RDS, ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 7 9:00 pm (6:00 pm PDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Box score\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Toronto Raptors** **105**, Golden State Warriors 92\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** 17\u2013**23**, **25**\u201323, **37**\u201321, **26**\u201325 |\n| **Pts:** Kawhi Leonard 36**Rebs:** Kawhi Leonard 12**Asts:** Kyle Lowry 7 |  | **Pts:** Klay Thompson 28**Rebs:** Draymond Green 9**Asts:** Draymond Green 12 |\n| ***Raptors leads series, 3-1*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Oracle Arena, Oakland, California**Attendance:** 19,596**Referees:**\n* No. 24 Mike Callahan\n* No. 15 Zach Zarba\n* No. 42 Eric Lewis\n |\n\nToronto took a 3\u20131 lead in the series after Leonard scored 36 points and had 12 rebounds in a 105\u201392 road win over Golden State.[33] The Raptors struggled early, falling behind by 11 early in the contest and only scoring 17 points in the opening period,[33] before trailing 46\u201342 at halftime.[34] They outscored the Warriors 37\u201321 in the third quarter, when Leonard scored 17 of his points, and led by as many as 16 in the final quarter.[34] Serge Ibaka scored 20 points for Toronto, shooting 9 for 12 in 22 minutes off the bench. Thompson returned from injury to lead Golden State with 28 points, including six 3-pointers.[33]\n\n\nSiakam added 19 points for the Raptors.[33] VanVleet needed seven stitches in the fourth quarter after the Warriors' Shaun Livingston inadvertently elbowed him in the face.[34] The only other player to score over 10 points for Golden State, Curry had 27 points, but shot just 9 for 22 and missed 7 of his 9 three-point attempts. Looney returned to score 10 points after Kerr initially declared him out for the series following his Game 2 injury.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| SN/Citytv, RDS, ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 10 9:00pm\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Box score\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Golden State Warriors** **106**, Toronto Raptors 105\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **34**\u201328, 28\u201328, 22\u201322, 22\u2013**27** |\n| **Pts:** Stephen Curry 31**Rebs:** Draymond Green 10**Asts:** Draymond Green 8 |  | **Pts:** Kawhi Leonard 26**Rebs:** Kawhi Leonard 12**Asts:** Leonard, Lowry 6 each |\n| ***Raptors lead series, 3-2*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Scotiabank Arena, Toronto, Ontario**Attendance:** 20,144**Referees:**\n* No. 19 James Capers\n* No. 23 Jason Phillips\n* No. 14 Ed Malloy\n |\n\nCurry scored 31 points and Thompson had 26 to help the Warriors stave off elimination with a 106\u2013105 win at Toronto. They combined for three straight 3-pointers after the Raptors led by six points with 3+1\u20442 minutes left in the game.[35] Durant returned after missing the previous nine games with his right calf injury,[35] and scored 11 points in the first quarter.[36] However, he was lost for the game two minutes into the second quarter when he tried to drive by Ibaka and suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon, falling and grabbing his lower right calf. He limped off the court and was helped to the locker room.[36][37] Leonard scored 10 straight points in the fourth quarter to erase Golden State's 14-point lead.[35] Lowry's potential championship-winning, 3-point shot at the buzzer fell short after it was partially blocked by Draymond Green.[35][38]\n\n\nGolden State made 20 three-pointers, the second most in NBA Finals history behind Cleveland's 24 against the Warriors in Game 4 in 2017.[36] Cousins, who did not enter the game until Durant's injury, had 14 points and six rebounds for the Warriors, and Green added 10 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists.[36] Leonard had 26 points for the Raptors, while Lowry added 18 and Gasol 17 to lead six Raptors in double figures.[38] Golden State played most of the second half without Looney, who aggravated his cartilage fracture after colliding with Lowry while battling for a rebound.[36][39]\n\n\nDurant left the arena on crutches and in a walking boot. \"I don't believe there's anybody to blame [for Durant's injury], but I understand in this world, and if you have to, you can blame me,\" said Bob Myers, the Warriors' president of basketball operations.[36] Durant underwent surgery to repair the tendon and was at risk of missing all of the following season.[37] Originally expected to become a free agent after the 2018\u201319 season, he had a $31.5 million option to remain with Golden State for another season,[40] but it was ultimately his last appearance with the Warriors, after a sign-and-trade to the Nets the following month.[41]\n\n\nNurse was criticized for calling a timeout with Toronto up 103\u201397 after going on a 12\u20132 run; the Splash Brothers' three 3-pointers came after the break.[42][43] In its Last Two Minutes report, the NBA stated that Cousins should have been called for a shooting foul on Gasol with 49 seconds left in the game, which would have given Gasol two free throws with the Raptors trailing 106\u2013103 at the time.[44][45][46]\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| TSN/CTV, RDS, ABC\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| June 13 9:00pm (6:00 pm PDT)\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Box score\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Toronto Raptors** **114**, Golden State Warriors 110\n |\n| **Scoring by quarter:** **33**\u201332, **27**\u201325, 26\u2013**31**, **28**\u201322 |\n| **Pts:** Siakam, Lowry 26 each**Rebs:** Pascal Siakam 10**Asts:** Kyle Lowry 10 |  | **Pts:** Klay Thompson 30**Rebs:** Draymond Green 19**Asts:** Draymond Green 13 |\n| ***Toronto Raptors Win NBA Finals, 4-2*** |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Oracle Arena, Oakland, California**Attendance:** 19,596**Referees:**\n* No. 8 Marc Davis\n* No. 16 David Guthrie\n* No. 30 John Goble\n |\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Full game broadcast by ABC on YouTube |\n\n\nLeonard scored 22 points and had six rebounds and was named the NBA Finals MVP after Toronto won 114\u2013110 over Golden State to claim its first championship in franchise history. Thompson scored a game-high 30 points for the Warriors, but was lost for the game with 2:22 remaining in the third quarter after landing awkwardly and suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee on a drive to the basket contested by Danny Green. With the Raptors leading 111\u2013110, the Warriors managed to force a turnover with 9.6 seconds left in the game, but Curry missed a three-pointer that would have forced a Game 7. Trying to secure the ball after the miss, Iguodala called a timeout, but the Warriors did not have any left, and were assessed a technical foul. It was academic, as time would have otherwise expired had they not attempted to stop the clock. Leonard was awarded three free throws to seal the Raptors' first-ever NBA championship title.[47]\n\n\nLowry and Siakam led Toronto with 26 points each. Lowry scored 11 of his points in the first two-plus minutes of the contest. Van Vleet finished with 22 points, including 12 in the final period, and made five of the team's 13 three-pointers. Siakam added 10 rebounds. Curry had 21 points for Golden State, but he was hounded by the Raptors in the fourth quarter without Durant or Thompson available. Draymond Green had a triple-double with 11 points, 19 rebounds and 13 assists, but committed eight turnovers. Iguodala had 22 points despite shooting only 1 of 5 on free throws.[47]\n\n\nLeonard averaged 28.5 points per game in the series,[48] and joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James as the only players to be named Finals MVP with two different teams. Toronto was the first Canadian team to win the NBA title and the first non-American team to win any of the Big Four North American sports titles since the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball won the World Series in October 1993.[49] This was the Warriors' last game ever at Oracle Arena, as they moved to the new Chase Center across the bay in San Francisco at the beginning of the 2019\u201320 season. They finished 0\u20133 at home in the series.[47] The road team won the last five games of the series, the longest string of road wins in one Finals.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Incident between Raptors president and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMoments after the game's conclusion, Raptors executive Masai Ujiri was barred by an Alameda County Sheriff deputy from walking onto the floor for the team's trophy presentation, leading to an altercation between the two men.[51]\n\n\nBody camera footage eventually released to the public revealed that Dep. Alan Strickland had shoved Ujiri twice in the chest after the executive had tried to access the court, prompting Ujiri to shove him back.[52] The two men appeared to stare each other down for several seconds before Lowry arrived, embracing Ujiri and escorting him onto the floor for the celebration.[53]\n\n\nWhile the footage does not display Ujiri wearing the credentials that would have allowed him to walk onto the floor, he is heard identifying himself as \"president of the Raptors\" while holding up the credentials he did have.[54][55]\n\n\nFollowing the incident, Sheriff Greg Ahearn said he would recommend battery charges against Ujiri. However, after privately meeting with Ujiri and his lawyers, representatives from the county District Attorney's office announced there would be no criminal charges filed against him.[56]\n\n\nStrickland separately sued Ujiri for $75,000, claiming to have suffered a concussion during the altercation.[57][58] Ujiri countersued, and the two men later dropped their filings.[59]\n\n\n\n## Rosters[edit]\n\n\n### Toronto Raptors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2018\u201319 Toronto Raptors roster\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n |

Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a multiyear partnership that began in 2018, the internet television service YouTube TV was the presenting sponsor of the series,[61] even in Canada despite its lack of legal availability there at the time, which was officially named the *NBA Finals 2019 presented by YouTube TV*.[62]\n\n\n\n## Media coverage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toronto Raptors commentary team members Matt Devlin and Jack Armstrong in the Scotiabank Arena during Game 2; note the advertisement of YouTube TV (despite its lack of legal availability there at the time) behind the announcers\nIn the United States, the Finals was televised by ABC in English and ESPN Deportes in Spanish. Play-by-play commentator Mike Breen, and analysts Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson called the series on ABC, while \u00c1lvaro Mart\u00edn (play-by-play) and Carlos Morales (analyst) were on ESPN Deportes.[63] This was also Doris Burke's last year in the NBA Finals as sideline reporter on TV; a year later, she transitioned to calling the series as an analyst on the ESPN Radio.[64]\n\n\nIn Canada, the Raptors' and the NBA's main local rightsholders, Sportsnet (which aired games 1, 3, and 5, and would have aired game 7) and TSN (games 2, 4, and 6) aired separate, local telecasts with the Raptors' commentary team of Matt Devlin on play-by-play, and Leo Rautins (Sportsnet) or Jack Armstrong (TSN) as analysts. TSN sister broadcast television network CTV 2 aired simulcasts of ABC's feed for games 2 and 4 in order to enforce simultaneous substitution rights on ABC stations carried on pay television,[65] while game 6 was simulcast on CTV.[66] Sportsnet's sister broadcast network Citytv similarly simulcast games 3 and 5.[67] RDS broadcast all six games in French.\n\n\nAs the NBA's sole Canadian franchise, the Raptors' parent company Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (which is, in turn, majority owned between a partnership of Sportsnet and TSN's respective owners, Rogers Communications and BCE Inc.) manages the league's national media rights in Canada.[68] The series technically marked the first time that a team's regional broadcaster has produced its own coverage of games during the NBA Finals; these local broadcasts had access to ABC's camera feeds, along with additional cameras that were part of its own production resources.[69]\n\n\n\n### Viewership[edit]\n\n\nSee also: NBA Finals television ratings\n\nIn Canada, Game 1 recorded an average of 3.3 million viewers on Sportsnet, making it the highest-rated NBA game in Canadian history.[70] By contrast, with 10.77 million U.S. viewers, Game 1 was the second lowest-rated NBA Finals game in the U.S. after the 2020 NBA Finals.[71] Analysts cited both the presence of a Canadian team (Canadian viewership does not count towards U.S. Nielsen ratings, leading to only one U.S. home market being reflected in viewership, being the San Francisco Bay Area market), and being the first NBA Finals not to feature a team with LeBron James since 2011, as factors in the drop.[72][73] In the Warriors' home market, ratings were also lower in comparison to its past Game 1 appearances.[74]\n\n\nThe Canadian record would be surpassed by Game 2, with an average of 4.3 million across TSN, the French-language broadcast on RDS, and CTV2's simulcast of ABC's broadcast, and an estimate that the game was seen at any point by at least 10 million viewers. The game also had a 68 percent ratings share in the Toronto\u2013Hamilton market. Game 3 was seen by 3.8 million viewers across Sportsnet and Citytv.[75][76] The downward trend of U.S. viewership continued on Game 4, with a 9.8 share for the Friday-night game (a 12.5 percent year-over-year decline over Game 4 in 2018).[77][78] TSN reported average viewership of 4.631 million, surpassing Canadian NBA viewership records for the third time in the series.[79]\n\n\nU.S. Game 5 viewership was 37% higher over Game 4, at 18.22 million, while Sportsnet reported an average of 6.4 million viewers across Sportsnet and the Citytv simulcast of ABC coverage\u2014surpassing the series finale of *The Big Bang Theory* (4.33 million), Super Bowl LIII (4.34 million), and the 91st Academy Awards (5.21 million)[80] as the most-watched television broadcast of 2019 in Canada, and once again the most-watched NBA telecast in Canada. The NBA itself estimated 6.9 million viewers when accounting for the French-language feed on RDS and estimated viewership on out-of-market stations.[81][82]\n\n\nGame 6 further exceeded these numbers with an average of 7.7 million. TSN publicized that a total of 15.9 million unique viewers watched some point of the telecast, and 9.99 million were watching during the final minute. TSN also reported that Game 6 had an 82 percent share of viewers in the Toronto\u2013Hamilton market\u2014which it stated to be the highest in the region for a sports broadcast outside of the Olympic Games, summer or winter.[83] Game 6's ratings in the United States were slightly higher over Game 5, with 18.34 million.[84]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(American households)\n | American audience(in millions)\n | Canadian average audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 7.9 | 13.31 | 3.3 | [85][70] |\n| 2\n | 8.0 | 13.88 | 4.3 | [86][76] |\n| 3\n | 7.8 | 13.10 | 3.8 | [87][76] |\n| 4\n | 7.6 | 12.79 | 4.6 | [79][88] |\n| 5\n | 10.6 | 18.22 | 6.4 | [81][89] |\n| 6\n | 10.7 | 18.34 | 7.7 | [90] |\n| Avg | 8.77 | 14.94 | 5.021\n |\n\n\n## Victory parade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toronto's Nathan Phillips Square on June 17, 2019, with crowds surrounding the Toronto Sign during the victory parade\nOn June 17, the Raptors held a victory parade in Downtown Toronto, which began at the Princes' Gates at the east end of Exhibition Place, traveled east along Lake Shore Boulevard West, north along York Street and University Avenue, east along Queen Street West, and finished at Nathan Phillips Square next to Toronto City Hall.[91] The parade was attended by an estimated crowd of two million fans, making this the largest public gathering in one place for one event in Canadian history, peacetime or wartime. However, due to this overcrowding, the parade was delayed an additional three hours as numerous fans bypassed the barricades, blocking the parade route.[92] In addition, excessive crowds delayed emergency services from attending to people in the crowd falling ill from heat exhaustion and dehydration, which resulted in the death of an infant.[93] Later on, the parade was marred by shootings, which occurred during the victory speeches.[94] The shootings wounded four people, though did not inflict life-threatening injuries, and caused a stampede.[94] Three suspects were arrested and two guns were recovered.[94]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Warriors[edit]\n\n\nIn the offseason, Kevin Durant left to join the Brooklyn Nets, but did not play until the 2020\u201321 season due to the Achilles injury he suffered in the Finals. Meanwhile, Klay Thompson did not play for the next two seasons due to the ACL injury he suffered in the Finals, and an Achilles tear he suffered in the succeeding offseason.\n\n\nWithout Thompson and Stephen Curry for most of the pandemic-shortened 2019\u201320 season, the Warriors finished with a conference-worst 15\u201350 record, and did not qualify for the Orlando bubble in the summer. In the 72-game 2020\u201321 season, they finished eighth in the conference with 39 wins and qualified for the play-in tournament, but lost to the Los Angeles Lakers and the Memphis Grizzlies in the first and second phases, respectively. However, with Thompson and Curry back and healthy, the Warriors finished the 2021\u201322 season third in the conference with 53 wins, and eventually defeated the Boston Celtics in six games of the 2022 NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n### Raptors[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2019 offseason, Kawhi Leonard signed with the Los Angeles Clippers after only one season in Toronto. Nevertheless, the Raptors still finished the 2019\u201320 season 53\u201319 and were invited to the Orlando bubble during the summer. However, they lost in seven games to the Boston Celtics in the second round of the playoffs. The following season, the Raptors were forced to play all of their home games at Amalie Arena in Tampa due to Canadian travel restrictions brought on by the pandemic. The team finished the season out of the playoffs with 27 wins. However, in the 2021\u201322 season, the Raptors resumed playing home games in Toronto and ended with 48 wins; however, they lost in the opening round to the Philadelphia 76ers. The Raptors would become the last team to win the NBA championship on their debut appearance until the Denver Nuggets in 2023.\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Celtics advanced 10 straight times, winning nine, including eight consecutive.[3]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Kawhi Leonard joins elite company in winning Finals MVP\". *NBA.com*.

If we were to prorate those seasons to 82 games:\n\nBucks: 46 wins in 72 games = 52.4 wins per 82 games\nLakers: 52 wins in 71 games = 60.1 wins per 82 games\n\nUsing these prorated numbers, the average would be:\n(53 + 53 + 52.4 + 60.1 + 58) / 5 = 55.3 wins",
