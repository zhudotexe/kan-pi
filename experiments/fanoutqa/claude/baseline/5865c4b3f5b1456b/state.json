The drama featured the members as themselves, as well as Kim Sae-ron, Seo Kang-joon, and the girl group Hello Venus.[8]\n\n\nAfter their web drama finished airing, the group started the \"Meet U\" project. As part of the project, Astro traveled through South Korea, covering songs in front of crowds and holding fan meetings. Along with the performances, a KakaoTalk Plus Friends account was set up. Fantagio stated that once the group had gathered 10,000 friends on the app, they would announce their official debut date.[9] The goal was met by December 2015.[10] Their debut showcase, held on January 28, 2016, was sold out in under a minute and far exceeded the original limit of 1,000 attendants.[11][12] There, they also announced their official fan club name, Aroha.\n\n\nThey also appeared in their own reality TV show titled *Astro OK! Ready*, which began airing on January 21, 2016, on MBC every1[13] and concluded on February 18, 2016.[14]\n\n\n\n### 2016: Debut with *Spring Up* and rising popularity[edit]\n\n\nOn February 23, 2016, Astro released their debut extended play *Spring Up* alongside its lead single \"Hide & Seek\".[15] For two days, starting on February 22, 2016, showcases and press conferences were held at Lotte Card Art Center[16] and Wapop Concert Hall[17] to commemorate the group's first release. Within a week of its release, *Spring Up* reached number six on the *Billboard* World Albums Chart in the United States,[18] as well as number four on the Gaon Album Chart.\n[19] On February 25, the group released the music video for \"Cat's Eye\" (\uc7a5\ud654 \uc2e0\uc740 \uace0\uc591\uc774), containing clips from their web drama *To Be Continued*. On April 13, Astro was the only Korean act invited to the LeTV Entertainment Awards in China. Due to their popularity in China, Cha Eun-woo was also offered a role in a Chinese drama shortly after their debut.[20]\n\n\nTheir second extended play *Summer Vibes* was released on July 1.[21] The album peaked at number six on the *Billboard* World Albums Chart[22] and at number two on the Gaon Album Chart.[23] Furthermore, the music video for \"Breathless\" (\uc228\uac00\ube60), featuring labelmate Choi Yoo-jung of Weki Meki, surpassed half a million views in just three days.[24] The same month, on July 31, Astro performed in front of more than 20,000 people at Staples Center in Los Angeles for KCON 2016.[25][26]\n\n\nJust five months after their debut, Astro held their first solo mini concert titled *Astro 2016 Mini Live \u2013 Thankx Aroha* from August 27 to 28 at the KEPCO Art Center in Seoul.[27][28] Additional showcases were held in Japan,[29] Indonesia,[30] and Thailand[31] throughout the months of October and November.\n\n\nThe group released their third extended play *Autumn Story* on November 10.[32] The music video to its lead single \"Confession\" (\uace0\ubc31) featured Sei of Weki Meki. Simultaneously, their reality TV show *Astro Project A.S.I.A*, which explored the events of their first oversea showcases, began airing.[33] In December, *Billboard* named Astro one of the best new K-pop groups of 2016.[5]\n\n\n\n### 2017\u20132018: First tour, group hiatus, and *Rise Up*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astro at their showcase for *Dream Part.01*\nOn February 22, 2017, one day before their one-year anniversary, Astro's four seasons project came to a close with their special album *Winter Dream*. The album and its lead single \"Again\" (\ubd99\uc7a1\uc558\uc5b4\uc57c \ud574) were neither promoted on any music shows nor did they receive a music video.[34] The group did, however, resume their overseas showcases with performances in Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.[35] The group released their fourth extended play *Dream Part.01*, featuring the lead single \"Baby\", on May 29.[36] The album placed sixth on the *Billboard* World Albums Chart.[37] The same month, Astro signed a contract with Avex Taiwan to handle their music distribution in Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia.[38] On July 15, 2017, the group started their first tour, titled *The 1st Astroad to Seoul*, in Seoul at Olympic Hall,[39][40] later expanding it with stops in Osaka, and Tokyo.[41] On November 1, Astro released their fifth extended play *Dream Part.02*, featuring the lead single \"Crazy Sexy Cool\" (\ub2c8\uac00 \ubd88\uc5b4\uc640).[42] A limited \"Wish\" edition of the EP was released on January 10, 2018. All 10,000 copies were sold out in pre-orders alone. The edition contains a poem written by member Cha Eun-woo titled \"Purple Evening\", a hidden \"Thanks to\", as well as polaroid pictures taken by the members themselves.[43]\n\n\nThe group held a second showcase in Taiwan on January 20, 2018, at the Taipei International Convention Center (TICC).[44] Throughout the months of February and March, Astro held twelve fan meetings across nine cities around the world, visiting the United States, Canada, South Korea, Japan, and Thailand.[45][46] On July 24, after a prolonged hiatus, Astro released their second special extended play *Rise Up* alongside its lead single \"Always You\" (\ub108\uc796\uc544). Due to internal issues at their label, Fantagio Music, the album was not promoted on music shows.[47][48] Still, the group proceeded to hold their second Japan tour *The 2nd Astroad to Japan* in August, with performances in Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo.[49][50] Another tour titled *The 2nd Astroad to Seoul [Star Light] (Part 1)* in South Korea followed, concluding on December 23 with a last performance in Seoul at KBS Hall.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### 2019: First studio album *All Night*, Japanese debut with *Venus*, and Moonbin's hiatus[edit]\n\n\nOn January 16, 2019, following their 14-month hiatus without any full comeback, Astro released their first studio album *All Light*.[53][54] To further promote the album, the group continued their *The 2nd Astroad to Seoul [Star Light]* tour with shows in Taiwan,[55] the United States,[56] Hong Kong,[57] and Thailand.[58][59] On January 29, they received their first music show win for \"All Night\" (\uc804\ud654\ud574) on the SBS MTV music program *The Show*.[60]\n\n\nOn April 3, Astro made their Japanese debut with the extended play *Venus*. The EP features three original Japanese tracks along with Japanese versions of their Korean singles \"Baby\", \"Always You\", and \"All Night\".[61] The release was well received by the general public, ranking third on the Oricon Weekly Album Chart[62] and peaking at number one on the Daily Album Chart.[63]\n\n\nOn November 12, Fantagio announced that Moonbin would be going on a hiatus to recover from health issues and focus on his treatment.[64] Subsequently, Moonbin did not participate in the promotions for the group's sixth extended play *Blue Flame*, which was released on November 20.[65] His parts were therefore temporarily re-distributed amongst the remaining members.[66] Despite this, he still took part in the recording of the EP and appeared in the music video for their lead single \"Blue Flame\".[67]\n\n\n\n### 2020: *One & Only*, *Gateway*, and first sub-unit Moonbin & Sanha[edit]\n\n\nOn February 14, 2020, Moonbin appeared in a V Live broadcast with the other Astro members, officially ending his hiatus.[68] In celebration of their fourth debut anniversary, Astro released a special digital single album titled *One & Only* on February 23.[69] A physical edition of the single was released on March 13.[70]\n\n\nIn May 4, Astro released their seventh extended play *Gateway*.[71] On May 12, the EP's lead single \"Knock\" earned the group their second win on the MBC M music show *Show Champion*.[72] On June 28, Astro held their first online live streaming concert *2020 Astro Live on WWW.*, where they performed the song \"No, I Don't\" for the first time.[73] On the same day, the single was distributed digitally through various streaming services.[74]\n\n\nOn August 14, Fantagio confirmed that members Moonbin and Yoon San-ha would form Astro's first sub-unit called Moonbin & Sanha and that the recording for the unit's first extended play had already been completed.[75] Their debut EP *In-Out*, featuring the lead single \"Bad Idea\", was released on September 14.[76][77] Eight days later, on September 22, the sub-unit received their first music show award from *The Show*, making them the fastest K-pop sub-unit to receive their first win on a music show.[78]\n\n\nOn December 31, Astro released the digital single \"We Still (Be With U)\" as a special year-end gift to their fans. The song is a re-arranged, winter-themed version of the track \"We Still\" from their seventh extended play *Gateway*.[79]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Second studio album *All Yours* and solo activities[edit]\n\n\nOn April 5, 2021, Astro released their second studio album *All Yours*.[80][81] The group received a total of three music show wins for its title track \"One\": the first one on *The Show* on April 13; the second on *Show Champion* on April 14; and finally on *M Countdown* on April 15, making it their first win on the program.[82] On June 10, *All Yours* became the first Astro album to be certified platinum by Gaon.[83][84]\n\n\nOn August 2, the group released their eighth extended play *Switch On*.[85][86] The music video for its lead single \"After Midnight\" garnered 10 million views in 34 hours, breaking the record previously set by \"One\".[87] On August 10, they earned their first music show win for \"After Midnight\" on *The Show*.[88] Just one day after, the group received their second win on *Show Champion*,[89] followed by their third win on *Music Bank* on August 13[90] and their fourth win on *Show!
