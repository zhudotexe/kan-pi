After the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377) the popes have mainly resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere. The Vatican is also a metonym for the Holy See.\n\n\nThe Holy See dates back to early Christianity and is the principal episcopal see of the Catholic Church, which has approximately 1.329 billion baptised Catholics in the world as of 2018[update] in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches.[23] The independent state of Vatican City, on the other hand, came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation,[24] not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756–1870), which had previously encompassed much of Central Italy.\n\n\nVatican City contains religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Apostolic Library, and the Vatican Museums. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by donations from the faithful, by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs, fees for admission to museums, and sales of publications. Vatican City has no taxes and items are duty-free.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Vatican City* was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state named after Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state within the city of Rome. \"Vatican\" is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, *Vatica* or *Vaticum*, located in the general area the Romans called *Ager Vaticanus*, \"Vatican territory\".[25]\n\n\nThe Italian name of the city is *Città del Vaticano* or, more formally, *Stato della Città del Vaticano*, meaning 'Vatican City State'. Its Latin name is **Status Civitatis Vaticanae**;[26][27] this is used in official documents by the Holy See, the Church and the Pope.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Papacy and Holy See § History\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican Obelisk in St. Peter's Square was brought to Rome from Egypt by Caligula\nThe name \"Vatican\" was already in use in the time of the Roman Republic for the *Ager Vaticanus*, a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome, located between the Janiculum, the Vatican Hill and Monte Mario, down to the Aventine Hill and up to the confluence of the Cremera creek.[28] The toponym *Ager Vaticanus* is attested until the 1st century AD: afterwards, another toponym appeared, *Vaticanus*, denoting an area much more restricted: the Vatican Hill, today's St. Peter's Square, and possibly today's Via della Conciliazione.[28] Because of its vicinity to Rome's archenemy, the Etruscan city of Veii (another naming for the *Ager Vaticanus* was *Ripa Veientana* or *Ripa Etrusca*), and for being subjected to the floods of the Tiber, the Romans considered this originally uninhabited part of Rome dismal and ominous.[29]\n\n\nThe particularly low quality of Vatican wine, even after the reclamation of the area, was commented on by the poet Martial (40 – between AD 102 and 104).[30] Tacitus wrote that in AD 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, when the northern army that brought Vitellius to power arrived in Rome, \"a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican, which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery; and the Tiber being close by, the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed with which they drank from the stream weakened their bodies, which were already an easy prey to disease\".[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)An early interpretation of the relative locations of the circus, and the medieval and current Basilicas of St. Peter\n![](image)One possible modern interpretation[32]\nDuring the Roman Empire, many villas were constructed there, after Agrippina the Elder (14 BC–18 October AD 33) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD. In AD 40, her son, Emperor Caligula (31 August AD 12–24 January AD 41; r. 37–41) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers (AD 40) that was later completed by Nero, the *Circus Gaii et Neronis*,[33] usually called, simply, the Circus of Nero.[34]\n\n\nThe Vatican Obelisk in St. Peter's Square is the last visible remnant from the Circus of Nero. It was brought from Heliopolis in Egypt by Emperor Caligula. The obelisk originally stood at the centre of the *spina* (median) of the Roman circus.[35] The circus became the site of martyrdom for many Christians after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64. Tradition states that it was in this circus that Saint Peter was crucified upside-down.[36] In 1586, the obelisk was relocated to its current position by Pope Sixtus V using a method devised by Italian architect Domenico Fontana.[37]\n\n\nOpposite the circus was a cemetery separated by the Via Cornelia. Funeral monuments and mausoleums, and small tombs, as well as altars to pagan gods of all kinds of polytheistic religions, were constructed lasting until before the construction of the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter in the first half of the 4th century. A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis remained active long after the ancient Basilica of St. Peter was built nearby.[38]\nRemains of this ancient necropolis were brought to light sporadically during renovations by various popes throughout the centuries, increasing in frequency during the Renaissance until it was systematically excavated by orders of Pope Pius XII from 1939 to 1941. The Constantinian basilica was built in 326 over what was believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, buried in that cemetery.[39]\n\n\nFrom then on, the area became more populated in connection with activity at the basilica. A palace was constructed nearby as early as the 5th century during the pontificate of Pope Symmachus (reigned 498–514).[40]\n\n\n\n### Papal States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Papal States\n\nSee also: History of the Papacy\n\n![](image)The Italian peninsula in 1796. The Papal States in central Italy are coloured purple.\nPopes gradually came to have a secular role as governors of regions near Rome. They ruled the Papal States, which covered a large portion of the Italian peninsula, for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the newly created Kingdom of Italy.\n\n\nFor most of this time, the popes did not live at the Vatican. The Lateran Palace, on the opposite side of Rome, was their habitual residence for about a thousand years. From 1309 to 1377, they lived at Avignon in France. On their return to Rome, they chose to live at the Vatican. They moved to the Quirinal Palace in 1583, after work on it was completed under Pope Paul V (1605–1621), but on the capture of Rome in 1870 retired to the Vatican, and what had been their residence became that of the King of Italy.\n\n\n\n### Under Italian rule (1871–1929)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Question\n\nIn 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when Rome itself was annexed by Italian forces, thus bringing to completion the Italian unification, after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the \"Roman Question\".\n\n\nItaly made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, it confiscated church property in many places. In 1871, the Quirinal Palace was confiscated by the King of Italy and became the royal palace. Thereafter, the popes resided undisturbed within the Vatican walls, and certain papal prerogatives were recognised by the Law of Guarantees, including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they refused to leave the Vatican compound until the dispute was resolved in 1929; Pope Pius IX (1846–1878), the last ruler of the Papal States, was referred to as a \"prisoner in the Vatican\". Forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.[41]\n\n\n\n### Lateran treaties[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lateran Treaty\n\nThis situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by Prime Minister and Head of Government Benito Mussolini on behalf of King Victor Emmanuel III and by Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri for Pope Pius XI.[24][20][42] The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Catholic Christianity in Italy.[43]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vatican City in World War II\n\n![](image)Bands of the British army's 38th Brigade playing in front of St Peter's Basilica, June 1944\nThe Holy See, which ruled Vatican City, pursued a policy of neutrality during World War II, under the leadership of Pope Pius XII. Although German troops occupied the city of Rome after the September 1943 Armistice of Cassibile, and the Allies from 1944, they respected Vatican City as neutral territory.[44] One of the main diplomatic priorities of the bishop of Rome was to prevent the bombing of the city; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.[45] The British policy, as expressed in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting, was: \"that we should on no account molest the Vatican City, but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian government observed the rules of war\".[45]\n\n\nAfter the US entered into the war, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, but said that \"they could not stop the British from bombing Rome if the British so decided\". The US military even exempted Catholic pilots and crew from air raids on Rome and other Church holdings, unless voluntarily agreed upon. Notably, with the exception of Rome, and presumably the possibility of the Vatican, no Catholic US pilot or air crew refused a mission within German-held Italy. The British uncompromisingly said \"they would bomb Rome whenever the needs of the war demanded\".[46] In December 1942, the UK's envoy suggested to the Holy See that Rome be declared an \"open city\", a suggestion that the Holy See took more seriously than was probably meant by the UK, who did not want Rome to be an open city, but Mussolini rejected the suggestion when the Holy See put it to him. In connection with the Allied invasion of Sicily, 500 US aircraft bombed Rome on 19 July 1943, aiming particularly at the railway hub. Some 1,500 people were killed. Pius XII, who had been described in the previous month as \"worried sick\" about the possible bombing, viewed the aftermath. Another raid took place on 13 August 1943, after Mussolini had been ousted from power.[47] On the following day, the new government declared Rome an open city, after consulting the Holy See on the wording of the declaration, but the UK had decided that they would never recognise Rome as an open city.[48]\n\n\n\n### Post-war history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of St. Peter's Square from the top of Michelangelo's dome\nPius XII had refrained from creating cardinals during the war. By the end of World War II, there were several prominent vacancies: Cardinal Secretary of State, Camerlengo, Chancellor, and Prefect for the Congregation for the Religious among them.[49] Pius XII created 32 cardinals in early 1946, having announced his intention to do so in his preceding Christmas message.\n\n\nThe Pontifical Military Corps, except for the Swiss Guard, was disbanded by the will of Paul VI, as expressed in a letter of 14 September 1970.[50] The Gendarmerie Corps was transformed into a civilian police and security force.\n\n\nIn 1984, a new concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain provisions of the earlier treaty, including the position of Catholic Christianity as the Italian state religion, a position given to it by a statute of the Kingdom of Sardinia of 1848.[43]\n\n\nConstruction in 1995 of a new guest house, Domus Sanctae Marthae, adjacent to St Peter's Basilica was criticised by Italian environmental groups, backed by Italian politicians. They claimed the new building would block views of the Basilica from nearby Italian apartments.[51] For a short while the plans strained the relations between the Vatican and the Italian government. The head of the Vatican's Department of Technical Services robustly rejected challenges to the Vatican State's right to build within its borders.[51]\n\n\nJohn R. Morss writes in the *European Journal of International Law* that due to the terms of the Lateran Treaty, Vatican City's status as a sovereign state, and the Pope's status as a head of state, are problematic.[*clarification needed*][52]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

It is in this territory that St. Peter's Basilica, the Apostolic Palace, the Sistine Chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman *rione* of Borgo until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the river Tiber, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of Leo IV (847–855), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under Paul III (1534–1549), Pius IV (1559–1565), and Urban VIII (1623–1644).[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)Territory of Vatican City State according to the Lateran Treaty\nWhen the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.[54]\n\n\nThe territory includes St. Peter's Square, distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the Via della Conciliazione which runs from close to the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by Benito Mussolini after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.\n\n\nAccording to the Lateran Treaty, certain properties of the Holy See that are located in Italian territory, most notably the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo and the major basilicas, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign embassies.[55][56] These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.[56]\n\n\nCastel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by police agents of Vatican City State and not by Italian police. According to the Lateran Treaty (Art. 3) St. Peter's Square, up to but not including the steps leading to the basilica, is normally patrolled by the Italian police.[55]\n\n\nThere are no passport controls for visitors entering Vatican City from the surrounding Italian territory. There is free public access to Saint Peter's Square and Basilica and, on the occasion of papal general audiences, to the hall in which they are held. For these audiences and for major ceremonies in Saint Peter's Basilica and Square, tickets free of charge must be obtained beforehand. The Vatican Museums, incorporating the Sistine Chapel, usually charge an entrance fee. There is no general public access to the gardens, but guided tours for small groups can be arranged to the gardens and excavations under the basilica.

Some minor local features, principally mists and dews, are caused by the anomalous bulk of St Peter's Basilica, the elevation, the fountains, and the size of the large paved square. The highest temperature ever recorded was 40.7 °C (105.3 °F), on both 2 August 2017 and 27 June 2022.[58]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Vatican City *(data of Aeroporto Roma-Ciampino \"Giovan Battista Pastine\")* |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 37.8(100.0)\n | 39.4(102.9)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 38.4(101.1)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 30.3(86.5)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 8.2(46.8)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 24.1(75.4)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 11.3(52.3)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n | −4.4(24.1)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n | −5.2(22.6)\n | −4.8(23.4)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 67(2.6)\n | 73(2.9)\n | 58(2.3)\n | 81(3.2)\n | 53(2.1)\n | 34(1.3)\n | 19(0.7)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 73(2.9)\n | 113(4.4)\n | 115(4.5)\n | 81(3.2)\n | 804(31.7)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1 mm) | 7.0\n | 7.6\n | 7.6\n | 9.2\n | 6.2\n | 4.3\n | 2.1\n | 3.3\n | 6.2\n | 8.2\n | 9.7\n | 8.0\n | 79.4\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 120.9\n | 132.8\n | 167.4\n | 201.0\n | 263.5\n | 285.0\n | 331.7\n | 297.6\n | 237.0\n | 195.3\n | 129.0\n | 111.6\n | 2,472.8\n |\n| Source: https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/noaa-earth-had-its-third-warmest-year-record-2017 |\n\nIn July 2007, the Vatican accepted a proposal by two firms based respectively in San Francisco and Budapest,[61] whereby it would become the first carbon neutral state by offsetting its carbon dioxide emissions with the creation of a Vatican Climate Forest in Hungary,[62] as a purely symbolic gesture[63] to encourage Catholics to do more to safeguard the planet.[64] Nothing came of the project.[65][66]\n\n\nOn 26 November 2008, the Vatican itself put into effect a plan announced in May 2007 to cover the roof of the Paul VI Audience Hall with solar panels.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### Gardens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gardens of Vatican City\n\nWithin the territory of Vatican City are the Vatican Gardens (Italian: *Giardini Vaticani*),[69] which account for about half of this territory. The gardens, established during the Renaissance and Baroque era, are decorated with fountains and sculptures.\n\n\nThe gardens cover approximately 23 hectares (57 acres). The highest point is 60 metres (197 ft) above mean sea level. Stone walls bound the area in the north, south, and west.\n\n\nThe gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal Apostolic Palace.[70] In 1279, Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, 1277–1280) moved his residence back to the Vatican from the Lateran Palace and enclosed this area with walls.[71] He planted an orchard *(pomerium)*, a lawn *(pratellum)*, and a garden *(viridarium)*.[71]\n\n\n\n![A panorama of gardens and several buildings viewed from St. Peter's Basilica](image)\nPanorama of the gardens viewed from St. Peter's Basilica\n\n## Governance[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Vatican City\n\nThe politics of Vatican City takes place in the context of an absolute elective monarchy, in which the head of the Catholic Church holds power. The Pope exercises principal legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of Vatican City (an entity distinct from the Holy See), which is a rare case of a non-hereditary monarchy.\n\n\n\n### State and Holy See[edit]\n\n\nVatican City State, created in 1929 by the Lateran Pacts, provides the Holy See with a temporal jurisdiction and independence within a small territory. It is distinct from the Holy See. The state can thus be deemed a significant but not essential instrument of the Holy See. The Holy See itself has existed continuously as a juridical entity since Roman Imperial times and has been internationally recognised as a powerful and independent sovereign entity since Late Antiquity to the present, without interruption even at times when it was deprived of territory (e.g. 1870 to 1929).\n\n\nVatican City is one of the few widely recognised independent states that has not become a member of the United Nations.[72] The Holy See, which is distinct from Vatican City State, has permanent observer status, with all the rights of a full member except for a vote in the UN General Assembly.\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pope Francis in Vatican City, 2021\nThe government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The Pope is the sovereign of the state, while legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the president of that commission, assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the Pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches over Vatican City,[73]\nand is thus the only absolute monarch in Europe.[74]\n\n\nOperationally, there are departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications and other matters.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Sede vacante[edit]\n\n\nThe Cardinal Camerlengo presides over the Apostolic Camera, to which is entrusted the administration of the property and protection of other papal temporal powers and rights of the Holy See during the period of the empty throne or sede vacante (papal vacancy).[75] Those of the Vatican State remain under the control of the Pontifical Commission for the State of Vatican City. Acting with three other cardinals chosen by lot every three days, one from each order of cardinals (cardinal bishop, cardinal priest, and cardinal deacon), he in a sense performs during that period the functions of head of state of Vatican City.[76] All the decisions these four cardinals take must be approved by the College of Cardinals as a whole.\n\n\n\n#### Papal nobility[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Papal nobility\n\nThe nobility that was closely associated with the Holy See at the time of the Papal States continued to be associated with the Papal Court after the loss of these territories, generally with merely nominal duties (see Papal Master of the Horse, Prefecture of the Pontifical Household, Hereditary officers of the Roman Curia, Black Nobility). They also formed the ceremonial Noble Guard. In the first decades of the existence of the Vatican City State, executive functions were entrusted to some of them, including that of delegate for the State of Vatican City (now denominated president of the Commission for Vatican City). But with the motu proprio *Pontificalis Domus* of 28 March 1968,[77] Pope Paul VI abolished the honorary positions that had continued to exist until then, such as Quartermaster general and Master of the Horse.[78]\n\n\n\n### Head of state and government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pope and President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State\n\nSee also: List of Sovereigns of the Vatican City State\n\n![](image)The Apostolic Palace (*Palazzo Apostolico*), the official residence of the Pope. Here, Benedict XVI is at the window marked by a maroon banner hanging from the windowsill at centre.\nThe Pope is *ex officio* head of state[79] of Vatican City, a function dependent on his primordial function as bishop of the diocese of Rome and head of the Catholic Church.[80] The term \"Holy See\" refers not to the Vatican state but to the Pope's spiritual and pastoral governance, largely exercised through the Roman Curia.[81] His official title with regard to Vatican City is *Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City*.\n\n\nPope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was elected on 13 March 2013. His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City as well as the country's head of government is the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the Governor of Vatican City. Since 2001, the president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of president of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City. The president is Spanish Cardinal Fernando Vérgez Alzaga, who was appointed on 1 October 2021.\n\n\n\n### Administration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Vatican City\n\n![](image)Palace of the Governorate of Vatican City State\nLegislative functions are delegated to the unicameral Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, led by the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the Pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the Pope, through the Holy See's Secretariat of State, and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.\n\n\nExecutive authority is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City. The Governorate consists of the President of the Pontifical Commission—using the title \"President of the Governorate of Vatican City\"—a general secretary, and a Vice general secretary, each appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. Important actions of the Governorate must be confirmed by the Pontifical Commission and by the Pope through the Secretariat of State.\n\n\nThe Governorate oversees the central governmental functions through several departments and offices. The directors and officials of these offices are appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. These organs concentrate on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, records, transportation, and finances. The Governorate oversees a modern security and police corps, the *Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Città del Vaticano*.\n\n\nJudicial functions are delegated to a supreme court, an appellate court, a tribunal (Tribunal of Vatican City State), and a trial judge. At the Vatican's request, sentences imposed can be served in Italy (see the section on crime, below).\n\n\nThe international postal country code prefix is *SCV*, and the only postal code is *00120* – altogether *SCV-00120*.[82]\n\n\n\n### Defence and security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military in Vatican City, Pontifical Swiss Guard, Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City, and Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State\n\n![](image)A guard of the Vatican at his sentry box\nAs Vatican City is an enclave within Italy, its military defence is provided by the Italian Armed Forces. However, there is no formal defence treaty with Italy, as Vatican City is a neutral state. Vatican City has no armed forces of its own, although the Swiss Guard is a military corps of the Holy See responsible for the personal security of the Pope, and residents in the state. Soldiers of the Swiss Guard are entitled to hold Vatican City State passports and nationality. Swiss mercenaries were historically recruited by Popes as part of an army for the Papal States, and the Pontifical Swiss Guard was founded by Pope Julius II on 22 January 1506 as the Pope's personal bodyguard and continues to fulfill that function. It is listed in the *Annuario Pontificio* under \"Holy See\", not under \"State of Vatican City\". At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and Switzerland. All recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their basic training with the Swiss Armed Forces with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least 174 cm (5 ft 9 in) in height. Members are equipped with small arms and the traditional halberd (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics. The Palatine Guard and the Noble Guard, the last armed forces of the Vatican City State, were disbanded by Pope Paul VI in 1970.[50] As Vatican City has listed every building in its territory on the International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict theoretically renders it immune to armed attack.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gendarmerie car\nCivil defence is the responsibility of the Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State, the national fire brigade. Dating its origins to the early nineteenth century, the Corps in its present form was established in 1941. It is responsible for fire fighting, as well as a range of civil defence scenarios including flood, natural disaster, and mass casualty management. The Corps is governmentally supervised through the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence, which is also responsible for the Gendarmerie (see below).\n\n\nThe Gendarmerie Corps (*Corpo della Gendarmeria*) is the gendarmerie, or police and security force, of Vatican City and the extraterritorial properties of the Holy See.[84] The corps is responsible for security, public order, border control, traffic control, criminal investigation, and other general police duties in Vatican City including providing security for the Pope outside of Vatican City. The corps has 130 personnel and is a part of the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence (which also includes the Vatican Fire Brigade), an organ of the Governorate of Vatican City.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The crowds of tourists in St. Peter's Square are a target for pickpockets.\nCrime in Vatican City consists largely of purse snatching, pickpocketing and shoplifting by outsiders.[87] The tourist foot-traffic in St. Peter's Square is one of the main locations for pickpockets in Vatican City.[88] If crimes are committed in Saint Peter's Square, the perpetrators may be arrested and tried by the Italian authorities, since that area is normally patrolled by Italian police.[89]\n\n\nUnder the terms of article 22 of the Lateran Treaty,[90] Italy will, at the request of the Holy See, punish individuals for crimes committed within Vatican City and will itself proceed against the person who committed the offence, if that person takes refuge in Italian territory. Persons accused of crimes recognised as such both in Italy and in Vatican City that are committed in Italian territory will be handed over to the Italian authorities if they take refuge in Vatican City or in buildings that enjoy immunity under the treaty.[90][91]\n\n\nVatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention.[92] People convicted of committing crimes in the Vatican serve terms in Italian prisons (Polizia Penitenziaria), with costs covered by the Vatican.[93]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of the Holy See and List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See\n\n![](image)The *Ingresso di Sant'Anna*, an entrance to Vatican City from Italy\nVatican City State is a recognised national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into international agreements in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.\n\n\nBecause of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City—embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.\n\n\nThe size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.[94]\n\n\nHowever, Vatican City State itself participates in some international organizations whose functions relate to the state as a geographical entity, distinct from the non-territorial legal persona of the Holy See. These organizations are much less numerous than those in which the Holy See participates either as a member or with observer status. They include the following eight, in each of which Vatican City State holds membership:[95][96]\n\n\n\n* European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT)\n* European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Eutelsat IGO)\n* International Grains Council (IGC)\n* International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IIAS)\n* International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n* International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (ITSO)\n* Interpol[97]\n* Universal Postal Union (UPU)\n\n\nIt also participates in:[95]\n\n\n\n* World Medical Association\n* World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)\n\n\n### Non-party, non-signatory policy[edit]\n\n\nThe Vatican City is not a member of the United Nations (UN), but was granted observer status to the United Nations General Assembly in 1968; the only other country in a similar position is the partially recognised State of Palestine. Since it is not a member of the UN, the Vatican City is not subjected to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It does, however, engage with various UN specialised agencies through its observer status including the Central Emergency Response Fund, to which it contributed US$20,000 between 2006 and 2022.[98]\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is not a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC). In Europe, only Belarus is also a non-party, non-signatory state, while Ukraine and Monaco are signatory states that have not ratified and Russia withdrew from it in 2016.\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is not a member of the European Court of Human Rights. Among European states, Belarus is also not a member, while Russia has ceased to be part of it after being expelled from the Council of Europe following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\nThe OECD's \"Common Reporting Standard\" (CRS), aiming at preventing tax evasion and money laundering, has also not been signed.[99][100][101] The Vatican City State has been criticised for money laundering practises in the past decades.[102][103][104] The only other country in Europe that has not agreed to sign the CRS is Belarus.\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is also one of few countries in the world that does not provide any publicly available financial data to the International Monetary Fund.[105]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Vatican City\n\nThe Vatican City State budget includes the Vatican Museums and post office and is supported financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales.[j] The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.[106] Other industries include printing, the production of mosaics, and the manufacture of staff uniforms. There is a Vatican Pharmacy.\n\n\n\n![](image)Vatican Museums' \"New Wing\", built by Raffaele Stern (1774–1820)\nThe Institute for Works of Religion (IOR, *Istituto per le Opere di Religione*), also known as the Vatican Bank, is a financial agency situated in the Vatican that conducts worldwide financial activities. It has multilingual ATMs with instructions in Latin, possibly the only ATM in the world with this feature.[107]\n\n\nVatican City issues its own coins and stamps. It has used the euro as its currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European Union (council decision 1999/98/EC). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002—the Vatican does not issue euro banknotes. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.[108] Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.[109] Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own Vatican lira currency, which was on par with the Italian lira.\n\n\nVatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7 million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15 million euros.[110]\n\n\nIn 2012, the US Department of State's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy, and Russia.[111]\n\n\nOn 24 February 2014, the Vatican announced it was establishing a secretariat for the economy, to be responsible for all economic, financial, and administrative activities of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, headed by Cardinal George Pell. This followed the charging of two senior clerics including a monsignor with money laundering offences. Pope Francis also appointed an auditor-general authorised to carry out random audits of any agency at any time and engaged a US financial services company to review the Vatican's 19,000 accounts to ensure compliance with international money laundering practices. The pontiff also ordered that the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See would be the Vatican's central bank, with responsibilities similar to other central banks around the world.[112]\n\n\nIn 2022, the Vatican planned to release NFTs of its museum collection.[113]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Women in Vatican City\n\nAs of 2023, Vatican City had a population of 764 residents, regardless of citizenship.[13] There were also 372 Vatican citizens residing elsewhere,[13] consisting of diplomats of the Holy See to other countries and cardinals residing in Rome.[114]\n\n\nThe population is composed of clergy, other religious members, laypeople serving the state (such as the Swiss Guard) and their family members.[115] In 2013 there were 13 families of the employees of the Holy See living in Vatican City,[116] in 2019 there were 20 children of the Swiss Guards living at the Vatican.[117] All citizens, residents and places of worship in the city are Catholic. The city also receives thousands of tourists and workers every day.\n\n\n\nVatican City population on 26 June 2023[13]\n| Sex | all\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |\n| Cardinals | 55 | 9 |  |\n| Diplomats | 317 |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 104 |  |\n| Others |  | 132 | 518\n |\n| Total | 618 | 518\n |\n| 372 | 246\n |\n| 764\n |\n| 1,136\n |\n\nVatican City population on 1 March 2011[115]\n| Sex | all | male | female\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other | Vatican | other | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |  | 1 |  |  |  |  |\n| Cardinals | 43 | 30 |  | 43 | 30 |  |  |  |  |\n| Diplomats | 306 |  |  | 306 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 86 |  |  | 86 |  |  |  |  |\n| Other religious |  | 50 | 197 |  | 49 | 102 |  | 1 | 95\n |\n| Other lay |  | 56 | 24 |  | 25 | 3 |  | 31 | 21\n |\n| Total | 572 | 221 | 540 | 105 | 32 | 116\n |\n| 349 | 223 | 349 | 191 |  | 32\n |\n| 444 | 296 | 148\n |\n| 793 | 645 | 148\n |\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Languages of Vatican City\n\n![](image)The Seal of Vatican City. Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh. The official websites of the Holy See[119] and of Vatican City[120] are primarily in Italian, with versions of their pages in a large number of languages to varying extents.\n\n\n\n### Citizenship[edit]\n\n\nUnlike citizenship of other states, which is based either on *jus sanguinis* (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on *jus soli* (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted on *jus officii*, namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.[114] Some individuals are also authorized to reside in the city but do not qualify or choose not to request citizenship.[114] Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an Italian citizen as provided in the Lateran Treaty.[55]\n\n\nThe Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.\n\n\n\n### Statistical oddities[edit]\n\n\nIn statistics comparing countries in various per capita or per area metrics, Vatican City is often an outlier—these can stem from the state's small size and ecclesiastical function.[121] For example, as most of the roles which would confer citizenship are reserved for men, the gender ratio of the citizenship is several men per woman.[122] Further oddities are petty crimes against tourists resulting in a very high per-capita crime rate,[123] and the city-state leading the world in per-capita wine consumption due to its sacramental use.[121] A jocular illustration of these anomalies is sometimes made by calculating a \"Popes per km2\" statistic, which is greater than two because the country is less than half a square kilometre in area.[124]\n\n\n\n![360-degree view from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking over the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square (centre) and out into Rome, showing Vatican City in all directions](image)\n360-degree view from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking over the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square (centre) and out into Rome, showing Vatican City in all directions\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Vatican City\n\nSee also: Music of Vatican City and Sport in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The Vatican Museums (*Musei Vaticani*) display works from the extensive collection of the Catholic Church.\nVatican City is home to some of the most famous art in the world. St. Peter's Basilica, whose successive architects include Bramante, Michelangelo, Giacomo della Porta, Maderno and Bernini, is a renowned work of Renaissance architecture. The Sistine Chapel is famous for its frescos, which include works by Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Botticelli as well as the ceiling and Last Judgment by Michelangelo. Artists who decorated the interiors of the Vatican include Raphael and Fra Angelico.\n\n\nThe Vatican Apostolic Library and the collections of the Vatican Museums are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance.[125] In 1984, the Vatican was added by UNESCO to the List of World Heritage Sites; it is the only one to consist of an entire state.[126] Furthermore, it is the only site to date registered with the UNESCO as a *centre containing monuments* in the \"International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection\" according to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.[126]\n\n\nFootball in Vatican City is organized by the Vatican Amateur Sports Association, which holds the national championship, called the Vatican City Championship, with eight teams, including, for example, the Swiss Guard's FC Guardia and police and museum guard teams.[127] The association also organizes the Coppa Sergio Valci and the Vatican Supercoppa. It controls the Vatican City national football team, which is neither affiliated with UEFA or FIFA.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The shortest national railway system in the world\nVatican City has a reasonably well-developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). As a state that is 1.05 kilometres (1,150 yards) long and 0.85 km (930 yd) wide,[128] it has a small transportation system with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the Vatican City Heliport. Vatican City is one of the few independent countries without an airport, and is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport and to a lesser extent Ciampino Airport.[129]\n\n\nThere is a standard gauge railway, mainly used to transport freight, connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an 852-metre-long (932 yd) spur, 300 metres (330 yd) of which is within Vatican territory.[129] Pope John XXIII was the first Pope to make use of the railway; Pope John Paul II rarely used it.[129]\n\n\nThe closest metro station is Ottaviano – San Pietro – Musei Vaticani.[130]\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican's post office was established on 11 February 1929.\nThe City is served by an independent, modern telephone system named the Vatican Telephone Service,[131] and a postal system (Poste Vaticane) that started operating on 13 February 1929. On 1 August, the state started to release its own postal stamps, under the authority of the Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State.[132] The city's postal service is sometimes said to be \"the best in the world\",[133] and faster than the postal service in Rome.[133]\n\n\nThe Vatican also controls its own Internet top-level domain, which is registered as (.va). Broadband service is widely provided within Vatican City. Vatican City has also been given a radio ITU prefix, HV, and this is sometimes used by amateur radio operators.\n\n\nVatican Radio, which was organised by Guglielmo Marconi, broadcasts on short-wave, medium-wave and FM frequencies and on the Internet.[134] Its main transmission antennae are located in Italian territory, and exceed Italian environmental protection levels of emission. For this reason, the Vatican Radio has been sued. Television services are provided through another entity, the Vatican Television Center.[135]\n\n\n*L'Osservatore Romano* is the multilingual semi-official newspaper of the Holy See. It is published by a private corporation under the direction of Catholic laymen, but reports on official information. However, the official texts of documents are in the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*, the official gazette of the Holy See, which has an appendix for documents of the Vatican City State.\n\n\nVatican Radio, the Vatican Television Center, and L'Osservatore Romano are organs not of the Vatican State but of the Holy See, and are listed as such in the *Annuario Pontificio*, which places them in the section \"Institutions linked with the Holy See\", ahead of the sections on the Holy See's diplomatic service abroad and the diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See, after which is placed the section on the State of Vatican City.\n\n\n\n### Recycling[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the Vatican began an \"ecological island\" for renewable waste and has continued the initiative throughout the papacy of Francis. These innovations included, for example, the installation of a solar power system on the roof of the Paul VI Audience Hall. In July 2019, it was announced that Vatican City would ban the use and sale of single-use plastics as soon as its supply was depleted, well before the 2021 deadline established by the European Union. It is estimated that 50–55% of Vatican City's municipal solid waste is properly sorted and recycled, with the goal of reaching the EU standard of 70–75%.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Vatican City portal\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Architecture of Vatican City\n* Holy city\n* Index of Vatican City-related articles\n* Law of Vatican City\n* News.va\n* Outline of Vatican City\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The Swiss Guard, in which commands on parade are given in German, also uses French and Italian, two of the three other official Swiss languages, in its official ceremonies, such as the annual swearing in of the new recruits on 6 May.[3]\n2. **^** All powers delegated by the sovereign[9][10]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The De Agostini Atlas Calendar listed the area of Vatican City as 44 ha in its 1930 edition[11] but corrected it to 49 ha in its 1945–1946 edition.[12] The figure of 44 ha is still widely cited by many sources despite its inaccuracy.\n4. **^** Visitors and tourists are not permitted to drive inside Vatican City without specific permission, which is normally granted only to those on official business in Vatican City.\n5. **^** ITU-T assigned code 379 to Vatican City.

Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund known as Peter's Pence, which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief and aid to churches in developing nations.\n\n### Citation notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Reuters Staff (6 October 2014). \"Pope ditches Latin as official language of Vatican synod\". *Reuters*.\n2. **^** \"What language is spoken at the Vatican?\". *Visiting The Vatican*. 13 April 2023.

After the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377) the popes have mainly resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere. The Vatican is also a metonym for the Holy See.\n\n\nThe Holy See dates back to early Christianity and is the principal episcopal see of the Catholic Church, which has approximately 1.329 billion baptised Catholics in the world as of 2018[update] in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches.[23] The independent state of Vatican City, on the other hand, came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation,[24] not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756–1870), which had previously encompassed much of Central Italy.\n\n\nVatican City contains religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Apostolic Library, and the Vatican Museums. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by donations from the faithful, by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs, fees for admission to museums, and sales of publications. Vatican City has no taxes and items are duty-free.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Vatican City* was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state named after Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state within the city of Rome. \"Vatican\" is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, *Vatica* or *Vaticum*, located in the general area the Romans called *Ager Vaticanus*, \"Vatican territory\".[25]\n\n\nThe Italian name of the city is *Città del Vaticano* or, more formally, *Stato della Città del Vaticano*, meaning 'Vatican City State'. Its Latin name is **Status Civitatis Vaticanae**;[26][27] this is used in official documents by the Holy See, the Church and the Pope.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Papacy and Holy See § History\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican Obelisk in St. Peter's Square was brought to Rome from Egypt by Caligula\nThe name \"Vatican\" was already in use in the time of the Roman Republic for the *Ager Vaticanus*, a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome, located between the Janiculum, the Vatican Hill and Monte Mario, down to the Aventine Hill and up to the confluence of the Cremera creek.[28] The toponym *Ager Vaticanus* is attested until the 1st century AD: afterwards, another toponym appeared, *Vaticanus*, denoting an area much more restricted: the Vatican Hill, today's St. Peter's Square, and possibly today's Via della Conciliazione.[28] Because of its vicinity to Rome's archenemy, the Etruscan city of Veii (another naming for the *Ager Vaticanus* was *Ripa Veientana* or *Ripa Etrusca*), and for being subjected to the floods of the Tiber, the Romans considered this originally uninhabited part of Rome dismal and ominous.[29]\n\n\nThe particularly low quality of Vatican wine, even after the reclamation of the area, was commented on by the poet Martial (40 – between AD 102 and 104).[30] Tacitus wrote that in AD 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, when the northern army that brought Vitellius to power arrived in Rome, \"a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican, which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery; and the Tiber being close by, the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed with which they drank from the stream weakened their bodies, which were already an easy prey to disease\".[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)An early interpretation of the relative locations of the circus, and the medieval and current Basilicas of St. Peter\n![](image)One possible modern interpretation[32]\nDuring the Roman Empire, many villas were constructed there, after Agrippina the Elder (14 BC–18 October AD 33) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD. In AD 40, her son, Emperor Caligula (31 August AD 12–24 January AD 41; r. 37–41) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers (AD 40) that was later completed by Nero, the *Circus Gaii et Neronis*,[33] usually called, simply, the Circus of Nero.[34]\n\n\nThe Vatican Obelisk in St. Peter's Square is the last visible remnant from the Circus of Nero. It was brought from Heliopolis in Egypt by Emperor Caligula. The obelisk originally stood at the centre of the *spina* (median) of the Roman circus.[35] The circus became the site of martyrdom for many Christians after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64. Tradition states that it was in this circus that Saint Peter was crucified upside-down.[36] In 1586, the obelisk was relocated to its current position by Pope Sixtus V using a method devised by Italian architect Domenico Fontana.[37]\n\n\nOpposite the circus was a cemetery separated by the Via Cornelia. Funeral monuments and mausoleums, and small tombs, as well as altars to pagan gods of all kinds of polytheistic religions, were constructed lasting until before the construction of the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter in the first half of the 4th century. A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis remained active long after the ancient Basilica of St. Peter was built nearby.[38]\nRemains of this ancient necropolis were brought to light sporadically during renovations by various popes throughout the centuries, increasing in frequency during the Renaissance until it was systematically excavated by orders of Pope Pius XII from 1939 to 1941. The Constantinian basilica was built in 326 over what was believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, buried in that cemetery.[39]\n\n\nFrom then on, the area became more populated in connection with activity at the basilica. A palace was constructed nearby as early as the 5th century during the pontificate of Pope Symmachus (reigned 498–514).[40]\n\n\n\n### Papal States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Papal States\n\nSee also: History of the Papacy\n\n![](image)The Italian peninsula in 1796. The Papal States in central Italy are coloured purple.\nPopes gradually came to have a secular role as governors of regions near Rome. They ruled the Papal States, which covered a large portion of the Italian peninsula, for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the newly created Kingdom of Italy.\n\n\nFor most of this time, the popes did not live at the Vatican. The Lateran Palace, on the opposite side of Rome, was their habitual residence for about a thousand years. From 1309 to 1377, they lived at Avignon in France. On their return to Rome, they chose to live at the Vatican. They moved to the Quirinal Palace in 1583, after work on it was completed under Pope Paul V (1605–1621), but on the capture of Rome in 1870 retired to the Vatican, and what had been their residence became that of the King of Italy.\n\n\n\n### Under Italian rule (1871–1929)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Question\n\nIn 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when Rome itself was annexed by Italian forces, thus bringing to completion the Italian unification, after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the \"Roman Question\".\n\n\nItaly made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, it confiscated church property in many places. In 1871, the Quirinal Palace was confiscated by the King of Italy and became the royal palace. Thereafter, the popes resided undisturbed within the Vatican walls, and certain papal prerogatives were recognised by the Law of Guarantees, including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they refused to leave the Vatican compound until the dispute was resolved in 1929; Pope Pius IX (1846–1878), the last ruler of the Papal States, was referred to as a \"prisoner in the Vatican\". Forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.[41]\n\n\n\n### Lateran treaties[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lateran Treaty\n\nThis situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by Prime Minister and Head of Government Benito Mussolini on behalf of King Victor Emmanuel III and by Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri for Pope Pius XI.[24][20][42] The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Catholic Christianity in Italy.[43]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vatican City in World War II\n\n![](image)Bands of the British army's 38th Brigade playing in front of St Peter's Basilica, June 1944\nThe Holy See, which ruled Vatican City, pursued a policy of neutrality during World War II, under the leadership of Pope Pius XII. Although German troops occupied the city of Rome after the September 1943 Armistice of Cassibile, and the Allies from 1944, they respected Vatican City as neutral territory.[44] One of the main diplomatic priorities of the bishop of Rome was to prevent the bombing of the city; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.[45] The British policy, as expressed in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting, was: \"that we should on no account molest the Vatican City, but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian government observed the rules of war\".[45]\n\n\nAfter the US entered into the war, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, but said that \"they could not stop the British from bombing Rome if the British so decided\". The US military even exempted Catholic pilots and crew from air raids on Rome and other Church holdings, unless voluntarily agreed upon. Notably, with the exception of Rome, and presumably the possibility of the Vatican, no Catholic US pilot or air crew refused a mission within German-held Italy. The British uncompromisingly said \"they would bomb Rome whenever the needs of the war demanded\".[46] In December 1942, the UK's envoy suggested to the Holy See that Rome be declared an \"open city\", a suggestion that the Holy See took more seriously than was probably meant by the UK, who did not want Rome to be an open city, but Mussolini rejected the suggestion when the Holy See put it to him. In connection with the Allied invasion of Sicily, 500 US aircraft bombed Rome on 19 July 1943, aiming particularly at the railway hub. Some 1,500 people were killed. Pius XII, who had been described in the previous month as \"worried sick\" about the possible bombing, viewed the aftermath. Another raid took place on 13 August 1943, after Mussolini had been ousted from power.[47] On the following day, the new government declared Rome an open city, after consulting the Holy See on the wording of the declaration, but the UK had decided that they would never recognise Rome as an open city.[48]\n\n\n\n### Post-war history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of St. Peter's Square from the top of Michelangelo's dome\nPius XII had refrained from creating cardinals during the war. By the end of World War II, there were several prominent vacancies: Cardinal Secretary of State, Camerlengo, Chancellor, and Prefect for the Congregation for the Religious among them.[49] Pius XII created 32 cardinals in early 1946, having announced his intention to do so in his preceding Christmas message.\n\n\nThe Pontifical Military Corps, except for the Swiss Guard, was disbanded by the will of Paul VI, as expressed in a letter of 14 September 1970.[50] The Gendarmerie Corps was transformed into a civilian police and security force.\n\n\nIn 1984, a new concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain provisions of the earlier treaty, including the position of Catholic Christianity as the Italian state religion, a position given to it by a statute of the Kingdom of Sardinia of 1848.[43]\n\n\nConstruction in 1995 of a new guest house, Domus Sanctae Marthae, adjacent to St Peter's Basilica was criticised by Italian environmental groups, backed by Italian politicians. They claimed the new building would block views of the Basilica from nearby Italian apartments.[51] For a short while the plans strained the relations between the Vatican and the Italian government. The head of the Vatican's Department of Technical Services robustly rejected challenges to the Vatican State's right to build within its borders.[51]\n\n\nJohn R. Morss writes in the *European Journal of International Law* that due to the terms of the Lateran Treaty, Vatican City's status as a sovereign state, and the Pope's status as a head of state, are problematic.[*clarification needed*][52]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

It is in this territory that St. Peter's Basilica, the Apostolic Palace, the Sistine Chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman *rione* of Borgo until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the river Tiber, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of Leo IV (847–855), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under Paul III (1534–1549), Pius IV (1559–1565), and Urban VIII (1623–1644).[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)Territory of Vatican City State according to the Lateran Treaty\nWhen the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.[54]\n\n\nThe territory includes St. Peter's Square, distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the Via della Conciliazione which runs from close to the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by Benito Mussolini after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.\n\n\nAccording to the Lateran Treaty, certain properties of the Holy See that are located in Italian territory, most notably the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo and the major basilicas, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign embassies.[55][56] These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.[56]\n\n\nCastel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by police agents of Vatican City State and not by Italian police. According to the Lateran Treaty (Art. 3) St. Peter's Square, up to but not including the steps leading to the basilica, is normally patrolled by the Italian police.[55]\n\n\nThere are no passport controls for visitors entering Vatican City from the surrounding Italian territory. There is free public access to Saint Peter's Square and Basilica and, on the occasion of papal general audiences, to the hall in which they are held. For these audiences and for major ceremonies in Saint Peter's Basilica and Square, tickets free of charge must be obtained beforehand. The Vatican Museums, incorporating the Sistine Chapel, usually charge an entrance fee. There is no general public access to the gardens, but guided tours for small groups can be arranged to the gardens and excavations under the basilica. Other places are open to only those individuals who have business to transact there.[57]\n\n\n\n![St. Peter's Square, the basilica and obelisk, from Piazza Pio XII](image)\nSt. Peter's Square, the basilica and obelisk, from Piazza Pio XII\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nVatican City's climate is the same as Rome's: a temperate, Mediterranean climate *Csa* with mild, rainy winters from October to mid-May and hot, dry summers from May to September. Some minor local features, principally mists and dews, are caused by the anomalous bulk of St Peter's Basilica, the elevation, the fountains, and the size of the large paved square. The highest temperature ever recorded was 40.7 °C (105.3 °F), on both 2 August 2017 and 27 June 2022.[58]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Vatican City *(data of Aeroporto Roma-Ciampino \"Giovan Battista Pastine\")* |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 37.8(100.0)\n | 39.4(102.9)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 38.4(101.1)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 30.3(86.5)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 8.2(46.8)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 24.1(75.4)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 11.3(52.3)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n | −4.4(24.1)\n | −5.6(21.9)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n | −5.2(22.6)\n | −4.8(23.4)\n | −11.0(12.2)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 67(2.6)\n | 73(2.9)\n | 58(2.3)\n | 81(3.2)\n | 53(2.1)\n | 34(1.3)\n | 19(0.7)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 73(2.9)\n | 113(4.4)\n | 115(4.5)\n | 81(3.2)\n | 804(31.7)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1 mm) | 7.0\n | 7.6\n | 7.6\n | 9.2\n | 6.2\n | 4.3\n | 2.1\n | 3.3\n | 6.2\n | 8.2\n | 9.7\n | 8.0\n | 79.4\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 120.9\n | 132.8\n | 167.4\n | 201.0\n | 263.5\n | 285.0\n | 331.7\n | 297.6\n | 237.0\n | 195.3\n | 129.0\n | 111.6\n | 2,472.8\n |\n| Source: https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/noaa-earth-had-its-third-warmest-year-record-2017 |\n\nIn July 2007, the Vatican accepted a proposal by two firms based respectively in San Francisco and Budapest,[61] whereby it would become the first carbon neutral state by offsetting its carbon dioxide emissions with the creation of a Vatican Climate Forest in Hungary,[62] as a purely symbolic gesture[63] to encourage Catholics to do more to safeguard the planet.[64] Nothing came of the project.[65][66]\n\n\nOn 26 November 2008, the Vatican itself put into effect a plan announced in May 2007 to cover the roof of the Paul VI Audience Hall with solar panels.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### Gardens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gardens of Vatican City\n\nWithin the territory of Vatican City are the Vatican Gardens (Italian: *Giardini Vaticani*),[69] which account for about half of this territory. The gardens, established during the Renaissance and Baroque era, are decorated with fountains and sculptures.\n\n\nThe gardens cover approximately 23 hectares (57 acres). The highest point is 60 metres (197 ft) above mean sea level. Stone walls bound the area in the north, south, and west.\n\n\nThe gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal Apostolic Palace.[70] In 1279, Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, 1277–1280) moved his residence back to the Vatican from the Lateran Palace and enclosed this area with walls.[71] He planted an orchard *(pomerium)*, a lawn *(pratellum)*, and a garden *(viridarium)*.[71]\n\n\n\n![A panorama of gardens and several buildings viewed from St. Peter's Basilica](image)\nPanorama of the gardens viewed from St. Peter's Basilica\n\n## Governance[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Vatican City\n\nThe politics of Vatican City takes place in the context of an absolute elective monarchy, in which the head of the Catholic Church holds power. The Pope exercises principal legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of Vatican City (an entity distinct from the Holy See), which is a rare case of a non-hereditary monarchy.\n\n\n\n### State and Holy See[edit]\n\n\nVatican City State, created in 1929 by the Lateran Pacts, provides the Holy See with a temporal jurisdiction and independence within a small territory. It is distinct from the Holy See. The state can thus be deemed a significant but not essential instrument of the Holy See. The Holy See itself has existed continuously as a juridical entity since Roman Imperial times and has been internationally recognised as a powerful and independent sovereign entity since Late Antiquity to the present, without interruption even at times when it was deprived of territory (e.g. 1870 to 1929).\n\n\nVatican City is one of the few widely recognised independent states that has not become a member of the United Nations.[72] The Holy See, which is distinct from Vatican City State, has permanent observer status, with all the rights of a full member except for a vote in the UN General Assembly.\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pope Francis in Vatican City, 2021\nThe government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The Pope is the sovereign of the state, while legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the president of that commission, assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the Pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches over Vatican City,[73]\nand is thus the only absolute monarch in Europe.[74]\n\n\nOperationally, there are departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications and other matters.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Sede vacante[edit]\n\n\nThe Cardinal Camerlengo presides over the Apostolic Camera, to which is entrusted the administration of the property and protection of other papal temporal powers and rights of the Holy See during the period of the empty throne or sede vacante (papal vacancy).[75] Those of the Vatican State remain under the control of the Pontifical Commission for the State of Vatican City. Acting with three other cardinals chosen by lot every three days, one from each order of cardinals (cardinal bishop, cardinal priest, and cardinal deacon), he in a sense performs during that period the functions of head of state of Vatican City.[76] All the decisions these four cardinals take must be approved by the College of Cardinals as a whole.\n\n\n\n#### Papal nobility[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Papal nobility\n\nThe nobility that was closely associated with the Holy See at the time of the Papal States continued to be associated with the Papal Court after the loss of these territories, generally with merely nominal duties (see Papal Master of the Horse, Prefecture of the Pontifical Household, Hereditary officers of the Roman Curia, Black Nobility). They also formed the ceremonial Noble Guard. In the first decades of the existence of the Vatican City State, executive functions were entrusted to some of them, including that of delegate for the State of Vatican City (now denominated president of the Commission for Vatican City). But with the motu proprio *Pontificalis Domus* of 28 March 1968,[77] Pope Paul VI abolished the honorary positions that had continued to exist until then, such as Quartermaster general and Master of the Horse.[78]\n\n\n\n### Head of state and government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pope and President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State\n\nSee also: List of Sovereigns of the Vatican City State\n\n![](image)The Apostolic Palace (*Palazzo Apostolico*), the official residence of the Pope. Here, Benedict XVI is at the window marked by a maroon banner hanging from the windowsill at centre.\nThe Pope is *ex officio* head of state[79] of Vatican City, a function dependent on his primordial function as bishop of the diocese of Rome and head of the Catholic Church.[80] The term \"Holy See\" refers not to the Vatican state but to the Pope's spiritual and pastoral governance, largely exercised through the Roman Curia.[81] His official title with regard to Vatican City is *Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City*.\n\n\nPope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was elected on 13 March 2013. His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City as well as the country's head of government is the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the Governor of Vatican City. Since 2001, the president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of president of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City. The president is Spanish Cardinal Fernando Vérgez Alzaga, who was appointed on 1 October 2021.\n\n\n\n### Administration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Vatican City\n\n![](image)Palace of the Governorate of Vatican City State\nLegislative functions are delegated to the unicameral Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, led by the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the Pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the Pope, through the Holy See's Secretariat of State, and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.\n\n\nExecutive authority is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City. The Governorate consists of the President of the Pontifical Commission—using the title \"President of the Governorate of Vatican City\"—a general secretary, and a Vice general secretary, each appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. Important actions of the Governorate must be confirmed by the Pontifical Commission and by the Pope through the Secretariat of State.\n\n\nThe Governorate oversees the central governmental functions through several departments and offices. The directors and officials of these offices are appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. These organs concentrate on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, records, transportation, and finances. The Governorate oversees a modern security and police corps, the *Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Città del Vaticano*.\n\n\nJudicial functions are delegated to a supreme court, an appellate court, a tribunal (Tribunal of Vatican City State), and a trial judge. At the Vatican's request, sentences imposed can be served in Italy (see the section on crime, below).\n\n\nThe international postal country code prefix is *SCV*, and the only postal code is *00120* – altogether *SCV-00120*.[82]\n\n\n\n### Defence and security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military in Vatican City, Pontifical Swiss Guard, Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City, and Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State\n\n![](image)A guard of the Vatican at his sentry box\nAs Vatican City is an enclave within Italy, its military defence is provided by the Italian Armed Forces. However, there is no formal defence treaty with Italy, as Vatican City is a neutral state. Vatican City has no armed forces of its own, although the Swiss Guard is a military corps of the Holy See responsible for the personal security of the Pope, and residents in the state. Soldiers of the Swiss Guard are entitled to hold Vatican City State passports and nationality. Swiss mercenaries were historically recruited by Popes as part of an army for the Papal States, and the Pontifical Swiss Guard was founded by Pope Julius II on 22 January 1506 as the Pope's personal bodyguard and continues to fulfill that function. It is listed in the *Annuario Pontificio* under \"Holy See\", not under \"State of Vatican City\". At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and Switzerland. All recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their basic training with the Swiss Armed Forces with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least 174 cm (5 ft 9 in) in height. Members are equipped with small arms and the traditional halberd (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics. The Palatine Guard and the Noble Guard, the last armed forces of the Vatican City State, were disbanded by Pope Paul VI in 1970.[50] As Vatican City has listed every building in its territory on the International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict theoretically renders it immune to armed attack.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gendarmerie car\nCivil defence is the responsibility of the Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State, the national fire brigade. Dating its origins to the early nineteenth century, the Corps in its present form was established in 1941. It is responsible for fire fighting, as well as a range of civil defence scenarios including flood, natural disaster, and mass casualty management. The Corps is governmentally supervised through the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence, which is also responsible for the Gendarmerie (see below).\n\n\nThe Gendarmerie Corps (*Corpo della Gendarmeria*) is the gendarmerie, or police and security force, of Vatican City and the extraterritorial properties of the Holy See.[84] The corps is responsible for security, public order, border control, traffic control, criminal investigation, and other general police duties in Vatican City including providing security for the Pope outside of Vatican City. The corps has 130 personnel and is a part of the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence (which also includes the Vatican Fire Brigade), an organ of the Governorate of Vatican City.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The crowds of tourists in St. Peter's Square are a target for pickpockets.\nCrime in Vatican City consists largely of purse snatching, pickpocketing and shoplifting by outsiders.[87] The tourist foot-traffic in St. Peter's Square is one of the main locations for pickpockets in Vatican City.[88] If crimes are committed in Saint Peter's Square, the perpetrators may be arrested and tried by the Italian authorities, since that area is normally patrolled by Italian police.[89]\n\n\nUnder the terms of article 22 of the Lateran Treaty,[90] Italy will, at the request of the Holy See, punish individuals for crimes committed within Vatican City and will itself proceed against the person who committed the offence, if that person takes refuge in Italian territory. Persons accused of crimes recognised as such both in Italy and in Vatican City that are committed in Italian territory will be handed over to the Italian authorities if they take refuge in Vatican City or in buildings that enjoy immunity under the treaty.[90][91]\n\n\nVatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention.[92] People convicted of committing crimes in the Vatican serve terms in Italian prisons (Polizia Penitenziaria), with costs covered by the Vatican.[93]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of the Holy See and List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See\n\n![](image)The *Ingresso di Sant'Anna*, an entrance to Vatican City from Italy\nVatican City State is a recognised national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into international agreements in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.\n\n\nBecause of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City—embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.\n\n\nThe size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.[94]\n\n\nHowever, Vatican City State itself participates in some international organizations whose functions relate to the state as a geographical entity, distinct from the non-territorial legal persona of the Holy See. These organizations are much less numerous than those in which the Holy See participates either as a member or with observer status. They include the following eight, in each of which Vatican City State holds membership:[95][96]\n\n\n\n* European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT)\n* European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Eutelsat IGO)\n* International Grains Council (IGC)\n* International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IIAS)\n* International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n* International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (ITSO)\n* Interpol[97]\n* Universal Postal Union (UPU)\n\n\nIt also participates in:[95]\n\n\n\n* World Medical Association\n* World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)\n\n\n### Non-party, non-signatory policy[edit]\n\n\nThe Vatican City is not a member of the United Nations (UN), but was granted observer status to the United Nations General Assembly in 1968; the only other country in a similar position is the partially recognised State of Palestine. Since it is not a member of the UN, the Vatican City is not subjected to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It does, however, engage with various UN specialised agencies through its observer status including the Central Emergency Response Fund, to which it contributed US$20,000 between 2006 and 2022.[98]\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is not a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC). In Europe, only Belarus is also a non-party, non-signatory state, while Ukraine and Monaco are signatory states that have not ratified and Russia withdrew from it in 2016.\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is not a member of the European Court of Human Rights. Among European states, Belarus is also not a member, while Russia has ceased to be part of it after being expelled from the Council of Europe following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\nThe OECD's \"Common Reporting Standard\" (CRS), aiming at preventing tax evasion and money laundering, has also not been signed.[99][100][101] The Vatican City State has been criticised for money laundering practises in the past decades.[102][103][104] The only other country in Europe that has not agreed to sign the CRS is Belarus.\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is also one of few countries in the world that does not provide any publicly available financial data to the International Monetary Fund.[105]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Vatican City\n\nThe Vatican City State budget includes the Vatican Museums and post office and is supported financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales.[j] The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.[106] Other industries include printing, the production of mosaics, and the manufacture of staff uniforms. There is a Vatican Pharmacy.\n\n\n\n![](image)Vatican Museums' \"New Wing\", built by Raffaele Stern (1774–1820)\nThe Institute for Works of Religion (IOR, *Istituto per le Opere di Religione*), also known as the Vatican Bank, is a financial agency situated in the Vatican that conducts worldwide financial activities. It has multilingual ATMs with instructions in Latin, possibly the only ATM in the world with this feature.[107]\n\n\nVatican City issues its own coins and stamps. It has used the euro as its currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European Union (council decision 1999/98/EC). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002—the Vatican does not issue euro banknotes. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.[108] Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.[109] Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own Vatican lira currency, which was on par with the Italian lira.\n\n\nVatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7 million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15 million euros.[110]\n\n\nIn 2012, the US Department of State's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy, and Russia.[111]\n\n\nOn 24 February 2014, the Vatican announced it was establishing a secretariat for the economy, to be responsible for all economic, financial, and administrative activities of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, headed by Cardinal George Pell. This followed the charging of two senior clerics including a monsignor with money laundering offences. Pope Francis also appointed an auditor-general authorised to carry out random audits of any agency at any time and engaged a US financial services company to review the Vatican's 19,000 accounts to ensure compliance with international money laundering practices. The pontiff also ordered that the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See would be the Vatican's central bank, with responsibilities similar to other central banks around the world.[112]\n\n\nIn 2022, the Vatican planned to release NFTs of its museum collection.[113]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Women in Vatican City\n\nAs of 2023, Vatican City had a population of 764 residents, regardless of citizenship.[13] There were also 372 Vatican citizens residing elsewhere,[13] consisting of diplomats of the Holy See to other countries and cardinals residing in Rome.[114]\n\n\nThe population is composed of clergy, other religious members, laypeople serving the state (such as the Swiss Guard) and their family members.[115] In 2013 there were 13 families of the employees of the Holy See living in Vatican City,[116] in 2019 there were 20 children of the Swiss Guards living at the Vatican.[117] All citizens, residents and places of worship in the city are Catholic. The city also receives thousands of tourists and workers every day.\n\n\n\nVatican City population on 26 June 2023[13]\n| Sex | all\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |\n| Cardinals | 55 | 9 |  |\n| Diplomats | 317 |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 104 |  |\n| Others |  | 132 | 518\n |\n| Total | 618 | 518\n |\n| 372 | 246\n |\n| 764\n |\n| 1,136\n |\n\nVatican City population on 1 March 2011[115]\n| Sex | all | male | female\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other | Vatican | other | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |  | 1 |  |  |  |  |\n| Cardinals | 43 | 30 |  | 43 | 30 |  |  |  |  |\n| Diplomats | 306 |  |  | 306 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 86 |  |  | 86 |  |  |  |  |\n| Other religious |  | 50 | 197 |  | 49 | 102 |  | 1 | 95\n |\n| Other lay |  | 56 | 24 |  | 25 | 3 |  | 31 | 21\n |\n| Total | 572 | 221 | 540 | 105 | 32 | 116\n |\n| 349 | 223 | 349 | 191 |  | 32\n |\n| 444 | 296 | 148\n |\n| 793 | 645 | 148\n |\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Languages of Vatican City\n\n![](image)The Seal of Vatican City. Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh. The official websites of the Holy See[119] and of Vatican City[120] are primarily in Italian, with versions of their pages in a large number of languages to varying extents.\n\n\n\n### Citizenship[edit]\n\n\nUnlike citizenship of other states, which is based either on *jus sanguinis* (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on *jus soli* (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted on *jus officii*, namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.[114] Some individuals are also authorized to reside in the city but do not qualify or choose not to request citizenship.[114] Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an Italian citizen as provided in the Lateran Treaty.[55]\n\n\nThe Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.\n\n\n\n### Statistical oddities[edit]\n\n\nIn statistics comparing countries in various per capita or per area metrics, Vatican City is often an outlier—these can stem from the state's small size and ecclesiastical function.[121] For example, as most of the roles which would confer citizenship are reserved for men, the gender ratio of the citizenship is several men per woman.[122] Further oddities are petty crimes against tourists resulting in a very high per-capita crime rate,[123] and the city-state leading the world in per-capita wine consumption due to its sacramental use.[121] A jocular illustration of these anomalies is sometimes made by calculating a \"Popes per km2\" statistic, which is greater than two because the country is less than half a square kilometre in area.[124]\n\n\n\n![360-degree view from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking over the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square (centre) and out into Rome, showing Vatican City in all directions](image)\n360-degree view from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking over the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square (centre) and out into Rome, showing Vatican City in all directions\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Vatican City\n\nSee also: Music of Vatican City and Sport in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The Vatican Museums (*Musei Vaticani*) display works from the extensive collection of the Catholic Church.\nVatican City is home to some of the most famous art in the world. St. Peter's Basilica, whose successive architects include Bramante, Michelangelo, Giacomo della Porta, Maderno and Bernini, is a renowned work of Renaissance architecture. The Sistine Chapel is famous for its frescos, which include works by Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Botticelli as well as the ceiling and Last Judgment by Michelangelo. Artists who decorated the interiors of the Vatican include Raphael and Fra Angelico.\n\n\nThe Vatican Apostolic Library and the collections of the Vatican Museums are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance.[125] In 1984, the Vatican was added by UNESCO to the List of World Heritage Sites; it is the only one to consist of an entire state.[126] Furthermore, it is the only site to date registered with the UNESCO as a *centre containing monuments* in the \"International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection\" according to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.[126]\n\n\nFootball in Vatican City is organized by the Vatican Amateur Sports Association, which holds the national championship, called the Vatican City Championship, with eight teams, including, for example, the Swiss Guard's FC Guardia and police and museum guard teams.[127] The association also organizes the Coppa Sergio Valci and the Vatican Supercoppa. It controls the Vatican City national football team, which is neither affiliated with UEFA or FIFA.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The shortest national railway system in the world\nVatican City has a reasonably well-developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). As a state that is 1.05 kilometres (1,150 yards) long and 0.85 km (930 yd) wide,[128] it has a small transportation system with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the Vatican City Heliport. Vatican City is one of the few independent countries without an airport, and is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport and to a lesser extent Ciampino Airport.[129]\n\n\nThere is a standard gauge railway, mainly used to transport freight, connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an 852-metre-long (932 yd) spur, 300 metres (330 yd) of which is within Vatican territory.[129] Pope John XXIII was the first Pope to make use of the railway; Pope John Paul II rarely used it.[129]\n\n\nThe closest metro station is Ottaviano – San Pietro – Musei Vaticani.[130]\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican's post office was established on 11 February 1929.\nThe City is served by an independent, modern telephone system named the Vatican Telephone Service,[131] and a postal system (Poste Vaticane) that started operating on 13 February 1929. On 1 August, the state started to release its own postal stamps, under the authority of the Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State.[132] The city's postal service is sometimes said to be \"the best in the world\",[133] and faster than the postal service in Rome.[133]\n\n\nThe Vatican also controls its own Internet top-level domain, which is registered as (.va). Broadband service is widely provided within Vatican City. Vatican City has also been given a radio ITU prefix, HV, and this is sometimes used by amateur radio operators.\n\n\nVatican Radio, which was organised by Guglielmo Marconi, broadcasts on short-wave, medium-wave and FM frequencies and on the Internet.[134] Its main transmission antennae are located in Italian territory, and exceed Italian environmental protection levels of emission. For this reason, the Vatican Radio has been sued. Television services are provided through another entity, the Vatican Television Center.[135]\n\n\n*L'Osservatore Romano* is the multilingual semi-official newspaper of the Holy See. It is published by a private corporation under the direction of Catholic laymen, but reports on official information. However, the official texts of documents are in the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*, the official gazette of the Holy See, which has an appendix for documents of the Vatican City State.\n\n\nVatican Radio, the Vatican Television Center, and L'Osservatore Romano are organs not of the Vatican State but of the Holy See, and are listed as such in the *Annuario Pontificio*, which places them in the section \"Institutions linked with the Holy See\", ahead of the sections on the Holy See's diplomatic service abroad and the diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See, after which is placed the section on the State of Vatican City.\n\n\n\n### Recycling[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the Vatican began an \"ecological island\" for renewable waste and has continued the initiative throughout the papacy of Francis. These innovations included, for example, the installation of a solar power system on the roof of the Paul VI Audience Hall. In July 2019, it was announced that Vatican City would ban the use and sale of single-use plastics as soon as its supply was depleted, well before the 2021 deadline established by the European Union. It is estimated that 50–55% of Vatican City's municipal solid waste is properly sorted and recycled, with the goal of reaching the EU standard of 70–75%.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Vatican City portal\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Architecture of Vatican City\n* Holy city\n* Index of Vatican City-related articles\n* Law of Vatican City\n* News.va\n* Outline of Vatican City\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish.

Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund known as Peter's Pence, which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief and aid to churches in developing nations.\n\n### Citation notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Reuters Staff (6 October 2014). \"Pope ditches Latin as official language of Vatican synod\". *Reuters*.\n2. **^** \"What language is spoken at the Vatican?\". *Visiting The Vatican*. 13 April 2023.

It is bordered by France to the north, east and west. The principality is home to 38,682 residents,[11] of whom 9,486 are Monégasque nationals;[12] it is widely recognised as one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world.[13][14] The official language of the principality is French. In addition, Monégasque (a dialect of Ligurian), English and Italian are spoken and understood by many residents.[b]\n\n\nWith an area of 2.02 km2 (0.78 sq mi), it is the second-smallest sovereign state in the world, after Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants /km2 (49,230/sq mi) make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world. Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi) and the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi);[15] it has a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The highest point in the state is a narrow pathway named Chemin des Révoires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les Révoires ward, which is 161 m (528 ft) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the border with Italy.[16] Since 2013, it consists of nine administrative wards, the largest of which is Monte Carlo (Monte Carlo/Spélugues, 0.44 km2 (0.17 sq mi)), and the most populous of which is Larvotto (Larvotto/Bas Moulins, 5,443 residents as of 2008). Through ongoing land reclamation, started in 1861 and accelerating in the 1960s, Monaco's small land mass has expanded by 20 per cent.\n\n\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state, who wields immense political power despite his constitutional status. The prime minister, who is the head of government, can be either a Monégasque or a French citizen; the monarch consults with the Government of France before an appointment. Key members of the judiciary in Monaco are detached French magistrates.[17] The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297.[18] The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France, besides maintenance of two small military units.\n\n\nMonaco's economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the state's first casino, the Monte Carlo Casino, and a railway connection to Paris.[19] Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. Monaco is famous as a tax haven, as the principality has no personal income tax (except for French citizens) and low business taxes. Over 30% of the residents are millionaires,[20] with real estate prices reaching €100,000 ($116,374) per square metre in 2018. Monaco is considered a global hub of money laundering, and in February 2023 was placed under review by the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force watchdog, with the threat of being placed on its 'grey list', for its failures in financial supervision and reform to inhibit global criminality and terrorism financing.[21]\n\n\nMonaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency; before, it used the Monegasque franc, which was pegged, and exchangeable with, the French franc until 1 January 2002. Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004 and is a member of the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie* (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race, the Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One. The local motorsports association gives name to the Monte Carlo Rally, hosted in January in the French Alps. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, which competes in the French Ligue 1 and have become French champions on multiple occasions, and a basketball team, which plays in the EuroLeague. A centre of research into marine conservation, Monaco is home to one of the world's first protected marine habitats,[22] an Oceanographic Museum, and the International Atomic Energy Agency Environment Labs, which is the only marine laboratory in the United Nations structure.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Monaco\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as *Monoikos*, from the Greek \"μόνοικος\", \"single house\", from \"μόνος\" (*monos*) \"alone, single\"[24] + \"οἶκος\" (*oikos*) \"house\".[25] According to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods.[26] As a result, a temple was constructed there. Because this \"House\" of Hercules was the only temple in the area, the city was called Monoikos.[27][28] It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese.\n\n\nAn ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia.\n\n\nIn the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it resulted in the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent. It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.\n\n\n\n### Arrival of the Grimaldi family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rainier I, victor of the naval battle at Zierikzee and first sovereign Grimaldi ruler of Monaco\nFollowing a grant of land from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa.[29][30] Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"*Malizia*\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan friars – a *monaco* in Italian – although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.[31]\n\n\nFrancesco was evicted a few years later by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over \"the Rock\" continued for another century.[32] The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. The Genoese engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco after fighting the Crown of Aragon over Corsica.[33] Aragon eventually became part of a united Spain, and other parts of the land grant came to be integrated piecemeal into other states. Between 1346 and 1355, Monaco annexed the towns of Menton and Roquebrune, increasing its territory by almost ten times.[33]\n\n\n\n### 1400–1800[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Monaco (as part of the Republic of Genoa) in 1494\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612, Honoré II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco.[34] In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII as a \"duc et pair étranger\".[35]\n\n\nThe princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes.[36] Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris, and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is Italian. The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution.[37]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of the County of Nice showing the area of the Italian kingdom of Sardinia annexed in 1860 to France (light brown). The area in red had already become part of France before 1860\nIn 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and until 1814 it was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French armies under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte).[35][38]\nThe principality was reestablished in 1814 under the Grimaldis, only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815.[38] Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality; the surrounding County of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France.[39] Monaco became a French protectorate once again.\n\n\nBefore this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence, hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.[40]\n\n\nThese were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs.[41] The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents—an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino.[42] This made Monaco not only a playground for the rich, but a favoured place for them to live.[43]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mayor of Monaco announcing concessions, ending the absolute monarchy of Prince Albert I in 1910\nUntil the Monégasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 Constitution of Monaco, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers.[44] The new constitution slightly reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I soon suspended it during the First World War.\n\n\nIn July 1918, a new Franco-Monégasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monégasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military and economic interests. It also resolved the Monaco succession crisis.\n\n\n\n![](image)The marriage of actress Grace Kelly to Prince Rainier III brought media attention to the principality.\nIn 1943, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a fascist administration.[45] In September 1943, after Mussolini's fall from power, the German Wehrmacht occupied Italy and Monaco, and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. René Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opéra in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to Auschwitz, where he was later murdered.[46] Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the Opéra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland.[47] In August 1944, the Germans executed René Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.\n\n\nRainier III, succeeded to the throne on the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949, and then ruled until 2005. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly, an event that was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.[48]\n\n\nA 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties. In 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French citizens.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations, with full voting rights.[39][49]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of Monaco in 2016\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defense is still the responsibility of France.[50][51]\n\n\nOn 31 March 2005, Rainier III, who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.[52] He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco. Following a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005,[53] in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Monégasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville.[54] On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"[55]\n\n\nIn 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily to accommodate desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.[56] Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but had called it off.[56] The plan is for about six hectares (15 acres) of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices to a land value of about 1 billion euros.[57] The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.[57][58] There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses.[59] The name for the new district is Anse du Portier.[58]\n\n\nOn 29 February 2020, Monaco announced its first case of COVID-19, a man who was admitted to the Princess Grace Hospital Centre then transferred to Nice University Hospital in France.[60][61]\n\n\nOn 3 September 2020, the first Monégasque satellite, OSM-1 CICERO, was launched into space from French Guiana, France aboard a Vega rocket.[62] The satellite was built in Monaco by Orbital Solutions Monaco.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of Monaco from the *Tête de Chien* (Dog's Head) high rock promontory\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo of the princely government of Monaco\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Monaco\n\n![](image)Albert II, Prince of Monaco\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state.[63] The executive branch consists of a Prime Minister as the head of government, who presides over the other five members of the Council of Government.[64] Until 2002, the Prime Minister was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the Government of France; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Prime Minister can be French or Monégasque.[29] On 1 September 2020, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Pierre Dartout, to the office.[65]\n\n\nUnder the 1962 Constitution of Monaco, the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council.[66] The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation.[67] All legislation requires the approval of the National Council. Following the 2023 Monegasque general election, all 24 seats are held by the pro-monarchist Monegasque National Union.[68] The principality's city affairs are directed by the Communal Council,[69] which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor.[70] Georges Marsan has been mayor since 2003. Unlike the National Council, communal councillors are elected for four-year terms[71] and are strictly non-partisan; oppositions inside the council frequently form.[69][72]\n\n\nMembers of the judiciary of Monaco are appointed by the Sovereign Prince. Key positions within the judiciary are held by French magistrates, proposed by the Government of France. Monaco currently has three examining magistrates.[73]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Law enforcement in Monaco\n\n![](image)Palace guards in Monaco\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 38,000 people) and police presences in the world.[74] Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats jointly with the military. Police forces in Monaco are commanded by a French officer.[75]\n\n\nThere is also a small military force. This consists of a bodyguard unit for the prince and his palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers);[76] together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence corps (Sapeurs-Pompiers) it forms Monaco's total forces.[77] The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honoré IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the non-commissioned officers and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army. In addition to their guard duties as described, the carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.[78]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Land reclamation in Monaco\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Monaco, with the France–Monaco border shown in yellow\nMonaco is a sovereign city-state, with five quarters and ten wards,[79] located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes department on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice.[49]\n\n\nIt has an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 ha (510 acres), and a population of 38,400,[80] making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world.[49] The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi),[80] a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 km (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).[81][82]\n\n\nThe highest point in the country is at the access to the *Patio Palace* residential building on the Chemin des Révoires (ward Les Révoires) from the D6007 (*Moyenne Corniche* street) at 164.4 m (539 ft) above sea level.[83] The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.[84]\n\n\nSaint-Jean brook is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 m; 0.12 mi; 620 ft) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (5,000 m2; 0 acres; 54,000 sq ft) in area.[85] Monaco's most populated *quartier* is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.[86]\n\n\nAfter a recent[*when?*] expansion of Port Hercules,[87] Monaco's total area grew to 2.08 km2 (0.80 sq mi) or 208 ha (510 acres);[86] subsequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 ha (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille.[88][89][90][87][91] There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille.[92] There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.[92] Monaco's only natural resource is fishing;[93] with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of La Condamine and Monte Carlo\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In the centre is La Condamine. At the right with the smaller harbour is Fontvieille, with The Rock (the old town, fortress, and Palace) jutting out between the two harbours. At the left are the high-rise buildings of La Rousse/Saint Roman.\n![](image)Enlargeable, detailed map of Monaco\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller.[94] Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world.[95] The state consists of only one municipality (*commune*), the Municipality of Monaco. There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.[65] According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:[96]\n\n\n\n* Monaco-Ville, the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco, or simply \"The Rock\";\n* Monte Carlo, the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast;\n* La Condamine, the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules.\n\n\nThe municipalities were merged into one in 1917,[97][*how?*] and they were accorded the status of *Wards* or *Quartiers* thereafter.\n\n\n\n* Fontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s;\n* Moneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine;\n* Larvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo;\n* La Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le Ténao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.\n\n\nSubsequently, three additional wards were created, but then again were dissolved in 2013:\n\n\n\n* Saint Michel, created from part of Monte Carlo;\n* La Colle, created from part of La Condamine;\n* Les Révoires, also created from part of La Condamine.\n\n\nMost of Saint Michel became part of Monte Carlo again in 2013. La Colle and Les Révoires were merged the same year as part of a redistricting process, where they became part of the larger Jardin Exotique ward. An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014[98] but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time.[99] Prince Albert II in mid-2010 firmly restarted the programme.[100][101] In 2015, a new development called Anse du Portier was announced.[58]\n\n\n\n#### Traditional quarters and modern geographic areas[edit]\n\n\nThe four traditional *quartiers* of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille.[102] The suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth *Quartier* of Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.[103]\n\n\n\n#### Wards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wards of Monaco\nFor town planning purposes, a sovereign ordinance in 1966 divided the principality into reserved sectors, \"whose current character must be preserved\", and wards. The number and boundaries of these sectors and wards have been modified several times. The latest division dates from 2013 and created two reserved sectors and seven wards. A new 6-hectare district, Le Portier, is currently being built on the sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wards | Area\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| in m² | in %\n |\n| **Reserved Sectors** |\n| Monaco-Ville | Reserved Sectors\n | 196,491 | 9,7 %\n |\n| Ravin de Sainte-Dévote | Reserved Sectors\n | 23,485 | 1,2 %\n |\n| **Wards** |\n| La Condamine | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 295,843 | 14,6 %\n |\n| Fontvieille | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 329,516 | 16,3 %\n |\n| Larvotto | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 217,932 | 10,8 %\n |\n| Jardin Exotique | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 234,865 | 11,6 %\n |\n| Les Moneghetti | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 115,196 | 5,7 %\n |\n| Monte-Carlo | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 436,760 | 21,5 %\n |\n| La Rousse | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 176,888 | 8,7 %\n |\n| Total\n | 2,026,976 | 100,0 %\n |\n\n\n*Note: for statistical purposes, the Wards of Monaco are further subdivided into 178 city blocks (îlots), which are comparable to the census blocks in the United States*.[86]\n\n\n\n* Another possibility was Fontvieille II Development to commence in 2013[104][105]\n\n\n![](image)Land reclamation in Monaco since 1861\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Monaco and Monaco villas\n\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle Époque. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878–9 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids. These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought and still seeks, to portray itself.[106] This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements were incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order.[107] In recent years[*when?*] the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay.[108] The principality has no heritage protection legislation.[109]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: *Csa*), with strong maritime influences, with some resemblances to the humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*). As a result, it has balmy warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The winters are very mild considering the city's latitude, being as mild as locations located much further south in the Mediterranean Basin.[110] Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 °C or 86 °F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 °C (68 °F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years.[111][112] On 27 February 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.[113]\n\n\n\n|

highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742, GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150.[117][118][119] It also has an unemployment rate of 2%,[120] with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day.[86] According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate[121] and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world.[122] For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.[123][124][125] Although the average price went down in 2020, to an average price of $53,378 per square metre, Monaco remains one of the most expensive places in the world to buy property.[126]\nThe world's most expensive apartment is located in Monaco, a penthouse at the Odeon Tower valued at $335 million according to *Forbes* in 2016.[127]\n\n\nOne of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casinos and pleasant climate.[82][128] It has also become a major banking center, holding over €100 billion worth of funds.[129] Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services.[130] Monaco is the only place in Europe where credit card points are not redeemable. Hotel points are not able to be accumulated nor are transactions recorded, allowing for an increase in privacy that is sought by many of the locals. The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics.[*failed verification*][121]\n\n\nThe state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network (Monaco Telecom) used to be fully owned by the state. Its monopoly now comprises only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Monégasque de Banque (6%). Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.[131]\n\n\nMonaco is not a member of the European Union, but very closely linked via a customs union with France. As such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc. Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.\n\n\n\n### Gambling industry[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Monte Carlo Casino\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.[29] All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III. The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money.\n\n\nThe towns of Menton and Roquebrune, which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much-improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to the Sardinian intervention and clamoured for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.\n\n\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates François and Louis Blanc for 1.7 million francs.\n\n\nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelugues (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\"[132] They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savoury elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\n\n\nThe Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.[133] Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses.[134] In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House, 46 hotels were built and the number of jewellers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold. In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Monégasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.[135] By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques—a masterstroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\n\n\nToday, Société des bains de mer de Monaco, which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Café de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent[*when?*] addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino, which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea; among other things, it offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" (TITO). It is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.[136]\n\n\n\n### Low taxes[edit]\n\n\nMonaco has a 20% VAT plus high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).[137]\n\n\nMonaco has never levied income tax on individuals,[88] and foreigners are thus able to use it as a \"tax haven\" from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obliged to pay taxes to other countries.[138][139]\n\n\nThe absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco. Celebrities, such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.[140]\n\n\nPer a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.[141] The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco. Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.[88]\n\n\nIn 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens.[142] Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands. The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.[143][144] Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions. In 2009, Monaco went a step further and secured a place on the \"white list\" after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.[88]\n\n\nIn 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. Difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\"[145]\n\n\nAlso in 2000, a report by French politicians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering including within its casino and that the Government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated.[146] In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven,[147] but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.[148][149]\n\n\nThe Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned to implement the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.[150]\n\n\n\n### Numismatics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Monégasque franc, Monégasque euro coins, and Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Monaco)\n\n![](image)1978 Monégasque franc coin with an effigy of Rainier III\nMonaco issued its own coins in various devaluations connected to the écu already in the seventeenth century, but its first decimal coins of the Monégasque franc were issued in 1837 continued until 2001.\n\n\nAlthough Monaco is not a European Union member, it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins, which was introduced in 2002.[151] In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins.[152] Three different designs were selected for the Monégasque coins.[153] The design was changed in 2006 after Prince Rainier's death to feature the effigy of Prince Albert.[153]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nPopulation of Monaco by nationality\n\n\n\nFrench (28.4%)\nMonégasque (21.6%)\nItalian (18.7%)\nBritish (7.5%)\nBelgian (2.8%)\nGerman (2.5%)\nSwiss (2.5%)\nAmerican (1.2%)\nOther (14.8%)\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Monaco\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015, and estimated by the United Nations to be 36,297 as of 1 July 2023.[154][155] Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Monégasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Monégasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).[156] According to 2019 studies, 31% of Monaco’s population is reported to be millionaires equalling up to 12,248 individuals \n\n\nCitizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called *Monégasque*. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.[157][158]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Monaco\n\n![](image)Street sign in French and Monégasque in Monaco-Ville\nThe main and official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Monégasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Monégasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Monégasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is also used.\n\n\nItalian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.[159] This was due to the annexation of the surrounding County of Nice to France following the Treaty of Turin (1860).[159]\n\n\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, are of Ligurian origin; thus, the traditional national language is Monégasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Monégasque.[160][161]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Monaco according to the *Global Religious Landscape* survey by the Pew Forum, 2012[3]\n\n\n\nChristianity (86%)\nUnaffiliated (11.7%)\nJudaism (1.7%)\nIslam (0.4%)\nOther religions (0.2%)\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.[3]\n\n\nAccording to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholic Christians are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians. The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church. There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n\n#### Catholicism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Catholic Church in Monaco\n\n![](image)Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate\n![](image)Sainte-Dévote Chapel\nThe official religion is Catholicism, with freedom of other religions guaranteed by the constitution.[2] There are five Catholic parish churches in Monaco and one cathedral, which is the seat of the archbishop of Monaco.\n\n\nThe diocese, which has existed since the mid-19th century, was raised to a non-metropolitan archbishopric in 1981 as the Archdiocese of Monaco and remains exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See). The patron saint is Saint Devota.\n\n\n\n#### Anglican Communion[edit]\n\n\nThere is one Anglican church (St Paul's Church), located in the Avenue de Grande Bretagne in Monte Carlo. The church was dedicated in 1925. In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglican residents in the principality but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books.[162] The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe.\n\n\n\n#### Reformed Church of Monaco[edit]\n\n\nThere is one Reformed church, which meets in a building located in Rue Louis Notari. The building dates from 1958–59. The church is affiliated with the United Protestant Church of France (Église Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a group that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (Église Réformée de France). Through this affiliation with EPUF, the church is part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The church acts as a host church to some other Christian communities, allowing them to use its building.\n\n\n\n#### Charismatic Episcopal Church[edit]\n\n\nThe Monaco Parish of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (Parish of St Joseph) dates from 2017 and meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n\n#### Christian Fellowship[edit]\n\n\nThe Monaco Christian Fellowship, formed in 1996, meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n\n#### Greek Orthodoxy[edit]\n\n\nMonaco's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report states that there is one Greek Orthodox church in Monaco.\n\n\n\n#### Russian Orthodox[edit]\n\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Parish of the Holy Royal Martyrs meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n\n### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nThe Association Culturelle Israélite de Monaco (founded in 1948) is a converted house containing a synagogue, a community Hebrew school, and a kosher food shop, located in Monte Carlo.[163] The community mainly consists of retirees from Britain (40%) and North Africa. Half of the Jewish population is Sephardic, mainly from North Africa, while the other half is Ashkenazi.[164]\n\n\n\n### Islam[edit]\n\n\nThe Muslim population of Monaco consists of about 280 people, most of whom are residents, not citizens.[165] The majority of the Muslim population of Monaco are Arabs, though there is a Turkish minority as well.[166] Monaco does not have any official mosques.[167]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n### Formula One[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Monaco Grand Prix\n\n![](image)Formation lap for the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix\nSince 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix has been held annually in the streets of Monaco.[168] It is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. The erection of the Circuit de Monaco takes six weeks to complete and the removal after the race takes another three weeks.[168]\n\n\nThe circuit is narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track.[169] Driver Nelson Piquet compared driving the circuit to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".\n\n\nDespite the challenging nature of the course it has only had two fatalities, Luigi Fagioli who died from injuries received in practice for the 1952 Monaco Grand Prix (run to sports car regulations that year, not Formula 1)[170] and Lorenzo Bandini, who crashed, burned and died three days later from his injuries in 1967.[171] Two other drivers had lucky escapes after they crashed into the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and Paul Hawkins, during the 1965 race.[168]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Monaco Grand Prix was cancelled for the first time since 1954 because of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n#### Monégasque Formula 1 drivers[edit]\n\n\nThere have been five Formula One drivers from Monaco:\n\n\n\n* Charles Leclerc (2018–present)\n* Robert Doornbos (2005, Dutch driver under a Monégasque license)\n* Olivier Beretta (1994)\n* André Testut (1958–1959)\n* Louis Chiron (1950–1958)\n\n\n### Formula E[edit]\n\n\nStarting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix[172] and used a shorter configuration of the full Formula 1 circuit, keeping it around Port Hercules until 2021.\n\n\nROKiT Venturi Racing is the only motor racing team based in the principality, headquartered in Fontvieille.[173] The marque competes in Formula E and was one of the founding teams of the fully-electric championship. Managed by former racing drivers Susie Wolff (CEO) and Jérôme d'Ambrosio (Team Principal),[174] the outfit holds 16 podiums in the series to date including five victories. 1997 Formula One World Champion Jacques Villeneuve and eleven-time Formula One race winner Felipe Massa have raced for the team previously.[175][176] Ten-time Macau winner and 2021 vice World Champion Edoardo Mortara and Season 3 Formula E champion Lucas di Grassi currently race for the team.[177]\n\n\n\n### Monte Carlo Rally[edit]\n\n\nSince 1911 part of the Monte Carlo Rally has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of Prince Albert I. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organised by Automobile Club de Monaco. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in rallying and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the World Rally Championship (WRC).[178] From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge.[179] The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since.[180] Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football in Monaco\n\n![](image)Stade Louis II, home of AS Monaco FC\nMonaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, AS Monaco FC, and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the Stade Louis II and competes in Ligue 1, the first division of French football. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016–17) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, with a team that included Dado Pršo, Fernando Morientes, Jérôme Rothen, Akis Zikos and Ludovic Giuly, but lost 3–0 to Portuguese team FC Porto. French World Cup-winners Thierry Henry, Fabien Barthez, David Trezeguet, and Kylian Mbappe have played for the club. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual UEFA Super Cup from 1998–2012 between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\n\n\nThe women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's French football league system. The club plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the Division 1 Féminine, in the 1994–95 season, but was quickly relegated.\n\n\nThe Monaco national football team represents the nation in association football and is controlled by the Monégasque Football Federation, the governing body for football in Monaco. Monaco is one of two sovereign states in Europe (along with the Vatican City) that is not a member of UEFA and so does not take part in any UEFA European Football Championship or FIFA World Cup competitions. They are instead affiliated with CONIFA, where they compete against other national teams that are not FIFA members. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.\n\n\n\n### Rugby[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rugby union in Monaco\n\nMonaco's national rugby team, as of April 2019, is 101st in the World Rugby Rankings.[181]\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nMulti-sport club AS Monaco owns AS Monaco Basket which was founded in 1928. They play in the top-tier European basketball league, the EuroLeague, and the French top flight, the LNB Pro A. They have three Pro A Leaders Cup, two Pro B (2nd-tier), and one NM1 (3rd-tier) championship. They play in Salle Gaston Médecin, which is part of Stade Louis II.\n\n\n\n### Professional boxing[edit]\n\n\nDue in part to its position both as a tourist and gambling centre, Monaco has staged major professional boxing world title and non title fights from time to time; those include the Carlos Monzon versus Nino Benvenuti rematch,[182] Monzon's rematch with Emile Griffith,[183] Monzon's two classic fights with Rodrigo Valdes,[184][185] Davey Moore versus Wilfredo Benitez,[186] the double knockout-ending classic between Lee Roy Murphy and Chisanda Mutti (won by Murphy),[187] and Julio César Chávez, Sr. versus Rocky Lockridge.[188] All of the aforementioned contests took place at the first Stade Louis II or the second Stade Louis II stadiums.\n\n\n\n### Other sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A view of the 2011 Monaco Porsche Supercup. Motor racing is very popular, with one course encompassing almost the whole country.\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is held annually in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, as a professional tournament for men as part of tennis's ATP Masters Series.[189] The tournament has been held since 1897. Golf's Monte Carlo Open was also held at the Monte Carlo Golf Club at Mont Agel in France between 1984 and 1992.\n\n\nMonaco has a national Davis Cup team, which plays in the European/African Zone.\n\n\nMonaco has also competed in the Olympic Games, although, no athlete from Monaco has ever won an Olympic medal. At the Youth Olympic Winter Games, Monaco won a bronze medal in bobsleigh.\n\n\nThe 2009 Tour de France, the world's premier cycle race, started from Monaco with a 15 km (9 mi) closed-circuit individual time trial starting and finishing there on the first day, and the 182 km (113 mi) second leg starting there on the following day and ending in Brignoles, France.[190]\n\n\nMonaco has also staged part of the Global Champions Tour (International Show-jumping).[191] In 2009, the Monaco stage of the Global Champions tour took place between 25 and 27 June.\n\n\nThe Monaco Marathon is the only marathon in the world to pass through three countries, those of Monaco, France and Italy, before the finish at the Stade Louis II.\n\n\nThe Monaco Ironman 70.3 triathlon race is an annual event with over 1,000 athletes competing and attracts top professional athletes from around the world. The race includes a 1.9 km (1.2 mi) swim, 90 km (56 mi) bike ride and 21.1 km (13.1 mi) run.\n\n\nSince 1993, the headquarters of the International Association of Athletics Federations,[192] the world governing body of athletics, is located in Monaco.[193] An IAAF Diamond League meet is annually held at Stade Louis II.[194]\n\n\nA municipal sports complex, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium in the Port Hercules district consists of a heated saltwater Olympic-size swimming pool, diving boards and a slide.[195] The pool is converted into an ice rink from December to March.[195]\n\n\nIn addition to Formula One, the Circuit de Monaco hosts several support series, including FIA Formula 2, Porsche Supercup and Formula Regional Europe.[196] It has in the past also hosted Formula Three and Formula Renault.\n\n\nFrom 10 to 12 July 2014 Monaco inaugurated the Solar1 Monte Carlo Cup, a series of ocean races exclusively for solar-powered boats.[197],[198]\n\n\nThe women team of the chess club CE Monte Carlo won the European Chess Club Cup several times.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of Monaco City and the port of Fontvieille\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Monégasque cuisine\n\nThe cuisine of Monaco is a Mediterranean cuisine shaped by the cooking style of Provence and the influences of nearby northern Italian and southern French cooking, in addition to Monaco's own culinary traditions.[199]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Monaco\n\n![](image)Seaside façade of the Salle Garnier, home of the Opéra de Monte-Carlo\nMonaco has an opera house, a symphony orchestra and a classical ballet company. Monaco participated regularly in the Eurovision Song Contest between 1959–1979 and 2004–2006, winning in 1971, although none of the artists participating for the principality was originally Monegasque.\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMonaco has a national museum of contemporary visual art at the New National Museum of Monaco. In 1997, the Audiovisual Institute of Monaco was founded aimed to preserve audiovisual archives and show how the Principality of Monaco is represented in cinema. The country also has numerous works of public art, statues, museums, and memorials (see list of public art in Monaco).\n\n\nPrince Albert of Monaco visited the Sassi di Matera on 22 April 2022, exploring the ancient districts.[200]\n\n\n\n### Museums in Monaco[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Monaco\n\n![](image)Oceanographic Museum\n* Monaco Top Cars Collection\n* Napoleon Museum (Monaco)\n* Oceanographic Museum\n\n\n### Events, festivals and shows[edit]\n\n\nThe Principality of Monaco hosts major international events such as : \n\n\n\n* International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo\n* Mondial du Théâtre\n* Monte-Carlo Television Festival\n\n\n### Bread Festival[edit]\n\n\nMonaco also has an annual bread festival on 17 September every year.[201]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lycée Albert Premier of Monaco\nMonaco has ten state-operated schools, including: seven nursery and primary schools; one secondary school, Collège Charles III;[202] one *lycée* that provides general and technological training, Lycée Albert 1er;[203] and one lycée that provides vocational and hotel training, Lycée technique et hôtelier de Monte-Carlo.[204] There are also two grant-aided denominational private schools, Institution François d'Assise Nicolas Barré and Ecole des Sœurs Dominicaines, and one international school, the International School of Monaco,[205][206] founded in 1994.[207]\n\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nThere is one university located in Monaco, namely the International University of Monaco (IUM), an English-language university specialising in business education and operated by the *Institut des hautes études économiques et commerciales* (INSEEC) group.\n\n\n\n## Flag[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flag of Monaco\n\n![](image)Monaco's flag and its coat of arms\nThe flag of Monaco is one of the world's oldest national flag designs.[208] Adopted by Monaco on 4 April 1881, it is almost identical to the flag of Indonesia (The flag \"Sang Saka Merah Putih\" is an old flag from the Indonesian kingdom Majapahit in the 13th century, and also adopted by modern Indonesia) except for the ratio of height to width.[209]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Monaco\n\nFurther information: Rail transport in Monaco\n\nThe Monaco-Monte Carlo station is served by the SNCF, the French national rail system. The Monaco Heliport provides helicopter service to the closest airport, Côte d'Azur Airport in Nice, France.\n\n\nThe Monaco bus company (CAM) covers all the tourist attractions, museums, Exotic garden, business centres, and the Casino or the Louis II Stadium.[210]\n\n\n\n## Relations with other countries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Monaco\n\nFurther information: France–Monaco relations, Monaco–European Union relations, Monaco–Russia relations, and Monaco–United States relations\n\n![](image)The Rock of Monaco in 1890\nMonaco is so old that it has outlived many of the nations and institutions that it has had relations with. The Crown of Aragon and Republic of Genoa became a part of other countries, as did the Kingdom of Sardinia. Honoré II, Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of Péronne (1641).\n\n\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters.[141] Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union.[141] Monaco shares a 6 km (3.7 mi) border with France but also has about 2 km (1.2 mi) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea.[211] Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia). The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence.[211]\n\n\n\n![](image)Embassy of Monaco, Paris, France\nFrance and Italy have embassies within Monaco, while most other nations represented via operations in Paris.[212][213] There are about another 30 or so consulates.[212] By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Portugal (Lisbon),[214] Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).[212]\n\n\nAs of 2000[update] nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners.[215] In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60%[211] It is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, or about 100–150 people a year.[216] The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 per cent were native Monegasque[217] (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\n\n\nA recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country.[211] Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco.[211] Monaco does not allow dual citizenship but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalisation.[218] In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country.[218] For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years.[218] In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.[219]\n\n\nThere are no border formalities entering or leaving France. For visitors, a souvenir passport stamp is available on request at Monaco's tourist office. This is located on the far side of the gardens that face the Casino.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Microstate\n | Association Agreement | Eurozone[220] | Schengen Area | EU single market | EU customs territory[221] | EU VAT area[222] | Dublin Regulation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Monaco (relations)\n | Negotiating[223] | Yes[c] | De facto[d] | Partial[e] | Yes[f] | Yes[g][h] | No\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Monaco portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![map](image)Europe portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* Japanese Garden, Monaco\n* Telecommunications in Monaco\n* Outline of Monaco\n* Microstates and the European Union\n* List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density\n* List of rulers of Monaco\n* List of diplomatic missions in Monaco\n* List of diplomatic missions of Monaco\n* ISO 3166-2:MC\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** French: *Principauté de Monaco*; Monégasque: *Prinçipatu de Mùnegu*; Ligurian: *Prinçipato de Mónego*; Occitan: *Principat de Mónegue*; Italian: *Principato di Monaco*.\n2. **^** For further information, see languages of Monaco.\n3. **^** Monetary agreement with the EU to issue euros\n4. **^** Although not a contracting party to the Schengen Agreement, has an open border with France and Schengen laws are administered as if it were a part of France.[224][225]\n5. **^** Through an agreement with France[226]\n6. **^** Through an agreement with France.

It is bordered by France to the north, east and west. The principality is home to 38,682 residents,[11] of whom 9,486 are Monégasque nationals;[12] it is widely recognised as one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world.[13][14] The official language of the principality is French. In addition, Monégasque (a dialect of Ligurian), English and Italian are spoken and understood by many residents.[b]\n\n\nWith an area of 2.02 km2 (0.78 sq mi), it is the second-smallest sovereign state in the world, after Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants /km2 (49,230/sq mi) make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world. Monaco has a land border of 5.47 km (3.40 mi) and the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83 km (2.38 mi);[15] it has a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft). The highest point in the state is a narrow pathway named Chemin des Révoires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les Révoires ward, which is 161 m (528 ft) above sea level. The principality is about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the border with Italy.[16] Since 2013, it consists of nine administrative wards, the largest of which is Monte Carlo (Monte Carlo/Spélugues, 0.44 km2 (0.17 sq mi)), and the most populous of which is Larvotto (Larvotto/Bas Moulins, 5,443 residents as of 2008). Through ongoing land reclamation, started in 1861 and accelerating in the 1960s, Monaco's small land mass has expanded by 20 per cent.\n\n\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state, who wields immense political power despite his constitutional status. The prime minister, who is the head of government, can be either a Monégasque or a French citizen; the monarch consults with the Government of France before an appointment. Key members of the judiciary in Monaco are detached French magistrates.[17] The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297.[18] The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France, besides maintenance of two small military units.\n\n\nMonaco's economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the state's first casino, the Monte Carlo Casino, and a railway connection to Paris.[19] Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. Monaco is famous as a tax haven, as the principality has no personal income tax (except for French citizens) and low business taxes. Over 30% of the residents are millionaires,[20] with real estate prices reaching €100,000 ($116,374) per square metre in 2018. Monaco is considered a global hub of money laundering, and in February 2023 was placed under review by the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force watchdog, with the threat of being placed on its 'grey list', for its failures in financial supervision and reform to inhibit global criminality and terrorism financing.[21]\n\n\nMonaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency; before, it used the Monegasque franc, which was pegged, and exchangeable with, the French franc until 1 January 2002. Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004 and is a member of the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie* (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race, the Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One. The local motorsports association gives name to the Monte Carlo Rally, hosted in January in the French Alps. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, which competes in the French Ligue 1 and have become French champions on multiple occasions, and a basketball team, which plays in the EuroLeague. A centre of research into marine conservation, Monaco is home to one of the world's first protected marine habitats,[22] an Oceanographic Museum, and the International Atomic Energy Agency Environment Labs, which is the only marine laboratory in the United Nations structure.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Monaco\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as *Monoikos*, from the Greek \"μόνοικος\", \"single house\", from \"μόνος\" (*monos*) \"alone, single\"[24] + \"οἶκος\" (*oikos*) \"house\".[25] According to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods.[26] As a result, a temple was constructed there. Because this \"House\" of Hercules was the only temple in the area, the city was called Monoikos.[27][28] It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese.\n\n\nAn ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia.\n\n\nIn the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it resulted in the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent. It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.\n\n\n\n### Arrival of the Grimaldi family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rainier I, victor of the naval battle at Zierikzee and first sovereign Grimaldi ruler of Monaco\nFollowing a grant of land from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa.[29][30] Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"*Malizia*\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan friars – a *monaco* in Italian – although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.[31]\n\n\nFrancesco was evicted a few years later by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over \"the Rock\" continued for another century.[32] The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. The Genoese engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco after fighting the Crown of Aragon over Corsica.[33] Aragon eventually became part of a united Spain, and other parts of the land grant came to be integrated piecemeal into other states. Between 1346 and 1355, Monaco annexed the towns of Menton and Roquebrune, increasing its territory by almost ten times.[33]\n\n\n\n### 1400–1800[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Monaco (as part of the Republic of Genoa) in 1494\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612, Honoré II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco.[34] In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII as a \"duc et pair étranger\".[35]\n\n\nThe princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes.[36] Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris, and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is Italian. The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution.[37]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of the County of Nice showing the area of the Italian kingdom of Sardinia annexed in 1860 to France (light brown). The area in red had already become part of France before 1860\nIn 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and until 1814 it was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French armies under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte).[35][38]\nThe principality was reestablished in 1814 under the Grimaldis, only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815.[38] Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality; the surrounding County of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France.[39] Monaco became a French protectorate once again.\n\n\nBefore this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence, hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.[40]\n\n\nThese were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs.[41] The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents—an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino.[42] This made Monaco not only a playground for the rich, but a favoured place for them to live.[43]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mayor of Monaco announcing concessions, ending the absolute monarchy of Prince Albert I in 1910\nUntil the Monégasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 Constitution of Monaco, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers.[44] The new constitution slightly reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I soon suspended it during the First World War.\n\n\nIn July 1918, a new Franco-Monégasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Monégasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military and economic interests. It also resolved the Monaco succession crisis.\n\n\n\n![](image)The marriage of actress Grace Kelly to Prince Rainier III brought media attention to the principality.\nIn 1943, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a fascist administration.[45] In September 1943, after Mussolini's fall from power, the German Wehrmacht occupied Italy and Monaco, and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. René Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Opéra in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to Auschwitz, where he was later murdered.[46] Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the Opéra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland.[47] In August 1944, the Germans executed René Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.\n\n\nRainier III, succeeded to the throne on the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949, and then ruled until 2005. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly, an event that was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.[48]\n\n\nA 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties. In 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French citizens.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations, with full voting rights.[39][49]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of Monaco in 2016\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defense is still the responsibility of France.[50][51]\n\n\nOn 31 March 2005, Rainier III, who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.[52] He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco. Following a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005,[53] in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Monégasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville.[54] On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"[55]\n\n\nIn 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily to accommodate desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.[56] Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but had called it off.[56] The plan is for about six hectares (15 acres) of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices to a land value of about 1 billion euros.[57] The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.[57][58] There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses.[59] The name for the new district is Anse du Portier.[58]\n\n\nOn 29 February 2020, Monaco announced its first case of COVID-19, a man who was admitted to the Princess Grace Hospital Centre then transferred to Nice University Hospital in France.[60][61]\n\n\nOn 3 September 2020, the first Monégasque satellite, OSM-1 CICERO, was launched into space from French Guiana, France aboard a Vega rocket.[62] The satellite was built in Monaco by Orbital Solutions Monaco.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of Monaco from the *Tête de Chien* (Dog's Head) high rock promontory\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo of the princely government of Monaco\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Monaco\n\n![](image)Albert II, Prince of Monaco\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state.[63] The executive branch consists of a Prime Minister as the head of government, who presides over the other five members of the Council of Government.[64] Until 2002, the Prime Minister was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the Government of France; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Prime Minister can be French or Monégasque.[29] On 1 September 2020, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Pierre Dartout, to the office.[65]\n\n\nUnder the 1962 Constitution of Monaco, the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council.[66] The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation.[67] All legislation requires the approval of the National Council. Following the 2023 Monegasque general election, all 24 seats are held by the pro-monarchist Monegasque National Union.[68] The principality's city affairs are directed by the Communal Council,[69] which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor.[70] Georges Marsan has been mayor since 2003. Unlike the National Council, communal councillors are elected for four-year terms[71] and are strictly non-partisan; oppositions inside the council frequently form.[69][72]\n\n\nMembers of the judiciary of Monaco are appointed by the Sovereign Prince. Key positions within the judiciary are held by French magistrates, proposed by the Government of France. Monaco currently has three examining magistrates.[73]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Law enforcement in Monaco\n\n![](image)Palace guards in Monaco\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 38,000 people) and police presences in the world.[74] Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats jointly with the military. Police forces in Monaco are commanded by a French officer.[75]\n\n\nThere is also a small military force. This consists of a bodyguard unit for the prince and his palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers);[76] together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence corps (Sapeurs-Pompiers) it forms Monaco's total forces.[77] The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honoré IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the non-commissioned officers and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army. In addition to their guard duties as described, the carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.[78]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Land reclamation in Monaco\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Monaco, with the France–Monaco border shown in yellow\nMonaco is a sovereign city-state, with five quarters and ten wards,[79] located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes department on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16 km (9.9 mi) from Italy and only 13 km (8.1 mi) northeast of Nice.[49]\n\n\nIt has an area of 2.1 km2 (0.81 sq mi), or 208 ha (510 acres), and a population of 38,400,[80] making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world.[49] The country has a land border of only 5.47 km (3.40 mi),[80] a coastline of 3.83 km (2.38 mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2 km (13.8 mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349 m (5,577 and 1,145 ft).[81][82]\n\n\nThe highest point in the country is at the access to the *Patio Palace* residential building on the Chemin des Révoires (ward Les Révoires) from the D6007 (*Moyenne Corniche* street) at 164.4 m (539 ft) above sea level.[83] The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.[84]\n\n\nSaint-Jean brook is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19 km (190 m; 0.12 mi; 620 ft) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5 ha (5,000 m2; 0 acres; 54,000 sq ft) in area.[85] Monaco's most populated *quartier* is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.[86]\n\n\nAfter a recent[*when?*] expansion of Port Hercules,[87] Monaco's total area grew to 2.08 km2 (0.80 sq mi) or 208 ha (510 acres);[86] subsequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08 km2 (0.031 sq mi) or 8 ha (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille.[88][89][90][87][91] There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille.[92] There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.[92] Monaco's only natural resource is fishing;[93] with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of La Condamine and Monte Carlo\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In the centre is La Condamine. At the right with the smaller harbour is Fontvieille, with The Rock (the old town, fortress, and Palace) jutting out between the two harbours. At the left are the high-rise buildings of La Rousse/Saint Roman.\n![](image)Enlargeable, detailed map of Monaco\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller.[94] Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world.[95] The state consists of only one municipality (*commune*), the Municipality of Monaco. There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.[65] According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:[96]\n\n\n\n* Monaco-Ville, the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco, or simply \"The Rock\";\n* Monte Carlo, the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast;\n* La Condamine, the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules.\n\n\nThe municipalities were merged into one in 1917,[97][*how?*] and they were accorded the status of *Wards* or *Quartiers* thereafter.\n\n\n\n* Fontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s;\n* Moneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine;\n* Larvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo;\n* La Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le Ténao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.\n\n\nSubsequently, three additional wards were created, but then again were dissolved in 2013:\n\n\n\n* Saint Michel, created from part of Monte Carlo;\n* La Colle, created from part of La Condamine;\n* Les Révoires, also created from part of La Condamine.\n\n\nMost of Saint Michel became part of Monte Carlo again in 2013. La Colle and Les Révoires were merged the same year as part of a redistricting process, where they became part of the larger Jardin Exotique ward. An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014[98] but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time.[99] Prince Albert II in mid-2010 firmly restarted the programme.[100][101] In 2015, a new development called Anse du Portier was announced.[58]\n\n\n\n#### Traditional quarters and modern geographic areas[edit]\n\n\nThe four traditional *quartiers* of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille.[102] The suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth *Quartier* of Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.[103]\n\n\n\n#### Wards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wards of Monaco\nFor town planning purposes, a sovereign ordinance in 1966 divided the principality into reserved sectors, \"whose current character must be preserved\", and wards. The number and boundaries of these sectors and wards have been modified several times. The latest division dates from 2013 and created two reserved sectors and seven wards. A new 6-hectare district, Le Portier, is currently being built on the sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wards | Area\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| in m² | in %\n |\n| **Reserved Sectors** |\n| Monaco-Ville | Reserved Sectors\n | 196,491 | 9,7 %\n |\n| Ravin de Sainte-Dévote | Reserved Sectors\n | 23,485 | 1,2 %\n |\n| **Wards** |\n| La Condamine | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 295,843 | 14,6 %\n |\n| Fontvieille | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 329,516 | 16,3 %\n |\n| Larvotto | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 217,932 | 10,8 %\n |\n| Jardin Exotique | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 234,865 | 11,6 %\n |\n| Les Moneghetti | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 115,196 | 5,7 %\n |\n| Monte-Carlo | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 436,760 | 21,5 %\n |\n| La Rousse | Quartier ordonnancé\n | 176,888 | 8,7 %\n |\n| Total\n | 2,026,976 | 100,0 %\n |\n\n\n*Note: for statistical purposes, the Wards of Monaco are further subdivided into 178 city blocks (îlots), which are comparable to the census blocks in the United States*.[86]\n\n\n\n* Another possibility was Fontvieille II Development to commence in 2013[104][105]\n\n\n![](image)Land reclamation in Monaco since 1861\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Monaco and Monaco villas\n\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle Époque. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878–9 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids. These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought and still seeks, to portray itself.[106] This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements were incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order.[107] In recent years[*when?*] the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay.[108] The principality has no heritage protection legislation.[109]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: *Csa*), with strong maritime influences, with some resemblances to the humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*). As a result, it has balmy warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The winters are very mild considering the city's latitude, being as mild as locations located much further south in the Mediterranean Basin.[110] Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30 °C or 86 °F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20 °C (68 °F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years.[111][112] On 27 February 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.[113]\n\n\n\n|

highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742, GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150.[117][118][119] It also has an unemployment rate of 2%,[120] with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day.[86] According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate[121] and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world.[122] For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.[123][124][125] Although the average price went down in 2020, to an average price of $53,378 per square metre, Monaco remains one of the most expensive places in the world to buy property.[126]\nThe world's most expensive apartment is located in Monaco, a penthouse at the Odeon Tower valued at $335 million according to *Forbes* in 2016.[127]\n\n\nOne of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casinos and pleasant climate.[82][128] It has also become a major banking center, holding over €100 billion worth of funds.[129] Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services.[130] Monaco is the only place in Europe where credit card points are not redeemable. Hotel points are not able to be accumulated nor are transactions recorded, allowing for an increase in privacy that is sought by many of the locals. The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics.[*failed verification*][121]\n\n\nThe state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network (Monaco Telecom) used to be fully owned by the state. Its monopoly now comprises only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Monégasque de Banque (6%). Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.[131]\n\n\nMonaco is not a member of the European Union, but very closely linked via a customs union with France. As such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc. Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.\n\n\n\n### Gambling industry[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Monte Carlo Casino\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.[29] All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III. The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money.\n\n\nThe towns of Menton and Roquebrune, which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much-improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to the Sardinian intervention and clamoured for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.\n\n\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates François and Louis Blanc for 1.7 million francs.\n\n\nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelugues (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\"[132] They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savoury elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\n\n\nThe Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.[133] Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses.[134] In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House, 46 hotels were built and the number of jewellers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold. In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Monégasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.[135] By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques—a masterstroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\n\n\nToday, Société des bains de mer de Monaco, which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Café de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent[*when?*] addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino, which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea; among other things, it offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" (TITO). It is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.[136]\n\n\n\n### Low taxes[edit]\n\n\nMonaco has a 20% VAT plus high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).[137]\n\n\nMonaco has never levied income tax on individuals,[88] and foreigners are thus able to use it as a \"tax haven\" from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obliged to pay taxes to other countries.[138][139]\n\n\nThe absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco. Celebrities, such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.[140]\n\n\nPer a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.[141] The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco. Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.[88]\n\n\nIn 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens.[142] Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands. The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.[143][144] Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions. In 2009, Monaco went a step further and secured a place on the \"white list\" after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.[88]\n\n\nIn 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. Difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\"[145]\n\n\nAlso in 2000, a report by French politicians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering including within its casino and that the Government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated.[146] In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven,[147] but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.[148][149]\n\n\nThe Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned to implement the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.[150]\n\n\n\n### Numismatics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Monégasque franc, Monégasque euro coins, and Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Monaco)\n\n![](image)1978 Monégasque franc coin with an effigy of Rainier III\nMonaco issued its own coins in various devaluations connected to the écu already in the seventeenth century, but its first decimal coins of the Monégasque franc were issued in 1837 continued until 2001.\n\n\nAlthough Monaco is not a European Union member, it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins, which was introduced in 2002.[151] In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins.[152] Three different designs were selected for the Monégasque coins.[153] The design was changed in 2006 after Prince Rainier's death to feature the effigy of Prince Albert.[153]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nPopulation of Monaco by nationality\n\n\n\nFrench (28.4%)\nMonégasque (21.6%)\nItalian (18.7%)\nBritish (7.5%)\nBelgian (2.8%)\nGerman (2.5%)\nSwiss (2.5%)\nAmerican (1.2%)\nOther (14.8%)\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Monaco\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015, and estimated by the United Nations to be 36,297 as of 1 July 2023.[154][155] Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Monégasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Monégasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).[156] According to 2019 studies, 31% of Monaco’s population is reported to be millionaires equalling up to 12,248 individuals \n\n\nCitizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called *Monégasque*. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.[157][158]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Monaco\n\n![](image)Street sign in French and Monégasque in Monaco-Ville\nThe main and official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Monégasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Monégasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Monégasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is also used.\n\n\nItalian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.[159] This was due to the annexation of the surrounding County of Nice to France following the Treaty of Turin (1860).[159]\n\n\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, are of Ligurian origin; thus, the traditional national language is Monégasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Monégasque.[160][161]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Monaco according to the *Global Religious Landscape* survey by the Pew Forum, 2012[3]\n\n\n\nChristianity (86%)\nUnaffiliated (11.7%)\nJudaism (1.7%)\nIslam (0.4%)\nOther religions (0.2%)\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.[3]\n\n\nAccording to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholic Christians are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians. The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church. There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n\n#### Catholicism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Catholic Church in Monaco\n\n![](image)Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate\n![](image)Sainte-Dévote Chapel\nThe official religion is Catholicism, with freedom of other religions guaranteed by the constitution.[2] There are five Catholic parish churches in Monaco and one cathedral, which is the seat of the archbishop of Monaco.\n\n\nThe diocese, which has existed since the mid-19th century, was raised to a non-metropolitan archbishopric in 1981 as the Archdiocese of Monaco and remains exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See). The patron saint is Saint Devota.\n\n\n\n#### Anglican Communion[edit]\n\n\nThere is one Anglican church (St Paul's Church), located in the Avenue de Grande Bretagne in Monte Carlo. The church was dedicated in 1925. In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglican residents in the principality but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books.[162] The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe.\n\n\n\n#### Reformed Church of Monaco[edit]\n\n\nThere is one Reformed church, which meets in a building located in Rue Louis Notari. The building dates from 1958–59. The church is affiliated with the United Protestant Church of France (Église Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a group that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (Église Réformée de France). Through this affiliation with EPUF, the church is part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The church acts as a host church to some other Christian communities, allowing them to use its building.\n\n\n\n#### Charismatic Episcopal Church[edit]\n\n\nThe Monaco Parish of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (Parish of St Joseph) dates from 2017 and meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n\n#### Christian Fellowship[edit]\n\n\nThe Monaco Christian Fellowship, formed in 1996, meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n\n#### Greek Orthodoxy[edit]\n\n\nMonaco's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report states that there is one Greek Orthodox church in Monaco.\n\n\n\n#### Russian Orthodox[edit]\n\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Parish of the Holy Royal Martyrs meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n\n### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nThe Association Culturelle Israélite de Monaco (founded in 1948) is a converted house containing a synagogue, a community Hebrew school, and a kosher food shop, located in Monte Carlo.[163] The community mainly consists of retirees from Britain (40%) and North Africa. Half of the Jewish population is Sephardic, mainly from North Africa, while the other half is Ashkenazi.[164]\n\n\n\n### Islam[edit]\n\n\nThe Muslim population of Monaco consists of about 280 people, most of whom are residents, not citizens.[165] The majority of the Muslim population of Monaco are Arabs, though there is a Turkish minority as well.[166] Monaco does not have any official mosques.[167]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n### Formula One[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Monaco Grand Prix\n\n![](image)Formation lap for the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix\nSince 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix has been held annually in the streets of Monaco.[168] It is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. The erection of the Circuit de Monaco takes six weeks to complete and the removal after the race takes another three weeks.[168]\n\n\nThe circuit is narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track.[169] Driver Nelson Piquet compared driving the circuit to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".\n\n\nDespite the challenging nature of the course it has only had two fatalities, Luigi Fagioli who died from injuries received in practice for the 1952 Monaco Grand Prix (run to sports car regulations that year, not Formula 1)[170] and Lorenzo Bandini, who crashed, burned and died three days later from his injuries in 1967.[171] Two other drivers had lucky escapes after they crashed into the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and Paul Hawkins, during the 1965 race.[168]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Monaco Grand Prix was cancelled for the first time since 1954 because of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n#### Monégasque Formula 1 drivers[edit]\n\n\nThere have been five Formula One drivers from Monaco:\n\n\n\n* Charles Leclerc (2018–present)\n* Robert Doornbos (2005, Dutch driver under a Monégasque license)\n* Olivier Beretta (1994)\n* André Testut (1958–1959)\n* Louis Chiron (1950–1958)\n\n\n### Formula E[edit]\n\n\nStarting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix[172] and used a shorter configuration of the full Formula 1 circuit, keeping it around Port Hercules until 2021.\n\n\nROKiT Venturi Racing is the only motor racing team based in the principality, headquartered in Fontvieille.[173] The marque competes in Formula E and was one of the founding teams of the fully-electric championship. Managed by former racing drivers Susie Wolff (CEO) and Jérôme d'Ambrosio (Team Principal),[174] the outfit holds 16 podiums in the series to date including five victories. 1997 Formula One World Champion Jacques Villeneuve and eleven-time Formula One race winner Felipe Massa have raced for the team previously.[175][176] Ten-time Macau winner and 2021 vice World Champion Edoardo Mortara and Season 3 Formula E champion Lucas di Grassi currently race for the team.[177]\n\n\n\n### Monte Carlo Rally[edit]\n\n\nSince 1911 part of the Monte Carlo Rally has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of Prince Albert I. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organised by Automobile Club de Monaco. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in rallying and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the World Rally Championship (WRC).[178] From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge.[179] The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since.[180] Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football in Monaco\n\n![](image)Stade Louis II, home of AS Monaco FC\nMonaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, AS Monaco FC, and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the Stade Louis II and competes in Ligue 1, the first division of French football. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016–17) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, with a team that included Dado Pršo, Fernando Morientes, Jérôme Rothen, Akis Zikos and Ludovic Giuly, but lost 3–0 to Portuguese team FC Porto. French World Cup-winners Thierry Henry, Fabien Barthez, David Trezeguet, and Kylian Mbappe have played for the club. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual UEFA Super Cup from 1998–2012 between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\n\n\nThe women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's French football league system. The club plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the Division 1 Féminine, in the 1994–95 season, but was quickly relegated.\n\n\nThe Monaco national football team represents the nation in association football and is controlled by the Monégasque Football Federation, the governing body for football in Monaco. Monaco is one of two sovereign states in Europe (along with the Vatican City) that is not a member of UEFA and so does not take part in any UEFA European Football Championship or FIFA World Cup competitions. They are instead affiliated with CONIFA, where they compete against other national teams that are not FIFA members. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.\n\n\n\n### Rugby[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rugby union in Monaco\n\nMonaco's national rugby team, as of April 2019, is 101st in the World Rugby Rankings.[181]\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nMulti-sport club AS Monaco owns AS Monaco Basket which was founded in 1928. They play in the top-tier European basketball league, the EuroLeague, and the French top flight, the LNB Pro A. They have three Pro A Leaders Cup, two Pro B (2nd-tier), and one NM1 (3rd-tier) championship. They play in Salle Gaston Médecin, which is part of Stade Louis II.\n\n\n\n### Professional boxing[edit]\n\n\nDue in part to its position both as a tourist and gambling centre, Monaco has staged major professional boxing world title and non title fights from time to time; those include the Carlos Monzon versus Nino Benvenuti rematch,[182] Monzon's rematch with Emile Griffith,[183] Monzon's two classic fights with Rodrigo Valdes,[184][185] Davey Moore versus Wilfredo Benitez,[186] the double knockout-ending classic between Lee Roy Murphy and Chisanda Mutti (won by Murphy),[187] and Julio César Chávez, Sr. versus Rocky Lockridge.[188] All of the aforementioned contests took place at the first Stade Louis II or the second Stade Louis II stadiums.\n\n\n\n### Other sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A view of the 2011 Monaco Porsche Supercup. Motor racing is very popular, with one course encompassing almost the whole country.\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is held annually in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, as a professional tournament for men as part of tennis's ATP Masters Series.[189] The tournament has been held since 1897. Golf's Monte Carlo Open was also held at the Monte Carlo Golf Club at Mont Agel in France between 1984 and 1992.\n\n\nMonaco has a national Davis Cup team, which plays in the European/African Zone.\n\n\nMonaco has also competed in the Olympic Games, although, no athlete from Monaco has ever won an Olympic medal. At the Youth Olympic Winter Games, Monaco won a bronze medal in bobsleigh.\n\n\nThe 2009 Tour de France, the world's premier cycle race, started from Monaco with a 15 km (9 mi) closed-circuit individual time trial starting and finishing there on the first day, and the 182 km (113 mi) second leg starting there on the following day and ending in Brignoles, France.[190]\n\n\nMonaco has also staged part of the Global Champions Tour (International Show-jumping).[191] In 2009, the Monaco stage of the Global Champions tour took place between 25 and 27 June.\n\n\nThe Monaco Marathon is the only marathon in the world to pass through three countries, those of Monaco, France and Italy, before the finish at the Stade Louis II.\n\n\nThe Monaco Ironman 70.3 triathlon race is an annual event with over 1,000 athletes competing and attracts top professional athletes from around the world. The race includes a 1.9 km (1.2 mi) swim, 90 km (56 mi) bike ride and 21.1 km (13.1 mi) run.\n\n\nSince 1993, the headquarters of the International Association of Athletics Federations,[192] the world governing body of athletics, is located in Monaco.[193] An IAAF Diamond League meet is annually held at Stade Louis II.[194]\n\n\nA municipal sports complex, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium in the Port Hercules district consists of a heated saltwater Olympic-size swimming pool, diving boards and a slide.[195] The pool is converted into an ice rink from December to March.[195]\n\n\nIn addition to Formula One, the Circuit de Monaco hosts several support series, including FIA Formula 2, Porsche Supercup and Formula Regional Europe.[196] It has in the past also hosted Formula Three and Formula Renault.\n\n\nFrom 10 to 12 July 2014 Monaco inaugurated the Solar1 Monte Carlo Cup, a series of ocean races exclusively for solar-powered boats.[197],[198]\n\n\nThe women team of the chess club CE Monte Carlo won the European Chess Club Cup several times.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of Monaco City and the port of Fontvieille\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Monégasque cuisine\n\nThe cuisine of Monaco is a Mediterranean cuisine shaped by the cooking style of Provence and the influences of nearby northern Italian and southern French cooking, in addition to Monaco's own culinary traditions.[199]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Monaco\n\n![](image)Seaside façade of the Salle Garnier, home of the Opéra de Monte-Carlo\nMonaco has an opera house, a symphony orchestra and a classical ballet company. Monaco participated regularly in the Eurovision Song Contest between 1959–1979 and 2004–2006, winning in 1971, although none of the artists participating for the principality was originally Monegasque.\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMonaco has a national museum of contemporary visual art at the New National Museum of Monaco. In 1997, the Audiovisual Institute of Monaco was founded aimed to preserve audiovisual archives and show how the Principality of Monaco is represented in cinema. The country also has numerous works of public art, statues, museums, and memorials (see list of public art in Monaco).\n\n\nPrince Albert of Monaco visited the Sassi di Matera on 22 April 2022, exploring the ancient districts.[200]\n\n\n\n### Museums in Monaco[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Monaco\n\n![](image)Oceanographic Museum\n* Monaco Top Cars Collection\n* Napoleon Museum (Monaco)\n* Oceanographic Museum\n\n\n### Events, festivals and shows[edit]\n\n\nThe Principality of Monaco hosts major international events such as : \n\n\n\n* International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo\n* Mondial du Théâtre\n* Monte-Carlo Television Festival\n\n\n### Bread Festival[edit]\n\n\nMonaco also has an annual bread festival on 17 September every year.[201]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lycée Albert Premier of Monaco\nMonaco has ten state-operated schools, including: seven nursery and primary schools; one secondary school, Collège Charles III;[202] one *lycée* that provides general and technological training, Lycée Albert 1er;[203] and one lycée that provides vocational and hotel training, Lycée technique et hôtelier de Monte-Carlo.[204] There are also two grant-aided denominational private schools, Institution François d'Assise Nicolas Barré and Ecole des Sœurs Dominicaines, and one international school, the International School of Monaco,[205][206] founded in 1994.[207]\n\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nThere is one university located in Monaco, namely the International University of Monaco (IUM), an English-language university specialising in business education and operated by the *Institut des hautes études économiques et commerciales* (INSEEC) group.\n\n\n\n## Flag[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flag of Monaco\n\n![](image)Monaco's flag and its coat of arms\nThe flag of Monaco is one of the world's oldest national flag designs.[208] Adopted by Monaco on 4 April 1881, it is almost identical to the flag of Indonesia (The flag \"Sang Saka Merah Putih\" is an old flag from the Indonesian kingdom Majapahit in the 13th century, and also adopted by modern Indonesia) except for the ratio of height to width.[209]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Monaco\n\nFurther information: Rail transport in Monaco\n\nThe Monaco-Monte Carlo station is served by the SNCF, the French national rail system. The Monaco Heliport provides helicopter service to the closest airport, Côte d'Azur Airport in Nice, France.\n\n\nThe Monaco bus company (CAM) covers all the tourist attractions, museums, Exotic garden, business centres, and the Casino or the Louis II Stadium.[210]\n\n\n\n## Relations with other countries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Monaco\n\nFurther information: France–Monaco relations, Monaco–European Union relations, Monaco–Russia relations, and Monaco–United States relations\n\n![](image)The Rock of Monaco in 1890\nMonaco is so old that it has outlived many of the nations and institutions that it has had relations with. The Crown of Aragon and Republic of Genoa became a part of other countries, as did the Kingdom of Sardinia. Honoré II, Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of Péronne (1641).\n\n\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters.[141] Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union.[141] Monaco shares a 6 km (3.7 mi) border with France but also has about 2 km (1.2 mi) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea.[211] Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Monégasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia). The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence.[211]\n\n\n\n![](image)Embassy of Monaco, Paris, France\nFrance and Italy have embassies within Monaco, while most other nations represented via operations in Paris.[212][213] There are about another 30 or so consulates.[212] By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Portugal (Lisbon),[214] Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).[212]\n\n\nAs of 2000[update] nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners.[215] In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60%[211] It is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, or about 100–150 people a year.[216] The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 per cent were native Monegasque[217] (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\n\n\nA recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country.[211] Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco.[211] Monaco does not allow dual citizenship but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalisation.[218] In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country.[218] For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years.[218] In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.[219]\n\n\nThere are no border formalities entering or leaving France. For visitors, a souvenir passport stamp is available on request at Monaco's tourist office. This is located on the far side of the gardens that face the Casino.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Microstate\n | Association Agreement | Eurozone[220] | Schengen Area | EU single market | EU customs territory[221] | EU VAT area[222] | Dublin Regulation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Monaco (relations)\n | Negotiating[223] | Yes[c] | De facto[d] | Partial[e] | Yes[f] | Yes[g][h] | No\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Monaco portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![map](image)Europe portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* Japanese Garden, Monaco\n* Telecommunications in Monaco\n* Outline of Monaco\n* Microstates and the European Union\n* List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density\n* List of rulers of Monaco\n* List of diplomatic missions in Monaco\n* List of diplomatic missions of Monaco\n* ISO 3166-2:MC\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** French: *Principauté de Monaco*; Monégasque: *Prinçipatu de Mùnegu*; Ligurian: *Prinçipato de Mónego*; Occitan: *Principat de Mónegue*; Italian: *Principato di Monaco*.\n2. **^** For further information, see languages of Monaco.\n3. **^** Monetary agreement with the EU to issue euros\n4. **^** Although not a contracting party to the Schengen Agreement, has an open border with France and Schengen laws are administered as if it were a part of France.[224][225]\n5. **^** Through an agreement with France[226]\n6. **^** Through an agreement with France.

The nearest airport is also in Italy. The country's capital city, the City of San Marino, is located atop Monte Titano, while its largest settlement is Dogana within the largest municipality of Serravalle. San Marino's official language is Italian.\n\n\nThe country derives its name from Saint Marinus, a stonemason from the then-Roman island of Rab in present-day Croatia. Born in AD 275, Marinus participated in the rebuilding of Rimini's city walls after their destruction by Liburnian pirates. Marinus then went on to found an independently ruled monastic community on Monte Titano in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to being the oldest extant sovereign state, as well as the oldest constitutional republic.[12]\n\n\nUniquely, San Marino's constitution dictates that its democratically elected legislature, the Grand and General Council, must elect two heads of state every six months. Known as captains regent, the two heads of state serve concurrently and with equal powers until their term expires after six months.\n\n\nThe country's economy is mainly based on finance, industry, services, retail, and tourism. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in GDP per capita, with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions.[1] Despite this fact, ranking 44th, its Human Development Index score is the lowest in Western Europe.[6] Its health care system ranked 3rd in the first ever World Health Organization analysis of the world's health systems.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of San Marino\n\n![](image)Illustration of Saint Marinus, the founder of the Republic of San Marino and prominent cultural figure\nSaint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\n\n\nThe official founding date is 3 September 301 AD.[14] In 1291 San Marino appealed to the bishop of Arezzo, Ildebrandino Guidi di Romena, against the contribution demands by the Vicario del Montefeltro. Jurist Palamede di Rimini, decided in favour of San Marino and recognised its tax exemption from tributes demands of Montefeltro. In 1296, when Guglielmo Durante was the governor of Romagna, Sammarinesi appealed to Pope Boniface VIII against the further requests by the Montefeltro podestas regarding tributes. Abbot Ranieri di Sant'Anastasio was assigned to judge the dispute. A long process was held using various witnesses and sources to determine San Marino tax's exemption status. The verdict was probably in favour of the autonomy of San Marino, as later the State has never paid taxes to the Montefeltro.[15]\n\n\nIn 1320, the community of Chiesanuova chose to join the country.[16] In 1463, San Marino was enlarged to include the communities of Faetano, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle, since then the country's borders have remained unchanged.[17]\n\n\nIn 1503, Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, occupied the Republic for six months until his father's successor, Pope Julius II, intervened and restored the country's independence.[18]\n\n\nOn 4 June 1543, Fabiano di Monte San Savino, nephew of the later Pope Julius III, attempted to conquer the republic, but his infantry and cavalry failed as they got lost in a dense fog, which the Sammarinese attributed to Saint Quirinus, whose feast day it was.[19]\n\n\nAfter the Duchy of Urbino was annexed by the Papal States in 1625, San Marino became an enclave within the papal states. This led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never amounted to a *de facto* Papal control of the republic.[20]\n\n\nThe country was occupied on 17 October 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of Ravenna, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, but independence was restored by Pope Clement XII on 5 February 1740, the feast day of Saint Agatha, after which she became a patron saint of the republic.[21]\n\n\nThe advance of Napoleon's army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty by one of its regents, Antonio Onofri, who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Due to Onofri's intervention, Napoleon promised, in a letter to Gaspard Monge, scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' revanchism.[22][23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anita and Giuseppe Garibaldi in San Marino, 1849\n![](image)The San Marino constitution, or more precisely statutes, of 1600\nDuring the later phase of the Italian unification process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including Giuseppe Garibaldi and his wife Anita. Garibaldi allowed San Marino to remain independent. San Marino and the Kingdom of Italy signed a Convention of Friendship in 1862.[24]\n\n\nThe government of San Marino made United States President Abraham Lincoln an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that \"government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring\".[25][26]\n\n\n\n### 20th century onwards[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 24 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not acquiesce. Two groups of ten volunteers joined the Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.[27]\n\n\nAfter the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tension between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the Sammarinese Fascist Party (*Partito Fascista Sammarinese*, PFS), founded in 1922 and styled largely on their Italian counterpart. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from Benito Mussolini's fascist government in Italy.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)British troops at Monte Titano during the Battle of San Marino, September 1944\nDuring World War II, San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article in *The New York Times* that it had declared war on the United Kingdom on 17 September 1940.[29] The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.[30]\n\n\nOn 28 July 1943, three days after the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The PFS regained power on 1 April 1944, but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the Royal Air Force, in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter.[31] San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the Gothic Line.[32] In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the Battle of San Marino.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSan Marino had the world's first democratically elected communist government – a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party, which held office between 1945 and 1957.[33][34] The coalition lost power through the fatti di Rovereta.\n\n\nSan Marino became a member of the Council of Europe in 1988 and of the United Nations in 1992. It is not a member of the European Union, although it uses the euro as its currency (despite not legally being part of the Eurozone). Before the introduction of the euro, the country's currency was the Sammarinese lira.\n\n\nAs of June 2020, San Marino had the highest death rate per capita of any country, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[35] In April 2021, it was reported that San Marino was using the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine rather than vaccines approved by the EU, following a slow rollout for the latter vaccines.[36][37]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics, San Marino became the smallest country to earn an Olympic medal when Alessandra Perilli won a bronze medal in the women's trap.[38] They later won another medal, this one silver, with Perilli's and Gian Marco Berti's performance in the mixed trap shooting event.[39]\n\n\nOn 7 March 2022, during the Russia-Ukraine War, the Russian Kremlin released on Twitter a list of countries which it considered \"unfriendly\" to Russia. San Marino was included in the list, alongside numerous well-known Russian adversaries such as the United States and countries in the European Union. The motivation for including San Marino as an \"unfriendly\" nation was unclear, and it gained substantial attention on the Internet.[40]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2022, San Marino officials voted to legalize abortion in the republic, \"one of the last European states to have had the procedure outlawed under all circumstances\".[41] 32 members of the legislature approved the bill while 10 abstained and 7 voted against.[42] The public health system is promised[*clarification needed*] to cover the cost of the abortion procedure.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of San Marino\n\n![](image)Enlargeable, detailed map of San Marino\n![](image)The fortress of *Guaita* on Monte Titano\n![](image)View of the *Guaita* defensive wall\nSan Marino is an enclave surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, on the border between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Marche and about ten kilometres (six miles) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no substantial naturally flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level; the lowest, the Ausa River (ending in the Marecchia),[43] is 55 m (180 ft). San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\n\n\nIt is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country (the others being Vatican City, also enclosed by Italy, and Lesotho, enclosed by South Africa). It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth-smallest country in the world.[11]\n\n\nThe terrestrial ecoregion of Italian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests lies within San Marino's territory.[44] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.01/10, ranking it last globally out of 172 countries.[45]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*), with some continental influences. It has warm to hot summers and cool winters, typical of inland areas of the central Italian Peninsula. Precipitation is scattered throughout the year with no real dry month. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400–500 m (1,300–1,600 feet) of elevation.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for San Marino (2006–2023)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 31.9(89.4)\n | 35.5(95.9)\n | 35.1(95.2)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 30.5(86.9)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 6.4(43.5)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 7.4(45.3)\n | 15.9(60.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 4.8(40.6)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 6.7(44.1)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 10.2(50.3)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n | −5.9(21.4)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 1.3(34.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 0.9(33.6)\n | −2.8(27.0)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 50.2(1.98)\n | 63.9(2.52)\n | 64.5(2.54)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 70.3(2.77)\n | 54.3(2.14)\n | 40.4(1.59)\n | 40.7(1.60)\n | 75.3(2.96)\n | 70.2(2.76)\n | 99.0(3.90)\n | 61.4(2.42)\n | 749.5(29.51)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 7.2\n | 8.4\n | 8.3\n | 7.9\n | 8.6\n | 4.8\n | 4.3\n | 4.5\n | 6.8\n | 7.1\n | 10.2\n | 8.3\n | 86.3\n |\n| Source: Arpae Emilia-Romagna[46] |\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of San Marino\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of San Marino, Constitution of San Marino, Capital punishment in San Marino, San Marino passport, Law enforcement in San Marino, and Elections in San Marino\n\n![](image)The Palazzo Pubblico, seat of the government of San Marino\n![](image)Four former captains regent: from left to right, Mirko Tomassoni, Alessandro Rossi, Alessandro Mancini, and Alberto Selva\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are heads of state,[47] and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Although there is no formal head of government, the secretary for foreign and political affairs is in many ways equal to the prime minister in other countries.[48] Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n\nSan Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect, as the Statutes of 1600 are still at the core of its constitutional framework.[49]\n\n\nSan Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the council. Still today, Captains Regent are elected every six months by the council.\n\n\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (*Consiglio grande e generale*). The council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old parishes of the republic. All citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote.\n\n\nBesides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the judicial branch during the period of legislature of the council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councilors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\n\n\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regent to be the heads of state. The captains are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\n\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the captains regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\n\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing Pact for San Marino, led by the San Marinese Christian Democratic Party; and the left-wing Reforms and Freedom, led by the Party of Socialists and Democrats, a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the former communist Party of Democrats. The 2008 general election was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\n\n\nOn 1 October 2007, Mirko Tomassoni was elected as captain regent, making him the first disabled person elected to that office.[50]\n\n\nSan Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino (*Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino*) exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n\nOn 1 April 2022, 58-year-old Paolo Rondelli was elected as one of the two captains regent, its heads of state. He had previously been the Ambassador to the United States and is the world's first openly gay head of state.[51]\n\n\n\n### Administrative division[edit]\n\n\n#### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of San Marino\nSan Marino is divided into nine municipalities, known locally as **castelli** (meaning \"castles\"):\n\n\n\n* San Marino (City of San Marino, officially **Città di San Marino**) is the capital.\n\n\nAnd eight minor municipalities:\n\n\n\n* Acquaviva\n* Borgo Maggiore\n* Chiesanuova\n* Domagnano\n* Faetano\n* Fiorentino\n* Montegiardino\n* Serravalle\n\n\nThe largest settlement of the Republic is Dogana, which is not an autonomous **castello**, but rather belongs to the Castello of Serravalle.\n\n\nIn a similar way to an Italian **comune**, each **castello** includes a main settlement, called **capoluogo**, which is the seat of the **castello**, and some even smaller localities known as **frazioni**.\n\n\n\n#### Curacies[edit]\n\n\nThe republic is made up of 43 parishes,[52] named *curacies* (Italian: *curazie*): Cà Berlone, Cà Chiavello, Cà Giannino, Cà Melone, Cà Ragni, Cà Rigo, Cailungo, Caladino, Calligaria, Canepa, Capanne, Casole, Castellaro, Cerbaiola, Cinque Vie, Confine, Corianino, Crociale, Dogana, Falciano, Fiorina, Galavotto, Gualdicciolo, La Serra, Lesignano, Molarini, Montalbo, Monte Pulito, Murata, Pianacci, Piandivello, Poggio Casalino, Poggio Chiesanuova, Ponte Mellini, Rovereta, San Giovanni sotto le Penne, Santa Mustiola, Spaccio Giannoni, Teglio, Torraccia, Valdragone, Valgiurata, and Ventoso.\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese Armed Forces\n\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces. Different branches have varied functions, including performing ceremonial duties, patrolling borders, mounting guard at government buildings, and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n\n\n#### Crossbow Corps[edit]\n\n\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Rock[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Guards of the Rock\nThe Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them.[53] In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City, the seat of national government.\n\n\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard.[53] Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Grand and General Council[edit]\n\n\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1741,[53] is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the council are to protect the captains regent, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n\n\n#### Company of Uniformed Militia[edit]\n\n\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\n\n\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n\n\n#### Military Ensemble[edit]\n\n\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia,[53] and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 60 musicians.[54] The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n\n\n#### Gendarmerie[edit]\n\n\nEstablished in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency.[53] Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\n\n\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the *Corpi Militari Volontari*, or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of San Marino, Sammarinese euro coins, Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino, and List of banks in San Marino\n\n![](image)Tourism and banking are the country's main sources of revenue.\nSan Marino is a developed country,[55] and although it is not a European Union member it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins. Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors.\n\n\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking, electronics, and ceramics. The main agricultural products are wine and cheese. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\n\n\nSan Marino's postage stamps, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to philatelists and are a significant source of income.[56] San Marino is no longer a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation.[57]\n\n\nIt has the world's third highest rate of car ownership, being one of only a handful of countries with more vehicles than people.[58] As of October 2023, Gibraltar had the highest rate of car ownership per capita, and Guernsey was in the number two spot.[59]\n\n\n\n### Taxation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"San Marino\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(October 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 8.5%. Capital gains are also subject to an 8.5% tax, and interest from bank deposits is subject to an 11% tax.[60] Several benefits apply to new businesses, which can strongly reduce the amount of taxes to be paid.\n\n\nThe personal income tax (IGR, Italian: *Imposta Generale sui Redditi*) was introduced in 1984 and it was heavily reformed in 2013 with the goal of increasing fiscal revenue. The nominal tax rate ranges from 9% for an annual revenue below €10,000 to 35% for revenues above €80,000.\n\n\nIn 1972, a value-added tax (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and an equivalent tax was introduced also in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. However, this tax is not a standard value-added tax, but rather it is an import tax, thus, it is levied only on imported goods and raw resources. For this reason it is locally best known as single stage tax (Italian: *imposta monofase*), as it is only applied one time during importation, while VAT is applied at every exchange. Furthermore, while VAT also applies to services, the import tax only applies on physical goods. Another important difference is that while VAT is computed on the final price paid by the consumer, the import tax is levied on the importation cost paid by the company, which is generally much lower.\n\n\nUnder the European Union customs agreement, San Marino import tax is considered equivalent to the European VAT system. A separate tax on services, with a rate of 3%, has been introduced in 2011. The introduction of a true VAT system, not dissimilar from the European one, is under development.\n\n\nBecause San Marino's tax rate is lower than surrounding Italy's, many businesses choose to be based in San Marino to avoid the higher rates. San Marino boasts a corporate rate 14.5% lower than Italy (23%) and 12.5% lower than the EU average (21.3%). This has made San Marino the tax haven of choice for many wealthy Italians and businesses.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in San Marino\n\nThe tourism sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's GDP,[61] with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.[62]\n\n\n\n### Conventions with Italy[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862,[63] dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.\n\n\nCultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's government monopoly are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden; all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use Italy's mint; the agreement does not affect the right of the Republic of San Marino to continue to issue gold coins denominated in Scudi[64] (the legal value of 1 gold Scudo is 37.50 euros). Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is one legally operating casino.\n\n\nIn exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, provided at cost, of sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).[65]\n\n\nAt the border there are no formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their passports.\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Over 48.4% of the population profess the Catholic faith, and approximately half of those regularly attend church. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino. The country's high Roman Catholic majority can mainly be traced back to the country's founding, when Saint Marinus set up the first fortress to protect Christians from Roman persecution.[66] The small state's culture has primarily remained Catholic ever since.\n\n\nThere is a provision under the income tax rules that taxpayers have the right to request the allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities.\n\n\nThe Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a suffragan of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.[67] The diocese includes all the parishes of San Marino. The earliest mention of Montefeltro, as *Mona Feretri*, is in the diplomas by which Charlemagne confirmed the donation of Pepin. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at San Leo. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino.[68] Since 1988, there is formally an apostolic nunciature to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.\n\n\nOther faiths include the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThere has been a Jewish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years.[69] The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino.[70] Jews were permitted official protection by the government.\n\n\nDuring World War II, San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Jews and other Italians (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from Nazi persecution. As of 2012[update], few Jews remain.[71]\n\n\nIn 2019, the sculpture \"Dialogue\" by Michele Chiaruzzi was inaugurated at Saint Anne Chapel, the first monument of its kind devoted to interfaith dialogue.[72]\n\n\n\n\n\nReligions in San Marino (2011)[1]\n| Religion | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Roman Catholic | 97.2%\n |\n| Protestant | 1.1%\n |\n| Other Christian | 0.7%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.1%\n |\n| Other | 0.1%\n |\n| Not religious | 0.7%\n |\n| No answer | 0.1%\n |\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive Sammarinese license plates, which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is \"RSM\".\n\n\nThere are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private airstrip located in Torraccia. Most tourists who arrive by air land at Federico Fellini International Airport (close to the Italian city of Rimini), then make the transfer by bus.\n\n\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino public transport comprises eight local bus lines entirely within San Marino. Cross-border connection to Rimini is available across a highway bridge in Rovereta.\n\n\nThere is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station.\n\n\nA limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic,[73] and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial tramway to Monte Titano\nThere is a 1.5-kilometre (1 mi) aerial tramway connecting the City of San Marino on top of Monte Titano with Borgo Maggiore, a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, Dogana, via the local bus service.\n\n\nTwo aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino\n\nToday, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before World War II, it had a single narrow-gauge line called the Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of Valdragone but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.[74]\nAn advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes. Debate continues on whether the line should be restored, as Rimini is the nearest bigger city and has access to the Adriatic sea, the Italian railway network, and the Federico Fellini International Airport.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on the |\n| Culture of San Marino |\n| ![](image) |\n| History |\n| People |\n| Languages |\n| Cuisine |\n| Festivals |\n| Religion |\n| Music |\n| Media\n* Television\n |\n| Sport |\n| Monuments\n* World Heritage Sites\n |\n| Symbols\n* Flag\n* Coat of arms\n* National anthem\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The three towers are: *Guaita*, the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century *Cesta*, located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century *Montale*, on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.\n\n\n\n### University[edit]\n\n\nThe *Università degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino* (University of the Republic of San Marino)[75] is the main university, which includes the *Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino* (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the *Istituto Musicale Sammarinese* (Sammarinese Musical Institute)[76] and the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino or *Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino* (International Academy of Sciences San Marino).[77] The latter is known for adopting Esperanto as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).\n\n\nItalian author Umberto Eco had attempted to create a \"university without physical structures\" in San Marino.[78]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in San Marino\n\nSee also: San Marino at the Olympics and Football in San Marino\n\nIn San Marino football is the most popular sport. Basketball and volleyball are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the San Marino Football Federation, the San Marino Basketball Federation and the San Marino Volleyball Federation.\n\n\nThe San Marino national football team has had little success, being made up of part-timers, such as local plumbers and farmers. Never qualifying for a major tournament, and recording only one win in over 25 years of its history, a 1–0 victory in 2004 against Liechtenstein.[79] They have drawn four more, with their most notable result being a 1993 0–0 draw with Turkey during the European qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[80] In the same qualifying competition Davide Gualtieri scored a goal 8.3 seconds into a match against England; this goal held the record for the fastest in international football until 2016.[81][82] San Marino has a club in the Italian league system called A.S.D.V. San Marino and a domestic amateur league, the Campionato Sammarinese, whose teams also participate in European club competitions. Together with Italy, San Marino held the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with teams playing at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle. With Italy being the sole automatic qualifiers, the Sammarinese team was not participating in the final tournament.\n\n\n\n![](image)2005 San Marino Grand Prix held in Imola, Italy\nA Formula One race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was named after the state, although it did not take place there. Instead, it was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about 100 km (60 mi) northwest of San Marino. Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna suffered fatal accidents a day apart during the 1994 Grand Prix. This international event was removed from the calendar in 2007, although the circuit has since returned to the calendar as the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.\n\n\nThe San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, as does San Marino's round of the World Superbike Championship.\n\n\nSan Marino has a professional baseball team which plays in Italy's top division. It has participated in the European Cup tournament for the continent's top club sides several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2007. It won the championship in 2006, 2011 and 2014.\n\n\nShooting is also very popular in San Marino, with many shooters having taken part in international competitions and the Olympic Games. San Marino is also the smallest country to have ever won an Olympic medal, having won one silver and a bronze in shooting in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Despite their small population, they got their silver in a team event losing the gold medal match to Spain 41–40.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese cuisine\n\n![](image)A *piadina*, a dish characteristic of the Italian region of Romagna and of its enclave of San Marino\nThe cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to Italian, especially that of the adjoining Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products.[83] Its best known is probably the *Torta Tre Monti* (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the Three Towers of San Marino. The country also has a small wine industry.\n\n\n\n### UNESCO[edit]\n\n\nThe site San Marino: Historic Centre and Mount Titano became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2008.[84] The decision was taken during the 32nd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee composed of 21 countries convened in Québec, Canada.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of San Marino and San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

A well-known 17th-century composer is Francesco Maria Marini. The pop singer Little Tony achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom and Italy in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\nSan Marino has taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest eleven times, achieving three final qualifications to date (with then-three, eventually four-time contestant and San Marino native Valentina Monetta with \"Maybe\" in 2014, Turkish singer Serhat with \"Say Na Na Na\" who achieved 19th place in the final in 2019 and Italian singer Senhit along with American rapper Flo Rida who qualified for the 2021 final with the song \"Adrenalina\").\n\n\n\n### Public holidays and festivals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in San Marino\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Name\n | Explanation\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 January\n | New Year's Day | Festival marking the beginning of the new year\n |\n| 6 January\n | Epiphany | Commemorates the visit of the three wise men or magi to the infant Jesus\n |\n| 5 February\n | Feast of Saint Agatha | Commemoration of Saint Agatha, co-patroness of the Republic after the country was liberated from foreign rule on her feast day in 1740[21] |\n| Variable, the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox | Easter | Resurrection of Jesus |\n| Variable, the Monday after Easter Sunday\n | Easter Monday | Monday after Easter day\n |\n| 25 March\n | Anniversary of the Arengo | Anniversary of the 1906 Arengo and the Festa delle Milizie (Feast of the Militants)\n |\n| 1 May\n | Labour Day | Celebration of workers and employees\n |\n| *Variable*, the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday | Corpus Christi | Commemoration of the body and blood of Jesus Christ\n |\n| 28 July\n | Liberation from Fascism\n | Commemoration of the fall of the Sammarinese Fascist Party |\n| 15 August\n | Ferragosto (Assumption)\n | Commemoration of the Virgin Mary's assumption into heaven\n |\n| 3 September\n | The Feast of Saint Marinus and the Republic\n | National feast of Saint Marinus (San Marino), celebrating the origin of the Republic in 301\n |\n| 1 November\n | All Saints' Day | Feast dedicated to all saints\n |\n| 2 November\n | All Souls'Day | Remembrance of all those who gave their lives for San Marino in war\n |\n| 8 December\n | Immaculate Conception | Remembrance of the Virgin Mary's conception without original sin\n |\n| 24 December\n | Christmas Eve | Day before the commemoration of the birth of Jesus |\n| 25 December\n | Christmas | Birth of Jesus |\n| 26 December\n | Saint Stephen's Day | Commemoration of the death of Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr\n |\n| 31 December\n | New Year's Eve | Celebration which closes and marks the end of the year\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The Catholic Guide and Scout Association of San Marino\n* City-state\n* Index of San Marino–related articles\n* Outline of San Marino\n* Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino\n* Telecommunications in San Marino\n* Order of San Marino and Order of Saint Agatha\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** San Marino. *The World Factbook*.

The nearest airport is also in Italy. The country's capital city, the City of San Marino, is located atop Monte Titano, while its largest settlement is Dogana within the largest municipality of Serravalle. San Marino's official language is Italian.\n\n\nThe country derives its name from Saint Marinus, a stonemason from the then-Roman island of Rab in present-day Croatia. Born in AD 275, Marinus participated in the rebuilding of Rimini's city walls after their destruction by Liburnian pirates. Marinus then went on to found an independently ruled monastic community on Monte Titano in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to being the oldest extant sovereign state, as well as the oldest constitutional republic.[12]\n\n\nUniquely, San Marino's constitution dictates that its democratically elected legislature, the Grand and General Council, must elect two heads of state every six months. Known as captains regent, the two heads of state serve concurrently and with equal powers until their term expires after six months.\n\n\nThe country's economy is mainly based on finance, industry, services, retail, and tourism. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in GDP per capita, with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions.[1] Despite this fact, ranking 44th, its Human Development Index score is the lowest in Western Europe.[6] Its health care system ranked 3rd in the first ever World Health Organization analysis of the world's health systems.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of San Marino\n\n![](image)Illustration of Saint Marinus, the founder of the Republic of San Marino and prominent cultural figure\nSaint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\n\n\nThe official founding date is 3 September 301 AD.[14] In 1291 San Marino appealed to the bishop of Arezzo, Ildebrandino Guidi di Romena, against the contribution demands by the Vicario del Montefeltro. Jurist Palamede di Rimini, decided in favour of San Marino and recognised its tax exemption from tributes demands of Montefeltro. In 1296, when Guglielmo Durante was the governor of Romagna, Sammarinesi appealed to Pope Boniface VIII against the further requests by the Montefeltro podestas regarding tributes. Abbot Ranieri di Sant'Anastasio was assigned to judge the dispute. A long process was held using various witnesses and sources to determine San Marino tax's exemption status. The verdict was probably in favour of the autonomy of San Marino, as later the State has never paid taxes to the Montefeltro.[15]\n\n\nIn 1320, the community of Chiesanuova chose to join the country.[16] In 1463, San Marino was enlarged to include the communities of Faetano, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle, since then the country's borders have remained unchanged.[17]\n\n\nIn 1503, Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, occupied the Republic for six months until his father's successor, Pope Julius II, intervened and restored the country's independence.[18]\n\n\nOn 4 June 1543, Fabiano di Monte San Savino, nephew of the later Pope Julius III, attempted to conquer the republic, but his infantry and cavalry failed as they got lost in a dense fog, which the Sammarinese attributed to Saint Quirinus, whose feast day it was.[19]\n\n\nAfter the Duchy of Urbino was annexed by the Papal States in 1625, San Marino became an enclave within the papal states. This led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never amounted to a *de facto* Papal control of the republic.[20]\n\n\nThe country was occupied on 17 October 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of Ravenna, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, but independence was restored by Pope Clement XII on 5 February 1740, the feast day of Saint Agatha, after which she became a patron saint of the republic.[21]\n\n\nThe advance of Napoleon's army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty by one of its regents, Antonio Onofri, who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Due to Onofri's intervention, Napoleon promised, in a letter to Gaspard Monge, scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' revanchism.[22][23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anita and Giuseppe Garibaldi in San Marino, 1849\n![](image)The San Marino constitution, or more precisely statutes, of 1600\nDuring the later phase of the Italian unification process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including Giuseppe Garibaldi and his wife Anita. Garibaldi allowed San Marino to remain independent. San Marino and the Kingdom of Italy signed a Convention of Friendship in 1862.[24]\n\n\nThe government of San Marino made United States President Abraham Lincoln an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that \"government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring\".[25][26]\n\n\n\n### 20th century onwards[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 24 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not acquiesce. Two groups of ten volunteers joined the Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.[27]\n\n\nAfter the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tension between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the Sammarinese Fascist Party (*Partito Fascista Sammarinese*, PFS), founded in 1922 and styled largely on their Italian counterpart. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from Benito Mussolini's fascist government in Italy.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)British troops at Monte Titano during the Battle of San Marino, September 1944\nDuring World War II, San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article in *The New York Times* that it had declared war on the United Kingdom on 17 September 1940.[29] The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.[30]\n\n\nOn 28 July 1943, three days after the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The PFS regained power on 1 April 1944, but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the Royal Air Force, in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter.[31] San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the Gothic Line.[32] In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the Battle of San Marino.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSan Marino had the world's first democratically elected communist government – a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party, which held office between 1945 and 1957.[33][34] The coalition lost power through the fatti di Rovereta.\n\n\nSan Marino became a member of the Council of Europe in 1988 and of the United Nations in 1992. It is not a member of the European Union, although it uses the euro as its currency (despite not legally being part of the Eurozone). Before the introduction of the euro, the country's currency was the Sammarinese lira.\n\n\nAs of June 2020, San Marino had the highest death rate per capita of any country, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[35] In April 2021, it was reported that San Marino was using the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine rather than vaccines approved by the EU, following a slow rollout for the latter vaccines.[36][37]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics, San Marino became the smallest country to earn an Olympic medal when Alessandra Perilli won a bronze medal in the women's trap.[38] They later won another medal, this one silver, with Perilli's and Gian Marco Berti's performance in the mixed trap shooting event.[39]\n\n\nOn 7 March 2022, during the Russia-Ukraine War, the Russian Kremlin released on Twitter a list of countries which it considered \"unfriendly\" to Russia. San Marino was included in the list, alongside numerous well-known Russian adversaries such as the United States and countries in the European Union. The motivation for including San Marino as an \"unfriendly\" nation was unclear, and it gained substantial attention on the Internet.[40]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2022, San Marino officials voted to legalize abortion in the republic, \"one of the last European states to have had the procedure outlawed under all circumstances\".[41] 32 members of the legislature approved the bill while 10 abstained and 7 voted against.[42] The public health system is promised[*clarification needed*] to cover the cost of the abortion procedure.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of San Marino\n\n![](image)Enlargeable, detailed map of San Marino\n![](image)The fortress of *Guaita* on Monte Titano\n![](image)View of the *Guaita* defensive wall\nSan Marino is an enclave surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, on the border between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Marche and about ten kilometres (six miles) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no substantial naturally flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749 m (2,457 ft) above sea level; the lowest, the Ausa River (ending in the Marecchia),[43] is 55 m (180 ft). San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\n\n\nIt is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country (the others being Vatican City, also enclosed by Italy, and Lesotho, enclosed by South Africa). It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth-smallest country in the world.[11]\n\n\nThe terrestrial ecoregion of Italian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests lies within San Marino's territory.[44] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.01/10, ranking it last globally out of 172 countries.[45]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: *Cfa*), with some continental influences. It has warm to hot summers and cool winters, typical of inland areas of the central Italian Peninsula. Precipitation is scattered throughout the year with no real dry month. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400–500 m (1,300–1,600 feet) of elevation.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for San Marino (2006–2023)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 31.9(89.4)\n | 35.5(95.9)\n | 35.1(95.2)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 30.5(86.9)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 6.4(43.5)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 7.4(45.3)\n | 15.9(60.7)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 4.8(40.6)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 6.7(44.1)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 10.2(50.3)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | −6.5(20.3)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n | −5.9(21.4)\n | −2.3(27.9)\n | 1.3(34.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 0.9(33.6)\n | −2.8(27.0)\n | −7.5(18.5)\n | −10.2(13.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 50.2(1.98)\n | 63.9(2.52)\n | 64.5(2.54)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 70.3(2.77)\n | 54.3(2.14)\n | 40.4(1.59)\n | 40.7(1.60)\n | 75.3(2.96)\n | 70.2(2.76)\n | 99.0(3.90)\n | 61.4(2.42)\n | 749.5(29.51)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 7.2\n | 8.4\n | 8.3\n | 7.9\n | 8.6\n | 4.8\n | 4.3\n | 4.5\n | 6.8\n | 7.1\n | 10.2\n | 8.3\n | 86.3\n |\n| Source: Arpae Emilia-Romagna[46] |\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of San Marino\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of San Marino, Constitution of San Marino, Capital punishment in San Marino, San Marino passport, Law enforcement in San Marino, and Elections in San Marino\n\n![](image)The Palazzo Pubblico, seat of the government of San Marino\n![](image)Four former captains regent: from left to right, Mirko Tomassoni, Alessandro Rossi, Alessandro Mancini, and Alberto Selva\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are heads of state,[47] and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Although there is no formal head of government, the secretary for foreign and political affairs is in many ways equal to the prime minister in other countries.[48] Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n\nSan Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect, as the Statutes of 1600 are still at the core of its constitutional framework.[49]\n\n\nSan Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the council. Still today, Captains Regent are elected every six months by the council.\n\n\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (*Consiglio grande e generale*). The council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old parishes of the republic. All citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote.\n\n\nBesides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the judicial branch during the period of legislature of the council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councilors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\n\n\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regent to be the heads of state. The captains are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\n\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the captains regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\n\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing Pact for San Marino, led by the San Marinese Christian Democratic Party; and the left-wing Reforms and Freedom, led by the Party of Socialists and Democrats, a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the former communist Party of Democrats. The 2008 general election was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\n\n\nOn 1 October 2007, Mirko Tomassoni was elected as captain regent, making him the first disabled person elected to that office.[50]\n\n\nSan Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino (*Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino*) exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n\nOn 1 April 2022, 58-year-old Paolo Rondelli was elected as one of the two captains regent, its heads of state. He had previously been the Ambassador to the United States and is the world's first openly gay head of state.[51]\n\n\n\n### Administrative division[edit]\n\n\n#### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of San Marino\nSan Marino is divided into nine municipalities, known locally as **castelli** (meaning \"castles\"):\n\n\n\n* San Marino (City of San Marino, officially **Città di San Marino**) is the capital.\n\n\nAnd eight minor municipalities:\n\n\n\n* Acquaviva\n* Borgo Maggiore\n* Chiesanuova\n* Domagnano\n* Faetano\n* Fiorentino\n* Montegiardino\n* Serravalle\n\n\nThe largest settlement of the Republic is Dogana, which is not an autonomous **castello**, but rather belongs to the Castello of Serravalle.\n\n\nIn a similar way to an Italian **comune**, each **castello** includes a main settlement, called **capoluogo**, which is the seat of the **castello**, and some even smaller localities known as **frazioni**.\n\n\n\n#### Curacies[edit]\n\n\nThe republic is made up of 43 parishes,[52] named *curacies* (Italian: *curazie*): Cà Berlone, Cà Chiavello, Cà Giannino, Cà Melone, Cà Ragni, Cà Rigo, Cailungo, Caladino, Calligaria, Canepa, Capanne, Casole, Castellaro, Cerbaiola, Cinque Vie, Confine, Corianino, Crociale, Dogana, Falciano, Fiorina, Galavotto, Gualdicciolo, La Serra, Lesignano, Molarini, Montalbo, Monte Pulito, Murata, Pianacci, Piandivello, Poggio Casalino, Poggio Chiesanuova, Ponte Mellini, Rovereta, San Giovanni sotto le Penne, Santa Mustiola, Spaccio Giannoni, Teglio, Torraccia, Valdragone, Valgiurata, and Ventoso.\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese Armed Forces\n\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces. Different branches have varied functions, including performing ceremonial duties, patrolling borders, mounting guard at government buildings, and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n\n\n#### Crossbow Corps[edit]\n\n\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Rock[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Guards of the Rock\nThe Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them.[53] In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City, the seat of national government.\n\n\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard.[53] Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Grand and General Council[edit]\n\n\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1741,[53] is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the council are to protect the captains regent, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n\n\n#### Company of Uniformed Militia[edit]\n\n\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\n\n\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n\n\n#### Military Ensemble[edit]\n\n\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia,[53] and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 60 musicians.[54] The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n\n\n#### Gendarmerie[edit]\n\n\nEstablished in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency.[53] Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\n\n\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the *Corpi Militari Volontari*, or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of San Marino, Sammarinese euro coins, Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino, and List of banks in San Marino\n\n![](image)Tourism and banking are the country's main sources of revenue.\nSan Marino is a developed country,[55] and although it is not a European Union member it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins. Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors.\n\n\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking, electronics, and ceramics. The main agricultural products are wine and cheese. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\n\n\nSan Marino's postage stamps, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to philatelists and are a significant source of income.[56] San Marino is no longer a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation.[57]\n\n\nIt has the world's third highest rate of car ownership, being one of only a handful of countries with more vehicles than people.[58] As of October 2023, Gibraltar had the highest rate of car ownership per capita, and Guernsey was in the number two spot.[59]\n\n\n\n### Taxation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:* \"San Marino\" – news **·** newspapers **·** books **·** scholar **·** JSTOR *(October 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 8.5%. Capital gains are also subject to an 8.5% tax, and interest from bank deposits is subject to an 11% tax.[60] Several benefits apply to new businesses, which can strongly reduce the amount of taxes to be paid.\n\n\nThe personal income tax (IGR, Italian: *Imposta Generale sui Redditi*) was introduced in 1984 and it was heavily reformed in 2013 with the goal of increasing fiscal revenue. The nominal tax rate ranges from 9% for an annual revenue below €10,000 to 35% for revenues above €80,000.\n\n\nIn 1972, a value-added tax (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and an equivalent tax was introduced also in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. However, this tax is not a standard value-added tax, but rather it is an import tax, thus, it is levied only on imported goods and raw resources. For this reason it is locally best known as single stage tax (Italian: *imposta monofase*), as it is only applied one time during importation, while VAT is applied at every exchange. Furthermore, while VAT also applies to services, the import tax only applies on physical goods. Another important difference is that while VAT is computed on the final price paid by the consumer, the import tax is levied on the importation cost paid by the company, which is generally much lower.\n\n\nUnder the European Union customs agreement, San Marino import tax is considered equivalent to the European VAT system. A separate tax on services, with a rate of 3%, has been introduced in 2011. The introduction of a true VAT system, not dissimilar from the European one, is under development.\n\n\nBecause San Marino's tax rate is lower than surrounding Italy's, many businesses choose to be based in San Marino to avoid the higher rates. San Marino boasts a corporate rate 14.5% lower than Italy (23%) and 12.5% lower than the EU average (21.3%). This has made San Marino the tax haven of choice for many wealthy Italians and businesses.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in San Marino\n\nThe tourism sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's GDP,[61] with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.[62]\n\n\n\n### Conventions with Italy[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862,[63] dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.\n\n\nCultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's government monopoly are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden; all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use Italy's mint; the agreement does not affect the right of the Republic of San Marino to continue to issue gold coins denominated in Scudi[64] (the legal value of 1 gold Scudo is 37.50 euros). Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is one legally operating casino.\n\n\nIn exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, provided at cost, of sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).[65]\n\n\nAt the border there are no formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their passports.\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Over 48.4% of the population profess the Catholic faith, and approximately half of those regularly attend church. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino. The country's high Roman Catholic majority can mainly be traced back to the country's founding, when Saint Marinus set up the first fortress to protect Christians from Roman persecution.[66] The small state's culture has primarily remained Catholic ever since.\n\n\nThere is a provision under the income tax rules that taxpayers have the right to request the allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities.\n\n\nThe Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a suffragan of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.[67] The diocese includes all the parishes of San Marino. The earliest mention of Montefeltro, as *Mona Feretri*, is in the diplomas by which Charlemagne confirmed the donation of Pepin. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at San Leo. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino.[68] Since 1988, there is formally an apostolic nunciature to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.\n\n\nOther faiths include the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThere has been a Jewish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years.[69] The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino.[70] Jews were permitted official protection by the government.\n\n\nDuring World War II, San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Jews and other Italians (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from Nazi persecution. As of 2012[update], few Jews remain.[71]\n\n\nIn 2019, the sculpture \"Dialogue\" by Michele Chiaruzzi was inaugurated at Saint Anne Chapel, the first monument of its kind devoted to interfaith dialogue.[72]\n\n\n\n\n\nReligions in San Marino (2011)[1]\n| Religion | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Roman Catholic | 97.2%\n |\n| Protestant | 1.1%\n |\n| Other Christian | 0.7%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.1%\n |\n| Other | 0.1%\n |\n| Not religious | 0.7%\n |\n| No answer | 0.1%\n |\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive Sammarinese license plates, which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is \"RSM\".\n\n\nThere are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private airstrip located in Torraccia. Most tourists who arrive by air land at Federico Fellini International Airport (close to the Italian city of Rimini), then make the transfer by bus.\n\n\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino public transport comprises eight local bus lines entirely within San Marino. Cross-border connection to Rimini is available across a highway bridge in Rovereta.\n\n\nThere is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station.\n\n\nA limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic,[73] and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial tramway to Monte Titano\nThere is a 1.5-kilometre (1 mi) aerial tramway connecting the City of San Marino on top of Monte Titano with Borgo Maggiore, a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, Dogana, via the local bus service.\n\n\nTwo aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino\n\nToday, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before World War II, it had a single narrow-gauge line called the Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of Valdragone but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.[74]\nAn advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes. Debate continues on whether the line should be restored, as Rimini is the nearest bigger city and has access to the Adriatic sea, the Italian railway network, and the Federico Fellini International Airport.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on the |\n| Culture of San Marino |\n| ![](image) |\n| History |\n| People |\n| Languages |\n| Cuisine |\n| Festivals |\n| Religion |\n| Music |\n| Media\n* Television\n |\n| Sport |\n| Monuments\n* World Heritage Sites\n |\n| Symbols\n* Flag\n* Coat of arms\n* National anthem\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

They are depicted on both the flag of San Marino and its coat of arms. The three towers are: *Guaita*, the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century *Cesta*, located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century *Montale*, on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.\n\n\n\n### University[edit]\n\n\nThe *Università degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino* (University of the Republic of San Marino)[75] is the main university, which includes the *Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino* (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the *Istituto Musicale Sammarinese* (Sammarinese Musical Institute)[76] and the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino or *Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino* (International Academy of Sciences San Marino).[77] The latter is known for adopting Esperanto as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).\n\n\nItalian author Umberto Eco had attempted to create a \"university without physical structures\" in San Marino.[78]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in San Marino\n\nSee also: San Marino at the Olympics and Football in San Marino\n\nIn San Marino football is the most popular sport. Basketball and volleyball are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the San Marino Football Federation, the San Marino Basketball Federation and the San Marino Volleyball Federation.\n\n\nThe San Marino national football team has had little success, being made up of part-timers, such as local plumbers and farmers. Never qualifying for a major tournament, and recording only one win in over 25 years of its history, a 1–0 victory in 2004 against Liechtenstein.[79] They have drawn four more, with their most notable result being a 1993 0–0 draw with Turkey during the European qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[80] In the same qualifying competition Davide Gualtieri scored a goal 8.3 seconds into a match against England; this goal held the record for the fastest in international football until 2016.[81][82] San Marino has a club in the Italian league system called A.S.D.V. San Marino and a domestic amateur league, the Campionato Sammarinese, whose teams also participate in European club competitions. Together with Italy, San Marino held the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with teams playing at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle. With Italy being the sole automatic qualifiers, the Sammarinese team was not participating in the final tournament.\n\n\n\n![](image)2005 San Marino Grand Prix held in Imola, Italy\nA Formula One race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was named after the state, although it did not take place there. Instead, it was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about 100 km (60 mi) northwest of San Marino. Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna suffered fatal accidents a day apart during the 1994 Grand Prix. This international event was removed from the calendar in 2007, although the circuit has since returned to the calendar as the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.\n\n\nThe San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, as does San Marino's round of the World Superbike Championship.\n\n\nSan Marino has a professional baseball team which plays in Italy's top division. It has participated in the European Cup tournament for the continent's top club sides several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2007. It won the championship in 2006, 2011 and 2014.\n\n\nShooting is also very popular in San Marino, with many shooters having taken part in international competitions and the Olympic Games. San Marino is also the smallest country to have ever won an Olympic medal, having won one silver and a bronze in shooting in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Despite their small population, they got their silver in a team event losing the gold medal match to Spain 41–40.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese cuisine\n\n![](image)A *piadina*, a dish characteristic of the Italian region of Romagna and of its enclave of San Marino\nThe cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to Italian, especially that of the adjoining Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products.[83] Its best known is probably the *Torta Tre Monti* (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the Three Towers of San Marino. The country also has a small wine industry.\n\n\n\n### UNESCO[edit]\n\n\nThe site San Marino: Historic Centre and Mount Titano became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2008.[84] The decision was taken during the 32nd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee composed of 21 countries convened in Québec, Canada.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of San Marino and San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

A well-known 17th-century composer is Francesco Maria Marini. The pop singer Little Tony achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom and Italy in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\nSan Marino has taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest eleven times, achieving three final qualifications to date (with then-three, eventually four-time contestant and San Marino native Valentina Monetta with \"Maybe\" in 2014, Turkish singer Serhat with \"Say Na Na Na\" who achieved 19th place in the final in 2019 and Italian singer Senhit along with American rapper Flo Rida who qualified for the 2021 final with the song \"Adrenalina\").\n\n\n\n### Public holidays and festivals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in San Marino\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Name\n | Explanation\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 January\n | New Year's Day | Festival marking the beginning of the new year\n |\n| 6 January\n | Epiphany | Commemorates the visit of the three wise men or magi to the infant Jesus\n |\n| 5 February\n | Feast of Saint Agatha | Commemoration of Saint Agatha, co-patroness of the Republic after the country was liberated from foreign rule on her feast day in 1740[21] |\n| Variable, the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox | Easter | Resurrection of Jesus |\n| Variable, the Monday after Easter Sunday\n | Easter Monday | Monday after Easter day\n |\n| 25 March\n | Anniversary of the Arengo | Anniversary of the 1906 Arengo and the Festa delle Milizie (Feast of the Militants)\n |\n| 1 May\n | Labour Day | Celebration of workers and employees\n |\n| *Variable*, the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday | Corpus Christi | Commemoration of the body and blood of Jesus Christ\n |\n| 28 July\n | Liberation from Fascism\n | Commemoration of the fall of the Sammarinese Fascist Party |\n| 15 August\n | Ferragosto (Assumption)\n | Commemoration of the Virgin Mary's assumption into heaven\n |\n| 3 September\n | The Feast of Saint Marinus and the Republic\n | National feast of Saint Marinus (San Marino), celebrating the origin of the Republic in 301\n |\n| 1 November\n | All Saints' Day | Feast dedicated to all saints\n |\n| 2 November\n | All Souls'Day | Remembrance of all those who gave their lives for San Marino in war\n |\n| 8 December\n | Immaculate Conception | Remembrance of the Virgin Mary's conception without original sin\n |\n| 24 December\n | Christmas Eve | Day before the commemoration of the birth of Jesus |\n| 25 December\n | Christmas | Birth of Jesus |\n| 26 December\n | Saint Stephen's Day | Commemoration of the death of Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr\n |\n| 31 December\n | New Year's Eve | Celebration which closes and marks the end of the year\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The Catholic Guide and Scout Association of San Marino\n* City-state\n* Index of San Marino–related articles\n* Outline of San Marino\n* Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino\n* Telecommunications in San Marino\n* Order of San Marino and Order of Saint Agatha\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** San Marino. *The World Factbook*.

Its islands are situated about midway between Hawaii and Australia. They lie east-northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands (which belong to the Solomon Islands), northeast of Vanuatu, southeast of Nauru, south of Kiribati, west of Tokelau, northwest of Samoa and Wallis and Futuna, and north of Fiji. Tuvalu is composed of three reef islands and six atolls. They are spread out between the latitude of 5° and 10° south and between the longitude of 176° and 180°. They lie west of the International Date Line.[8] The 2017 census determined that Tuvalu had a population of 10,645. The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi).\n\n\nThe first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians, according to well established theories regarding a migration of Polynesians into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago.[9] Long before European contact with the Pacific islands, Polynesians frequently voyaged by canoe between the islands. Polynesian navigation skills enabled them to make elaborately planned journeys in either double-hulled sailing canoes or outrigger canoes.[10] Scholars believe that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls, which then served as a stepping stone for further migration into the Polynesian outliers in Melanesia and Micronesia.[11][12][13]\n\n\nIn 1569, Spanish navigator and documentor Álvaro de Mendaña became the first European to sail through the archipelago, sighting the island of Nui during an expedition he was making in search of Terra Australis. The island of Funafuti was named Ellice's Island in 1819. Later, the whole group was named Ellice Islands by English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay. In the late 19th century, Great Britain claimed control over the Ellice Islands, designating them as within their sphere of influence.[14] Between 9 and 16 October 1892, Captain Gibson of HMS *Curacoa* declared each of the Ellice Islands to be a British protectorate. Britain assigned a resident commissioner to administer the Ellice Islands as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT). From 1916 to 1975, they were managed as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony.\n\n\nA referendum was held in 1974 to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration.[15] As a result of the referendum, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony legally ceased to exist on 1 October 1975, and on 1 January 1976, the old administration was officially separated,[16] and two separate British colonies, Kiribati and Tuvalu, were formed. On 1 October 1978, Tuvalu became fully independent as a sovereign state within the Commonwealth, and is a constitutional monarchy with King Charles III as King of Tuvalu. On 5 September 2000, Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations.\n\n\nThe islands do not have a significant amount of soil, so the country relies heavily on imports and fishing for food. Licensing fishing permits to international companies, grants and aid projects, and remittances to their families from Tuvaluan seafarers who work on cargo ships are important parts of the economy. Because it is a low-lying island nation, the country is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise due to climate change. It is active in international climate negotiations as part of the Alliance of Small Island States.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tuvalu\n\nSee also: Timeline of the history of Tuvalu and Outline of Tuvalu\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding the migration into the Pacific that began about 3000 years ago. During pre-European-contact times, there was frequent canoe voyaging between the nearer islands including Samoa and Tonga.[17] Eight of the nine islands of Tuvalu were inhabited. This explains the origin of the name, Tuvalu, which means \"eight standing together\" in Tuvaluan (compare to *\\*walo* meaning \"eight\" in Proto-Austronesian). Possible evidence of human-made fires in the Caves of Nanumanga suggests humans may have occupied the islands for thousands of years.\n\n\nAn important creation myth in the islands of Tuvalu is the story of *te Pusi mo te Ali* (the Eel and the Flounder), who are said to have created the islands of Tuvalu. *Te Ali* (the flounder) is believed to be the origin of the flat atolls of Tuvalu and *te Pusi* (the eel) is the model for the coconut palms that are important in the lives of Tuvaluans. The stories of the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island. On Niutao,[18] Funafuti and Vaitupu, for instance, the founding ancestor is described as being from Samoa,[19][20] whereas on Nanumea, the founding ancestor is described as being from Tonga.[19]\n\n\n\n### Early contacts with other cultures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Tuvaluan man in traditional attire drawn by Alfred Agate in 1841, during the United States Exploring Expedition[21]\nTuvalu was first sighted by Europeans on 16 January 1568, during the voyage of Álvaro de Mendaña from Spain, who sailed past Nui and charted it as *Isla de Jesús* (Spanish for \"Island of Jesus\") because the previous day was the feast of the Holy Name. Mendaña made contact with the islanders but was unable to land.[22][23] During Mendaña's second voyage across the Pacific, he passed Niulakita on 29 August 1595, which he named *La Solitaria*.[23][24]\n\n\nCaptain John Byron passed through the islands of Tuvalu in 1764, during his circumnavigation of the globe as captain of the *Dolphin* (1751).[25] He charted the atolls as *Lagoon Islands*.\n\n\nThe first recorded sighting of Nanumea by Europeans was by Spanish naval officer Francisco Mourelle de la Rúa who sailed past it on 5 May 1781 as captain of the frigate *La Princesa*, when attempting a southern crossing of the Pacific from the Philippines to New Spain. He charted Nanumea as *San Augustin*.[26][27] Keith S. Chambers and Doug Munro (1980) identified Niutao as the island that Mourelle also sailed past on 5 May 1781, thus solving what Europeans had called *The Mystery of Gran Cocal*.[24][28] Mourelle's map and journal named the island *El Gran Cocal* ('The Great Coconut Plantation'); however, the latitude and longitude was uncertain.[28] Longitude could be reckoned only crudely at the time, as accurate chronometers did not become available until the late 18th century.\n\n\nIn 1809, Captain Patterson in the brig *Elizabeth* sighted Nanumea while passing through the northern Tuvalu waters on a trading voyage from Port Jackson, Sydney, Australia to China.[26]\nIn May 1819, Arent Schuyler de Peyster, of New York, captain of the armed brigantine or privateer *Rebecca*, sailing under British colours,[29][30] passed through the southern Tuvaluan waters. De Peyster sighted Nukufetau and Funafuti, which he named Ellice's Island after an English politician, Edward Ellice, the Member of Parliament for Coventry and the owner of the *Rebecca*'s cargo.[28][31][32] The name Ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay.[33]\n\n\nIn 1820, the Russian explorer Mikhail Lazarev visited Nukufetau as commander of the *Mirny*.[28] Louis-Isidore Duperrey, captain of *La Coquille*, sailed past Nanumanga in May 1824 during a circumnavigation of the Earth (1822–1825).[34] A Dutch expedition (the frigate *Maria Reigersberg*) found Nui on the morning of 14 June 1825, and named the main island (Fenua Tapu) as *Nederlandsch Eiland*.[35]\n\n\nWhalers began roving the Pacific, although they visited Tuvalu only infrequently because of the difficulties of landing on the atolls. The American Captain George Barrett of the Nantucket whaler *Independence II* has been identified as the first whaler to hunt the waters around Tuvalu.[31] He bartered coconuts from the people of Nukulaelae in November 1821, and also visited Niulakita.[24] He established a shore camp on Sakalua islet of Nukufetau, where coal was used to melt down the whale blubber.[36]\n\n\nFor less than a year between 1862 and 1863, Peruvian ships engaged in the so-called \"blackbirding\" trade, by which they recruited or impressed workers, combed the smaller islands of Polynesia from Easter Island in the eastern Pacific to Tuvalu and the southern atolls of the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati). They sought recruits to fill the extreme labour shortage in Peru.[37] While some islanders were voluntary recruits, the \"blackbirders\" were notorious for enticing islanders on to ships with tricks, such as pretending to be Christian missionaries, as well as kidnapping islanders at gunpoint. The Rev. A. W. Murray,[38] the earliest European missionary in Tuvalu, reported that in 1863 about 170 people were taken from Funafuti and about 250 were taken from Nukulaelae,[28] as there were fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae.[39][40]\n\n\nChristianity came to Tuvalu in 1861 when Elekana, a deacon of a Congregational church in Manihiki, Cook Islands, became caught in a storm and drifted for eight weeks before landing at Nukulaelae on 10 May 1861.[28][41] Elekana began preaching Christianity. He was trained at Malua Theological College, a London Missionary Society (LMS) school in Samoa, before beginning his work in establishing the Church of Tuvalu.[28]\n\n\nIn 1865, the Rev. A. W. Murray of the LMS, a Protestant congregationalist missionary society, arrived as the first European missionary; he also evangelised among the inhabitants of Tuvalu. By 1878 Protestantism was considered well established, as there were preachers on each island.[28] In the later 19th and early 20th centuries, the ministers of what became the Church of Tuvalu (*Te Ekalesia Kelisiano Tuvalu*) were predominantly Samoans,[42] who influenced the development of the Tuvaluan language and the music of Tuvalu.[43]\n\n\nThe islands came into Britain's sphere of influence in the late 19th century, when each of the Ellice Islands was declared a British protectorate by Captain Gibson of HMS *Curacoa*, between 9 and 16 October 1892.[44]\n\n\n\n### Trading firms and traders[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Islands of Tuvalu\nTrading companies became active in Tuvalu in the mid-19th century; the trading companies engaged white (palagi) traders who lived on the islands. John (also known as Jack) O'Brien was the first European to settle in Tuvalu; he became a trader on Funafuti in the 1850s. He married Salai, the daughter of the paramount chief of Funafuti. Louis Becke, who later found success as a writer, was a trader on Nanumanga from April 1880 until the trading station was destroyed later that year in a cyclone.[45] He then became a trader on Nukufetau.[46][47][48]\n\n\nIn 1892, Captain Davis of HMS *Royalist* reported on trading activities and traders on each of the islands visited. Captain Davis identified the following traders in the Ellice Group: Edmund Duffy (Nanumea); Jack Buckland (Niutao); Harry Nitz (Vaitupu); Jack O'Brien (Funafuti); Alfred Restieaux and Emile Fenisot (Nukufetau); and Martin Kleis (Nui).[49][50] During this time, the greatest number of palagi traders lived on the atolls, acting as agents for the trading companies. Some islands would have competing traders, while dryer islands might only have a single trader.[51]\n\n\nIn the later 1890s and into first decade of the 20th century, structural changes occurred in the operation of the Pacific trading companies; they moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to instead becoming a business operation where the supercargo (the cargo manager of a trading ship) would deal directly with the islanders when a ship visited an island. From 1900, the numbers of palagi traders in Tuvalu declined; the last of them were Fred Whibley on Niutao, Alfred Restieaux on Nukufetau,[52][53] and Martin Kleis on Nui.[50] By 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies,[50][51] although Whibley, Restieaux and Kleis[54] remained in the islands until their deaths.\n\n\n\n### Scientific expeditions and travellers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A man from the Nukufetau atoll, drawn by Alfred Thomas Agate in 1841\nThe United States Exploring Expedition under Charles Wilkes visited Funafuti, Nukufetau, and Vaitupu in 1841.[55] During this expedition, engraver and illustrator Alfred Thomas Agate recorded the dress and tattoo patterns of the men of Nukufetau.[56]\n\n\nIn 1885 or 1886, the New Zealand photographer Thomas Andrew visited Funafuti[57] and Nui.[58][59]\n\n\nIn 1890, Robert Louis Stevenson, his wife Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson and her son Lloyd Osbourne sailed on the *Janet Nicoll*, a trading steamer owned by Henderson and Macfarlane of Auckland, New Zealand, which operated between Sydney and Auckland and into the central Pacific.[60] The *Janet Nicoll* visited three of the Ellice Islands;[61] while Fanny records that they made landfall at Funafuti, Niutao and Nanumea, Jane Resture suggests that it was more likely they landed at Nukufetau rather than Funafuti.[62] An account of this voyage was written by Fanny Stevenson and published under the title *The Cruise of the Janet Nichol*,[63] together with photographs taken by Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne.\n\n\nIn 1894, Count Rudolf Festetics de Tolna, his wife Eila (*née* Haggin) and her daughter Blanche Haggin visited Funafuti aboard the yacht *Le Tolna*.[64] The Count spent several days photographing men and women on Funafuti.[65][66]\n\n\n\n![1900, Woman on Funafuti, Tuvalu, then known as Ellice Islands](image)Woman on Funafuti (1900)  \nPhotography by Harry Clifford Fassett\nThe boreholes on Funafuti, at the site now called *Darwin's Drill*,[67] are the result of drilling conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating the formation of coral reefs to determine whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral of Pacific atolls. This investigation followed the work on *The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs* conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1898.[68] Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney was a member of the 1896 \"Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society\", under Professor William Sollas and led the expedition in 1897.[69] Photographers on these trips recorded people, communities, and scenes at Funafuti.[70]\n\n\nCharles Hedley, a naturalist at the Australian Museum, accompanied the 1896 expedition, and during his stay on Funafuti he collected invertebrate and ethnological objects. The descriptions of these were published in *Memoir III of the Australian Museum Sydney* between 1896 and 1900. Hedley also wrote the *General Account of the Atoll of Funafuti*, *The Ethnology of Funafuti*,[71] and *The Mollusca of Funafuti*.[72][73] Edgar Waite was also part of the 1896 expedition and published *The mammals, reptiles, and fishes of Funafuti*.[74] William Rainbow described the spiders and insects collected at Funafuti in *The insect fauna of Funafuti*.[75]\n\n\nHarry Clifford Fassett, captain's clerk and photographer, recorded people, communities and scenes at Funafuti in 1900 during a visit of USFC *Albatross* when the United States Fish Commission was investigating the formation of coral reefs on Pacific atolls.[76]\n\n\n\n### Colonial administration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British Western Pacific Territories, Gilbert and Ellice Islands, and Governor of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands\n\n![](image)Stamps of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands with portraits of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II\nThe Ellice Islands were administered as a British Protectorate from 1892 to 1916, as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), by a Resident Commissioner based in the Gilbert Islands. The administration of the BWTP ended in 1916, and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony was established, which existed until October 1975.\n\n\n\n### Second World War[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Second World War, as a British colony the Ellice Islands were aligned with the Allies. Early in the war, the Japanese invaded and occupied Makin, Tarawa and other islands in what is now Kiribati. The United States Marine Corps landed on Funafuti on 2 October 1942[77] and on Nanumea and Nukufetau in August 1943.\n\n\nFunafuti was used as a base to prepare for the subsequent seaborne attacks on the Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) that were occupied by Japanese forces.[78]\n\n\nThe islanders assisted the American forces to build airfields on Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau and to unload supplies from ships.[79] On Funafuti, the islanders shifted to the smaller islets so as to allow the American forces to build the airfield and to build naval bases and port facilities on Fongafale.[80] A Naval Construction Battalion (Seabees) built a seaplane ramp on the lagoon side of Fongafale islet, for seaplane operations by both short- and long-range seaplanes, and a compacted coral runway was also constructed on Fongafale,[81] with runways also constructed to create Nanumea Airfield[82] and Nukufetau Airfield.[83] USN Patrol Torpedo Boats (PTs) and seaplanes were based at Naval Base Funafuti from 2 November 1942 to 11 May 1944.[84]\n\n\nThe atolls of Tuvalu acted as staging posts during the preparation for the Battle of Tarawa and the Battle of Makin that commenced on 20 November 1943, which were part of the implementation of \"Operation Galvanic\".[85] After the war, the military airfield on Funafuti was developed into Funafuti International Airport.\n\n\n\n### Post-World War II – transition to independence[edit]\n\n\nThe formation of the United Nations after World War II resulted in the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization committing to a process of decolonisation; as a consequence, the British colonies in the Pacific started on a path to self-determination.[86][87]\n\n\nIn 1974, the ministerial government was introduced to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony through a change to the Constitution. In that year a general election was held,[88] and a referendum was held in 1974 to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration.[89] As a consequence of the referendum, separation occurred in two stages. The Tuvaluan Order 1975, which took effect on 1 October 1975, recognised Tuvalu as a separate British dependency with its own government.[90] The second stage occurred on 1 January 1976, when separate administrations were created out of the civil service of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.[91]: 169[92]\n\n\nIn 1976, Tuvalu adopted the Tuvaluan dollar, whose currency circulates alongside the Australian dollar, which was previously adopted in 1966.\n\n\nElections to the House of Assembly of the British Colony of Tuvalu were held on 27 August 1977, with Toaripi Lauti being appointed Chief Minister in the House of Assembly of the Colony of Tuvalu on 1 October 1977. The House of Assembly was dissolved in July 1978, with the government of Toaripi Lauti continuing as a caretaker government until the 1981 elections were held.[93]\n\n\n\n### Independence[edit]\n\n\nToaripi Lauti became the first Prime Minister on 1 October 1978, when Tuvalu became an independent nation.[86][91]: 153–177 That date is also celebrated as the country's Independence Day and is a public holiday.[94]\n\n\nOn 26 October 1982, Queen Elizabeth II made a special royal tour to Tuvalu.\n\n\nOn 5 September 2000, Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations.[95]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2022, amidst sea level rises, Tuvalu announced plans as the first country in the world to build a self-digital replica in the metaverse in order to preserve its cultural heritage.[96]\n\n\nOn 10 November 2023, Tuvalu signed the Falepili Union, a bilateral diplomatic relationship with Australia.[97] In the Tuvaluan language, Falepili describes the traditional values of good neighbourliness, care and mutual respect.[98] The Treaty addresses climate change and security,[98] with security threats encompassing major natural disasters, health pandemics and traditional security threats.[98] The implementation of the Treaty will involve Australia increasing its contribution to the Tuvalu Trust Fund and the Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project.[98] Australia will also provide a pathway for citizens of Tuvalu to migrate to Australia, to enable  climate-related mobility for Tuvaluans.[98][99]\n\n\nThe understanding of security that is applied in the Falepili Union is consistent with the Boe Declaration (2018) on Regional Security,[100] which commits Pacific Island Forum members to commit to core values, including good governance, liberty of the individual, democratic processes and indigenous rights. The Boe Declaration expanded the Biketawa Declaration (2000) to include issues of human security, environmental security, transnational crime, and cybersecurity.[100]\n\n\n\n## Geography and environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Tuvalu\n\nSee also: Agriculture in Tuvalu and Coral reefs of Tuvalu\n\n### Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A beach at Funafuti atoll\nTuvalu is a volcanic archipelago, and consists of three reef islands (Nanumanga, Niutao and Niulakita) and six true atolls (Funafuti, Nanumea, Nui, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae and Vaitupu).[101] Its small, scattered group of low-lying atolls have poor soil and a total land area of only about 26 square kilometres (10 square miles) making it the fourth smallest country in the world. The highest elevation is 4.6 metres (15 ft) above sea level on Niulakita. Due to the lack of land above sea level, Tuvalu is often referred to as the first country that will be totally submerged, due to climate change. Over four decades, there had been a net increase in land area of the islets of 73.5 ha (2.9%), although the changes are not uniform, with 74% increasing and 27% decreasing in size. The sea level at the Funafuti tide gauge has risen at 3.9 mm per year, which is approximately twice the global average.[102] A 2018 report stated that the rising sea levels are identified as creating an increased transfer of wave energy across reef surfaces, which shifts sand, resulting in accretion to island shorelines.[101] The Tuvalu Prime Minister objected to the report's implication that there were \"alternate\" strategies for Islanders to adapt to rising sea levels, and criticised it for neglecting issues such as saltwater intrusion into groundwater tables as a result of sea level rise.[103]\n\n\nFunafuti is the largest atoll, and comprises numerous islets around a central lagoon that is approximately 25.1 kilometres (15.6 miles) (N–S) by 18.4 kilometres (11.4 miles) (W-E), centred on 179°7'E and 8°30'S. On the atolls, an annular reef rim surrounds the lagoon with seven natural reef channels.[104] Surveys were carried out in May 2010 of the reef habitats of Nanumea, Nukulaelae and Funafuti; a total of 317 fish species were recorded during this *Tuvalu Marine Life* study. The surveys identified 66 species that had not previously been recorded in Tuvalu, which brings the total number of identified species to 607.[105][106] Tuvalu's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) covers an oceanic area of approximately 900,000 km2.[107]\n\n\nTuvalu signed the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1992, and ratified it in December 2002.[108][109] The predominant vegetation type on the islands of Tuvalu is the cultivated coconut woodland, which covers 43% of the land. The native broadleaf forest is limited to 4.1% of the vegetation types.[110] Tuvalu contains the Western Polynesian tropical moist forests terrestrial ecoregion.[111]\n\n\n\n### Environmental pressures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A wharf and beach at Funafuti atoll\nThe eastern shoreline of Funafuti Lagoon on Fongafale was modified during World War II when the airfield (now Funafuti International Airport) was constructed. The coral base of the atoll was used as fill to create the runway. The resulting borrow pits impacted the fresh-water aquifer. In the low-lying areas of Funafuti, the sea water can be seen bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools with each high tide.[112][113] In 2014, the Tuvalu Borrow Pits Remediation (BPR) project was approved so that 10 borrow pits would be filled with sand from the lagoon, leaving Tafua Pond, which is a natural pond. The New Zealand Government funded the BPR project.[114] The project was carried out in 2015, with 365,000 sqm of sand being dredged from the lagoon to fill the holes and improve living conditions on the island. This project increased the usable land space on Fongafale by eight per cent.[115]\n\n\nDuring World War II, several piers were also constructed on Fongafale in the Funafuti Lagoon; beach areas were filled and deep-water access channels were excavated. These alterations to the reef and shoreline resulted in changes to wave patterns, with less sand accumulating to form the beaches, compared to former times; the shoreline is now exposed to wave action. Several attempts to stabilise the shoreline have not achieved the desired effect.[116]\n\n\nThe reefs at Funafuti suffered damage during the El Niño events that occurred between 1998 and 2001, with an average of 70% of the Staghorn (*Acropora spp.*) corals becoming bleached as a consequence of the increase in ocean temperatures.[117][118][119] A reef restoration project has investigated reef restoration techniques;[120] and researchers from Japan have investigated rebuilding the coral reefs through the introduction of foraminifera.[121] The project of the Japan International Cooperation Agency is designed to increase the resilience of the Tuvalu coast against sea level rise, through ecosystem rehabilitation and regeneration and through support for sand production.[122]\n\n\nThe rising population has resulted in an increased demand on fish stocks, which are under stress,[118] although the creation of the Funafuti Conservation Area has provided a fishing exclusion area to help sustain the fish population across the Funafuti lagoon.[123] Population pressure on the resources of Funafuti, and inadequate sanitation systems, have resulted in pollution.[124][125] The Waste Operations and Services Act of 2009 provides the legal framework for waste management and pollution control projects funded by the European Union directed at organic waste composting in eco-sanitation systems.[126] The Environment Protection (Litter and Waste Control) Regulation 2013 is intended to improve the management of the importation of non-biodegradable materials. Plastic waste is a problem in Tuvalu, for much imported food and other commodities are supplied in plastic containers or packaging.\n\n\nIn 2023 the governments of Tuvalu and other islands vulnerable to climate change (Fiji, Niue, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu) launched the \"Port Vila Call for a Just Transition to a Fossil Fuel Free Pacific\", calling for the phase out fossil fuels and the 'rapid and just transition' to renewable energy and strengthening environmental law including introducing the crime of ecocide.[127][128][129]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2011 Tuvalu drought\n\n![](image)Tuvalu Meteorological Service, Fongafale, Funafuti atoll\nTuvalu experiences two distinct seasons, a wet season from November to April and a dry season from May to October.[130] Westerly gales and heavy rain are the predominant weather conditions from October to March, the period that is known as *Tau-o-lalo*, with tropical temperatures moderated by easterly winds from April to November.\n\n\nTuvalu experiences the effects of El Niño and La Niña, which is caused by changes in ocean temperatures in the equatorial and central Pacific. El Niño effects increase the chances of tropical storms and cyclones, while La Niña effects increase the chances of drought. Typically the islands of Tuvalu receive between 200 and 400 mm (8 and 16 in) of rainfall per month. The central Pacific Ocean experiences changes from periods of La Niña to periods of El Niño.[131]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Funafuti (Köppen Af)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 33.8(92.8)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.9(87.6)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 31.2(88.2)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.9(78.6)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 413.7(16.29)\n | 360.6(14.20)\n | 324.3(12.77)\n | 255.8(10.07)\n | 259.8(10.23)\n | 216.6(8.53)\n | 253.1(9.96)\n | 275.9(10.86)\n | 217.5(8.56)\n | 266.5(10.49)\n | 275.9(10.86)\n | 393.9(15.51)\n | 3,512.6(138.29)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 20\n | 19\n | 20\n | 19\n | 18\n | 19\n | 19\n | 18\n | 16\n | 18\n | 17\n | 19\n | 223\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 82\n | 82\n | 82\n | 82\n | 82\n | 82\n | 83\n | 82\n | 81\n | 81\n | 80\n | 81\n | 82\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 179.8\n | 161.0\n | 186.0\n | 201.0\n | 195.3\n | 201.0\n | 195.3\n | 220.1\n | 210.0\n | 232.5\n | 189.0\n | 176.7\n | 2,347.7\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 5.8\n | 5.7\n | 6.0\n | 6.7\n | 6.3\n | 6.7\n | 6.3\n | 7.1\n | 7.0\n | 7.5\n | 6.3\n | 5.7\n | 6.4\n |\n| Source: Deutscher Wetterdienst[132] |\n\n### Impact of climate change[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate change in Tuvalu\n\nAs low-lying islands lacking a surrounding shallow shelf, the communities of Tuvalu are especially susceptible to changes in sea level and undissipated storms.[133][134][135] At its highest, Tuvalu is only 4.6 metres (15 ft) above sea level. Tuvaluan leaders have been concerned about the effects of rising sea levels.[136] It is estimated that a sea level rise of 20–40 centimetres (8–16 inches) in the next 100 years could make Tuvalu uninhabitable.[137][138] A study published in 2018 estimated the change in land area of Tuvalu's nine atolls and 101 reef islands between 1971 and 2014, indicating that 75% of the islands had grown in area, with an overall increase of more than 2%.[139] Enele Sopoaga, the Prime Minister of Tuvalu at the time, responded to the research by stating that Tuvalu is not expanding and has gained no additional habitable land.[140][141] Sopoaga has also said that evacuating the islands is the last resort.[142]\n\n\nWhether there are measurable changes in the sea level relative to the islands of Tuvalu is a contentious issue.[143][144] There were problems associated with the pre-1993 sea level records from Funafuti which resulted in improvements in the recording technology to provide more reliable data for analysis.[138] The degree of uncertainty as to estimates of sea level change relative to the islands of Tuvalu was reflected in the conclusions made in 2002 from the available data.[138] The uncertainty as to the accuracy of the data from this tide gauge resulted in a modern Aquatrak acoustic gauge being installed in 1993 by the Australian National Tidal Facility (NTF) as part of the AusAID-sponsored South Pacific Sea Level and Climate Monitoring Project.[145] The 2011 report of the *Pacific Climate Change Science Program* published by the Australian Government,[146] concludes: \"The sea-level rise near Tuvalu measured by satellite altimeters since 1993 is about 5 mm (0.2 in) per year.\"[147]\n\n\nTuvalu has adopted a national plan of action as the observable transformations over the last ten to fifteen years show Tuvaluans that there have been changes to the sea levels.[148] These include sea water bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools at high tide and the flooding of low-lying areas including the airport during spring tides and king tides.[112][113][149][150][151]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Simon Kofe, Minister for Justice, Communication & Foreign Affairs, proclaimed that in response to rising sea levels and the perceived failures by the outside world to combat global warming, the country would be uploading a virtual version of itself to the metaverse in an effort to preserve its history and culture.[152]\n\n\nThe major concerns about climate change has led to the launching and development of the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA). These adaptation measures are needed to decrease the amount and volume of the negative effects from climate change. NAPA has selected seven adaptation projects with all different themes. These are: coastal, agricultural, water, health, fisheries (two different projects) and disaster. For example, a 'target' of one of these projects, like the project 'coastal', is 'increasing resilience of coastal areas and settlement to climate change'. And for the project 'water' it is 'adaptation to frequent water shortages through increasing household water capacity, water collection accessories, and water conservation techniques'.[153]\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project (TCAP) was launched in 2017 for the purpose on enhancing the resilience of the islands of Tuvalu to meet the challenges resulting from higher sea levels.[154] Tuvalu was the first country in the Pacific to access climate finance from Green Climate Fund, with the support of the UNDP.[154] In December 2022, work on the Funafuti reclamation project commenced. The project is to dredge sand from the lagoon to construct a platform on Funafuti that is 780 metres (2,560 ft) meters long and 100 metres (330 ft) meters wide, giving a total area of approximately 7.8 ha. (19.27 acres), which is designed to remain above sea level rise and the reach of storm waves beyond the year 2100.[154] The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) also provided funding for the TCAP. Further projects that are part of TCAP are capital works on the outer islands of Nanumea and Nanumaga aimed at reducing exposure to coastal damage resulting from storms.[154]\n\n\n\n### Cyclones and king tides[edit]\n\n\n#### Cyclones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ocean side of Funafuti atoll showing the storm dunes, the highest point on the atoll.\nBecause of the low elevation, the islands that make up this nation are vulnerable to the effects of tropical cyclones and by the threat of current and future sea level rise.[124][155][156] A warning system, which uses the Iridium satellite network, was introduced in 2016 to allow outlying islands to be better prepared for natural disasters.[157]\n\n\nThe highest elevation is 4.6 metres (15 ft) above sea level on Niulakita.[158] Tuvalu thus has the second-lowest maximum elevation of any country (after the Maldives). The highest elevations are typically in narrow storm dunes on the ocean side of the islands which are prone to overtopping in tropical cyclones, as occurred with Cyclone Bebe, which was a very early-season storm that passed through the Tuvaluan atolls in October 1972.[159] Cyclone Bebe submerged Funafuti, eliminating 90% of structures on the island. Sources of drinking water were contaminated as a result of the system's storm surge and the flooding of the sources of fresh water.[160]\n\n\nGeorge Westbrook, a trader on Funafuti, recorded a cyclone that struck Funafuti on 23–24 December 1883.[161] A cyclone struck Nukulaelae on 17–18 March 1886.[161]\nA cyclone caused severe damage to the islands in 1894.[162]\n\n\nTuvalu experienced an average of three cyclones per decade between the 1940s and 1970s; however, eight occurred in the 1980s.[163] The impact of individual cyclones is subject to variables including the force of the winds and also whether a cyclone coincides with high tides. Funafuti's Tepuka Vili Vili islet was devastated by Cyclone Meli in 1979, with all its vegetation and most of its sand swept away during the cyclone. Along with a tropical depression that affected the islands a few days later, Severe Tropical Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Tuvalu with most islands reporting damage to vegetation and crops.[164][165] Cyclone Gavin was first identified during 2 March 1997, and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996–97 cyclone season, with Cyclones Hina and Keli following later in the season.\n\n\nIn March 2015, the winds and storm surge created by Cyclone Pam resulted in waves of 3 metres (9.8 ft) to 5 metres (16 ft) breaking over the reef of the outer islands, causing damage to houses, crops and infrastructure.[166][167] A state of emergency was declared. On Nui, the sources of fresh water were destroyed or contaminated.[168][169][170] The flooding in Nui and Nukufetau caused many families to shelter in evacuation centres or with other families.[171] Nui suffered the most damage of the three central islands (Nui, Nukufetau and Vaitupu);[172] with both Nui and Nukufetau suffering the loss of 90% of the crops.[173] Of the three northern islands (Nanumanga, Niutao and Nanumea), Nanumanga suffered the most damage, with from 60 to 100 houses flooded, with the waves also causing damage to the health facility.[173] Vasafua islet, part of the Funafuti Conservation Area, was severely damaged by Cyclone Pam. The coconut palms were washed away, leaving the islet as a sand bar.[174][175]\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Government carried out assessments of the damage caused by Cyclone Pam to the islands and has provided medical aid, food as well as assistance for the cleaning-up of storm debris. Government and Non-Government Organisations provided assistance technical, funding and material support to Tuvalu to assist with recovery, including WHO, UNICEF EAPRO, UNDP Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme, OCHA, World Bank, DFAT, New Zealand Red Cross & IFRC, Fiji National University and governments of New Zealand, Netherlands, UAE, Taiwan and the United States.[176]\n\n\nDespite passing over 500 km (310 mi) to the south of the island nation, Cyclone Tino and its associated convergence zone impacted the whole of Tuvalu between January 16 - 19 of 2020.[177][178]\n\n\n\n#### King tides[edit]\n\n\nTuvalu is also affected by perigean spring tide events which raise the sea level higher than a normal high tide.[179] The highest peak tide recorded by the Tuvalu Meteorological Service is 3.4 metres (11 ft), on 24 February 2006 and again on 19 February 2015.[180] As a result of the historical sea level rise, the king tide events lead to flooding of low-lying areas, which is compounded when sea levels are further raised by La Niña effects or local storms and waves.[181]\n\n\n\n### Water and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nRainwater harvesting is the principal source of fresh water in Tuvalu. Nukufetau, Vaitupu and Nanumea are the only islands with sustainable groundwater supplies. The effectiveness of rainwater harvesting is diminished because of poor maintenance of roofs, gutters and pipes.[182][183] Aid programmes of Australia and the European Union have been directed to improving the storage capacity on Funafuti and in the outer islands.[184]\n\n\nReverse osmosis (R/O) desalination units supplement rainwater harvesting on Funafuti. The 65 m3 desalination plant operates at a real production level of around 40 m3 per day. R/O water is only intended to be produced when storage falls below 30%, however demand to replenish household storage supplies with tanker-delivered water means that the R/O desalination units are continually operating. Water is delivered at a cost of A$3.50 per m3. Cost of production and delivery has been estimated at A$6 per m3, with the difference subsidised by the government.[182]\n\n\nIn July 2012, a United Nations Special Rapporteur called on the Tuvalu Government to develop a national water strategy to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation.[185][186] In 2012, Tuvalu developed a National Water Resources Policy under the Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) Project and the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC) Project, which are sponsored by the Global Environment Fund/SOPAC. Government water planning has established a target of between 50 and 100L of water per person per day accounting for drinking water, cleaning, community and cultural activities.[182]\n\n\nTuvalu is working with the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) to implement composting toilets and to improve the treatment of sewage sludge from septic tanks on Fongafale, for septic tanks are leaking into the freshwater lens in the sub-surface of the atoll as well as the ocean and lagoon. Composting toilets reduce water use by up to 30%.[182]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Tuvalu\n\n![](image)Government office building\n### Parliamentary democracy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human rights in Tuvalu\n\nThe *Constitution of Tuvalu* states that it is \"the supreme law of Tuvalu\" and that \"all other laws shall be interpreted and applied subject to this Constitution\"; it sets out the Principles of the Bill of Rights and the Protection of the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms.[187]\n\n\nTuvalu is a parliamentary democracy and Commonwealth realm with Charles III as King of Tuvalu. Since the King resides in the United Kingdom, he is represented in Tuvalu by a Governor General, whom he appoints upon the advice of the Prime Minister of Tuvalu.[93] Referendums were carried out in 1986 and 2008 seeking to abolish the monarchy and establish Tuvalu as a republic, but in both occasions the monarchy was chosen by the electorate.\n\n\nFrom 1974 (the creation of the British colony of Tuvalu) until independence, the legislative body of Tuvalu was called the *House of the Assembly* or *Fale I Fono*. Following independence in October 1978, the House of the Assembly was renamed the Parliament of Tuvalu or *Palamene o Tuvalu*.[93] The place at which the parliament sits is called the *Vaiaku maneapa*.[188] The *maneapa* on each island is an open meeting place where the chiefs and elders deliberate and make decisions.[188]\n\n\nThe unicameral Parliament has 16 members, with elections held every four years. The members of parliament select the Prime Minister (who is the head of government) and the Speaker of Parliament. The ministers that form the Cabinet are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister. There are no formal political parties; election campaigns are largely based on personal/family ties and reputations.\n\n\nThe Tuvalu National Library and Archives holds \"vital documentation on the cultural, social and political heritage of Tuvalu\", including surviving records from the colonial administration, as well as Tuvalu government archives.[189]\n\n\nTuvalu is a state party to the following human rights treaties: the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC); the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and; the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).[190] Tuvalu has commitments to ensuring human rights are respected under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n\nThe national strategy plan *Te Kete - National Strategy for Sustainable Development 2021-2030* sets out the development agenda of the Government of Tuvalu,[191][192] which followed on from *Te Kakeega III – National Strategy for Sustainable Development-2016-2020* (TK III). The areas of development in these strategic plans include education; climate change; environment; migration and urbanisation.[191][193]\n\n\nThe Tuvalu National Council for Women acts as an umbrella organisation for non-governmental women's rights groups throughout the country and works closely with the government.[194]\n\n\n\n### Legal system[edit]\n\n\nThere are eight Island Courts and Lands Courts; appeals in relation to land disputes are made to the Lands Courts Appeal Panel. Appeals from the Island Courts and the Lands Courts Appeal Panel are made to the Magistrates Court, which has jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving up to $T10,000. The superior court is the High Court of Tuvalu as it has unlimited original jurisdiction to determine the Law of Tuvalu and to hear appeals from the lower courts. Rulings of the High Court can be appealed to the Court of Appeal of Tuvalu. From the Court of Appeal, there is a right of appeal to His Majesty in Council, i.e., the Privy Council in London.[195][196]\n\n\nWith regard to the judiciary, \"the first female Island Court magistrate was appointed to the Island Court in Nanumea in the 1980s and another in Nukulaelae in the early 1990s.\" There were 7 female magistrates in the Island Courts of Tuvalu (as of 2007) in comparison \"to the past where only one woman magistrate served in the Magistrate Court of Tuvalu.\"[197]\n\n\nThe Law of Tuvalu comprises the Acts voted into law by the Parliament of Tuvalu and statutory instruments that become law; certain Acts passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (during the time Tuvalu was either a British protectorate or British colony); the common law; and customary law (particularly in relation to the ownership of land).[195][196] The land tenure system is largely based on *kaitasi* (extended family ownership).[198]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Tuvalu\n\n![](image)Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen visits Governor-General of Tuvalu Iakoba Italeli in November 2017\nTuvalu participates in the work of the Pacific Community (SPC) and is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations. It has maintained a mission at the United Nations in New York City since 2000. Tuvalu became a member of the Asian Development Bank in 1993,[199] and became a member of the World Bank in 2010.[200]\n\n\nTuvalu maintains close relations with Fiji, New Zealand, Australia (which has maintained a High Commission in Tuvalu since 2018),[201] Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the European Union. It has diplomatic relations with Taiwan;[202][203][204] which maintains an embassy in Tuvalu and has a large assistance programme in the islands.[205][206]\n\n\nA major international priority for Tuvalu in the UN, at the 2002 Earth Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa and in other international fora, is promoting concern about global warming and the possible sea level rising. Tuvalu advocates ratification and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. In December 2009, the islands stalled talks on climate change at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, fearing some other developing countries were not committing fully to binding deals on a reduction in carbon emissions. Their chief negotiator stated, \"Tuvalu is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change and our future rests on the outcome of this meeting.\"[207]\n\n\nTuvalu participates in the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which is a coalition of small island and low-lying coastal countries that have concerns about their vulnerability to the adverse effects of global climate change. Under the Majuro Declaration, which was signed on 5 September 2013, Tuvalu has made a commitment to implement power generation of 100% renewable energy (between 2013 and 2020), which is proposed to be implemented using Solar PV (95% of demand) and biodiesel (5% of demand). The feasibility of wind power generation will be considered.[208] Tuvalu participates in the operations of the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP).[209]\n\n\nTuvalu is party to a treaty of friendship with the United States, signed soon after independence and ratified by the US Senate in 1983, under which the United States renounced prior territorial claims to four Tuvaluan islands (Funafuti, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae and Niulakita) under the Guano Islands Act of 1856.[210]\n\n\nTuvalu participates in the operations of the Pacific Island Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA)[211] and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC).[212] The Tuvaluan government, the US government, and the governments of other Pacific islands are parties to the South Pacific Tuna Treaty (SPTT), which entered into force in 1988.[213] Tuvalu is also a member of the Nauru Agreement which addresses the management of tuna purse seine fishing in the tropical western Pacific. The United States and the Pacific Islands countries have negotiated the Multilateral Fisheries Treaty (which encompasses the South Pacific Tuna Treaty) to confirm access to the fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific for US tuna boats. Tuvalu and the other members of the Pacific Island Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and the United States have settled a tuna fishing deal for 2015; a longer-term deal will be negotiated. The treaty is an extension of the Nauru Agreement and provides for the US flagged purse seine vessels to fish 8,300 days in the region in return for a payment of US$90 million made up by tuna fishing industry and US-Government contributions.[214] In 2015, Tuvalu refused to sell fishing days to certain nations and fleets that have blocked Tuvaluan initiatives to develop and sustain their own fishery.[215] In 2016, the Minister of Natural Resources drew attention to Article 30 of the WCPF Convention, which describes the collective obligation of members to consider the disproportionate burden that management measures might place on small-island developing states.[216]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Tuvalu signed the memorandum of understanding (MOU) to establish the Pacific Regional Trade and Development Facility, which Facility originated in 2006, in the context of negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between Pacific ACP States and the European Union. The rationale for the creation of the Facility being to improve the delivery of aid to Pacific island countries in support of the Aid-for-Trade (AfT) requirements. The Pacific ACP States are the countries in the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement with the European Union.[217] On 31 May 2017 the first enhanced High Level Political Dialogue between Tuvalu and the European Union under the Cotonou Agreement was held in Funafuti.[218]\n\n\nOn 18 February 2016, Tuvalu signed the Pacific Islands Development Forum Charter and formally joined the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF).[219] In June 2017, Tuvalu signed the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER).[220][221] Tuvalu ratified the PACER agreement in January 2022. The agreement is designed to reduce trade barriers between signatories of the agreement. Existing import tariffs will reduce to zero, and the agreement contemplates additional actions to reduce trade barriers, including harmonizing customs procedures and rules of origin, as well as eliminating restrictions to services trade, and improving labour mobility schemes between countries.[222]\n\n\n\n### Defence and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law enforcement in Tuvalu\n\nTuvalu has no regular military forces, and spends no money on the military. Its national police force, the Tuvalu Police Force headquartered in Funafuti, includes a maritime surveillance unit, customs, prisons and immigration. Police officers wear British-style uniforms.\n\n\nFrom 1994 to 2019 the Tuvalu policed its 200-kilometre exclusive economic zone with the Pacific-class patrol boat HMTSS *Te Mataili*, provided by Australia.[223] In 2019, Australia gifted a Guardian-class patrol boat as replacement.[224] Named HMTSS *Te Mataili II*, it is meant for use in maritime surveillance, fishery patrol and for search-and-rescue missions.[225] (\"HMTSS\" stands for *His/Her Majesty's Tuvaluan State Ship* or for *His/Her Majesty's Tuvalu Surveillance Ship*.)\n\n\nMale homosexuality is illegal in Tuvalu.[226] Crime in Tuvalu is not a significant social problem due to an effective criminal justice system, also due to the influence of the *Falekaupule* (the traditional assembly of elders of each island) and the central role of religious institutions in the Tuvaluan community.\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Islands of Tuvalu\n\nTuvalu consists of six atolls and three reef islands. The smallest, Niulakita, is administered as part of Niutao.\n\n\nEach island has its own high-chief, or ulu-aliki, and several sub-chiefs (alikis). The community council is the *Falekaupule* (the traditional assembly of elders) or *te sina o fenua* (literally: \"grey-hairs of the land\"). In the past, another caste, the priests (tofuga), were also amongst the decision-makers. The ulu-aliki and aliki exercise informal authority at the local level. Ulu-aliki are always chosen based on ancestry. Under the Falekaupule Act (1997),[227] the powers and functions of the *Falekaupule* are now shared with the *pule o kaupule* (elected village presidents; one on each atoll).[228]\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of Tuvalu.\nLocal government districts consisting of more than one islet:\n\n\n\n* Funafuti\n* Nanumea\n* Nui\n* Nukufetau\n* Nukulaelae\n* Vaitupu\n\n\nLocal government districts consisting of only one island:\n\n\n\n* Nanumanga\n* Niulakita\n* Niutao\n\n\nTuvalu has ISO 3166-2 codes defined for one town council (Funafuti) and seven island councils. Niulakita, which now has its own island council, is not listed, as it is administered as part of Niutao.\n\n\n\n## Society[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Tuvalu\n\nSee also: Women in Tuvalu\n\n![](image)Population distribution of Tuvalu by age group (2014).\nThe population at the 2002 census was 9,561,[229] and the population at the 2017 census was 10,645.[230][231] The most recent evaluation in 2020 puts the population at 11,342.[232] The population of Tuvalu is primarily of Polynesian ethnicity, with approximately 5.6% of the population being Micronesians speaking Gilbertese, especially on Nui.[230]\n\n\nLife expectancy for women in Tuvalu is 70.2 years and 65.6 years for men (2018 est.).[233] The country's population growth rate is 0.86% (2018 est.).[233] The net migration rate is estimated at −6.6 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.).[233] The threat of global warming in Tuvalu is not yet a dominant motivation for migration as Tuvaluans appear to prefer to continue living on the islands for reasons of lifestyle, culture and identity.[234]\n\n\nFrom 1947 to 1983, a number of Tuvaluans from Vaitupu migrated to Kioa, an island in Fiji.[235] The settlers from Tuvalu were granted Fijian citizenship in 2005. In recent years, New Zealand and Australia have been the primary destinations for migration or seasonal work.\n\n\nIn 2014, attention was drawn to an appeal to the New Zealand Immigration and Protection Tribunal against the deportation of a Tuvaluan family on the basis that they were \"climate change refugees\", who would suffer hardship resulting from the environmental degradation of Tuvalu.[236] However, the subsequent grant of residence permits to the family was made on grounds unrelated to the refugee claim.[237] The family was successful in their appeal because, under the relevant immigration legislation, there were \"exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature\" that justified the grant of resident permits, for the family was integrated into New Zealand society with a sizeable extended family that had effectively relocated to New Zealand.[237] Indeed, in 2013 a claim of a Kiribati man of being a \"climate change refugee\" under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) was determined by the New Zealand High Court to be untenable, for there was no persecution or serious harm related to any of the five stipulated Refugee Convention grounds.[238] Permanent migration to Australia and New Zealand, such as for family reunification, requires compliance with the immigration legislation of those countries.[239]\n\n\nOn 10 November 2023, Tuvalu signed the Falepili Union, a bilateral diplomatic relationship with Australia, under which Australia will provide a pathway for citizens of Tuvalu to migrate to Australia, to enable  climate-related mobility for Tuvaluans.[240][241]\n\n\nNew Zealand has an annual quota of 75 Tuvaluans granted work permits under the *Pacific Access Category*, as announced in 2001.[242] The applicants register for the Pacific Access Category (PAC) ballots; the primary criterion is that the principal applicant must have a job offer from a New Zealand employer.[243] Tuvaluans also have access to seasonal employment in the horticulture and viticulture industries in New Zealand under the *Recognised Seasonal Employer* (RSE) Work Policy introduced in 2007 allowing for employment of up to 5,000 workers from Tuvalu and other Pacific islands.[244] Tuvaluans can participate in the Australian *Pacific Seasonal Worker Program*, which allows Pacific Islanders to obtain seasonal employment in the Australian agriculture industry, in particular, cotton and cane operations; fishing industry, in particular aquaculture; and with accommodation providers in the tourism industry.[245]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tuvaluan language\n\nThe Tuvaluan language and English are the national languages of Tuvalu. Tuvaluan is of the Ellicean group of Polynesian languages, distantly related to all other Polynesian languages such as Hawaiian, Māori, Tahitian, Rapa Nui, Samoan and Tongan.[246] It is most closely related to the languages spoken on the Polynesian outliers in Micronesia and northern and central Melanesia. The Tuvaluan language has borrowed from the Samoan language, as a consequence of Christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries being predominantly Samoan.[43][246]\n\n\nThe Tuvaluan language is spoken by virtually everyone, while a Micronesian language very similar to Gilbertese is spoken on Nui.[246][247] English is also an official language but is not spoken in daily use. Parliament and official functions are conducted in the Tuvaluan language.\n\n\nThere are about 13,000 Tuvaluan speakers worldwide.[248][249] Radio Tuvalu transmits Tuvaluan-language programming.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Tuvalu\n\n![](image)Fetu Ao Lima (Morning Star Church), Congregational Christian Church of Tuvalu\nThe Congregational Christian Church of Tuvalu, which is part of the Calvinist tradition, is the state church of Tuvalu;[250] although in practice this merely entitles it to \"the privilege of performing special services on major national events\".[251] Its adherents comprise about 97% of the 10,837 (2012 census) inhabitants of the archipelago.[250][252] The Constitution of Tuvalu guarantees freedom of religion, including the freedom to practice, the freedom to change religion, the right not to receive religious instruction at school or to attend religious ceremonies at school, and the right not to \"take an oath or make an affirmation that is contrary to his religion or belief\".[253]\n\n\nOther Christian groups include the Catholic community served by the Mission Sui Iuris of Funafuti, and the Seventh-day Adventist which has 2.8% of the population.[233] According to its own estimates, the Tuvalu Brethren Church has about 500 members (i.e. 4.5% of the population).[254]\n\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith is the largest minority religion and the largest non-Christian religion in Tuvalu. It constitutes 2.0% of the population.[233] The Baháʼís are present on Nanumea,[255] and Funafuti.[256] The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community consists of about 50 members (0.4% of the population).[257]\n\n\nThe introduction of Christianity ended the worship of ancestral spirits and other deities (animism),[258] along with the power of the *vaka-atua* (the priests of the old religions).[259] Laumua Kofe describes the objects of worship as varying from island to island, although ancestor worship was described by Rev. D. J. Whitmee in 1870 as being common practice.[260]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Tuvalu\n\nThe Princess Margaret Hospital on Funafuti is the only hospital in Tuvalu and the primary provider of medical services.\n\n\nSince the late 20th century, the biggest health problems in Tuvalu are obesity-related. The leading cause of death has been heart disease,[261] which is closely followed by diabetes[262] and high blood pressure.[261] In 2016 the majority of deaths resulted from cardiac diseases, with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and cerebral-vascular disease among the other causes of death.[263]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Children on Niutao\nEducation in Tuvalu is free and compulsory between the ages of 6 and 15 years. Each island has a primary school. Motufoua Secondary School is located on Vaitupu.[264] Students board at the school during the school term, returning to their home islands each school vacation. Fetuvalu Secondary School, a day school operated by the Church of Tuvalu, is on Funafuti.[265]\n\n\nFetuvalu offers the Cambridge syllabus. Motufoua offers the Fiji Junior Certificate (FJC) at year 10, Tuvaluan Certificate at Year 11 and the Pacific Senior Secondary Certificate (PSSC) at Year 12, which is set by SPBEA, the Fiji-based exam board.[266] Sixth form students who pass their PSSC go on to the Augmented Foundation Programme, funded by the Tuvalu government. This program is required for tertiary education programmes outside of Tuvalu and is available at the University of the South Pacific (USP) Extension Centre in Funafuti.[267]\n\n\nRequired attendance at school is 10 years for males and 11 years for females (2001).[233] The adult literacy rate is 99.0% (2002).[268] In 2010, there were 1,918 students who were taught by 109 teachers (98 certified and 11 uncertified). The teacher-pupil ratio for primary schools in Tuvalu is around 1:18 for all schools with the exception of Nauti School, which has a ratio of 1:27. Nauti School on Funafuti is the largest primary school in Tuvalu with more than 900 students (45 per cent of the total primary school enrolment). The pupil-teacher ratio for Tuvalu is low compared to the entire Pacific region (ratio of 1:29).[269]\n\n\nCommunity Training Centres (CTCs) have been established within the primary schools on each atoll. They provide vocational training to students who do not progress beyond Class 8 because they failed the entry qualifications for secondary education. The CTCs offer training in basic carpentry, gardening and farming, sewing and cooking. At the end of their studies the graduates can apply to continue studies either at Motufoua Secondary School or the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI). Adults can also attend courses at the CTCs.[270]\n\n\nFour tertiary institutions offer technical and vocational courses: Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI), Tuvalu Atoll Science Technology Training Institute (TASTII), Australian Pacific Training Coalition (APTC) and University of the South Pacific (USP) Extension Centre.[271]\n\n\nThe Tuvaluan Employment Ordinance of 1966 sets the minimum age for paid employment at 14 years and prohibits children under the age of 15 from performing hazardous work.[272]\n\n\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI)[273] finds that Tuvalu is fulfilling only 88.0% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to education based on the country's level of income.[274] HRMI breaks down the right to education by looking at the rights to both primary education and secondary education. While taking into consideration Tuvalu's income level, the nation is achieving 97.7% of what should be possible based on its resources (income) for primary education but only 78.3% for secondary education.[274]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tuvaluan mythology\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nThe traditional buildings of Tuvalu used plants and trees from the native broadleaf forest,[275] including timber from *pouka* (*Hernandia peltata*); *ngia* or *ingia* bush (*Pemphis acidula*); *miro* (*Thespesia populnea*); *tonga* (*Rhizophora mucronata*); *fau* or *fo fafini*, or woman's fibre tree (*Hibiscus tiliaceus*).[275] Fibre is from coconut; *ferra*, native fig (*Ficus aspem*); *fala*, screw pine or *Pandanus*.[275] The buildings were constructed without nails and were lashed together with a plaited sennit rope that was handmade from dried coconut fibre.[276]\n\n\nFollowing contact with Europeans, iron products were used including nails and corrugated roofing material. Modern buildings in Tuvalu are constructed from imported building materials, including imported timber and concrete.[276]\n\n\n\n![](image)Interior of a maneapa on Funafuti, Tuvalu\nChurch and community buildings (*maneapa*) are usually coated with white paint that is known as *lase*, which is made by burning a large amount of dead coral with firewood. The whitish powder that is the result is mixed with water and painted on the buildings.[277]\n\n\n\n### Art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Art of Tuvalu\n\nThe women of Tuvalu use cowrie and other shells in traditional handicrafts.[278] The artistic traditions of Tuvalu have traditionally been expressed in the design of clothing and traditional handicrafts such as the decoration of mats and fans.[278] Crochet (*kolose*) is one of the art forms practised by Tuvaluan women.[279] The design of women's skirts (*titi*), tops (*teuga saka*), headbands, armbands, and wristbands, which continue to be used in performances of the traditional dance songs of Tuvalu, represents contemporary Tuvaluan art and design.[280] The material culture of Tuvalu uses traditional design elements in artefacts used in everyday life such as the design of canoes and fish hooks made from traditional materials.[281][282]\n\n\nIn 2015, an exhibition was held on Funafuti of the art of Tuvalu, with works that addressed climate change through the eyes of artists and the display of *Kope ote olaga* (possessions of life), a display of the various artefacts of Tuvalu culture.[283]\n\n\n\n### Dance and music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Tuvalu\n\n![](image)A Tuvaluan dancer at Auckland's Pasifika Festival\nThe traditional music of Tuvalu consists of a number of dances, including *fakaseasea*, *fakanau* and *fatele*.[284] The *fatele*, in its modern form, is performed at community events and to celebrate leaders and other prominent individuals, such as the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in September 2012.[285][286] The Tuvaluan style can be described \"as a musical microcosm of Polynesia, where contemporary and older styles co-exist\".[284]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Tuvalu\n\nThe cuisine of Tuvalu is based on the staple of coconut and the many species of fish found in the ocean and lagoons of the atolls. Desserts made on the islands include coconut and coconut milk, rather than animal milk. The traditional foods eaten in Tuvalu are pulaka, taro, bananas, breadfruit[287] and coconut.[288] Tuvaluans also eat seafood, including coconut crab and fish from the lagoon and ocean.[123] Another traditional food source is seabirds (*taketake* or black noddy and *akiaki* or white tern), with pork being eaten mostly at *fateles* (or parties with dancing to celebrate events).[228]\n\n\nPulaka is the main source for carbohydrates. Seafood provides protein. Bananas and breadfruit are supplemental crops. Coconut is used for its juice, to make other beverages (such as toddy) and to improve the taste of some dishes.[228]\n\n\nA 1560-square-metre pond was built in 1996 on Vaitupu to sustain aquaculture in Tuvalu.[289]\n\n\nFlying fish are also caught as a source of food;[290][291] and as an exciting activity, using a boat, a butterfly net and a spotlight to attract the flying fish.[228]\n\n\n\n### Heritage[edit]\n\n\nThe traditional community system still survives to a large extent on Tuvalu. Each family has its own task, or *salanga*, to perform for the community, such as fishing, house building or defence. The skills of a family are passed on from parents to children.\n\n\nMost islands have their own *fusi*, community-owned shops similar to convenience stores, where canned foods and bags of rice can be purchased. Goods are cheaper, and fusis give better prices for their own produce.[228]\n\n\nAnother important building is the *falekaupule* or *maneapa*, the traditional island meeting hall,[292] where important matters are discussed and which is also used for wedding celebrations and community activities such as a *fatele* involving music, singing and dancing.[228] *Falekaupule* is also used as the name of the council of elders – the traditional decision-making body on each island. Under the Falekaupule Act, *Falekaupule* means \"traditional assembly in each island ... composed in accordance with the Aganu of each island\". *Aganu* means traditional customs and culture.[292]\n\n\nTuvalu does not have any museums, however the creation of a Tuvalu National Cultural Centre and Museum is part of the government's strategic plan for 2018–24.[293][294]\n\n\n\n### Traditional single-outrigger canoe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Canoe carving on Nanumea\n*Paopao* (from the Samoan language, meaning a small fishing-canoe made from a single log), is the traditional single-outrigger canoe of Tuvalu, of which the largest could carry four to six adults. The variations of single-outrigger canoes that had been developed on Vaitupu and Nanumea were reef-type or paddled canoes; that is, they were designed for carrying over the reef and being paddled, rather than being sailed.[281] Outrigger canoes from Nui were constructed with an indirect type of outrigger attachment and the hull is double-ended, with no distinct bow and stern. These canoes were designed to be sailed over the Nui lagoon.[295] The booms of the outrigger are longer than those found in other designs of canoes from the other islands. This made the Nui canoe more stable when used with a sail than the other designs.[295]\n\n\n\n## Sport and leisure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Tuvalu\n\nSee also: Tuvaluan records in athletics, Tuvalu at the Pacific Games, Tuvalu at the Commonwealth Games, Tuvalu at the World Championships in Athletics, and Tuvalu at the Olympics\n\nA traditional sport played in Tuvalu is *kilikiti*,[296] which is similar to cricket.[297] A popular sport specific to Tuvalu is *Te ano* (The ball), which is played with two round balls of 12 cm (5 in) diameter.[228] *Te ano* is a traditional game that is similar to volleyball, in which the two hard balls made from pandanus leaves are volleyed at great speed with the team members trying to stop the ball hitting the ground.[298] Traditional sports in the late 19th century were foot racing, lance throwing, quarterstaff fencing and wrestling, although the Christian missionaries disapproved of these activities.[299]\n\n\nThe popular sports in Tuvalu include *kilikiti*, *Te ano*, association football, futsal, volleyball, handball, basketball and rugby sevens. Tuvalu has sports organisations for athletics, badminton, tennis, table tennis, volleyball, football, basketball, rugby union, weightlifting and powerlifting. At the 2013 Pacific Mini Games, Tuau Lapua Lapua won Tuvalu's first gold medal in an international competition in the weightlifting 62 kilogram male snatch. (He also won bronze in the clean and jerk, and obtained the silver medal overall for the combined event.)[300] In 2015, Telupe Iosefa received the first gold medal won by Tuvalu at the Pacific Games in the powerlifting 120 kg male division.[301][302][303]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tuvalu national football team (2011)\nFootball in Tuvalu is played at club and national team level. The Tuvalu national football team trains at the Tuvalu Sports Ground in Funafuti and competes in the Pacific Games. The Tuvalu National Football Association is an associate member of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) and is seeking membership in FIFA.[304][305] The Tuvalu national futsal team participates in the Oceanian Futsal Championship.\n\n\nA major sporting event is the \"Independence Day Sports Festival\" held annually on 1 October. The most important sports event within the country is arguably the Tuvalu Games, which are held yearly since 2008. Tuvalu first participated in the Pacific Games in 1978 and in the Commonwealth Games in 1998, when a weightlifter attended the games held at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.[306] Two table tennis players attended the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England;[306] Tuvalu entered competitors in shooting, table tennis and weightlifting at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia;[306] three athletes participated in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India, entering the discus, shot put and weightlifting events;[306] and a team of 3 weightlifters and 2 table tennis players attended the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Tuvaluan athletes have also participated in the men's and women's 100 metres sprint at the World Championships in Athletics from 2009.\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Association of Sports and National Olympic Committee (TASNOC) was recognised as a National Olympic Committee in July 2007. Tuvalu entered the Olympic Games for the first time at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, China, with a weightlifter and two athletes in the men's and women's 100 metres sprint. A team with athletes in the same events represented Tuvalu at the 2012 Summer Olympics.[307] Etimoni Timuani was the sole representative of Tuvalu at the 2016 Summer Olympics in the 100m event.[308] Karalo Maibuca and Matie Stanley represented Tuvalu at the 2020 Summer Olympics in the 100m events.[309][310] Tuvalu sent a team to the 2023 Pacific Games.\n\n\n\n## Economy and government services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Tuvalu\n\n### Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)National Bank of Tuvalu\nFrom 1996 to 2002, Tuvalu was one of the best-performing Pacific Island economies and achieved an average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 5.6% per annum. Economic growth slowed after 2002, with GDP growth of 1.5% in 2008. Tuvalu was exposed to rapid rises in world prices of fuel and food in 2008, with the level of inflation peaking at 13.4%.[268] Tuvalu has the smallest GDP of any sovereign nation in the world.[311]\n\n\nTuvalu joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 24 June 2010.[312] The IMP 2010 Report on Tuvalu estimates that Tuvalu experienced zero growth in its 2010 GDP, after the economy contracted by about 2% in 2009.[268] On 5 August 2012, the executive board of the IMF concluded the Article IV consultation with Tuvalu, and assessed the economy of Tuvalu: \"A slow recovery is underway in Tuvalu, but there are important risks. GDP grew in 2011 for the first time since the global financial crisis, led by the private retail sector and education spending.\"[313] The IMF 2014 Country Report noted that real GDP growth in Tuvalu had been volatile averaging only 1 per cent in the past decade. The 2014 Country Report describes economic growth prospects as generally positive as the result of large revenues from fishing licences, together with substantial foreign aid.[314] In 2023, the IMF Article IV consultation with Tuvalu concluded that a successful vaccination strategy allowed Tuvalu to lift coronavirus disease (COVID) containment measures at the end of 2022. However, the economic cost of the pandemic was significant, with real gross domestic product growth falling from 13.8% in 2019 to -4.3 percent in 2020, although it recovered to 1.8% in 2021.[315] Inflation rose to 11.5% in 2022, but inflation is project to fall to 2.8% by 2028.[315]\n\n\nThe increase in inflation in 2022 was due to the rapid rise in the cost of food resulting from a drought that affected food production and from rising global food prices, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (food imports represent 19 percent of Tuvalu’s GDP, while agriculture makes up for only 10 percent of GDP).[315]\n\n\nThe government is the primary provider of medical services through Princess Margaret Hospital on Funafuti, which operates health clinics on the other islands. Banking services are provided by the National Bank of Tuvalu. Public sector workers make up about 65% of those formally employed. Remittances from Tuvaluans living in Australia and New Zealand, and remittances from Tuvaluan sailors employed on overseas ships are important sources of income for Tuvaluans.[316] Approximately 15% of adult males work as seamen on foreign-flagged merchant ships. Agriculture in Tuvalu is focused on coconut trees and growing pulaka in large pits of composted soil below the water table. Tuvaluans are otherwise involved in traditional subsistence agriculture and fishing.\n\n\nTuvaluans are well known for their seafaring skills, with the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute on Amatuku motu (island), Funafuti, providing training to approximately 120 marine cadets each year so that they have the skills necessary for employment as seafarers on merchant shipping. The Tuvalu Overseas Seamen's Union (TOSU) is the only registered trade union in Tuvalu. It represents workers on foreign ships. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that 800 Tuvaluan men are trained, certified and active as seafarers. The ADB estimates that, at any one time, about 15% of the adult male population works abroad as seafarers.[317] Job opportunities also exist as observers on tuna boats where the role is to monitor compliance with the boat's tuna fishing licence.[318]\n\n\nGovernment revenues largely come from sales of fishing licences, income from the Tuvalu Trust Fund, and from the lease of its \".tv\" Internet Top Level Domain (TLD). Tuvalu began deriving revenue from the commercialisation of its \".tv\" Internet domain name,[319] which was managed by Verisign until 2021.[320][321] Tuvalu also generates income from postage stamps by the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau, and from the Tuvalu Ship Registry.\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) was established in 1987 by the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.[42] The TTF is a sovereign wealth fund that is owned by Tuvalu but is administered by an international Board and the government of Tuvalu. When the performance of the TTF exceeds its operating target each year, excess funds are transferred to the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF), and can be freely drawn upon by the Tuvaluan government to finance budgetary expenditures.[322] In 2022, the value of the Tuvalu Trust Fund is approximately $190 million.[322] In 2021 the market value of the TTF rose by 12 percent to its highest level on record (261 percent of GDP). However, the volatility in global equity markets in 2022 resulted in the TTF’s value falling by 7 percent as compared to the end of 2021.[322]\n\n\nFinancial support to Tuvalu is also provided by Japan, South Korea and the European Union. Australia and New Zealand continue to contribute capital to the TTF, and provide other forms of development assistance.[316][42]\n\n\nThe U.S. government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu. In 1999, the payment from the South Pacific Tuna Treaty (SPTT) was about $9 million, with the value increasing in the following years. In May 2013, representatives from the United States and the Pacific Islands countries agreed to sign interim arrangement documents to extend the Multilateral Fisheries Treaty (which encompasses the South Pacific Tuna Treaty) for 18 months.[323]\n\n\nThe United Nations designates Tuvalu as a least developed country (LDC) because of its limited potential for economic development, absence of exploitable resources and its small size and vulnerability to external economic and environmental shocks.[324] Tuvalu participates in the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries (EIF), which was established in October 1997 under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation.[325] In 2013, Tuvalu deferred its graduation from least developed country (LDC) status to a developing country to 2015. Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary to maintain access by Tuvalu to the funds provided by the United Nations's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), as \"Once Tuvalu graduates to a developed country, it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation programmes like NAPA, which only goes to LDCs\". Tuvalu had met targets so that Tuvalu was to graduate from LDC status. Prime minister Enele Sopoaga wants the United Nations to reconsider its criteria for graduation from LDC status as not enough weight is given to the environmental plight of small island states like Tuvalu in the application of the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI).[326]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Funafuti Conservation Area, Public holidays in Tuvalu, and Visa policy of Tuvalu\n\n![](image)Funafuti lagoon (*Te Namo*)\nDue to the country's remoteness, tourism is not significant. Visitors totalled 1,684 in 2010: 65% were on business, development officials or technical consultants, 20% were tourists (360 people), and 11% were expatriates returning to visit family.[182] In 2016, the number of visitors had increased to 2,000.[327]\n\n\nThe main island of Funafuti is the focus of travellers, since the only airport in Tuvalu is the Funafuti International Airport and Funafuti is the only island that has hotel facilities.[328] However, there are no tour guides, tour operators or organised activities and no cruise ships visit.[329] Ecotourism is a motivation of travellers to Tuvalu. The Funafuti Conservation Area consists of 12.74 square miles (33.00 square kilometres) of ocean, reef, lagoon, channel and six uninhabited islets.\n\n\nThe outer atolls can be visited on the two passenger-cargo ships, *Nivaga III* and *Manú Folau*, which provide round-trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks. There is guesthouse accommodation on many of the outer islands.\n\n\nFrom October 2023, Air Tuvalu commenced domestic flights between Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau.[330]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications and media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in Tuvalu\n\nSee also: List of newspapers in Tuvalu\n\nThe Tuvalu Media Department of the Government of Tuvalu operates *Radio Tuvalu* which broadcasts from Funafuti.[331] In 2011, the Japanese government provided financial support to construct a new AM broadcast studio. The installation of upgraded transmission equipment allows Radio Tuvalu to be heard on all nine islands of Tuvalu. The new AM radio transmitter on Funafuti replaced the FM radio service to the outer islands and freed up satellite bandwidth for mobile services.[182] *Fenui – news from Tuvalu* is a free digital publication of the Tuvalu Media Department that is emailed to subscribers and operates a Facebook page, which publishes news about government activities and news about Tuvaluan events.\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation (TTC), a state-owned enterprise, provides fixed line telephone communications to subscribers on each island, mobile phone services on Funafuti, Vaitupu and Nukulaelae and is a distributor of the Fiji Television service (Sky Pacific satellite television service).[182]\n\n\nCommunications in Tuvalu rely on satellite dishes for telephone and internet access. The available bandwidth is only 512 kbit/s uplink, and 1.5 Mbit/s downlink. Throughout Tuvalu are more than 900 subscribers who want to use the satellite service, with demand slowing down the speed of the system.[332]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Manu Folau* off Vaitupu atoll (2006)\nThere are limited transport services in Tuvalu. There are about eight kilometres (5 miles) of roads.[233] The streets of Funafuti were paved in mid-2002, but other roads are unpaved. Tuvalu does not have any railroads.\n\n\nFunafuti is the only port, but there is a deep-water berth in the lagoon at Nukufetau. The merchant marine fleet consists of two passenger/cargo ships *Nivaga III* and *Manu Folau*. The *Nivaga III* and *Manu Folau* provide round-trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks, and travel between Suva, Fiji and Funafuti three or four times a year. The *Manu Folau*, a 50-metre vessel, was a gift from Japan to the people of Tuvalu.\n\n\nIn 2015, the *Nivaga III* was donated by the government of Japan; it replaced the *Nivaga II*, which had been in service in Tuvalu from 1989.[333][334]\n\n\nIn 2020, the government of Tuvalu purchased a landing barge, which is intended to transport of dangerous goods and building material from the capital to the outer islands. The barge was named *Moeiteava*. The Government of Taiwan provided financial assistance.[335]\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Fisheries Department operates two vessels for carrying out its activities within the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and outer islands. These are the 18-metre *Manaui* and 32-metre *Tala Moana*. The vessels are used for fisheries research, deploying fish aggregating devices (FADs), visiting outer islands for monitoring and consultations, including to implement Tuvalu's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) to address climate change.[336] The *Manaui* was procured through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in 1989 and is nearing the end of its life.[337] In 2015, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) provided assistance to acquire *Tala Moana*;[338] which is also used for Monitoring Control and Surveillance (MCS) patrols.[339] *Tala Moana* is steel monohull oil rig supply vessel that is equipped with facilities for a team of about 15 people.[340]\n\n\nThe only international airport in Tuvalu is Funafuti International Airport. Fiji Airways, the owner of Fiji Airlines (trading as Fiji Link) operates services three times a week (Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday) between Suva (originating from Nadi) and Funafuti with ATR 72–600, a 68-seat plane. Air Kiribati service provides one flight a week to Funafuti from Tarawa on a Wednesday. The service uses a Bombardier Dash 8 100 series aircraft, which has the capacity to take up to 35 passengers.[341] The government owned Air Tuvalu commenced domestic flights between Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau from October 2023 using a 16 seat Twin Otter (T2-TV8).[330]\n\n\n\n## Filmography and bibliography[edit]\n\n\n### Filmography[edit]\n\n\nDocumentary films about Tuvalu:\n\n\n\n* *Tu Toko Tasi* (Stand by Yourself) (2000) Conrad Mill, a Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) production.[342]\n* *Paradise Domain – Tuvalu* (Director: Joost De Haas, Bullfrog Films/TVE 2001) 25:52 minutes – YouTube video.[112]\n* *Tuvalu island tales (A Tale of two Islands*) (Director: Michel Lippitsch) 34 minutes – YouTube video.\n* *The Disappearing of Tuvalu: Trouble in Paradise* (2004) by Christopher Horner and Gilliane Le Gallic.[343]\n* *Paradise Drowned: Tuvalu, the Disappearing Nation* (2004) Written and produced by Wayne Tourell.

Its islands are situated about midway between Hawaii and Australia. They lie east-northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands (which belong to the Solomon Islands), northeast of Vanuatu, southeast of Nauru, south of Kiribati, west of Tokelau, northwest of Samoa and Wallis and Futuna, and north of Fiji. Tuvalu is composed of three reef islands and six atolls. They are spread out between the latitude of 5° and 10° south and between the longitude of 176° and 180°. They lie west of the International Date Line.[8] The 2017 census determined that Tuvalu had a population of 10,645. The total land area of the islands of Tuvalu is 26 square kilometres (10 sq mi).\n\n\nThe first inhabitants of Tuvalu were Polynesians, according to well established theories regarding a migration of Polynesians into the Pacific that began about three thousand years ago.[9] Long before European contact with the Pacific islands, Polynesians frequently voyaged by canoe between the islands. Polynesian navigation skills enabled them to make elaborately planned journeys in either double-hulled sailing canoes or outrigger canoes.[10] Scholars believe that the Polynesians spread out from Samoa and Tonga into the Tuvaluan atolls, which then served as a stepping stone for further migration into the Polynesian outliers in Melanesia and Micronesia.[11][12][13]\n\n\nIn 1569, Spanish navigator and documentor Álvaro de Mendaña became the first European to sail through the archipelago, sighting the island of Nui during an expedition he was making in search of Terra Australis. The island of Funafuti was named Ellice's Island in 1819. Later, the whole group was named Ellice Islands by English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay. In the late 19th century, Great Britain claimed control over the Ellice Islands, designating them as within their sphere of influence.[14] Between 9 and 16 October 1892, Captain Gibson of HMS *Curacoa* declared each of the Ellice Islands to be a British protectorate. Britain assigned a resident commissioner to administer the Ellice Islands as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT). From 1916 to 1975, they were managed as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony.\n\n\nA referendum was held in 1974 to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration.[15] As a result of the referendum, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony legally ceased to exist on 1 October 1975, and on 1 January 1976, the old administration was officially separated,[16] and two separate British colonies, Kiribati and Tuvalu, were formed. On 1 October 1978, Tuvalu became fully independent as a sovereign state within the Commonwealth, and is a constitutional monarchy with King Charles III as King of Tuvalu. On 5 September 2000, Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations.\n\n\nThe islands do not have a significant amount of soil, so the country relies heavily on imports and fishing for food. Licensing fishing permits to international companies, grants and aid projects, and remittances to their families from Tuvaluan seafarers who work on cargo ships are important parts of the economy. Because it is a low-lying island nation, the country is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise due to climate change. It is active in international climate negotiations as part of the Alliance of Small Island States.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tuvalu\n\nSee also: Timeline of the history of Tuvalu and Outline of Tuvalu\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nThe origins of the people of Tuvalu are addressed in the theories regarding the migration into the Pacific that began about 3000 years ago. During pre-European-contact times, there was frequent canoe voyaging between the nearer islands including Samoa and Tonga.[17] Eight of the nine islands of Tuvalu were inhabited. This explains the origin of the name, Tuvalu, which means \"eight standing together\" in Tuvaluan (compare to *\\*walo* meaning \"eight\" in Proto-Austronesian). Possible evidence of human-made fires in the Caves of Nanumanga suggests humans may have occupied the islands for thousands of years.\n\n\nAn important creation myth in the islands of Tuvalu is the story of *te Pusi mo te Ali* (the Eel and the Flounder), who are said to have created the islands of Tuvalu. *Te Ali* (the flounder) is believed to be the origin of the flat atolls of Tuvalu and *te Pusi* (the eel) is the model for the coconut palms that are important in the lives of Tuvaluans. The stories of the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island. On Niutao,[18] Funafuti and Vaitupu, for instance, the founding ancestor is described as being from Samoa,[19][20] whereas on Nanumea, the founding ancestor is described as being from Tonga.[19]\n\n\n\n### Early contacts with other cultures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Tuvaluan man in traditional attire drawn by Alfred Agate in 1841, during the United States Exploring Expedition[21]\nTuvalu was first sighted by Europeans on 16 January 1568, during the voyage of Álvaro de Mendaña from Spain, who sailed past Nui and charted it as *Isla de Jesús* (Spanish for \"Island of Jesus\") because the previous day was the feast of the Holy Name. Mendaña made contact with the islanders but was unable to land.[22][23] During Mendaña's second voyage across the Pacific, he passed Niulakita on 29 August 1595, which he named *La Solitaria*.[23][24]\n\n\nCaptain John Byron passed through the islands of Tuvalu in 1764, during his circumnavigation of the globe as captain of the *Dolphin* (1751).[25] He charted the atolls as *Lagoon Islands*.\n\n\nThe first recorded sighting of Nanumea by Europeans was by Spanish naval officer Francisco Mourelle de la Rúa who sailed past it on 5 May 1781 as captain of the frigate *La Princesa*, when attempting a southern crossing of the Pacific from the Philippines to New Spain. He charted Nanumea as *San Augustin*.[26][27] Keith S. Chambers and Doug Munro (1980) identified Niutao as the island that Mourelle also sailed past on 5 May 1781, thus solving what Europeans had called *The Mystery of Gran Cocal*.[24][28] Mourelle's map and journal named the island *El Gran Cocal* ('The Great Coconut Plantation'); however, the latitude and longitude was uncertain.[28] Longitude could be reckoned only crudely at the time, as accurate chronometers did not become available until the late 18th century.\n\n\nIn 1809, Captain Patterson in the brig *Elizabeth* sighted Nanumea while passing through the northern Tuvalu waters on a trading voyage from Port Jackson, Sydney, Australia to China.[26]\nIn May 1819, Arent Schuyler de Peyster, of New York, captain of the armed brigantine or privateer *Rebecca*, sailing under British colours,[29][30] passed through the southern Tuvaluan waters. De Peyster sighted Nukufetau and Funafuti, which he named Ellice's Island after an English politician, Edward Ellice, the Member of Parliament for Coventry and the owner of the *Rebecca*'s cargo.[28][31][32] The name Ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay.[33]\n\n\nIn 1820, the Russian explorer Mikhail Lazarev visited Nukufetau as commander of the *Mirny*.[28] Louis-Isidore Duperrey, captain of *La Coquille*, sailed past Nanumanga in May 1824 during a circumnavigation of the Earth (1822–1825).[34] A Dutch expedition (the frigate *Maria Reigersberg*) found Nui on the morning of 14 June 1825, and named the main island (Fenua Tapu) as *Nederlandsch Eiland*.[35]\n\n\nWhalers began roving the Pacific, although they visited Tuvalu only infrequently because of the difficulties of landing on the atolls. The American Captain George Barrett of the Nantucket whaler *Independence II* has been identified as the first whaler to hunt the waters around Tuvalu.[31] He bartered coconuts from the people of Nukulaelae in November 1821, and also visited Niulakita.[24] He established a shore camp on Sakalua islet of Nukufetau, where coal was used to melt down the whale blubber.[36]\n\n\nFor less than a year between 1862 and 1863, Peruvian ships engaged in the so-called \"blackbirding\" trade, by which they recruited or impressed workers, combed the smaller islands of Polynesia from Easter Island in the eastern Pacific to Tuvalu and the southern atolls of the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati). They sought recruits to fill the extreme labour shortage in Peru.[37] While some islanders were voluntary recruits, the \"blackbirders\" were notorious for enticing islanders on to ships with tricks, such as pretending to be Christian missionaries, as well as kidnapping islanders at gunpoint. The Rev. A. W. Murray,[38] the earliest European missionary in Tuvalu, reported that in 1863 about 170 people were taken from Funafuti and about 250 were taken from Nukulaelae,[28] as there were fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae.[39][40]\n\n\nChristianity came to Tuvalu in 1861 when Elekana, a deacon of a Congregational church in Manihiki, Cook Islands, became caught in a storm and drifted for eight weeks before landing at Nukulaelae on 10 May 1861.[28][41] Elekana began preaching Christianity. He was trained at Malua Theological College, a London Missionary Society (LMS) school in Samoa, before beginning his work in establishing the Church of Tuvalu.[28]\n\n\nIn 1865, the Rev. A. W. Murray of the LMS, a Protestant congregationalist missionary society, arrived as the first European missionary; he also evangelised among the inhabitants of Tuvalu. By 1878 Protestantism was considered well established, as there were preachers on each island.[28] In the later 19th and early 20th centuries, the ministers of what became the Church of Tuvalu (*Te Ekalesia Kelisiano Tuvalu*) were predominantly Samoans,[42] who influenced the development of the Tuvaluan language and the music of Tuvalu.[43]\n\n\nThe islands came into Britain's sphere of influence in the late 19th century, when each of the Ellice Islands was declared a British protectorate by Captain Gibson of HMS *Curacoa*, between 9 and 16 October 1892.[44]\n\n\n\n### Trading firms and traders[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Islands of Tuvalu\nTrading companies became active in Tuvalu in the mid-19th century; the trading companies engaged white (palagi) traders who lived on the islands. John (also known as Jack) O'Brien was the first European to settle in Tuvalu; he became a trader on Funafuti in the 1850s. He married Salai, the daughter of the paramount chief of Funafuti. Louis Becke, who later found success as a writer, was a trader on Nanumanga from April 1880 until the trading station was destroyed later that year in a cyclone.[45] He then became a trader on Nukufetau.[46][47][48]\n\n\nIn 1892, Captain Davis of HMS *Royalist* reported on trading activities and traders on each of the islands visited. Captain Davis identified the following traders in the Ellice Group: Edmund Duffy (Nanumea); Jack Buckland (Niutao); Harry Nitz (Vaitupu); Jack O'Brien (Funafuti); Alfred Restieaux and Emile Fenisot (Nukufetau); and Martin Kleis (Nui).[49][50] During this time, the greatest number of palagi traders lived on the atolls, acting as agents for the trading companies. Some islands would have competing traders, while dryer islands might only have a single trader.[51]\n\n\nIn the later 1890s and into first decade of the 20th century, structural changes occurred in the operation of the Pacific trading companies; they moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to instead becoming a business operation where the supercargo (the cargo manager of a trading ship) would deal directly with the islanders when a ship visited an island. From 1900, the numbers of palagi traders in Tuvalu declined; the last of them were Fred Whibley on Niutao, Alfred Restieaux on Nukufetau,[52][53] and Martin Kleis on Nui.[50] By 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies,[50][51] although Whibley, Restieaux and Kleis[54] remained in the islands until their deaths.\n\n\n\n### Scientific expeditions and travellers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A man from the Nukufetau atoll, drawn by Alfred Thomas Agate in 1841\nThe United States Exploring Expedition under Charles Wilkes visited Funafuti, Nukufetau, and Vaitupu in 1841.[55] During this expedition, engraver and illustrator Alfred Thomas Agate recorded the dress and tattoo patterns of the men of Nukufetau.[56]\n\n\nIn 1885 or 1886, the New Zealand photographer Thomas Andrew visited Funafuti[57] and Nui.[58][59]\n\n\nIn 1890, Robert Louis Stevenson, his wife Fanny Vandegrift Stevenson and her son Lloyd Osbourne sailed on the *Janet Nicoll*, a trading steamer owned by Henderson and Macfarlane of Auckland, New Zealand, which operated between Sydney and Auckland and into the central Pacific.[60] The *Janet Nicoll* visited three of the Ellice Islands;[61] while Fanny records that they made landfall at Funafuti, Niutao and Nanumea, Jane Resture suggests that it was more likely they landed at Nukufetau rather than Funafuti.[62] An account of this voyage was written by Fanny Stevenson and published under the title *The Cruise of the Janet Nichol*,[63] together with photographs taken by Robert Louis Stevenson and Lloyd Osbourne.\n\n\nIn 1894, Count Rudolf Festetics de Tolna, his wife Eila (*née* Haggin) and her daughter Blanche Haggin visited Funafuti aboard the yacht *Le Tolna*.[64] The Count spent several days photographing men and women on Funafuti.[65][66]\n\n\n\n![1900, Woman on Funafuti, Tuvalu, then known as Ellice Islands](image)Woman on Funafuti (1900)  \nPhotography by Harry Clifford Fassett\nThe boreholes on Funafuti, at the site now called *Darwin's Drill*,[67] are the result of drilling conducted by the Royal Society of London for the purpose of investigating the formation of coral reefs to determine whether traces of shallow water organisms could be found at depth in the coral of Pacific atolls. This investigation followed the work on *The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs* conducted by Charles Darwin in the Pacific. Drilling occurred in 1896, 1897 and 1898.[68] Professor Edgeworth David of the University of Sydney was a member of the 1896 \"Funafuti Coral Reef Boring Expedition of the Royal Society\", under Professor William Sollas and led the expedition in 1897.[69] Photographers on these trips recorded people, communities, and scenes at Funafuti.[70]\n\n\nCharles Hedley, a naturalist at the Australian Museum, accompanied the 1896 expedition, and during his stay on Funafuti he collected invertebrate and ethnological objects. The descriptions of these were published in *Memoir III of the Australian Museum Sydney* between 1896 and 1900. Hedley also wrote the *General Account of the Atoll of Funafuti*, *The Ethnology of Funafuti*,[71] and *The Mollusca of Funafuti*.[72][73] Edgar Waite was also part of the 1896 expedition and published *The mammals, reptiles, and fishes of Funafuti*.[74] William Rainbow described the spiders and insects collected at Funafuti in *The insect fauna of Funafuti*.[75]\n\n\nHarry Clifford Fassett, captain's clerk and photographer, recorded people, communities and scenes at Funafuti in 1900 during a visit of USFC *Albatross* when the United States Fish Commission was investigating the formation of coral reefs on Pacific atolls.[76]\n\n\n\n### Colonial administration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: British Western Pacific Territories, Gilbert and Ellice Islands, and Governor of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands\n\n![](image)Stamps of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands with portraits of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II\nThe Ellice Islands were administered as a British Protectorate from 1892 to 1916, as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), by a Resident Commissioner based in the Gilbert Islands. The administration of the BWTP ended in 1916, and the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony was established, which existed until October 1975.\n\n\n\n### Second World War[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Second World War, as a British colony the Ellice Islands were aligned with the Allies. Early in the war, the Japanese invaded and occupied Makin, Tarawa and other islands in what is now Kiribati. The United States Marine Corps landed on Funafuti on 2 October 1942[77] and on Nanumea and Nukufetau in August 1943.\n\n\nFunafuti was used as a base to prepare for the subsequent seaborne attacks on the Gilbert Islands (Kiribati) that were occupied by Japanese forces.[78]\n\n\nThe islanders assisted the American forces to build airfields on Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau and to unload supplies from ships.[79] On Funafuti, the islanders shifted to the smaller islets so as to allow the American forces to build the airfield and to build naval bases and port facilities on Fongafale.[80] A Naval Construction Battalion (Seabees) built a seaplane ramp on the lagoon side of Fongafale islet, for seaplane operations by both short- and long-range seaplanes, and a compacted coral runway was also constructed on Fongafale,[81] with runways also constructed to create Nanumea Airfield[82] and Nukufetau Airfield.[83] USN Patrol Torpedo Boats (PTs) and seaplanes were based at Naval Base Funafuti from 2 November 1942 to 11 May 1944.[84]\n\n\nThe atolls of Tuvalu acted as staging posts during the preparation for the Battle of Tarawa and the Battle of Makin that commenced on 20 November 1943, which were part of the implementation of \"Operation Galvanic\".[85] After the war, the military airfield on Funafuti was developed into Funafuti International Airport.\n\n\n\n### Post-World War II – transition to independence[edit]\n\n\nThe formation of the United Nations after World War II resulted in the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization committing to a process of decolonisation; as a consequence, the British colonies in the Pacific started on a path to self-determination.[86][87]\n\n\nIn 1974, the ministerial government was introduced to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony through a change to the Constitution. In that year a general election was held,[88] and a referendum was held in 1974 to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration.[89] As a consequence of the referendum, separation occurred in two stages. The Tuvaluan Order 1975, which took effect on 1 October 1975, recognised Tuvalu as a separate British dependency with its own government.[90] The second stage occurred on 1 January 1976, when separate administrations were created out of the civil service of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony.[91]: 169[92]\n\n\nIn 1976, Tuvalu adopted the Tuvaluan dollar, whose currency circulates alongside the Australian dollar, which was previously adopted in 1966.\n\n\nElections to the House of Assembly of the British Colony of Tuvalu were held on 27 August 1977, with Toaripi Lauti being appointed Chief Minister in the House of Assembly of the Colony of Tuvalu on 1 October 1977. The House of Assembly was dissolved in July 1978, with the government of Toaripi Lauti continuing as a caretaker government until the 1981 elections were held.[93]\n\n\n\n### Independence[edit]\n\n\nToaripi Lauti became the first Prime Minister on 1 October 1978, when Tuvalu became an independent nation.[86][91]: 153–177 That date is also celebrated as the country's Independence Day and is a public holiday.[94]\n\n\nOn 26 October 1982, Queen Elizabeth II made a special royal tour to Tuvalu.\n\n\nOn 5 September 2000, Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations.[95]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2022, amidst sea level rises, Tuvalu announced plans as the first country in the world to build a self-digital replica in the metaverse in order to preserve its cultural heritage.[96]\n\n\nOn 10 November 2023, Tuvalu signed the Falepili Union, a bilateral diplomatic relationship with Australia.[97] In the Tuvaluan language, Falepili describes the traditional values of good neighbourliness, care and mutual respect.[98] The Treaty addresses climate change and security,[98] with security threats encompassing major natural disasters, health pandemics and traditional security threats.[98] The implementation of the Treaty will involve Australia increasing its contribution to the Tuvalu Trust Fund and the Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project.[98] Australia will also provide a pathway for citizens of Tuvalu to migrate to Australia, to enable  climate-related mobility for Tuvaluans.[98][99]\n\n\nThe understanding of security that is applied in the Falepili Union is consistent with the Boe Declaration (2018) on Regional Security,[100] which commits Pacific Island Forum members to commit to core values, including good governance, liberty of the individual, democratic processes and indigenous rights. The Boe Declaration expanded the Biketawa Declaration (2000) to include issues of human security, environmental security, transnational crime, and cybersecurity.[100]\n\n\n\n## Geography and environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Tuvalu\n\nSee also: Agriculture in Tuvalu and Coral reefs of Tuvalu\n\n### Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A beach at Funafuti atoll\nTuvalu is a volcanic archipelago, and consists of three reef islands (Nanumanga, Niutao and Niulakita) and six true atolls (Funafuti, Nanumea, Nui, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae and Vaitupu).[101] Its small, scattered group of low-lying atolls have poor soil and a total land area of only about 26 square kilometres (10 square miles) making it the fourth smallest country in the world. The highest elevation is 4.6 metres (15 ft) above sea level on Niulakita. Due to the lack of land above sea level, Tuvalu is often referred to as the first country that will be totally submerged, due to climate change. Over four decades, there had been a net increase in land area of the islets of 73.5 ha (2.9%), although the changes are not uniform, with 74% increasing and 27% decreasing in size. The sea level at the Funafuti tide gauge has risen at 3.9 mm per year, which is approximately twice the global average.[102] A 2018 report stated that the rising sea levels are identified as creating an increased transfer of wave energy across reef surfaces, which shifts sand, resulting in accretion to island shorelines.[101] The Tuvalu Prime Minister objected to the report's implication that there were \"alternate\" strategies for Islanders to adapt to rising sea levels, and criticised it for neglecting issues such as saltwater intrusion into groundwater tables as a result of sea level rise.[103]\n\n\nFunafuti is the largest atoll, and comprises numerous islets around a central lagoon that is approximately 25.1 kilometres (15.6 miles) (N–S) by 18.4 kilometres (11.4 miles) (W-E), centred on 179°7'E and 8°30'S. On the atolls, an annular reef rim surrounds the lagoon with seven natural reef channels.[104] Surveys were carried out in May 2010 of the reef habitats of Nanumea, Nukulaelae and Funafuti; a total of 317 fish species were recorded during this *Tuvalu Marine Life* study. The surveys identified 66 species that had not previously been recorded in Tuvalu, which brings the total number of identified species to 607.[105][106] Tuvalu's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) covers an oceanic area of approximately 900,000 km2.[107]\n\n\nTuvalu signed the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1992, and ratified it in December 2002.[108][109] The predominant vegetation type on the islands of Tuvalu is the cultivated coconut woodland, which covers 43% of the land. The native broadleaf forest is limited to 4.1% of the vegetation types.[110] Tuvalu contains the Western Polynesian tropical moist forests terrestrial ecoregion.[111]\n\n\n\n### Environmental pressures[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A wharf and beach at Funafuti atoll\nThe eastern shoreline of Funafuti Lagoon on Fongafale was modified during World War II when the airfield (now Funafuti International Airport) was constructed. The coral base of the atoll was used as fill to create the runway. The resulting borrow pits impacted the fresh-water aquifer. In the low-lying areas of Funafuti, the sea water can be seen bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools with each high tide.[112][113] In 2014, the Tuvalu Borrow Pits Remediation (BPR) project was approved so that 10 borrow pits would be filled with sand from the lagoon, leaving Tafua Pond, which is a natural pond. The New Zealand Government funded the BPR project.[114] The project was carried out in 2015, with 365,000 sqm of sand being dredged from the lagoon to fill the holes and improve living conditions on the island. This project increased the usable land space on Fongafale by eight per cent.[115]\n\n\nDuring World War II, several piers were also constructed on Fongafale in the Funafuti Lagoon; beach areas were filled and deep-water access channels were excavated. These alterations to the reef and shoreline resulted in changes to wave patterns, with less sand accumulating to form the beaches, compared to former times; the shoreline is now exposed to wave action. Several attempts to stabilise the shoreline have not achieved the desired effect.[116]\n\n\nThe reefs at Funafuti suffered damage during the El Niño events that occurred between 1998 and 2001, with an average of 70% of the Staghorn (*Acropora spp.*) corals becoming bleached as a consequence of the increase in ocean temperatures.[117][118][119] A reef restoration project has investigated reef restoration techniques;[120] and researchers from Japan have investigated rebuilding the coral reefs through the introduction of foraminifera.[121] The project of the Japan International Cooperation Agency is designed to increase the resilience of the Tuvalu coast against sea level rise, through ecosystem rehabilitation and regeneration and through support for sand production.[122]\n\n\nThe rising population has resulted in an increased demand on fish stocks, which are under stress,[118] although the creation of the Funafuti Conservation Area has provided a fishing exclusion area to help sustain the fish population across the Funafuti lagoon.[123] Population pressure on the resources of Funafuti, and inadequate sanitation systems, have resulted in pollution.[124][125] The Waste Operations and Services Act of 2009 provides the legal framework for waste management and pollution control projects funded by the European Union directed at organic waste composting in eco-sanitation systems.[126] The Environment Protection (Litter and Waste Control) Regulation 2013 is intended to improve the management of the importation of non-biodegradable materials. Plastic waste is a problem in Tuvalu, for much imported food and other commodities are supplied in plastic containers or packaging.\n\n\nIn 2023 the governments of Tuvalu and other islands vulnerable to climate change (Fiji, Niue, the Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu) launched the \"Port Vila Call for a Just Transition to a Fossil Fuel Free Pacific\", calling for the phase out fossil fuels and the 'rapid and just transition' to renewable energy and strengthening environmental law including introducing the crime of ecocide.[127][128][129]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2011 Tuvalu drought\n\n![](image)Tuvalu Meteorological Service, Fongafale, Funafuti atoll\nTuvalu experiences two distinct seasons, a wet season from November to April and a dry season from May to October.[130] Westerly gales and heavy rain are the predominant weather conditions from October to March, the period that is known as *Tau-o-lalo*, with tropical temperatures moderated by easterly winds from April to November.\n\n\nTuvalu experiences the effects of El Niño and La Niña, which is caused by changes in ocean temperatures in the equatorial and central Pacific. El Niño effects increase the chances of tropical storms and cyclones, while La Niña effects increase the chances of drought. Typically the islands of Tuvalu receive between 200 and 400 mm (8 and 16 in) of rainfall per month. The central Pacific Ocean experiences changes from periods of La Niña to periods of El Niño.[131]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Funafuti (Köppen Af)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 33.8(92.8)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.9(87.6)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 31.2(88.2)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °C (°F)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.9(78.6)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 413.7(16.29)\n | 360.6(14.20)\n | 324.3(12.77)\n | 255.8(10.07)\n | 259.8(10.23)\n | 216.6(8.53)\n | 253.1(9.96)\n | 275.9(10.86)\n | 217.5(8.56)\n | 266.5(10.49)\n | 275.9(10.86)\n | 393.9(15.51)\n | 3,512.6(138.29)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 1.0 mm) | 20\n | 19\n | 20\n | 19\n | 18\n | 19\n | 19\n | 18\n | 16\n | 18\n | 17\n | 19\n | 223\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 82\n | 82\n | 82\n | 82\n | 82\n | 82\n | 83\n | 82\n | 81\n | 81\n | 80\n | 81\n | 82\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 179.8\n | 161.0\n | 186.0\n | 201.0\n | 195.3\n | 201.0\n | 195.3\n | 220.1\n | 210.0\n | 232.5\n | 189.0\n | 176.7\n | 2,347.7\n |\n| Mean daily sunshine hours | 5.8\n | 5.7\n | 6.0\n | 6.7\n | 6.3\n | 6.7\n | 6.3\n | 7.1\n | 7.0\n | 7.5\n | 6.3\n | 5.7\n | 6.4\n |\n| Source: Deutscher Wetterdienst[132] |\n\n### Impact of climate change[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate change in Tuvalu\n\nAs low-lying islands lacking a surrounding shallow shelf, the communities of Tuvalu are especially susceptible to changes in sea level and undissipated storms.[133][134][135] At its highest, Tuvalu is only 4.6 metres (15 ft) above sea level. Tuvaluan leaders have been concerned about the effects of rising sea levels.[136] It is estimated that a sea level rise of 20–40 centimetres (8–16 inches) in the next 100 years could make Tuvalu uninhabitable.[137][138] A study published in 2018 estimated the change in land area of Tuvalu's nine atolls and 101 reef islands between 1971 and 2014, indicating that 75% of the islands had grown in area, with an overall increase of more than 2%.[139] Enele Sopoaga, the Prime Minister of Tuvalu at the time, responded to the research by stating that Tuvalu is not expanding and has gained no additional habitable land.[140][141] Sopoaga has also said that evacuating the islands is the last resort.[142]\n\n\nWhether there are measurable changes in the sea level relative to the islands of Tuvalu is a contentious issue.[143][144] There were problems associated with the pre-1993 sea level records from Funafuti which resulted in improvements in the recording technology to provide more reliable data for analysis.[138] The degree of uncertainty as to estimates of sea level change relative to the islands of Tuvalu was reflected in the conclusions made in 2002 from the available data.[138] The uncertainty as to the accuracy of the data from this tide gauge resulted in a modern Aquatrak acoustic gauge being installed in 1993 by the Australian National Tidal Facility (NTF) as part of the AusAID-sponsored South Pacific Sea Level and Climate Monitoring Project.[145] The 2011 report of the *Pacific Climate Change Science Program* published by the Australian Government,[146] concludes: \"The sea-level rise near Tuvalu measured by satellite altimeters since 1993 is about 5 mm (0.2 in) per year.\"[147]\n\n\nTuvalu has adopted a national plan of action as the observable transformations over the last ten to fifteen years show Tuvaluans that there have been changes to the sea levels.[148] These include sea water bubbling up through the porous coral rock to form pools at high tide and the flooding of low-lying areas including the airport during spring tides and king tides.[112][113][149][150][151]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Simon Kofe, Minister for Justice, Communication & Foreign Affairs, proclaimed that in response to rising sea levels and the perceived failures by the outside world to combat global warming, the country would be uploading a virtual version of itself to the metaverse in an effort to preserve its history and culture.[152]\n\n\nThe major concerns about climate change has led to the launching and development of the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA). These adaptation measures are needed to decrease the amount and volume of the negative effects from climate change. NAPA has selected seven adaptation projects with all different themes. These are: coastal, agricultural, water, health, fisheries (two different projects) and disaster. For example, a 'target' of one of these projects, like the project 'coastal', is 'increasing resilience of coastal areas and settlement to climate change'. And for the project 'water' it is 'adaptation to frequent water shortages through increasing household water capacity, water collection accessories, and water conservation techniques'.[153]\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Coastal Adaptation Project (TCAP) was launched in 2017 for the purpose on enhancing the resilience of the islands of Tuvalu to meet the challenges resulting from higher sea levels.[154] Tuvalu was the first country in the Pacific to access climate finance from Green Climate Fund, with the support of the UNDP.[154] In December 2022, work on the Funafuti reclamation project commenced. The project is to dredge sand from the lagoon to construct a platform on Funafuti that is 780 metres (2,560 ft) meters long and 100 metres (330 ft) meters wide, giving a total area of approximately 7.8 ha. (19.27 acres), which is designed to remain above sea level rise and the reach of storm waves beyond the year 2100.[154] The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) also provided funding for the TCAP. Further projects that are part of TCAP are capital works on the outer islands of Nanumea and Nanumaga aimed at reducing exposure to coastal damage resulting from storms.[154]\n\n\n\n### Cyclones and king tides[edit]\n\n\n#### Cyclones[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ocean side of Funafuti atoll showing the storm dunes, the highest point on the atoll.\nBecause of the low elevation, the islands that make up this nation are vulnerable to the effects of tropical cyclones and by the threat of current and future sea level rise.[124][155][156] A warning system, which uses the Iridium satellite network, was introduced in 2016 to allow outlying islands to be better prepared for natural disasters.[157]\n\n\nThe highest elevation is 4.6 metres (15 ft) above sea level on Niulakita.[158] Tuvalu thus has the second-lowest maximum elevation of any country (after the Maldives). The highest elevations are typically in narrow storm dunes on the ocean side of the islands which are prone to overtopping in tropical cyclones, as occurred with Cyclone Bebe, which was a very early-season storm that passed through the Tuvaluan atolls in October 1972.[159] Cyclone Bebe submerged Funafuti, eliminating 90% of structures on the island. Sources of drinking water were contaminated as a result of the system's storm surge and the flooding of the sources of fresh water.[160]\n\n\nGeorge Westbrook, a trader on Funafuti, recorded a cyclone that struck Funafuti on 23–24 December 1883.[161] A cyclone struck Nukulaelae on 17–18 March 1886.[161]\nA cyclone caused severe damage to the islands in 1894.[162]\n\n\nTuvalu experienced an average of three cyclones per decade between the 1940s and 1970s; however, eight occurred in the 1980s.[163] The impact of individual cyclones is subject to variables including the force of the winds and also whether a cyclone coincides with high tides. Funafuti's Tepuka Vili Vili islet was devastated by Cyclone Meli in 1979, with all its vegetation and most of its sand swept away during the cyclone. Along with a tropical depression that affected the islands a few days later, Severe Tropical Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Tuvalu with most islands reporting damage to vegetation and crops.[164][165] Cyclone Gavin was first identified during 2 March 1997, and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996–97 cyclone season, with Cyclones Hina and Keli following later in the season.\n\n\nIn March 2015, the winds and storm surge created by Cyclone Pam resulted in waves of 3 metres (9.8 ft) to 5 metres (16 ft) breaking over the reef of the outer islands, causing damage to houses, crops and infrastructure.[166][167] A state of emergency was declared. On Nui, the sources of fresh water were destroyed or contaminated.[168][169][170] The flooding in Nui and Nukufetau caused many families to shelter in evacuation centres or with other families.[171] Nui suffered the most damage of the three central islands (Nui, Nukufetau and Vaitupu);[172] with both Nui and Nukufetau suffering the loss of 90% of the crops.[173] Of the three northern islands (Nanumanga, Niutao and Nanumea), Nanumanga suffered the most damage, with from 60 to 100 houses flooded, with the waves also causing damage to the health facility.[173] Vasafua islet, part of the Funafuti Conservation Area, was severely damaged by Cyclone Pam. The coconut palms were washed away, leaving the islet as a sand bar.[174][175]\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Government carried out assessments of the damage caused by Cyclone Pam to the islands and has provided medical aid, food as well as assistance for the cleaning-up of storm debris. Government and Non-Government Organisations provided assistance technical, funding and material support to Tuvalu to assist with recovery, including WHO, UNICEF EAPRO, UNDP Asia-Pacific Development Information Programme, OCHA, World Bank, DFAT, New Zealand Red Cross & IFRC, Fiji National University and governments of New Zealand, Netherlands, UAE, Taiwan and the United States.[176]\n\n\nDespite passing over 500 km (310 mi) to the south of the island nation, Cyclone Tino and its associated convergence zone impacted the whole of Tuvalu between January 16 - 19 of 2020.[177][178]\n\n\n\n#### King tides[edit]\n\n\nTuvalu is also affected by perigean spring tide events which raise the sea level higher than a normal high tide.[179] The highest peak tide recorded by the Tuvalu Meteorological Service is 3.4 metres (11 ft), on 24 February 2006 and again on 19 February 2015.[180] As a result of the historical sea level rise, the king tide events lead to flooding of low-lying areas, which is compounded when sea levels are further raised by La Niña effects or local storms and waves.[181]\n\n\n\n### Water and sanitation[edit]\n\n\nRainwater harvesting is the principal source of fresh water in Tuvalu. Nukufetau, Vaitupu and Nanumea are the only islands with sustainable groundwater supplies. The effectiveness of rainwater harvesting is diminished because of poor maintenance of roofs, gutters and pipes.[182][183] Aid programmes of Australia and the European Union have been directed to improving the storage capacity on Funafuti and in the outer islands.[184]\n\n\nReverse osmosis (R/O) desalination units supplement rainwater harvesting on Funafuti. The 65 m3 desalination plant operates at a real production level of around 40 m3 per day. R/O water is only intended to be produced when storage falls below 30%, however demand to replenish household storage supplies with tanker-delivered water means that the R/O desalination units are continually operating. Water is delivered at a cost of A$3.50 per m3. Cost of production and delivery has been estimated at A$6 per m3, with the difference subsidised by the government.[182]\n\n\nIn July 2012, a United Nations Special Rapporteur called on the Tuvalu Government to develop a national water strategy to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation.[185][186] In 2012, Tuvalu developed a National Water Resources Policy under the Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) Project and the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC) Project, which are sponsored by the Global Environment Fund/SOPAC. Government water planning has established a target of between 50 and 100L of water per person per day accounting for drinking water, cleaning, community and cultural activities.[182]\n\n\nTuvalu is working with the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) to implement composting toilets and to improve the treatment of sewage sludge from septic tanks on Fongafale, for septic tanks are leaking into the freshwater lens in the sub-surface of the atoll as well as the ocean and lagoon. Composting toilets reduce water use by up to 30%.[182]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Tuvalu\n\n![](image)Government office building\n### Parliamentary democracy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human rights in Tuvalu\n\nThe *Constitution of Tuvalu* states that it is \"the supreme law of Tuvalu\" and that \"all other laws shall be interpreted and applied subject to this Constitution\"; it sets out the Principles of the Bill of Rights and the Protection of the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms.[187]\n\n\nTuvalu is a parliamentary democracy and Commonwealth realm with Charles III as King of Tuvalu. Since the King resides in the United Kingdom, he is represented in Tuvalu by a Governor General, whom he appoints upon the advice of the Prime Minister of Tuvalu.[93] Referendums were carried out in 1986 and 2008 seeking to abolish the monarchy and establish Tuvalu as a republic, but in both occasions the monarchy was chosen by the electorate.\n\n\nFrom 1974 (the creation of the British colony of Tuvalu) until independence, the legislative body of Tuvalu was called the *House of the Assembly* or *Fale I Fono*. Following independence in October 1978, the House of the Assembly was renamed the Parliament of Tuvalu or *Palamene o Tuvalu*.[93] The place at which the parliament sits is called the *Vaiaku maneapa*.[188] The *maneapa* on each island is an open meeting place where the chiefs and elders deliberate and make decisions.[188]\n\n\nThe unicameral Parliament has 16 members, with elections held every four years. The members of parliament select the Prime Minister (who is the head of government) and the Speaker of Parliament. The ministers that form the Cabinet are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister. There are no formal political parties; election campaigns are largely based on personal/family ties and reputations.\n\n\nThe Tuvalu National Library and Archives holds \"vital documentation on the cultural, social and political heritage of Tuvalu\", including surviving records from the colonial administration, as well as Tuvalu government archives.[189]\n\n\nTuvalu is a state party to the following human rights treaties: the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC); the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and; the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).[190] Tuvalu has commitments to ensuring human rights are respected under the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n\nThe national strategy plan *Te Kete - National Strategy for Sustainable Development 2021-2030* sets out the development agenda of the Government of Tuvalu,[191][192] which followed on from *Te Kakeega III – National Strategy for Sustainable Development-2016-2020* (TK III). The areas of development in these strategic plans include education; climate change; environment; migration and urbanisation.[191][193]\n\n\nThe Tuvalu National Council for Women acts as an umbrella organisation for non-governmental women's rights groups throughout the country and works closely with the government.[194]\n\n\n\n### Legal system[edit]\n\n\nThere are eight Island Courts and Lands Courts; appeals in relation to land disputes are made to the Lands Courts Appeal Panel. Appeals from the Island Courts and the Lands Courts Appeal Panel are made to the Magistrates Court, which has jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving up to $T10,000. The superior court is the High Court of Tuvalu as it has unlimited original jurisdiction to determine the Law of Tuvalu and to hear appeals from the lower courts. Rulings of the High Court can be appealed to the Court of Appeal of Tuvalu. From the Court of Appeal, there is a right of appeal to His Majesty in Council, i.e., the Privy Council in London.[195][196]\n\n\nWith regard to the judiciary, \"the first female Island Court magistrate was appointed to the Island Court in Nanumea in the 1980s and another in Nukulaelae in the early 1990s.\" There were 7 female magistrates in the Island Courts of Tuvalu (as of 2007) in comparison \"to the past where only one woman magistrate served in the Magistrate Court of Tuvalu.\"[197]\n\n\nThe Law of Tuvalu comprises the Acts voted into law by the Parliament of Tuvalu and statutory instruments that become law; certain Acts passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (during the time Tuvalu was either a British protectorate or British colony); the common law; and customary law (particularly in relation to the ownership of land).[195][196] The land tenure system is largely based on *kaitasi* (extended family ownership).[198]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Tuvalu\n\n![](image)Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen visits Governor-General of Tuvalu Iakoba Italeli in November 2017\nTuvalu participates in the work of the Pacific Community (SPC) and is a member of the Pacific Islands Forum, the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations. It has maintained a mission at the United Nations in New York City since 2000. Tuvalu became a member of the Asian Development Bank in 1993,[199] and became a member of the World Bank in 2010.[200]\n\n\nTuvalu maintains close relations with Fiji, New Zealand, Australia (which has maintained a High Commission in Tuvalu since 2018),[201] Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the European Union. It has diplomatic relations with Taiwan;[202][203][204] which maintains an embassy in Tuvalu and has a large assistance programme in the islands.[205][206]\n\n\nA major international priority for Tuvalu in the UN, at the 2002 Earth Summit in Johannesburg, South Africa and in other international fora, is promoting concern about global warming and the possible sea level rising. Tuvalu advocates ratification and implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. In December 2009, the islands stalled talks on climate change at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, fearing some other developing countries were not committing fully to binding deals on a reduction in carbon emissions. Their chief negotiator stated, \"Tuvalu is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change and our future rests on the outcome of this meeting.\"[207]\n\n\nTuvalu participates in the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which is a coalition of small island and low-lying coastal countries that have concerns about their vulnerability to the adverse effects of global climate change. Under the Majuro Declaration, which was signed on 5 September 2013, Tuvalu has made a commitment to implement power generation of 100% renewable energy (between 2013 and 2020), which is proposed to be implemented using Solar PV (95% of demand) and biodiesel (5% of demand). The feasibility of wind power generation will be considered.[208] Tuvalu participates in the operations of the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP).[209]\n\n\nTuvalu is party to a treaty of friendship with the United States, signed soon after independence and ratified by the US Senate in 1983, under which the United States renounced prior territorial claims to four Tuvaluan islands (Funafuti, Nukufetau, Nukulaelae and Niulakita) under the Guano Islands Act of 1856.[210]\n\n\nTuvalu participates in the operations of the Pacific Island Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA)[211] and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC).[212] The Tuvaluan government, the US government, and the governments of other Pacific islands are parties to the South Pacific Tuna Treaty (SPTT), which entered into force in 1988.[213] Tuvalu is also a member of the Nauru Agreement which addresses the management of tuna purse seine fishing in the tropical western Pacific. The United States and the Pacific Islands countries have negotiated the Multilateral Fisheries Treaty (which encompasses the South Pacific Tuna Treaty) to confirm access to the fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific for US tuna boats. Tuvalu and the other members of the Pacific Island Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and the United States have settled a tuna fishing deal for 2015; a longer-term deal will be negotiated. The treaty is an extension of the Nauru Agreement and provides for the US flagged purse seine vessels to fish 8,300 days in the region in return for a payment of US$90 million made up by tuna fishing industry and US-Government contributions.[214] In 2015, Tuvalu refused to sell fishing days to certain nations and fleets that have blocked Tuvaluan initiatives to develop and sustain their own fishery.[215] In 2016, the Minister of Natural Resources drew attention to Article 30 of the WCPF Convention, which describes the collective obligation of members to consider the disproportionate burden that management measures might place on small-island developing states.[216]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Tuvalu signed the memorandum of understanding (MOU) to establish the Pacific Regional Trade and Development Facility, which Facility originated in 2006, in the context of negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between Pacific ACP States and the European Union. The rationale for the creation of the Facility being to improve the delivery of aid to Pacific island countries in support of the Aid-for-Trade (AfT) requirements. The Pacific ACP States are the countries in the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement with the European Union.[217] On 31 May 2017 the first enhanced High Level Political Dialogue between Tuvalu and the European Union under the Cotonou Agreement was held in Funafuti.[218]\n\n\nOn 18 February 2016, Tuvalu signed the Pacific Islands Development Forum Charter and formally joined the Pacific Islands Development Forum (PIDF).[219] In June 2017, Tuvalu signed the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER).[220][221] Tuvalu ratified the PACER agreement in January 2022. The agreement is designed to reduce trade barriers between signatories of the agreement. Existing import tariffs will reduce to zero, and the agreement contemplates additional actions to reduce trade barriers, including harmonizing customs procedures and rules of origin, as well as eliminating restrictions to services trade, and improving labour mobility schemes between countries.[222]\n\n\n\n### Defence and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law enforcement in Tuvalu\n\nTuvalu has no regular military forces, and spends no money on the military. Its national police force, the Tuvalu Police Force headquartered in Funafuti, includes a maritime surveillance unit, customs, prisons and immigration. Police officers wear British-style uniforms.\n\n\nFrom 1994 to 2019 the Tuvalu policed its 200-kilometre exclusive economic zone with the Pacific-class patrol boat HMTSS *Te Mataili*, provided by Australia.[223] In 2019, Australia gifted a Guardian-class patrol boat as replacement.[224] Named HMTSS *Te Mataili II*, it is meant for use in maritime surveillance, fishery patrol and for search-and-rescue missions.[225] (\"HMTSS\" stands for *His/Her Majesty's Tuvaluan State Ship* or for *His/Her Majesty's Tuvalu Surveillance Ship*.)\n\n\nMale homosexuality is illegal in Tuvalu.[226] Crime in Tuvalu is not a significant social problem due to an effective criminal justice system, also due to the influence of the *Falekaupule* (the traditional assembly of elders of each island) and the central role of religious institutions in the Tuvaluan community.\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Islands of Tuvalu\n\nTuvalu consists of six atolls and three reef islands. The smallest, Niulakita, is administered as part of Niutao.\n\n\nEach island has its own high-chief, or ulu-aliki, and several sub-chiefs (alikis). The community council is the *Falekaupule* (the traditional assembly of elders) or *te sina o fenua* (literally: \"grey-hairs of the land\"). In the past, another caste, the priests (tofuga), were also amongst the decision-makers. The ulu-aliki and aliki exercise informal authority at the local level. Ulu-aliki are always chosen based on ancestry. Under the Falekaupule Act (1997),[227] the powers and functions of the *Falekaupule* are now shared with the *pule o kaupule* (elected village presidents; one on each atoll).[228]\n\n\n\n![](image)A map of Tuvalu.\nLocal government districts consisting of more than one islet:\n\n\n\n* Funafuti\n* Nanumea\n* Nui\n* Nukufetau\n* Nukulaelae\n* Vaitupu\n\n\nLocal government districts consisting of only one island:\n\n\n\n* Nanumanga\n* Niulakita\n* Niutao\n\n\nTuvalu has ISO 3166-2 codes defined for one town council (Funafuti) and seven island councils. Niulakita, which now has its own island council, is not listed, as it is administered as part of Niutao.\n\n\n\n## Society[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Tuvalu\n\nSee also: Women in Tuvalu\n\n![](image)Population distribution of Tuvalu by age group (2014).\nThe population at the 2002 census was 9,561,[229] and the population at the 2017 census was 10,645.[230][231] The most recent evaluation in 2020 puts the population at 11,342.[232] The population of Tuvalu is primarily of Polynesian ethnicity, with approximately 5.6% of the population being Micronesians speaking Gilbertese, especially on Nui.[230]\n\n\nLife expectancy for women in Tuvalu is 70.2 years and 65.6 years for men (2018 est.).[233] The country's population growth rate is 0.86% (2018 est.).[233] The net migration rate is estimated at −6.6 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.).[233] The threat of global warming in Tuvalu is not yet a dominant motivation for migration as Tuvaluans appear to prefer to continue living on the islands for reasons of lifestyle, culture and identity.[234]\n\n\nFrom 1947 to 1983, a number of Tuvaluans from Vaitupu migrated to Kioa, an island in Fiji.[235] The settlers from Tuvalu were granted Fijian citizenship in 2005. In recent years, New Zealand and Australia have been the primary destinations for migration or seasonal work.\n\n\nIn 2014, attention was drawn to an appeal to the New Zealand Immigration and Protection Tribunal against the deportation of a Tuvaluan family on the basis that they were \"climate change refugees\", who would suffer hardship resulting from the environmental degradation of Tuvalu.[236] However, the subsequent grant of residence permits to the family was made on grounds unrelated to the refugee claim.[237] The family was successful in their appeal because, under the relevant immigration legislation, there were \"exceptional circumstances of a humanitarian nature\" that justified the grant of resident permits, for the family was integrated into New Zealand society with a sizeable extended family that had effectively relocated to New Zealand.[237] Indeed, in 2013 a claim of a Kiribati man of being a \"climate change refugee\" under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (1951) was determined by the New Zealand High Court to be untenable, for there was no persecution or serious harm related to any of the five stipulated Refugee Convention grounds.[238] Permanent migration to Australia and New Zealand, such as for family reunification, requires compliance with the immigration legislation of those countries.[239]\n\n\nOn 10 November 2023, Tuvalu signed the Falepili Union, a bilateral diplomatic relationship with Australia, under which Australia will provide a pathway for citizens of Tuvalu to migrate to Australia, to enable  climate-related mobility for Tuvaluans.[240][241]\n\n\nNew Zealand has an annual quota of 75 Tuvaluans granted work permits under the *Pacific Access Category*, as announced in 2001.[242] The applicants register for the Pacific Access Category (PAC) ballots; the primary criterion is that the principal applicant must have a job offer from a New Zealand employer.[243] Tuvaluans also have access to seasonal employment in the horticulture and viticulture industries in New Zealand under the *Recognised Seasonal Employer* (RSE) Work Policy introduced in 2007 allowing for employment of up to 5,000 workers from Tuvalu and other Pacific islands.[244] Tuvaluans can participate in the Australian *Pacific Seasonal Worker Program*, which allows Pacific Islanders to obtain seasonal employment in the Australian agriculture industry, in particular, cotton and cane operations; fishing industry, in particular aquaculture; and with accommodation providers in the tourism industry.[245]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tuvaluan language\n\nThe Tuvaluan language and English are the national languages of Tuvalu. Tuvaluan is of the Ellicean group of Polynesian languages, distantly related to all other Polynesian languages such as Hawaiian, Māori, Tahitian, Rapa Nui, Samoan and Tongan.[246] It is most closely related to the languages spoken on the Polynesian outliers in Micronesia and northern and central Melanesia. The Tuvaluan language has borrowed from the Samoan language, as a consequence of Christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries being predominantly Samoan.[43][246]\n\n\nThe Tuvaluan language is spoken by virtually everyone, while a Micronesian language very similar to Gilbertese is spoken on Nui.[246][247] English is also an official language but is not spoken in daily use. Parliament and official functions are conducted in the Tuvaluan language.\n\n\nThere are about 13,000 Tuvaluan speakers worldwide.[248][249] Radio Tuvalu transmits Tuvaluan-language programming.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Tuvalu\n\n![](image)Fetu Ao Lima (Morning Star Church), Congregational Christian Church of Tuvalu\nThe Congregational Christian Church of Tuvalu, which is part of the Calvinist tradition, is the state church of Tuvalu;[250] although in practice this merely entitles it to \"the privilege of performing special services on major national events\".[251] Its adherents comprise about 97% of the 10,837 (2012 census) inhabitants of the archipelago.[250][252] The Constitution of Tuvalu guarantees freedom of religion, including the freedom to practice, the freedom to change religion, the right not to receive religious instruction at school or to attend religious ceremonies at school, and the right not to \"take an oath or make an affirmation that is contrary to his religion or belief\".[253]\n\n\nOther Christian groups include the Catholic community served by the Mission Sui Iuris of Funafuti, and the Seventh-day Adventist which has 2.8% of the population.[233] According to its own estimates, the Tuvalu Brethren Church has about 500 members (i.e. 4.5% of the population).[254]\n\n\nThe Baháʼí Faith is the largest minority religion and the largest non-Christian religion in Tuvalu. It constitutes 2.0% of the population.[233] The Baháʼís are present on Nanumea,[255] and Funafuti.[256] The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community consists of about 50 members (0.4% of the population).[257]\n\n\nThe introduction of Christianity ended the worship of ancestral spirits and other deities (animism),[258] along with the power of the *vaka-atua* (the priests of the old religions).[259] Laumua Kofe describes the objects of worship as varying from island to island, although ancestor worship was described by Rev. D. J. Whitmee in 1870 as being common practice.[260]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Tuvalu\n\nThe Princess Margaret Hospital on Funafuti is the only hospital in Tuvalu and the primary provider of medical services.\n\n\nSince the late 20th century, the biggest health problems in Tuvalu are obesity-related. The leading cause of death has been heart disease,[261] which is closely followed by diabetes[262] and high blood pressure.[261] In 2016 the majority of deaths resulted from cardiac diseases, with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and cerebral-vascular disease among the other causes of death.[263]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Children on Niutao\nEducation in Tuvalu is free and compulsory between the ages of 6 and 15 years. Each island has a primary school. Motufoua Secondary School is located on Vaitupu.[264] Students board at the school during the school term, returning to their home islands each school vacation. Fetuvalu Secondary School, a day school operated by the Church of Tuvalu, is on Funafuti.[265]\n\n\nFetuvalu offers the Cambridge syllabus. Motufoua offers the Fiji Junior Certificate (FJC) at year 10, Tuvaluan Certificate at Year 11 and the Pacific Senior Secondary Certificate (PSSC) at Year 12, which is set by SPBEA, the Fiji-based exam board.[266] Sixth form students who pass their PSSC go on to the Augmented Foundation Programme, funded by the Tuvalu government. This program is required for tertiary education programmes outside of Tuvalu and is available at the University of the South Pacific (USP) Extension Centre in Funafuti.[267]\n\n\nRequired attendance at school is 10 years for males and 11 years for females (2001).[233] The adult literacy rate is 99.0% (2002).[268] In 2010, there were 1,918 students who were taught by 109 teachers (98 certified and 11 uncertified). The teacher-pupil ratio for primary schools in Tuvalu is around 1:18 for all schools with the exception of Nauti School, which has a ratio of 1:27. Nauti School on Funafuti is the largest primary school in Tuvalu with more than 900 students (45 per cent of the total primary school enrolment). The pupil-teacher ratio for Tuvalu is low compared to the entire Pacific region (ratio of 1:29).[269]\n\n\nCommunity Training Centres (CTCs) have been established within the primary schools on each atoll. They provide vocational training to students who do not progress beyond Class 8 because they failed the entry qualifications for secondary education. The CTCs offer training in basic carpentry, gardening and farming, sewing and cooking. At the end of their studies the graduates can apply to continue studies either at Motufoua Secondary School or the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI). Adults can also attend courses at the CTCs.[270]\n\n\nFour tertiary institutions offer technical and vocational courses: Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI), Tuvalu Atoll Science Technology Training Institute (TASTII), Australian Pacific Training Coalition (APTC) and University of the South Pacific (USP) Extension Centre.[271]\n\n\nThe Tuvaluan Employment Ordinance of 1966 sets the minimum age for paid employment at 14 years and prohibits children under the age of 15 from performing hazardous work.[272]\n\n\nThe Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI)[273] finds that Tuvalu is fulfilling only 88.0% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to education based on the country's level of income.[274] HRMI breaks down the right to education by looking at the rights to both primary education and secondary education. While taking into consideration Tuvalu's income level, the nation is achieving 97.7% of what should be possible based on its resources (income) for primary education but only 78.3% for secondary education.[274]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tuvaluan mythology\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nThe traditional buildings of Tuvalu used plants and trees from the native broadleaf forest,[275] including timber from *pouka* (*Hernandia peltata*); *ngia* or *ingia* bush (*Pemphis acidula*); *miro* (*Thespesia populnea*); *tonga* (*Rhizophora mucronata*); *fau* or *fo fafini*, or woman's fibre tree (*Hibiscus tiliaceus*).[275] Fibre is from coconut; *ferra*, native fig (*Ficus aspem*); *fala*, screw pine or *Pandanus*.[275] The buildings were constructed without nails and were lashed together with a plaited sennit rope that was handmade from dried coconut fibre.[276]\n\n\nFollowing contact with Europeans, iron products were used including nails and corrugated roofing material. Modern buildings in Tuvalu are constructed from imported building materials, including imported timber and concrete.[276]\n\n\n\n![](image)Interior of a maneapa on Funafuti, Tuvalu\nChurch and community buildings (*maneapa*) are usually coated with white paint that is known as *lase*, which is made by burning a large amount of dead coral with firewood. The whitish powder that is the result is mixed with water and painted on the buildings.[277]\n\n\n\n### Art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Art of Tuvalu\n\nThe women of Tuvalu use cowrie and other shells in traditional handicrafts.[278] The artistic traditions of Tuvalu have traditionally been expressed in the design of clothing and traditional handicrafts such as the decoration of mats and fans.[278] Crochet (*kolose*) is one of the art forms practised by Tuvaluan women.[279] The design of women's skirts (*titi*), tops (*teuga saka*), headbands, armbands, and wristbands, which continue to be used in performances of the traditional dance songs of Tuvalu, represents contemporary Tuvaluan art and design.[280] The material culture of Tuvalu uses traditional design elements in artefacts used in everyday life such as the design of canoes and fish hooks made from traditional materials.[281][282]\n\n\nIn 2015, an exhibition was held on Funafuti of the art of Tuvalu, with works that addressed climate change through the eyes of artists and the display of *Kope ote olaga* (possessions of life), a display of the various artefacts of Tuvalu culture.[283]\n\n\n\n### Dance and music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Tuvalu\n\n![](image)A Tuvaluan dancer at Auckland's Pasifika Festival\nThe traditional music of Tuvalu consists of a number of dances, including *fakaseasea*, *fakanau* and *fatele*.[284] The *fatele*, in its modern form, is performed at community events and to celebrate leaders and other prominent individuals, such as the visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in September 2012.[285][286] The Tuvaluan style can be described \"as a musical microcosm of Polynesia, where contemporary and older styles co-exist\".[284]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Tuvalu\n\nThe cuisine of Tuvalu is based on the staple of coconut and the many species of fish found in the ocean and lagoons of the atolls. Desserts made on the islands include coconut and coconut milk, rather than animal milk. The traditional foods eaten in Tuvalu are pulaka, taro, bananas, breadfruit[287] and coconut.[288] Tuvaluans also eat seafood, including coconut crab and fish from the lagoon and ocean.[123] Another traditional food source is seabirds (*taketake* or black noddy and *akiaki* or white tern), with pork being eaten mostly at *fateles* (or parties with dancing to celebrate events).[228]\n\n\nPulaka is the main source for carbohydrates. Seafood provides protein. Bananas and breadfruit are supplemental crops. Coconut is used for its juice, to make other beverages (such as toddy) and to improve the taste of some dishes.[228]\n\n\nA 1560-square-metre pond was built in 1996 on Vaitupu to sustain aquaculture in Tuvalu.[289]\n\n\nFlying fish are also caught as a source of food;[290][291] and as an exciting activity, using a boat, a butterfly net and a spotlight to attract the flying fish.[228]\n\n\n\n### Heritage[edit]\n\n\nThe traditional community system still survives to a large extent on Tuvalu. Each family has its own task, or *salanga*, to perform for the community, such as fishing, house building or defence. The skills of a family are passed on from parents to children.\n\n\nMost islands have their own *fusi*, community-owned shops similar to convenience stores, where canned foods and bags of rice can be purchased. Goods are cheaper, and fusis give better prices for their own produce.[228]\n\n\nAnother important building is the *falekaupule* or *maneapa*, the traditional island meeting hall,[292] where important matters are discussed and which is also used for wedding celebrations and community activities such as a *fatele* involving music, singing and dancing.[228] *Falekaupule* is also used as the name of the council of elders – the traditional decision-making body on each island. Under the Falekaupule Act, *Falekaupule* means \"traditional assembly in each island ... composed in accordance with the Aganu of each island\". *Aganu* means traditional customs and culture.[292]\n\n\nTuvalu does not have any museums, however the creation of a Tuvalu National Cultural Centre and Museum is part of the government's strategic plan for 2018–24.[293][294]\n\n\n\n### Traditional single-outrigger canoe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Canoe carving on Nanumea\n*Paopao* (from the Samoan language, meaning a small fishing-canoe made from a single log), is the traditional single-outrigger canoe of Tuvalu, of which the largest could carry four to six adults. The variations of single-outrigger canoes that had been developed on Vaitupu and Nanumea were reef-type or paddled canoes; that is, they were designed for carrying over the reef and being paddled, rather than being sailed.[281] Outrigger canoes from Nui were constructed with an indirect type of outrigger attachment and the hull is double-ended, with no distinct bow and stern. These canoes were designed to be sailed over the Nui lagoon.[295] The booms of the outrigger are longer than those found in other designs of canoes from the other islands. This made the Nui canoe more stable when used with a sail than the other designs.[295]\n\n\n\n## Sport and leisure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Tuvalu\n\nSee also: Tuvaluan records in athletics, Tuvalu at the Pacific Games, Tuvalu at the Commonwealth Games, Tuvalu at the World Championships in Athletics, and Tuvalu at the Olympics\n\nA traditional sport played in Tuvalu is *kilikiti*,[296] which is similar to cricket.[297] A popular sport specific to Tuvalu is *Te ano* (The ball), which is played with two round balls of 12 cm (5 in) diameter.[228] *Te ano* is a traditional game that is similar to volleyball, in which the two hard balls made from pandanus leaves are volleyed at great speed with the team members trying to stop the ball hitting the ground.[298] Traditional sports in the late 19th century were foot racing, lance throwing, quarterstaff fencing and wrestling, although the Christian missionaries disapproved of these activities.[299]\n\n\nThe popular sports in Tuvalu include *kilikiti*, *Te ano*, association football, futsal, volleyball, handball, basketball and rugby sevens. Tuvalu has sports organisations for athletics, badminton, tennis, table tennis, volleyball, football, basketball, rugby union, weightlifting and powerlifting. At the 2013 Pacific Mini Games, Tuau Lapua Lapua won Tuvalu's first gold medal in an international competition in the weightlifting 62 kilogram male snatch. (He also won bronze in the clean and jerk, and obtained the silver medal overall for the combined event.)[300] In 2015, Telupe Iosefa received the first gold medal won by Tuvalu at the Pacific Games in the powerlifting 120 kg male division.[301][302][303]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tuvalu national football team (2011)\nFootball in Tuvalu is played at club and national team level. The Tuvalu national football team trains at the Tuvalu Sports Ground in Funafuti and competes in the Pacific Games. The Tuvalu National Football Association is an associate member of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) and is seeking membership in FIFA.[304][305] The Tuvalu national futsal team participates in the Oceanian Futsal Championship.\n\n\nA major sporting event is the \"Independence Day Sports Festival\" held annually on 1 October. The most important sports event within the country is arguably the Tuvalu Games, which are held yearly since 2008. Tuvalu first participated in the Pacific Games in 1978 and in the Commonwealth Games in 1998, when a weightlifter attended the games held at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.[306] Two table tennis players attended the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England;[306] Tuvalu entered competitors in shooting, table tennis and weightlifting at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia;[306] three athletes participated in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India, entering the discus, shot put and weightlifting events;[306] and a team of 3 weightlifters and 2 table tennis players attended the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Tuvaluan athletes have also participated in the men's and women's 100 metres sprint at the World Championships in Athletics from 2009.\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Association of Sports and National Olympic Committee (TASNOC) was recognised as a National Olympic Committee in July 2007. Tuvalu entered the Olympic Games for the first time at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, China, with a weightlifter and two athletes in the men's and women's 100 metres sprint. A team with athletes in the same events represented Tuvalu at the 2012 Summer Olympics.[307] Etimoni Timuani was the sole representative of Tuvalu at the 2016 Summer Olympics in the 100m event.[308] Karalo Maibuca and Matie Stanley represented Tuvalu at the 2020 Summer Olympics in the 100m events.[309][310] Tuvalu sent a team to the 2023 Pacific Games.\n\n\n\n## Economy and government services[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Tuvalu\n\n### Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)National Bank of Tuvalu\nFrom 1996 to 2002, Tuvalu was one of the best-performing Pacific Island economies and achieved an average real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 5.6% per annum. Economic growth slowed after 2002, with GDP growth of 1.5% in 2008. Tuvalu was exposed to rapid rises in world prices of fuel and food in 2008, with the level of inflation peaking at 13.4%.[268] Tuvalu has the smallest GDP of any sovereign nation in the world.[311]\n\n\nTuvalu joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on 24 June 2010.[312] The IMP 2010 Report on Tuvalu estimates that Tuvalu experienced zero growth in its 2010 GDP, after the economy contracted by about 2% in 2009.[268] On 5 August 2012, the executive board of the IMF concluded the Article IV consultation with Tuvalu, and assessed the economy of Tuvalu: \"A slow recovery is underway in Tuvalu, but there are important risks. GDP grew in 2011 for the first time since the global financial crisis, led by the private retail sector and education spending.\"[313] The IMF 2014 Country Report noted that real GDP growth in Tuvalu had been volatile averaging only 1 per cent in the past decade. The 2014 Country Report describes economic growth prospects as generally positive as the result of large revenues from fishing licences, together with substantial foreign aid.[314] In 2023, the IMF Article IV consultation with Tuvalu concluded that a successful vaccination strategy allowed Tuvalu to lift coronavirus disease (COVID) containment measures at the end of 2022. However, the economic cost of the pandemic was significant, with real gross domestic product growth falling from 13.8% in 2019 to -4.3 percent in 2020, although it recovered to 1.8% in 2021.[315] Inflation rose to 11.5% in 2022, but inflation is project to fall to 2.8% by 2028.[315]\n\n\nThe increase in inflation in 2022 was due to the rapid rise in the cost of food resulting from a drought that affected food production and from rising global food prices, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (food imports represent 19 percent of Tuvalu’s GDP, while agriculture makes up for only 10 percent of GDP).[315]\n\n\nThe government is the primary provider of medical services through Princess Margaret Hospital on Funafuti, which operates health clinics on the other islands. Banking services are provided by the National Bank of Tuvalu. Public sector workers make up about 65% of those formally employed. Remittances from Tuvaluans living in Australia and New Zealand, and remittances from Tuvaluan sailors employed on overseas ships are important sources of income for Tuvaluans.[316] Approximately 15% of adult males work as seamen on foreign-flagged merchant ships. Agriculture in Tuvalu is focused on coconut trees and growing pulaka in large pits of composted soil below the water table. Tuvaluans are otherwise involved in traditional subsistence agriculture and fishing.\n\n\nTuvaluans are well known for their seafaring skills, with the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute on Amatuku motu (island), Funafuti, providing training to approximately 120 marine cadets each year so that they have the skills necessary for employment as seafarers on merchant shipping. The Tuvalu Overseas Seamen's Union (TOSU) is the only registered trade union in Tuvalu. It represents workers on foreign ships. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that 800 Tuvaluan men are trained, certified and active as seafarers. The ADB estimates that, at any one time, about 15% of the adult male population works abroad as seafarers.[317] Job opportunities also exist as observers on tuna boats where the role is to monitor compliance with the boat's tuna fishing licence.[318]\n\n\nGovernment revenues largely come from sales of fishing licences, income from the Tuvalu Trust Fund, and from the lease of its \".tv\" Internet Top Level Domain (TLD). Tuvalu began deriving revenue from the commercialisation of its \".tv\" Internet domain name,[319] which was managed by Verisign until 2021.[320][321] Tuvalu also generates income from postage stamps by the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau, and from the Tuvalu Ship Registry.\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) was established in 1987 by the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.[42] The TTF is a sovereign wealth fund that is owned by Tuvalu but is administered by an international Board and the government of Tuvalu. When the performance of the TTF exceeds its operating target each year, excess funds are transferred to the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF), and can be freely drawn upon by the Tuvaluan government to finance budgetary expenditures.[322] In 2022, the value of the Tuvalu Trust Fund is approximately $190 million.[322] In 2021 the market value of the TTF rose by 12 percent to its highest level on record (261 percent of GDP). However, the volatility in global equity markets in 2022 resulted in the TTF’s value falling by 7 percent as compared to the end of 2021.[322]\n\n\nFinancial support to Tuvalu is also provided by Japan, South Korea and the European Union. Australia and New Zealand continue to contribute capital to the TTF, and provide other forms of development assistance.[316][42]\n\n\nThe U.S. government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu. In 1999, the payment from the South Pacific Tuna Treaty (SPTT) was about $9 million, with the value increasing in the following years. In May 2013, representatives from the United States and the Pacific Islands countries agreed to sign interim arrangement documents to extend the Multilateral Fisheries Treaty (which encompasses the South Pacific Tuna Treaty) for 18 months.[323]\n\n\nThe United Nations designates Tuvalu as a least developed country (LDC) because of its limited potential for economic development, absence of exploitable resources and its small size and vulnerability to external economic and environmental shocks.[324] Tuvalu participates in the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries (EIF), which was established in October 1997 under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation.[325] In 2013, Tuvalu deferred its graduation from least developed country (LDC) status to a developing country to 2015. Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga said that this deferral was necessary to maintain access by Tuvalu to the funds provided by the United Nations's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), as \"Once Tuvalu graduates to a developed country, it will not be considered for funding assistance for climate change adaptation programmes like NAPA, which only goes to LDCs\". Tuvalu had met targets so that Tuvalu was to graduate from LDC status. Prime minister Enele Sopoaga wants the United Nations to reconsider its criteria for graduation from LDC status as not enough weight is given to the environmental plight of small island states like Tuvalu in the application of the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI).[326]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Funafuti Conservation Area, Public holidays in Tuvalu, and Visa policy of Tuvalu\n\n![](image)Funafuti lagoon (*Te Namo*)\nDue to the country's remoteness, tourism is not significant. Visitors totalled 1,684 in 2010: 65% were on business, development officials or technical consultants, 20% were tourists (360 people), and 11% were expatriates returning to visit family.[182] In 2016, the number of visitors had increased to 2,000.[327]\n\n\nThe main island of Funafuti is the focus of travellers, since the only airport in Tuvalu is the Funafuti International Airport and Funafuti is the only island that has hotel facilities.[328] However, there are no tour guides, tour operators or organised activities and no cruise ships visit.[329] Ecotourism is a motivation of travellers to Tuvalu. The Funafuti Conservation Area consists of 12.74 square miles (33.00 square kilometres) of ocean, reef, lagoon, channel and six uninhabited islets.\n\n\nThe outer atolls can be visited on the two passenger-cargo ships, *Nivaga III* and *Manú Folau*, which provide round-trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks. There is guesthouse accommodation on many of the outer islands.\n\n\nFrom October 2023, Air Tuvalu commenced domestic flights between Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau.[330]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications and media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in Tuvalu\n\nSee also: List of newspapers in Tuvalu\n\nThe Tuvalu Media Department of the Government of Tuvalu operates *Radio Tuvalu* which broadcasts from Funafuti.[331] In 2011, the Japanese government provided financial support to construct a new AM broadcast studio. The installation of upgraded transmission equipment allows Radio Tuvalu to be heard on all nine islands of Tuvalu. The new AM radio transmitter on Funafuti replaced the FM radio service to the outer islands and freed up satellite bandwidth for mobile services.[182] *Fenui – news from Tuvalu* is a free digital publication of the Tuvalu Media Department that is emailed to subscribers and operates a Facebook page, which publishes news about government activities and news about Tuvaluan events.\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation (TTC), a state-owned enterprise, provides fixed line telephone communications to subscribers on each island, mobile phone services on Funafuti, Vaitupu and Nukulaelae and is a distributor of the Fiji Television service (Sky Pacific satellite television service).[182]\n\n\nCommunications in Tuvalu rely on satellite dishes for telephone and internet access. The available bandwidth is only 512 kbit/s uplink, and 1.5 Mbit/s downlink. Throughout Tuvalu are more than 900 subscribers who want to use the satellite service, with demand slowing down the speed of the system.[332]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Manu Folau* off Vaitupu atoll (2006)\nThere are limited transport services in Tuvalu. There are about eight kilometres (5 miles) of roads.[233] The streets of Funafuti were paved in mid-2002, but other roads are unpaved. Tuvalu does not have any railroads.\n\n\nFunafuti is the only port, but there is a deep-water berth in the lagoon at Nukufetau. The merchant marine fleet consists of two passenger/cargo ships *Nivaga III* and *Manu Folau*. The *Nivaga III* and *Manu Folau* provide round-trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks, and travel between Suva, Fiji and Funafuti three or four times a year. The *Manu Folau*, a 50-metre vessel, was a gift from Japan to the people of Tuvalu.\n\n\nIn 2015, the *Nivaga III* was donated by the government of Japan; it replaced the *Nivaga II*, which had been in service in Tuvalu from 1989.[333][334]\n\n\nIn 2020, the government of Tuvalu purchased a landing barge, which is intended to transport of dangerous goods and building material from the capital to the outer islands. The barge was named *Moeiteava*. The Government of Taiwan provided financial assistance.[335]\n\n\nThe Tuvalu Fisheries Department operates two vessels for carrying out its activities within the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and outer islands. These are the 18-metre *Manaui* and 32-metre *Tala Moana*. The vessels are used for fisheries research, deploying fish aggregating devices (FADs), visiting outer islands for monitoring and consultations, including to implement Tuvalu's National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) to address climate change.[336] The *Manaui* was procured through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in 1989 and is nearing the end of its life.[337] In 2015, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) provided assistance to acquire *Tala Moana*;[338] which is also used for Monitoring Control and Surveillance (MCS) patrols.[339] *Tala Moana* is steel monohull oil rig supply vessel that is equipped with facilities for a team of about 15 people.[340]\n\n\nThe only international airport in Tuvalu is Funafuti International Airport. Fiji Airways, the owner of Fiji Airlines (trading as Fiji Link) operates services three times a week (Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday) between Suva (originating from Nadi) and Funafuti with ATR 72–600, a 68-seat plane. Air Kiribati service provides one flight a week to Funafuti from Tarawa on a Wednesday. The service uses a Bombardier Dash 8 100 series aircraft, which has the capacity to take up to 35 passengers.[341] The government owned Air Tuvalu commenced domestic flights between Funafuti, Nanumea and Nukufetau from October 2023 using a 16 seat Twin Otter (T2-TV8).[330]\n\n\n\n## Filmography and bibliography[edit]\n\n\n### Filmography[edit]\n\n\nDocumentary films about Tuvalu:\n\n\n\n* *Tu Toko Tasi* (Stand by Yourself) (2000) Conrad Mill, a Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) production.[342]\n* *Paradise Domain – Tuvalu* (Director: Joost De Haas, Bullfrog Films/TVE 2001) 25:52 minutes – YouTube video.[112]\n* *Tuvalu island tales (A Tale of two Islands*) (Director: Michel Lippitsch) 34 minutes – YouTube video.\n* *The Disappearing of Tuvalu: Trouble in Paradise* (2004) by Christopher Horner and Gilliane Le Gallic.[343]\n* *Paradise Drowned: Tuvalu, the Disappearing Nation* (2004) Written and produced by Wayne Tourell.

Its nearest neighbour is Banaba of Kiribati, about 300 km (190 mi) to the east.[13] It lies northwest of Tuvalu, 1,300 km (810 mi) northeast of Solomon Islands,[14] east-northeast of Papua New Guinea, southeast of the Federated States of Micronesia and south of the Marshall Islands. With an area of only 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi), Nauru is the third-smallest country in the world behind Vatican City and Monaco, making it the smallest republic and island nation. Its population of about 10,800 is the world's second-smallest (not including colonies or overseas territories) after Vatican City.\nSettled by people from Micronesia circa 1000 BCE, Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century. After World War I, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. During World War II, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops, and was bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into United Nations trusteeship. Nauru gained its independence in 1968.\n\n\nNauru is a phosphate-rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy strip mining operations for over a century. However, this has seriously harmed the country's environment, causing the island nation to suffer from what is often referred to as the \"resource curse\". The phosphate was exhausted in the 1990s, and the remaining reserves are not economically viable for extraction.[15] A trust established to manage the island's accumulated mining wealth, set up for the day the reserves would be exhausted, has diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre.[16] At various points since 2001, it has accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional Processing Centre, a controversial offshore Australian immigration detention facility. As a result of heavy dependence on Australia, some sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.[17][18][19] The sovereign state is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Organization of African, Caribbean, and Pacific States.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Nauru and British Western Pacific Territories\n\n![](image)Photo of a Nauruan warrior during the Nauruan Civil War around 1880\nNauru was first settled by Micronesians at least 3,000 years ago, and there is evidence of possible Polynesian influence.[20] Comparatively little is known of Nauruan prehistory,[21] although the island is believed to have had a long period of isolation, which accounts for the distinct language that developed among the inhabitants.[22] There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru, which are represented in the twelve-pointed star on the country's flag.[23] Traditionally, Nauruans traced their descent matrilineally. Inhabitants practised aquaculture: they caught juvenile milkfish (known as *Ibija* in Nauruan), acclimatised them to freshwater, and raised them in Buada Lagoon, providing a reliable food source. The other locally grown components of their diet included coconuts and pandanus fruit.[24][25] The name \"Nauru\" may derive from the Nauruan word **Anáoero**, which means 'I go to the beach.'[26]\n\n\nIn 1798, the British sea captain John Fearn, on his trading ship *Hunter* (300 tons), became the first Westerner to report sighting Nauru, calling it \"Pleasant Island\", because of its attractive appearance.[27][28] From at least 1826, Nauruans had regular contact with Europeans on whaling and trading ships who called for provisions and fresh drinking water.[29] The last whaler to call during the age of sail visited in 1904.[30]\n\n\nAround this time, deserters from European ships began to live on the island. The islanders traded food for alcoholic palm wine and firearms.[31] The firearms were used during the 10-year Nauruan Civil War that began in 1878.[32]\n\n\nAfter an agreement with Great Britain, Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's Marshall Islands Protectorate for administrative purposes.[33][34] The arrival of the Germans ended the civil war, and kings were established as rulers of the island. The most widely known of these was King Auweyida. Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands arrived in 1888.[35][36] The German settlers called the island \"Nawodo\" or \"Onawero\".[37] The Germans ruled Nauru for almost three decades. Robert Rasch, a German trader who married a Nauruan woman, was the first administrator, appointed in 1890.[35]\n\n\nPhosphate was discovered on Nauru in 1900 by the prospector Albert Fuller Ellis.[34][28] The Pacific Phosphate Company began to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany, exporting its first shipment in 1907.[27][38] In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, Nauru was captured by Australian troops. In 1919, it was agreed by the Allied and Associated Powers that His Britannic Majesty should be the administering authority under a League of Nations mandate. The Nauru Island Agreement forged in 1919 between the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand provided for the administration of the island and extraction of the phosphate deposits by an intergovernmental British Phosphate Commission (BPC).[33][39] The terms of the League of Nations mandate were drawn up in 1920.[33][40]\n\n\nThe island experienced an influenza epidemic and ongoing colonial strife through the early 20th century, with a mortality rate of 18 per cent among native Nauruans.[41] In 1923, the League of Nations gave Australia a trustee mandate over Nauru, with the United Kingdom and New Zealand as co-trustees.[42] On 6 and 7 December 1940, the German auxiliary cruisers *Komet* and *Orion* sank five supply ships in the vicinity of Nauru. *Komet* then shelled Nauru's phosphate mining areas, oil storage depots, and the shiploading cantilever.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Army Air Forces bombing the Japanese airstrip on Nauru, 1943.[46]\nJapanese troops occupied Nauru on 25 August 1942.[44] The Japanese built 2 airfields which were bombed for the first time on 25 March 1943, preventing food supplies from being flown to Nauru.[47] The Japanese deported 1,200 Nauruans to work as labourers in the Chuuk Islands,[46] which was also occupied by Japan. As part of the Allied strategy of island hopping from the Pacific islands towards the main islands of Japan, Nauru was bypassed and left to \"wither on the vine\". Nauru was finally taken back from the Japanese on 13 September 1945, when commander Hisayaki Soeda surrendered the island to the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy.[48] The surrender was accepted by Brigadier J. R. Stevenson, who represented Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, the commander of the First Australian Army, aboard the warship HMAS *Diamantina*.[49][50][51] Arrangements were made to repatriate from Chuuk the 745 Nauruans who survived Japanese captivity there.[52] They were returned to Nauru by the BPC ship *Trienza* in January 1946.[53]\n\n\nIn 1947, a trusteeship was established by the United Nations, with Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as trustees.[54][55] Under those arrangements, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand were a joint administering authority. The Nauru Island Agreement provided for the first administrator to be appointed by Australia for five years, leaving subsequent appointments to be decided by the three governments.[33][40] However, in practice, administrative power was exercised by Australia alone.[33][40]\n\n\nThe 1948 Nauru riots occurred when Chinese guano mining workers went on strike over pay and conditions. The Australian administration imposed a state of emergency with Native Police and armed volunteers of locals and Australian officials being mobilised. This force, using sub-machine guns and other firearms, opened fire on the Chinese workers killing two and wounding sixteen. Around 50 of the workers were arrested and two of these were bayoneted to death while in custody. The trooper who bayoneted the prisoners was charged but later acquitted on grounds that the wounds were \"accidentally received.\"[56][57] The governments of the Soviet Union and China made official complaints against Australia at the United Nations over this incident.[58]\n\n\nIn 1964, it was proposed to relocate the population of Nauru to Curtis Island off the coast of Queensland, Australia. By that time, Nauru had been extensively mined for phosphate by companies from Australia, Britain, and New Zealand, damaging the landscape so much that it was thought the island would be uninhabitable by the 1990s. Rehabilitating the island was seen as financially impossible. In 1962, Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies said that the three countries involved in the mining had an obligation to provide a solution for the Nauruan people, and proposed finding a new island for them. In 1963, the Australian Government proposed to acquire all the land on Curtis Island (which was considerably larger than Nauru) and then offer the Nauruans freehold title over the island and that the Nauruans would become Australian citizens.[59][60] The cost of resettling the Nauruans on Curtis Island was estimated to be £10 million (A$324 million in 2022[61]), which included housing and infrastructure and the establishment of pastoral, agricultural, and fishing industries.[62] However, the Nauruan people did not wish to become Australian citizens and wanted to be given sovereignty over Curtis Island to establish themselves as an independent nation, which Australia would not agree to.[63] Nauru rejected the proposal to move to Curtis Island, instead choosing to become an independent nation operating their mines in Nauru.[64]\n\n\nNauru became self-governing in January 1966, and following a two-year constitutional convention, it became independent on 31 January 1968 under founding president Hammer DeRoburt.[65] In 1967, the people of Nauru purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners, and in June 1970, control passed to the locally owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation (NPC).[38] Income from the mines made Nauruans among the richest people in the world.[66][67] In 1989, Nauru took legal action against Australia in the International Court of Justice over Australia's administration of the island, in particular, Australia's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining. *Certain Phosphate Lands: Nauru v. Australia* led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru.[54][68]\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a state of emergency was declared in Nauru on 17 March 2020. The declaration to minimize the outbreak was signed by President Lionel Aingimea during a period of 30 days.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Nauru and Geology of Nauru\n\n![](image)Map of Nauru\nNauru is a 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi),[3] oval-shaped island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, 55.95 km (34.77 mi) south of the Equator.[69] The island is surrounded by a coral reef, which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles.[4] The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a seaport, although channels in the reef allow small boats access to the island.[70] A fertile coastal strip 150 to 300 m (490 to 980 ft) wide lies inland from the beach.[4]\n\n\nCoral cliffs surround Nauru's central plateau. The highest point of the plateau, called the Command Ridge, is 71 m (233 ft) above sea level.[71]\n\n\nThe only fertile areas on Nauru are on the narrow coastal belt, where coconut palms flourish. The land around Buada Lagoon supports bananas, pineapples, vegetables, pandanus trees, and indigenous hardwoods, such as the tamanu tree.[4]\n\n\nNauru was one of three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean, along with Banaba (Ocean Island), in Kiribati, and Makatea, in French Polynesia. The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost entirely depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to 15 m (49 ft) high. Mining has stripped and devastated about 80 per cent of Nauru's land area, leaving it uninhabitable[67] and has also affected the surrounding exclusive economic zone; 40 per cent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff.[4][72]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nNauru's climate is hot and very humid year-round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean. Nauru is hit by monsoon rains between November and February. Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, with several significant recorded droughts.[20][73] The temperature on Nauru ranges between 30 and 35 °C (86 and 95 °F) during the day and is quite stable at around 25 °C (77 °F) at night.[74]\n\n\nStreams and rivers do not exist in Nauru. Water is gathered from roof catchment systems. Water is brought to Nauru as ballast on ships returning for loads of phosphate.[75]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Yaren District, Nauru\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 34(93)\n | 37(99)\n | 35(95)\n | 35(95)\n | 32(90)\n | 32(90)\n | 35(95)\n | 33(91)\n | 35(95)\n | 34(93)\n | 36(97)\n | 35(95)\n | 37(99)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 31(88)\n | 31(88)\n | 31(88)\n | 30(87)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 280(11.0)\n | 250(9.8)\n | 190(7.5)\n | 190(7.5)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 110(4.3)\n | 150(5.9)\n | 130(5.1)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 100(3.9)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 280(11.0)\n | 2,080(81.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation days\n | 16\n | 14\n | 13\n | 11\n | 9\n | 9\n | 12\n | 14\n | 11\n | 10\n | 13\n | 15\n | 152\n |\n| Source: Weatherbase |\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Nauru\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eastern Micronesia tropical moist forests and List of mammals of Nauru\n\nFauna is sparse on the island because of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphate mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to the destruction of their habitat.[76] There are about 60 recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have seriously disturbed the native vegetation.[20]\n\n\nThere are no native land mammals, but there are native insects, land crabs, and birds, including the endemic Nauru reed warbler. The Polynesian rat, cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships.[77] The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island; also popular are scuba diving and snorkelling.[78]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Nauru and Elections in Nauru\n\nFurther information: Law of Nauru, List of political parties in Nauru, and Crime in Nauru\n\n![](image)Parliament of Nauru\nThe president of Nauru is David Adeang, who heads a 19-member unicameral parliament. The country is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Asian Development Bank. Nauru also participates in the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. Recently Nauru became a member country of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The Republic of Nauru became the 189th member of the International Monetary Fund in April 2016.\n\n\nNauru is a republic with a parliamentary system of government.[65] The president is both head of state and head of government and is dependent on parliamentary confidence to remain president. All 19 parliament seats are elected every three years.[79] The parliament elects the president from its members, and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members.[80] As a result of a referendum in 2021, naturalised citizens and their descendants are barred from becoming parliamentarians.\n\n\nNauru does not have any formal structure for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19 members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed based on extended family ties rather than party affiliation.[81]\n\n\nFrom 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local government system known as the Nauru Island Council (NIC).[82] It was a successor to the Nauru Local Government Council, established in 1951.[83] This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services. The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government.[82] Land tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, which is owned by individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.[20]\n\n\nNauru's Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice, is paramount on constitutional issues. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions. Historically, Appellate Court rulings could be appealed to the High Court of Australia,[84][85] though this happened only rarely and the Australian court's appellate jurisdiction ended entirely on 12 March 2018 after the Government of Nauru unilaterally ended the arrangement.[86][87][88] Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.[4]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Nauru\n\nFollowing independence in 1968, Nauru joined the Commonwealth of Nations as a Special Member; it became a full member in 1999.[89] The country was admitted to the Asian Development Bank in 1991 and the United Nations in 1999.[90] Nauru is a member of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, the Pacific Community, and the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission.[91] In February 2021, Nauru announced it would be formally withdrawing from the Pacific Islands Forum in a joint statement with Marshall Islands, Kiribati, and the Federated States of Micronesia after a dispute regarding Henry Puna's election as the Forum's secretary-general.[92][93]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nauruan police cadets undergoing training. Nauru has no armed forces, though there is a small police force under civilian control.\nNauru has no armed forces, though there is a small police force under civilian control.[3] Australia is responsible for Nauru's defence under an informal agreement between the two countries.[3] The September 2005 memorandum of understanding between Australia and Nauru provides the latter with financial aid and technical assistance, including a Secretary of Finance to prepare the budget, and advisers on health and education. This aid is in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed.[94] Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency.[4]\n\n\nNauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both Taiwan (officially the Republic of China or ROC) and mainland China (officially the People's Republic of China or PRC) by changing its recognition from one to the other under the One-China policy. On 21 July 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC, accepting US$130 million from the PRC for this action[95] (US$211 million in 2023[96]). In response, the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later. Nauru later re-established links with the ROC on 14 May 2005,[97] and diplomatic ties with the PRC were officially severed on 31 May 2005.[98]\n\n\nIn 2008, Nauru recognised Kosovo as an independent country, and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country, after Russia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to recognise Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia. Russia was reported to be giving Nauru US$50 million in humanitarian aid as a result of this recognition[95] ($69.5 million in 2023[96]). On 15 July 2008, the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme, financed with US$9 million of development aid received from Russia ($12.5 million in 2023[96]). The Nauru government claimed this aid is not related to its recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[99]\n\n\nA significant portion of Nauru's income has been in the form of aid from Australia. In 2001, the MV *Tampa*, a Norwegian ship that had rescued 438 refugees from a stranded 20-metre-long boat, was seeking to dock in Australia. In what became known as the *Tampa* affair, the ship was refused entry and boarded by Australian troops. The refugees were eventually loaded onto Royal Australian Navy vessel HMAS *Manoora* and taken to Nauru to be held in detention facilities which later became part of the Howard government's Pacific Solution. Nauru operated two detention centres known as State House and Topside for these refugees in exchange for Australian aid.[100] By November 2005, only two refugees, Mohammed Sagar and Muhammad Faisal remained on Nauru from those first sent there in 2001,[101] with Sagar finally resettling in early 2007. The Australian government sent further groups of asylum-seekers to Nauru in late 2006 and early 2007.[102] The refugee centre was closed in 2008,[4] but, following the Australian government's re-adoption of the Pacific Solution in August 2012, it has re-opened it.[103] The US Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program operates a climate-monitoring facility on the island.[104]\n\n\nIn March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of Nauru and some other Pacific nations raising human rights violations in Western New Guinea, which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963,[105] and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report.[106][107] Indonesia rejected the allegations.[107] More than 100,000 Papuans have died during a 50-year Papua conflict.[108]\n\n\nAmnesty International has since described the conditions of the refugees of war living in Nauru as a \"horror\",[109][110] with reports of children as young as eight attempting suicide and engaging in acts of self-harm.[111] In 2018, the situation gained attention as a \"mental health crisis\", with an estimated thirty children suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome, also known as resignation syndrome.[111][112]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of settlements in Nauru\n\n![](image)Map of Nauru showing its districts\nNauru is divided into fourteen administrative districts, which are grouped into eight electoral constituencies and are further divided into villages.[4][3] The most populous district is Denigomodu, with 1,804 residents, of which 1,497 reside in an RONPhos settlement called \"Location\". The following table shows population by district according to the 2011 census.[113]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| No. | District | Formername | Area(ha) | Population(2011) | No. ofvillages | Density(persons/ha)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Aiwo | Aiue | 110 | 1,220 | 8 | 11.1\n |\n| 2 | Anabar | Anebwor | 150 | 452 | 15 | 3.0\n |\n| 3 | Anetan | Añetañ | 100 | 587 | 12 | 5.9\n |\n| 4 | Anibare | Anybody | 310 | 226 | 17 | 0.7\n |\n| 5 | Baitsi | Beidi, Baiti | 120 | 513 | 15 | 4.3\n |\n| 6 | Boe | Boi | 50 | 851 | 4 | 17.0\n |\n| 7 | Buada | Arenibok | 260 | 739 | 14 | 2.8\n |\n| 8 | Denigomodu | Denikomotu | 118 | 1,804 | 17 | 15.3\n |\n| 9 | Ewa | Eoa | 120 | 446 | 12 | 3.7\n |\n| 10 | Ijuw | Ijub | 110 | 178 | 13 | 1.6\n |\n| 11 | Meneng | Meneñ | 310 | 1,380 | 18 | 4.5\n |\n| 12 | Nibok | Ennibeck | 160 | 484 | 11 | 3.0\n |\n| 13 | Uaboe | Ueboi | 80 | 318 | 6 | 3.0\n |\n| 14 | Yaren | Moqua | 150 | 747 | 7 | 4.0\n |\n| – | **Nauru** | Naoero | 2,120 | 10,084 | 169 | 4.8\n |\n\n |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Nauru and Telecommunications in Nauru\n\n![](image)A satellite image of Nauru, 2002\nBefore a resurgence in the 2010s, the Nauruan economy was strongest in the 1970s, with GDP peaking in 1981.[114][115] This trend came from phosphate mining, which accounted for a majority of its economic output. Mining declined starting in the early 1980s.[116]: 5 There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.[4][117] Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, formerly known as the Nauru Phosphate Corporation.[4] The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The trust manages long-term investments, which were intended to support the citizens after the phosphate reserves were exhausted.[118]\n\n\nBecause of mismanagement, the trust's fixed and current assets were reduced considerably and may never fully recover. The failed investments included financing *Leonardo the Musical* in 1993.[119] The Mercure Hotel in Sydney[120] and Nauru House in Melbourne were sold in 2004 to finance debts and Air Nauru's only Boeing 737 was repossessed in December 2005. Normal air service resumed after the aircraft was replaced with a Boeing 737-300 airliner in June 2006.[121] In 2005, the corporation sold its remaining real estate in Melbourne, the vacant Savoy Tavern site, for $7.5 million[122] (US$11.2 million in 2023[96]).\n\n\nThe value of the trust is estimated to have shrunk from A$1.3 billion in 1991 to A$138 million in 2002 (A$2.79 billion to A$229 million in 2022 dollars[61]).[123] Nauru currently lacks money to perform many of the basic functions of government; for example, the National Bank of Nauru is insolvent. The CIA World Factbook estimated a GDP per capita of US$5,000 in 2005.[3] The Asian Development Bank 2007 economic report on Nauru estimated GDP per capita at US$2,400 to US$2,715.[116]\n\n\nThere are no personal taxes in Nauru. The unemployment rate is estimated to be 23 per cent and the government employs 95 per cent of those who have jobs.[3][124] The Asian Development Bank notes that, although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, in the absence of an alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance.[123] Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)Limestone pinnacles remain after phosphate mining at the site of one of Nauru's secondary mines\nIn the 1990s, Nauru became a tax haven and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee.[126] The inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) identified Nauru as one of 15 \"non-cooperative\" countries in its fight against money laundering. During the 1990s, it was possible to establish a licensed bank in Nauru for only US$25,000[126] (US$42,040 in 2023[96]) with no other requirements. Under pressure from FATF, Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003, after which foreign hot money left the country. In October 2005, after satisfactory results from the legislation and its enforcement, FATF lifted the non-cooperative designation.[127]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, the Nauru detention centre provided a significant source of income for the country. The Nauruan authorities reacted with concern to its closure by Australia.[128] In February 2008, the Foreign Affairs minister, Kieren Keke, stated that the closure would result in 100 Nauruans losing their jobs, and would affect 10 per cent of the island's population directly or indirectly: \"We have got a huge number of families that are suddenly going to be without any income. We are looking at ways we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited. Literally we have got a major unemployment crisis in front of us.\"[129] The detention centre was re-opened in August 2012.[103]\n\n\nIn July 2017 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) upgraded its rating of Nauru's standards of tax transparency. Previously Nauru had been listed alongside fourteen other countries that had failed to show that they could comply with international tax transparency standards and regulations. The OECD subsequently put Nauru through a fast-tracked compliance process and the country was given a \"largely compliant\" rating.[130]\n\n\nThe Nauru 2017–2018 budget, delivered by Minister of Finance David Adeang, forecast A$128.7 million in revenues and A$128.6 million in expenditures and projected modest economic growth for the nation over the next two years.[131] In 2018 the Nauru government partnered with the deep sea mining company DeepGreen, now Nauru Ocean Resources Inc (NORI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canadian The Metals Company.[132] They planned to harvest manganese nodules whose minerals and metals can be used in the development of sustainable energy technology.[133][134][135]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Nauru\n\n![Demographic pyramid of Nauru, 2015](image)\nNauru had 12,511 residents as of July 2021.[6][7] The population was previously larger, but in 2006 the island saw 1,500 people leave during a repatriation of immigrant workers from Kiribati and Tuvalu. The repatriation was motivated by significant layoffs in phosphate mining.[116]\n\n\nNauru is one of the most densely populated Westernized countries in the South Pacific.[136]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFifty-eight per cent of people in Nauru are ethnically Nauruan, 26 per cent are other Pacific Islander, 8 per cent are European, and 8 per cent are Han Chinese.[3]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauruan language\n\nThe official languages of Nauru are Nauruan and English. Nauruan[1] is a distinct Micronesian language, which is spoken by 96 per cent of ethnic Nauruans at home.[116] English is widely spoken and is the language of government and commerce.[3][4]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Religion in Nauru\n\n![](image)Church in Nauru\nThe main religion practised on the island is Christianity (the main denominations are Nauru Congregational Church 35.71%, Roman Catholic 32.96%, Assemblies of God 12.98%, and Baptist 1.48%).[4] The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. The government has restricted the religious practices of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Jehovah's Witnesses, most of whom are foreign workers employed by the government-owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation.[137] The Catholics are pastorally served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarawa and Nauru, with see at Tarawa in Kiribati.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of Nauru, Music of Nauru, and Nauruan cuisine\n\nAngam Day, held on 26 October, celebrates the recovery of the Nauruan population after the two world wars and the 1920 influenza epidemic.[138] Colonial and contemporary Western influence has largely displaced the indigenous culture.[139] Few older customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.[140]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mass media in Nauru\n\nThere are no daily news publications on Nauru, although there is one fortnightly publication, *Mwinen Ko*. There is a state-owned television station, Nauru Television (NTV), which broadcasts programs from New Zealand and Australia, and a state-owned non-commercial radio station, Radio Nauru, which carries programs from Radio Australia and the BBC.[141]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Soccer in Nauru\n\n![](image)Australian rules football, played at Linkbelt Oval\nAustralian rules football is the most popular sport in Nauru; it and weightlifting are considered the country's national sports. There is an Australian rules football league with eight teams.[142] The Nauruan national team for Australian rules football are the Chiefs. Other sports popular in Nauru include volleyball, netball, fishing, weightlifting and tennis. Nauru participates in the Commonwealth Games and has participated in the Summer Olympic Games in weightlifting and judo.[143]\n\n\nNauru's national basketball team competed at the 1969 Pacific Games, where it defeated Solomon Islands and Fiji.\n\n\nThe Nauru national rugby sevens team made its international debut at the 2015 Pacific Games.[144]\n\n\nNauru competed in the 2015 Oceania Sevens Championship in New Zealand.\n\n\n\n### Holidays[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in Nauru\n\nIndependence Day is celebrated on 31 January.[145]\n\n\n\n## Public services[edit]\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in Nauru\n\nLiteracy on Nauru is 96 per cent. Education is compulsory for children from six to sixteen years old, and two more non-compulsory years are offered (years 11 and 12).[146] The island has three primary schools and two secondary schools. The secondary schools are Nauru Secondary School and Nauru College.[147] There is a campus of the University of the South Pacific on Nauru. Before this campus was built in 1987, students would study either by distance or abroad.[148] Since 2011, the University of New England, Australia has established a presence on the island with around 30 Nauruan teachers studying for an associate degree in education. These students will continue on to the degree to complete their studies.[149] This project is led by Associate Professor Pep Serow and funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\n\nThe previous community public library was destroyed in a fire. As of 1999[update] a new one had not yet been built, and no bookmobile services were available as of that year. Sites with libraries include the University of the South Pacific campus, Nauru Secondary, Kayser College, and Aiwo Primary.[150] The Nauru Community Library is in the new University of the South Pacific Nauru Campus building, which was officially opened in May 2018.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Nauru\n\nFurther information: Obesity in Nauru\n\n![](image)Nauruan residents walking around Nauru International Airport. Nauruans are amongst the most obese people in the world.[151]Nauru has one of the highest child mortality rates in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) region at 2.9% in 2020, according to a UNICEF study.[152]\n\n\nLife expectancy in Nauru in 2009 was 60.6 years for males and 68.0 years for females.[153]\n\n\nBy measure of mean body mass index (BMI), Nauruans are the most overweight people in the world;[151] 97 per cent of men and 93 per cent of women are overweight or obese.[151] In 2012, the obesity rate was 71.7 per cent.[154] Obesity on the Pacific islands is common.\n\n\nNauru has the world's highest level of type 2 diabetes, with more than 40 per cent of the population affected.[155] Other significant dietary-related problems on Nauru include kidney disease and heart disease.[153]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of Nauru International AirportMain article: Transport in Nauru\n\nThe island is solely served by Nauru International Airport. Passenger service is provided by Nauru Airlines. Flights operate four days a week to Brisbane,[156] with limited service to other destinations including Nadi[157] and Bonriki.[158]\n\n\nNauru is accessible by sea via the Nauru International Port. The modernization and expansion project of the former Aiwo Boat Harbor was expected to be completed in 2021 but has been delayed due to technical and logistics issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[159][160]\n\n\n\n## Resources[edit]\n\n\n### Plants and Farming[edit]\n\n\nHistorically, Indigenous Nauruans kept household gardens that provided much of the food that they needed through subsistence farming, with the most common food plants including coconuts, breadfruit, bananas, pandanus, papaya, and guavas.[161] Because of the large immigrant population that would work in the phosphate mines, there were many types of fruits and vegetables grown that were staples in those countries as well.[161] The soil in Nauru was very rich on what citizens call the \"Topside,\" which is the raised phosphate plateau where the phosphate is mined from, and it was extremely fertile and great for growing crops.[161] However, the area where most Nauruans live now, on the coastal ring on the island that hasn't been mined, the soil quality is among the poorest in the world, as it is shallow, alkaline, and has the coarse texture of the coral that surrounds it.[162][161][163] In 2011, just 13% of households maintained a garden or were involved in growing crops.[164] Most of the soil that was on Nauru is now gone because of phosphate-mining activities, leaving people to import the soil that they need.[162][161] Ethnobotanical studies have indicated that the reduction in the types of plants that can be grown due to phosphate mining has significantly impacted the connection that Indigenous Nauruans feel to the land, as plants are a large part of their cultural identity and have many uses in their lives, with each plant having an average of 7 uses within Pacific Island cultures.[161]\n\n\n\n### Food[edit]\n\n\nFor Nauru residents today, all food must also be imported because of the loss of 90% of tenable land due to phosphate mining, leaving people with a diet of mainly processed foods, such as rice and sugar.[165] Though residents are trying to salvage the soil that they can, some researchers speculate that there will be no regeneration of soils even after the mining ceases.[162] The country's dependence on processed and imported foods along with \"cultural, historical and social factors\" have greatly affected the health of its citizens.[166] Despite having all food imported, the Household and Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) conducted for the year of 2012–2013 found that Nauruans have a food poverty incidence rate of 0, based on the Food Poverty Line (FPL) which \"includes a daily intake of 2,100 calories per adult per day.\"[166]\n\n\n\n### Non-food Basic Needs[edit]\n\n\nWhile the HIES found that Nauru is doing well in terms of food poverty, 24% of the population and 16.8% of households are below the basic needs (clothing, shelter, education, transport, communication, water, sanitation and health services) poverty line.[166] This is the worst poverty index of all Pacific nations.[166] In 2017, half of Nauruans were living on $9,000 a year. Water resources are extremely limited, with the island supplying enough for 32 liters of freshwater per person per day despite the WHO's recommendation of 50 liters per person per day.[167] Much of the groundwater has been contaminated by mining runoff, toilets, and dumping of other commercial and household wastes, causing Nauruans to rely on imported water, the price of which can vary as it is closely tied to fuel prices for its delivery, and rainfall storage.[167][152] Access to sanitation facilities is restricted with just 66% of residents having access to reliable toilets, and open defecation is still practiced by 3% of the population.[152] Schools are frequently forced to close because they do not have reliable toilets or drinking water for students to use.[152] There is a long-standing truancy problem and accessibility of education for refugee and asylum-seeking children, as well as for disabled children remain areas of concern for Nauru's education sector.[152]\n\n\n\n## Effects of mining on Nauruans and their land[edit]\n\n\n### Land and people[edit]\n\n\nSince the early 1900s, Nauru has been mined for phosphorus by many countries, resulting in devastating destruction of the land. As noted earlier, 80% of the island is unusable due to phosphorus mining, which has left exposed coral pinnacles that leave the land useless and uninhabitable.[167] The degradation of the land has resulted in a \"lower resilience of the natural environment,\" causing many negative health and environmental effects, like poor water quality, greater erosion rates, poor precipitation, higher droughts, and greater CO2 emissions.[167] The damage done through mining extends further by ocean acidification and coastal erosion and has threatened terrestrial and marine biodiversity.[167] The people of Nauru also face continued negative health effects from the mining in the form of phosphate dust pollution and cadmium pollution, tainting the water and air quality.[167] As a result, the rate of care-seeking for children under 5 years of age with ARI is 69% according to UNICEF data.[164] Due to the extent of the mining, there is not much that can be done now to alleviate the agricultural problems that Nauruans face besides monetary reparations, which Nauru pursued from the Australian Government in 1989 through the International Court of Justice in the Hague.[163][168] The lawsuit was settled in 1993 in an out-of-court payout of $120 million AUD over 20 years.[168]\n\n\nPhosphate mining has removed most of the vegetation and tree coverage that Nauru had, leaving the land and the people vulnerable to intense heat on an island so close to the Equator.[161] The effects of the vegetation removal has been most felt by refugees in the Nauru detention center, which is in the very center of the island where the majority of the mining is done.[169] Along the coast, where most Nauruans are forced to live now due to the land reduction caused by mining, the coastal plants that remain are vital for the \"provision of shade and animal and plant habitats; protection from wind, erosion, flood, and salt water incursion; land stabilization; protection from the desiccating effects of salt spray; and soil improvement and mulching,\" especially as the coast is expected to continue eroding with the increasing effects of climate change.[161]\n\n\n\n### Social effects[edit]\n\n\nBecause phosphate mining, and now deep-sea mining, has been going on for so long, it is hard to parse out exactly how it has affected the Nauruan people. Researchers have offered that the Nauruan people likely have a loss of their sense of place and culture, as they did not have full control of their land until 1968.[170][171] There has also been a documented loss of Nauruan traditions like subsistence farming as well as the violations of their rights to their own land and the continued human rights violations that continue at the Nauru detention center.[171] The Nauruan people face extremely high rates of obesity, alcoholism, prostitution, poorer mental health rates, and myriad other health issues that stem from these problems.[152][171] A study done in 2014 by The Nauru Family Health and Support Study implemented by Nauru Department of Home Affairs and DFAT and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) have shown the alarming prevalence of violence in romantic relationships on the island, with 48.1% of ever-partnered women who participated saying that have experienced physical or sexual violence at least once.[166] A quarter of women in the same study have experienced violence in at least one pregnancy, and 9.9% of women had experienced some form of violence in the past 12 months.[166] In another study surveying sexual health, 21% of a portion of the population tested positive for chlamydia.[164] In the same survey, 30% of school children aged 13–15 reported having attempted suicide, and 24% of children under the age of five are stunted.[164] Though Nauruans are currently still searching for a way to stay on the island and live viable lives, some speculate that the only way for them to do so is to continue mining the phosphorus that is left (30 years or so).[169]\n\n\n\n## Asylum seeker detention centre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauru Regional Processing Centre\n\nThe Nauru Regional Processing Centre is an offshore Australian immigration detention facility established in 2001 and run by the Government of Nauru. The use of immigration detention facilities is part of a policy of mandatory detention in Australia. The detainees at the centre have suffered serious human rights abuses and there are widespread reports of suicide and psychiatric illness. In 2013, a veteran nurse described the detention centre as \"like a concentration camp\".[172] The Nauru facility was opened in 2001 as part of the Howard government's Pacific Solution.[173] As of February 2022[update] there were 115 held by Australia on Nauru, costing the Australian government more than $4m per year per asylum seeker (nearly $12,000 per day).[174]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Oceania portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* Index of Nauru-related articles\n* Outline of Nauru\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Nauru does not have an official capital but Yaren is the seat of parliament.[1]\n2. **^** English is widely spoken by the majority of the population and it is commonly used in government, legislation and commerce alongside Nauruan.

Its nearest neighbour is Banaba of Kiribati, about 300 km (190 mi) to the east.[13] It lies northwest of Tuvalu, 1,300 km (810 mi) northeast of Solomon Islands,[14] east-northeast of Papua New Guinea, southeast of the Federated States of Micronesia and south of the Marshall Islands. With an area of only 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi), Nauru is the third-smallest country in the world behind Vatican City and Monaco, making it the smallest republic and island nation. Its population of about 10,800 is the world's second-smallest (not including colonies or overseas territories) after Vatican City.\nSettled by people from Micronesia circa 1000 BCE, Nauru was annexed and claimed as a colony by the German Empire in the late 19th century. After World War I, Nauru became a League of Nations mandate administered by Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. During World War II, Nauru was occupied by Japanese troops, and was bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into United Nations trusteeship. Nauru gained its independence in 1968.\n\n\nNauru is a phosphate-rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy strip mining operations for over a century. However, this has seriously harmed the country's environment, causing the island nation to suffer from what is often referred to as the \"resource curse\". The phosphate was exhausted in the 1990s, and the remaining reserves are not economically viable for extraction.[15] A trust established to manage the island's accumulated mining wealth, set up for the day the reserves would be exhausted, has diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre.[16] At various points since 2001, it has accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional Processing Centre, a controversial offshore Australian immigration detention facility. As a result of heavy dependence on Australia, some sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.[17][18][19] The sovereign state is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Organization of African, Caribbean, and Pacific States.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Nauru and British Western Pacific Territories\n\n![](image)Photo of a Nauruan warrior during the Nauruan Civil War around 1880\nNauru was first settled by Micronesians at least 3,000 years ago, and there is evidence of possible Polynesian influence.[20] Comparatively little is known of Nauruan prehistory,[21] although the island is believed to have had a long period of isolation, which accounts for the distinct language that developed among the inhabitants.[22] There were traditionally 12 clans or tribes on Nauru, which are represented in the twelve-pointed star on the country's flag.[23] Traditionally, Nauruans traced their descent matrilineally. Inhabitants practised aquaculture: they caught juvenile milkfish (known as *Ibija* in Nauruan), acclimatised them to freshwater, and raised them in Buada Lagoon, providing a reliable food source. The other locally grown components of their diet included coconuts and pandanus fruit.[24][25] The name \"Nauru\" may derive from the Nauruan word **Anáoero**, which means 'I go to the beach.'[26]\n\n\nIn 1798, the British sea captain John Fearn, on his trading ship *Hunter* (300 tons), became the first Westerner to report sighting Nauru, calling it \"Pleasant Island\", because of its attractive appearance.[27][28] From at least 1826, Nauruans had regular contact with Europeans on whaling and trading ships who called for provisions and fresh drinking water.[29] The last whaler to call during the age of sail visited in 1904.[30]\n\n\nAround this time, deserters from European ships began to live on the island. The islanders traded food for alcoholic palm wine and firearms.[31] The firearms were used during the 10-year Nauruan Civil War that began in 1878.[32]\n\n\nAfter an agreement with Great Britain, Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's Marshall Islands Protectorate for administrative purposes.[33][34] The arrival of the Germans ended the civil war, and kings were established as rulers of the island. The most widely known of these was King Auweyida. Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands arrived in 1888.[35][36] The German settlers called the island \"Nawodo\" or \"Onawero\".[37] The Germans ruled Nauru for almost three decades. Robert Rasch, a German trader who married a Nauruan woman, was the first administrator, appointed in 1890.[35]\n\n\nPhosphate was discovered on Nauru in 1900 by the prospector Albert Fuller Ellis.[34][28] The Pacific Phosphate Company began to exploit the reserves in 1906 by agreement with Germany, exporting its first shipment in 1907.[27][38] In 1914, following the outbreak of World War I, Nauru was captured by Australian troops. In 1919, it was agreed by the Allied and Associated Powers that His Britannic Majesty should be the administering authority under a League of Nations mandate. The Nauru Island Agreement forged in 1919 between the governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand provided for the administration of the island and extraction of the phosphate deposits by an intergovernmental British Phosphate Commission (BPC).[33][39] The terms of the League of Nations mandate were drawn up in 1920.[33][40]\n\n\nThe island experienced an influenza epidemic and ongoing colonial strife through the early 20th century, with a mortality rate of 18 per cent among native Nauruans.[41] In 1923, the League of Nations gave Australia a trustee mandate over Nauru, with the United Kingdom and New Zealand as co-trustees.[42] On 6 and 7 December 1940, the German auxiliary cruisers *Komet* and *Orion* sank five supply ships in the vicinity of Nauru. *Komet* then shelled Nauru's phosphate mining areas, oil storage depots, and the shiploading cantilever.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Army Air Forces bombing the Japanese airstrip on Nauru, 1943.[46]\nJapanese troops occupied Nauru on 25 August 1942.[44] The Japanese built 2 airfields which were bombed for the first time on 25 March 1943, preventing food supplies from being flown to Nauru.[47] The Japanese deported 1,200 Nauruans to work as labourers in the Chuuk Islands,[46] which was also occupied by Japan. As part of the Allied strategy of island hopping from the Pacific islands towards the main islands of Japan, Nauru was bypassed and left to \"wither on the vine\". Nauru was finally taken back from the Japanese on 13 September 1945, when commander Hisayaki Soeda surrendered the island to the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy.[48] The surrender was accepted by Brigadier J. R. Stevenson, who represented Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, the commander of the First Australian Army, aboard the warship HMAS *Diamantina*.[49][50][51] Arrangements were made to repatriate from Chuuk the 745 Nauruans who survived Japanese captivity there.[52] They were returned to Nauru by the BPC ship *Trienza* in January 1946.[53]\n\n\nIn 1947, a trusteeship was established by the United Nations, with Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom as trustees.[54][55] Under those arrangements, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand were a joint administering authority. The Nauru Island Agreement provided for the first administrator to be appointed by Australia for five years, leaving subsequent appointments to be decided by the three governments.[33][40] However, in practice, administrative power was exercised by Australia alone.[33][40]\n\n\nThe 1948 Nauru riots occurred when Chinese guano mining workers went on strike over pay and conditions. The Australian administration imposed a state of emergency with Native Police and armed volunteers of locals and Australian officials being mobilised. This force, using sub-machine guns and other firearms, opened fire on the Chinese workers killing two and wounding sixteen. Around 50 of the workers were arrested and two of these were bayoneted to death while in custody. The trooper who bayoneted the prisoners was charged but later acquitted on grounds that the wounds were \"accidentally received.\"[56][57] The governments of the Soviet Union and China made official complaints against Australia at the United Nations over this incident.[58]\n\n\nIn 1964, it was proposed to relocate the population of Nauru to Curtis Island off the coast of Queensland, Australia. By that time, Nauru had been extensively mined for phosphate by companies from Australia, Britain, and New Zealand, damaging the landscape so much that it was thought the island would be uninhabitable by the 1990s. Rehabilitating the island was seen as financially impossible. In 1962, Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies said that the three countries involved in the mining had an obligation to provide a solution for the Nauruan people, and proposed finding a new island for them. In 1963, the Australian Government proposed to acquire all the land on Curtis Island (which was considerably larger than Nauru) and then offer the Nauruans freehold title over the island and that the Nauruans would become Australian citizens.[59][60] The cost of resettling the Nauruans on Curtis Island was estimated to be £10 million (A$324 million in 2022[61]), which included housing and infrastructure and the establishment of pastoral, agricultural, and fishing industries.[62] However, the Nauruan people did not wish to become Australian citizens and wanted to be given sovereignty over Curtis Island to establish themselves as an independent nation, which Australia would not agree to.[63] Nauru rejected the proposal to move to Curtis Island, instead choosing to become an independent nation operating their mines in Nauru.[64]\n\n\nNauru became self-governing in January 1966, and following a two-year constitutional convention, it became independent on 31 January 1968 under founding president Hammer DeRoburt.[65] In 1967, the people of Nauru purchased the assets of the British Phosphate Commissioners, and in June 1970, control passed to the locally owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation (NPC).[38] Income from the mines made Nauruans among the richest people in the world.[66][67] In 1989, Nauru took legal action against Australia in the International Court of Justice over Australia's administration of the island, in particular, Australia's failure to remedy the environmental damage caused by phosphate mining. *Certain Phosphate Lands: Nauru v. Australia* led to an out-of-court settlement to rehabilitate the mined-out areas of Nauru.[54][68]\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a state of emergency was declared in Nauru on 17 March 2020. The declaration to minimize the outbreak was signed by President Lionel Aingimea during a period of 30 days.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Nauru and Geology of Nauru\n\n![](image)Map of Nauru\nNauru is a 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi),[3] oval-shaped island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, 55.95 km (34.77 mi) south of the Equator.[69] The island is surrounded by a coral reef, which is exposed at low tide and dotted with pinnacles.[4] The presence of the reef has prevented the establishment of a seaport, although channels in the reef allow small boats access to the island.[70] A fertile coastal strip 150 to 300 m (490 to 980 ft) wide lies inland from the beach.[4]\n\n\nCoral cliffs surround Nauru's central plateau. The highest point of the plateau, called the Command Ridge, is 71 m (233 ft) above sea level.[71]\n\n\nThe only fertile areas on Nauru are on the narrow coastal belt, where coconut palms flourish. The land around Buada Lagoon supports bananas, pineapples, vegetables, pandanus trees, and indigenous hardwoods, such as the tamanu tree.[4]\n\n\nNauru was one of three great phosphate rock islands in the Pacific Ocean, along with Banaba (Ocean Island), in Kiribati, and Makatea, in French Polynesia. The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost entirely depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to 15 m (49 ft) high. Mining has stripped and devastated about 80 per cent of Nauru's land area, leaving it uninhabitable[67] and has also affected the surrounding exclusive economic zone; 40 per cent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff.[4][72]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nNauru's climate is hot and very humid year-round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean. Nauru is hit by monsoon rains between November and February. Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, with several significant recorded droughts.[20][73] The temperature on Nauru ranges between 30 and 35 °C (86 and 95 °F) during the day and is quite stable at around 25 °C (77 °F) at night.[74]\n\n\nStreams and rivers do not exist in Nauru. Water is gathered from roof catchment systems. Water is brought to Nauru as ballast on ships returning for loads of phosphate.[75]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Yaren District, Nauru\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °C (°F)\n | 34(93)\n | 37(99)\n | 35(95)\n | 35(95)\n | 32(90)\n | 32(90)\n | 35(95)\n | 33(91)\n | 35(95)\n | 34(93)\n | 36(97)\n | 35(95)\n | 37(99)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °C (°F)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 30(86)\n | 31(88)\n | 31(88)\n | 31(88)\n | 30(87)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °C (°F)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n | 25(77)\n |\n| Record low °C (°F)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 21(70)\n | 20(68)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 280(11.0)\n | 250(9.8)\n | 190(7.5)\n | 190(7.5)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 110(4.3)\n | 150(5.9)\n | 130(5.1)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 100(3.9)\n | 120(4.7)\n | 280(11.0)\n | 2,080(81.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation days\n | 16\n | 14\n | 13\n | 11\n | 9\n | 9\n | 12\n | 14\n | 11\n | 10\n | 13\n | 15\n | 152\n |\n| Source: Weatherbase |\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Nauru\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eastern Micronesia tropical moist forests and List of mammals of Nauru\n\nFauna is sparse on the island because of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphate mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to the destruction of their habitat.[76] There are about 60 recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have seriously disturbed the native vegetation.[20]\n\n\nThere are no native land mammals, but there are native insects, land crabs, and birds, including the endemic Nauru reed warbler. The Polynesian rat, cats, dogs, pigs, and chickens have been introduced to Nauru from ships.[77] The diversity of the reef marine life makes fishing a popular activity for tourists on the island; also popular are scuba diving and snorkelling.[78]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Nauru and Elections in Nauru\n\nFurther information: Law of Nauru, List of political parties in Nauru, and Crime in Nauru\n\n![](image)Parliament of Nauru\nThe president of Nauru is David Adeang, who heads a 19-member unicameral parliament. The country is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Asian Development Bank. Nauru also participates in the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. Recently Nauru became a member country of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). The Republic of Nauru became the 189th member of the International Monetary Fund in April 2016.\n\n\nNauru is a republic with a parliamentary system of government.[65] The president is both head of state and head of government and is dependent on parliamentary confidence to remain president. All 19 parliament seats are elected every three years.[79] The parliament elects the president from its members, and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members.[80] As a result of a referendum in 2021, naturalised citizens and their descendants are barred from becoming parliamentarians.\n\n\nNauru does not have any formal structure for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19 members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed based on extended family ties rather than party affiliation.[81]\n\n\nFrom 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local government system known as the Nauru Island Council (NIC).[82] It was a successor to the Nauru Local Government Council, established in 1951.[83] This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services. The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government.[82] Land tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, which is owned by individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.[20]\n\n\nNauru's Supreme Court, headed by the Chief Justice, is paramount on constitutional issues. Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions. Historically, Appellate Court rulings could be appealed to the High Court of Australia,[84][85] though this happened only rarely and the Australian court's appellate jurisdiction ended entirely on 12 March 2018 after the Government of Nauru unilaterally ended the arrangement.[86][87][88] Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.[4]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Nauru\n\nFollowing independence in 1968, Nauru joined the Commonwealth of Nations as a Special Member; it became a full member in 1999.[89] The country was admitted to the Asian Development Bank in 1991 and the United Nations in 1999.[90] Nauru is a member of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, the Pacific Community, and the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission.[91] In February 2021, Nauru announced it would be formally withdrawing from the Pacific Islands Forum in a joint statement with Marshall Islands, Kiribati, and the Federated States of Micronesia after a dispute regarding Henry Puna's election as the Forum's secretary-general.[92][93]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nauruan police cadets undergoing training. Nauru has no armed forces, though there is a small police force under civilian control.\nNauru has no armed forces, though there is a small police force under civilian control.[3] Australia is responsible for Nauru's defence under an informal agreement between the two countries.[3] The September 2005 memorandum of understanding between Australia and Nauru provides the latter with financial aid and technical assistance, including a Secretary of Finance to prepare the budget, and advisers on health and education. This aid is in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed.[94] Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency.[4]\n\n\nNauru has used its position as a member of the United Nations to gain financial support from both Taiwan (officially the Republic of China or ROC) and mainland China (officially the People's Republic of China or PRC) by changing its recognition from one to the other under the One-China policy. On 21 July 2002, Nauru signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations with the PRC, accepting US$130 million from the PRC for this action[95] (US$211 million in 2023[96]). In response, the ROC severed diplomatic relations with Nauru two days later. Nauru later re-established links with the ROC on 14 May 2005,[97] and diplomatic ties with the PRC were officially severed on 31 May 2005.[98]\n\n\nIn 2008, Nauru recognised Kosovo as an independent country, and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country, after Russia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to recognise Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia. Russia was reported to be giving Nauru US$50 million in humanitarian aid as a result of this recognition[95] ($69.5 million in 2023[96]). On 15 July 2008, the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme, financed with US$9 million of development aid received from Russia ($12.5 million in 2023[96]). The Nauru government claimed this aid is not related to its recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.[99]\n\n\nA significant portion of Nauru's income has been in the form of aid from Australia. In 2001, the MV *Tampa*, a Norwegian ship that had rescued 438 refugees from a stranded 20-metre-long boat, was seeking to dock in Australia. In what became known as the *Tampa* affair, the ship was refused entry and boarded by Australian troops. The refugees were eventually loaded onto Royal Australian Navy vessel HMAS *Manoora* and taken to Nauru to be held in detention facilities which later became part of the Howard government's Pacific Solution. Nauru operated two detention centres known as State House and Topside for these refugees in exchange for Australian aid.[100] By November 2005, only two refugees, Mohammed Sagar and Muhammad Faisal remained on Nauru from those first sent there in 2001,[101] with Sagar finally resettling in early 2007. The Australian government sent further groups of asylum-seekers to Nauru in late 2006 and early 2007.[102] The refugee centre was closed in 2008,[4] but, following the Australian government's re-adoption of the Pacific Solution in August 2012, it has re-opened it.[103] The US Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program operates a climate-monitoring facility on the island.[104]\n\n\nIn March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council, Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of Nauru and some other Pacific nations raising human rights violations in Western New Guinea, which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963,[105] and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report.[106][107] Indonesia rejected the allegations.[107] More than 100,000 Papuans have died during a 50-year Papua conflict.[108]\n\n\nAmnesty International has since described the conditions of the refugees of war living in Nauru as a \"horror\",[109][110] with reports of children as young as eight attempting suicide and engaging in acts of self-harm.[111] In 2018, the situation gained attention as a \"mental health crisis\", with an estimated thirty children suffering from traumatic withdrawal syndrome, also known as resignation syndrome.[111][112]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of settlements in Nauru\n\n![](image)Map of Nauru showing its districts\nNauru is divided into fourteen administrative districts, which are grouped into eight electoral constituencies and are further divided into villages.[4][3] The most populous district is Denigomodu, with 1,804 residents, of which 1,497 reside in an RONPhos settlement called \"Location\". The following table shows population by district according to the 2011 census.[113]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| No. | District | Formername | Area(ha) | Population(2011) | No. ofvillages | Density(persons/ha)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Aiwo | Aiue | 110 | 1,220 | 8 | 11.1\n |\n| 2 | Anabar | Anebwor | 150 | 452 | 15 | 3.0\n |\n| 3 | Anetan | Añetañ | 100 | 587 | 12 | 5.9\n |\n| 4 | Anibare | Anybody | 310 | 226 | 17 | 0.7\n |\n| 5 | Baitsi | Beidi, Baiti | 120 | 513 | 15 | 4.3\n |\n| 6 | Boe | Boi | 50 | 851 | 4 | 17.0\n |\n| 7 | Buada | Arenibok | 260 | 739 | 14 | 2.8\n |\n| 8 | Denigomodu | Denikomotu | 118 | 1,804 | 17 | 15.3\n |\n| 9 | Ewa | Eoa | 120 | 446 | 12 | 3.7\n |\n| 10 | Ijuw | Ijub | 110 | 178 | 13 | 1.6\n |\n| 11 | Meneng | Meneñ | 310 | 1,380 | 18 | 4.5\n |\n| 12 | Nibok | Ennibeck | 160 | 484 | 11 | 3.0\n |\n| 13 | Uaboe | Ueboi | 80 | 318 | 6 | 3.0\n |\n| 14 | Yaren | Moqua | 150 | 747 | 7 | 4.0\n |\n| – | **Nauru** | Naoero | 2,120 | 10,084 | 169 | 4.8\n |\n\n |\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Nauru and Telecommunications in Nauru\n\n![](image)A satellite image of Nauru, 2002\nBefore a resurgence in the 2010s, the Nauruan economy was strongest in the 1970s, with GDP peaking in 1981.[114][115] This trend came from phosphate mining, which accounted for a majority of its economic output. Mining declined starting in the early 1980s.[116]: 5 There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported.[4][117] Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, formerly known as the Nauru Phosphate Corporation.[4] The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The trust manages long-term investments, which were intended to support the citizens after the phosphate reserves were exhausted.[118]\n\n\nBecause of mismanagement, the trust's fixed and current assets were reduced considerably and may never fully recover. The failed investments included financing *Leonardo the Musical* in 1993.[119] The Mercure Hotel in Sydney[120] and Nauru House in Melbourne were sold in 2004 to finance debts and Air Nauru's only Boeing 737 was repossessed in December 2005. Normal air service resumed after the aircraft was replaced with a Boeing 737-300 airliner in June 2006.[121] In 2005, the corporation sold its remaining real estate in Melbourne, the vacant Savoy Tavern site, for $7.5 million[122] (US$11.2 million in 2023[96]).\n\n\nThe value of the trust is estimated to have shrunk from A$1.3 billion in 1991 to A$138 million in 2002 (A$2.79 billion to A$229 million in 2022 dollars[61]).[123] Nauru currently lacks money to perform many of the basic functions of government; for example, the National Bank of Nauru is insolvent. The CIA World Factbook estimated a GDP per capita of US$5,000 in 2005.[3] The Asian Development Bank 2007 economic report on Nauru estimated GDP per capita at US$2,400 to US$2,715.[116]\n\n\nThere are no personal taxes in Nauru. The unemployment rate is estimated to be 23 per cent and the government employs 95 per cent of those who have jobs.[3][124] The Asian Development Bank notes that, although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, in the absence of an alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance.[123] Tourism is not a major contributor to the economy.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)Limestone pinnacles remain after phosphate mining at the site of one of Nauru's secondary mines\nIn the 1990s, Nauru became a tax haven and offered passports to foreign nationals for a fee.[126] The inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) identified Nauru as one of 15 \"non-cooperative\" countries in its fight against money laundering. During the 1990s, it was possible to establish a licensed bank in Nauru for only US$25,000[126] (US$42,040 in 2023[96]) with no other requirements. Under pressure from FATF, Nauru introduced anti-avoidance legislation in 2003, after which foreign hot money left the country. In October 2005, after satisfactory results from the legislation and its enforcement, FATF lifted the non-cooperative designation.[127]\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007, the Nauru detention centre provided a significant source of income for the country. The Nauruan authorities reacted with concern to its closure by Australia.[128] In February 2008, the Foreign Affairs minister, Kieren Keke, stated that the closure would result in 100 Nauruans losing their jobs, and would affect 10 per cent of the island's population directly or indirectly: \"We have got a huge number of families that are suddenly going to be without any income. We are looking at ways we can try and provide some welfare assistance but our capacity to do that is very limited. Literally we have got a major unemployment crisis in front of us.\"[129] The detention centre was re-opened in August 2012.[103]\n\n\nIn July 2017 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) upgraded its rating of Nauru's standards of tax transparency. Previously Nauru had been listed alongside fourteen other countries that had failed to show that they could comply with international tax transparency standards and regulations. The OECD subsequently put Nauru through a fast-tracked compliance process and the country was given a \"largely compliant\" rating.[130]\n\n\nThe Nauru 2017–2018 budget, delivered by Minister of Finance David Adeang, forecast A$128.7 million in revenues and A$128.6 million in expenditures and projected modest economic growth for the nation over the next two years.[131] In 2018 the Nauru government partnered with the deep sea mining company DeepGreen, now Nauru Ocean Resources Inc (NORI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Canadian The Metals Company.[132] They planned to harvest manganese nodules whose minerals and metals can be used in the development of sustainable energy technology.[133][134][135]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Nauru\n\n![Demographic pyramid of Nauru, 2015](image)\nNauru had 12,511 residents as of July 2021.[6][7] The population was previously larger, but in 2006 the island saw 1,500 people leave during a repatriation of immigrant workers from Kiribati and Tuvalu. The repatriation was motivated by significant layoffs in phosphate mining.[116]\n\n\nNauru is one of the most densely populated Westernized countries in the South Pacific.[136]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFifty-eight per cent of people in Nauru are ethnically Nauruan, 26 per cent are other Pacific Islander, 8 per cent are European, and 8 per cent are Han Chinese.[3]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauruan language\n\nThe official languages of Nauru are Nauruan and English. Nauruan[1] is a distinct Micronesian language, which is spoken by 96 per cent of ethnic Nauruans at home.[116] English is widely spoken and is the language of government and commerce.[3][4]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Religion in Nauru\n\n![](image)Church in Nauru\nThe main religion practised on the island is Christianity (the main denominations are Nauru Congregational Church 35.71%, Roman Catholic 32.96%, Assemblies of God 12.98%, and Baptist 1.48%).[4] The Constitution provides for freedom of religion. The government has restricted the religious practices of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Jehovah's Witnesses, most of whom are foreign workers employed by the government-owned Nauru Phosphate Corporation.[137] The Catholics are pastorally served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarawa and Nauru, with see at Tarawa in Kiribati.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of Nauru, Music of Nauru, and Nauruan cuisine\n\nAngam Day, held on 26 October, celebrates the recovery of the Nauruan population after the two world wars and the 1920 influenza epidemic.[138] Colonial and contemporary Western influence has largely displaced the indigenous culture.[139] Few older customs have been preserved, but some forms of traditional music, arts and crafts, and fishing are still practised.[140]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mass media in Nauru\n\nThere are no daily news publications on Nauru, although there is one fortnightly publication, *Mwinen Ko*. There is a state-owned television station, Nauru Television (NTV), which broadcasts programs from New Zealand and Australia, and a state-owned non-commercial radio station, Radio Nauru, which carries programs from Radio Australia and the BBC.[141]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Soccer in Nauru\n\n![](image)Australian rules football, played at Linkbelt Oval\nAustralian rules football is the most popular sport in Nauru; it and weightlifting are considered the country's national sports. There is an Australian rules football league with eight teams.[142] The Nauruan national team for Australian rules football are the Chiefs. Other sports popular in Nauru include volleyball, netball, fishing, weightlifting and tennis. Nauru participates in the Commonwealth Games and has participated in the Summer Olympic Games in weightlifting and judo.[143]\n\n\nNauru's national basketball team competed at the 1969 Pacific Games, where it defeated Solomon Islands and Fiji.\n\n\nThe Nauru national rugby sevens team made its international debut at the 2015 Pacific Games.[144]\n\n\nNauru competed in the 2015 Oceania Sevens Championship in New Zealand.\n\n\n\n### Holidays[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in Nauru\n\nIndependence Day is celebrated on 31 January.[145]\n\n\n\n## Public services[edit]\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Education in Nauru\n\nLiteracy on Nauru is 96 per cent. Education is compulsory for children from six to sixteen years old, and two more non-compulsory years are offered (years 11 and 12).[146] The island has three primary schools and two secondary schools. The secondary schools are Nauru Secondary School and Nauru College.[147] There is a campus of the University of the South Pacific on Nauru. Before this campus was built in 1987, students would study either by distance or abroad.[148] Since 2011, the University of New England, Australia has established a presence on the island with around 30 Nauruan teachers studying for an associate degree in education. These students will continue on to the degree to complete their studies.[149] This project is led by Associate Professor Pep Serow and funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\n\nThe previous community public library was destroyed in a fire. As of 1999[update] a new one had not yet been built, and no bookmobile services were available as of that year. Sites with libraries include the University of the South Pacific campus, Nauru Secondary, Kayser College, and Aiwo Primary.[150] The Nauru Community Library is in the new University of the South Pacific Nauru Campus building, which was officially opened in May 2018.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Nauru\n\nFurther information: Obesity in Nauru\n\n![](image)Nauruan residents walking around Nauru International Airport. Nauruans are amongst the most obese people in the world.[151]Nauru has one of the highest child mortality rates in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) region at 2.9% in 2020, according to a UNICEF study.[152]\n\n\nLife expectancy in Nauru in 2009 was 60.6 years for males and 68.0 years for females.[153]\n\n\nBy measure of mean body mass index (BMI), Nauruans are the most overweight people in the world;[151] 97 per cent of men and 93 per cent of women are overweight or obese.[151] In 2012, the obesity rate was 71.7 per cent.[154] Obesity on the Pacific islands is common.\n\n\nNauru has the world's highest level of type 2 diabetes, with more than 40 per cent of the population affected.[155] Other significant dietary-related problems on Nauru include kidney disease and heart disease.[153]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of Nauru International AirportMain article: Transport in Nauru\n\nThe island is solely served by Nauru International Airport. Passenger service is provided by Nauru Airlines. Flights operate four days a week to Brisbane,[156] with limited service to other destinations including Nadi[157] and Bonriki.[158]\n\n\nNauru is accessible by sea via the Nauru International Port. The modernization and expansion project of the former Aiwo Boat Harbor was expected to be completed in 2021 but has been delayed due to technical and logistics issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[159][160]\n\n\n\n## Resources[edit]\n\n\n### Plants and Farming[edit]\n\n\nHistorically, Indigenous Nauruans kept household gardens that provided much of the food that they needed through subsistence farming, with the most common food plants including coconuts, breadfruit, bananas, pandanus, papaya, and guavas.[161] Because of the large immigrant population that would work in the phosphate mines, there were many types of fruits and vegetables grown that were staples in those countries as well.[161] The soil in Nauru was very rich on what citizens call the \"Topside,\" which is the raised phosphate plateau where the phosphate is mined from, and it was extremely fertile and great for growing crops.[161] However, the area where most Nauruans live now, on the coastal ring on the island that hasn't been mined, the soil quality is among the poorest in the world, as it is shallow, alkaline, and has the coarse texture of the coral that surrounds it.[162][161][163] In 2011, just 13% of households maintained a garden or were involved in growing crops.[164] Most of the soil that was on Nauru is now gone because of phosphate-mining activities, leaving people to import the soil that they need.[162][161] Ethnobotanical studies have indicated that the reduction in the types of plants that can be grown due to phosphate mining has significantly impacted the connection that Indigenous Nauruans feel to the land, as plants are a large part of their cultural identity and have many uses in their lives, with each plant having an average of 7 uses within Pacific Island cultures.[161]\n\n\n\n### Food[edit]\n\n\nFor Nauru residents today, all food must also be imported because of the loss of 90% of tenable land due to phosphate mining, leaving people with a diet of mainly processed foods, such as rice and sugar.[165] Though residents are trying to salvage the soil that they can, some researchers speculate that there will be no regeneration of soils even after the mining ceases.[162] The country's dependence on processed and imported foods along with \"cultural, historical and social factors\" have greatly affected the health of its citizens.[166] Despite having all food imported, the Household and Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) conducted for the year of 2012–2013 found that Nauruans have a food poverty incidence rate of 0, based on the Food Poverty Line (FPL) which \"includes a daily intake of 2,100 calories per adult per day.\"[166]\n\n\n\n### Non-food Basic Needs[edit]\n\n\nWhile the HIES found that Nauru is doing well in terms of food poverty, 24% of the population and 16.8% of households are below the basic needs (clothing, shelter, education, transport, communication, water, sanitation and health services) poverty line.[166] This is the worst poverty index of all Pacific nations.[166] In 2017, half of Nauruans were living on $9,000 a year. Water resources are extremely limited, with the island supplying enough for 32 liters of freshwater per person per day despite the WHO's recommendation of 50 liters per person per day.[167] Much of the groundwater has been contaminated by mining runoff, toilets, and dumping of other commercial and household wastes, causing Nauruans to rely on imported water, the price of which can vary as it is closely tied to fuel prices for its delivery, and rainfall storage.[167][152] Access to sanitation facilities is restricted with just 66% of residents having access to reliable toilets, and open defecation is still practiced by 3% of the population.[152] Schools are frequently forced to close because they do not have reliable toilets or drinking water for students to use.[152] There is a long-standing truancy problem and accessibility of education for refugee and asylum-seeking children, as well as for disabled children remain areas of concern for Nauru's education sector.[152]\n\n\n\n## Effects of mining on Nauruans and their land[edit]\n\n\n### Land and people[edit]\n\n\nSince the early 1900s, Nauru has been mined for phosphorus by many countries, resulting in devastating destruction of the land. As noted earlier, 80% of the island is unusable due to phosphorus mining, which has left exposed coral pinnacles that leave the land useless and uninhabitable.[167] The degradation of the land has resulted in a \"lower resilience of the natural environment,\" causing many negative health and environmental effects, like poor water quality, greater erosion rates, poor precipitation, higher droughts, and greater CO2 emissions.[167] The damage done through mining extends further by ocean acidification and coastal erosion and has threatened terrestrial and marine biodiversity.[167] The people of Nauru also face continued negative health effects from the mining in the form of phosphate dust pollution and cadmium pollution, tainting the water and air quality.[167] As a result, the rate of care-seeking for children under 5 years of age with ARI is 69% according to UNICEF data.[164] Due to the extent of the mining, there is not much that can be done now to alleviate the agricultural problems that Nauruans face besides monetary reparations, which Nauru pursued from the Australian Government in 1989 through the International Court of Justice in the Hague.[163][168] The lawsuit was settled in 1993 in an out-of-court payout of $120 million AUD over 20 years.[168]\n\n\nPhosphate mining has removed most of the vegetation and tree coverage that Nauru had, leaving the land and the people vulnerable to intense heat on an island so close to the Equator.[161] The effects of the vegetation removal has been most felt by refugees in the Nauru detention center, which is in the very center of the island where the majority of the mining is done.[169] Along the coast, where most Nauruans are forced to live now due to the land reduction caused by mining, the coastal plants that remain are vital for the \"provision of shade and animal and plant habitats; protection from wind, erosion, flood, and salt water incursion; land stabilization; protection from the desiccating effects of salt spray; and soil improvement and mulching,\" especially as the coast is expected to continue eroding with the increasing effects of climate change.[161]\n\n\n\n### Social effects[edit]\n\n\nBecause phosphate mining, and now deep-sea mining, has been going on for so long, it is hard to parse out exactly how it has affected the Nauruan people. Researchers have offered that the Nauruan people likely have a loss of their sense of place and culture, as they did not have full control of their land until 1968.[170][171] There has also been a documented loss of Nauruan traditions like subsistence farming as well as the violations of their rights to their own land and the continued human rights violations that continue at the Nauru detention center.[171] The Nauruan people face extremely high rates of obesity, alcoholism, prostitution, poorer mental health rates, and myriad other health issues that stem from these problems.[152][171] A study done in 2014 by The Nauru Family Health and Support Study implemented by Nauru Department of Home Affairs and DFAT and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) have shown the alarming prevalence of violence in romantic relationships on the island, with 48.1% of ever-partnered women who participated saying that have experienced physical or sexual violence at least once.[166] A quarter of women in the same study have experienced violence in at least one pregnancy, and 9.9% of women had experienced some form of violence in the past 12 months.[166] In another study surveying sexual health, 21% of a portion of the population tested positive for chlamydia.[164] In the same survey, 30% of school children aged 13–15 reported having attempted suicide, and 24% of children under the age of five are stunted.[164] Though Nauruans are currently still searching for a way to stay on the island and live viable lives, some speculate that the only way for them to do so is to continue mining the phosphorus that is left (30 years or so).[169]\n\n\n\n## Asylum seeker detention centre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauru Regional Processing Centre\n\nThe Nauru Regional Processing Centre is an offshore Australian immigration detention facility established in 2001 and run by the Government of Nauru. The use of immigration detention facilities is part of a policy of mandatory detention in Australia. The detainees at the centre have suffered serious human rights abuses and there are widespread reports of suicide and psychiatric illness. In 2013, a veteran nurse described the detention centre as \"like a concentration camp\".[172] The Nauru facility was opened in 2001 as part of the Howard government's Pacific Solution.[173] As of February 2022[update] there were 115 held by Australia on Nauru, costing the Australian government more than $4m per year per asylum seeker (nearly $12,000 per day).[174]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Oceania portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* Index of Nauru-related articles\n* Outline of Nauru\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Nauru does not have an official capital but Yaren is the seat of parliament.[1]\n2. **^** English is widely spoken by the majority of the population and it is commonly used in government, legislation and commerce alongside Nauruan.
