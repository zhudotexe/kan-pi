As of 2023[update], 20 Indians have been nominated and 10 have won Oscars including in the scientific and technical category.\n\n\nAt the 30th Academy Awards, Mehboob Khan's 1957 Hindi-language film *Mother India* was India's first submission for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film category.[1] It was nominated alongside four other films and lost to the Italian film *Nights of Cabiria* (1957) by one vote.[2][3] In 1982, The National Film Development Corporation of India was instrumental in co-producing Richard Attenborough's biographical film *Gandhi*.[4][5] At the 55th Academy Awards, Bhanu Athaiya became the first Indian to win an Academy Award for designing the costumes.[6] Ravi Shankar was nominated for Best Original Score for the same film.[7] As of 2023, three Indian films have been nominated for Best International Feature\u2014*Mother India*, *Salaam Bombay!* (1988) and *Lagaan* (2001).\n\n\nIn 1992, legendary Bengali filmmaker Satyajit Ray was bestowed with an Honorary Academy Award, becoming the only Indian to date to receive the honour.[8] Resul Pookutty and A. R. Rahman won the Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing and Best Original Score, respectively, for the 2008 British film *Slumdog Millionaire*. Rahman also won for Best Original Song alongside lyricist Gulzar for the song \"Jai Ho\",[9] becoming the first Indian to date to have won more than one Academy Award. Rahman also holds the record for most nominations for an Indian with five total nominations to date, followed by Ismail Merchant with four nominations (three for Best Picture and once for Live Action Short). \n\n\nAt the 95th Academy Awards, three different Indian productions received Oscar nominations, with both *RRR* (feature film) and *The Elephant Whisperers (Documentary short film)* winning their respective categories and thus becoming the first Indian full length feature film and first Indian Documentary short film to win the Oscars.[10] Several Indians and Indian Americans have received the Oscars in the technical category like Rahul Thakkar, Cottalango Leon and Vikas Sathaye.\n\n\n\n\n## Honorary awards[edit]\n\n\n![A portrait of Satyajit Ray.](image)India's Oscar Honorary Academy Award recipient (in 1992) director Satyajit Ray (Born in Kolkata, Bengal, now West Bengal, into a Bengali Hindu Kayastha family of Mymensingh, Bengal, now Bangladesh).\n\n\nHonorary awards\n| Year\n | Recipient\n | Note\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992(64th) | Satyajit Ray | \"In recognition of his rare mastery of the art of motion pictures, and of his profound humanitarian outlook, which has had an indelible influence on filmmakers and audiences throughout the world.\"\n | [11][12] |\n\n\n## Competitive Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCompetitive awards\n| Year\n | Nominee(s)/recipient(s)\n | Film\n | Category\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1958(30th) | *Mother India* | *Mother India* | Best Foreign Language Film | Nominated\n | [2] |\n| 1961(33rd) | Ismail Merchant | *The Creation of Woman* | Best Short Subject (Live Action) | Nominated\n | [13] |\n| 1969(41st) | Fali Bilimoria | *The House That Ananda Built* | Best Documentary (Short Subject) | Nominated\n |  |\n| 1978(50th) | Ishu Patel | *Bead Game* | Best Animated Short Film | Nominated\n | [14] |\n| 1979(51st) | K.

The documentary is about the bond that develops between a couple and an orphaned baby elephant, Raghu, who was entrusted to their care. It won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Film at the 95th Academy Awards,[3][4] making it the first Indian film to win an Academy Award in that category.[5]\n\n\nThe film had its world premiere on 9 November 2022 at Doc NYC Film Festival, a film festival for documentaries in the United States.[6][7]\n\n\nThe film is produced by Mumbai based production house Sikhya Entertainment, led by Guneet Monga Kapoor and Achin Jain. It was released by Netflix globally on 8 December 2022 for streaming.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRaghu (juvenile male elephant; left) and Ammu (right), the stars of the film, at Mudumalai National Park, Tamilnadu, India\n\n*The Elephant Whisperers* tells the story of an indigenous couple named Bomman and Bellie who are entrusted with an orphaned baby Indian elephant named Raghu. They take great pains to ensure that the fragile, injured infant survives and grows to be a healthy juvenile. A strong bond develops between the couple and the elephant. They adopt another elephant Ammukutty and eventually have to give up Raghu. Set in the Mudumalai National Park in the border of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu states of India, the documentary also highlights the natural beauty of the location. It explores the life of the tribal people in harmony with nature.[6][9]\n\n\nThe film is not just a heart-touching story of a bond between animal and human and co-existence, but also showcases Indian culture and tradition of environment conservation.[10]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A family group of elephants in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, India\nThe documentary follows the story of Bomman and Bellie, elephant caretakers belonging to the Kattunayakan tribe. Director Kartiki Gonsalves stated, \"I met Raghu when he was exactly three months old,\" she added, \"I spent about a year and a half with him when he was a tiny baby before this became a documentary.\" \n\n\nThe team spent nearly five years living the ongoing story of these caregivers and their baby elephant, working in a verite mode of letting the daily life and events of Bomman and Bellie tell the story of a life of an orphaned baby elephant (and his sudden unlikely sister, Amu!).\n\n\nOur intention in the process of documenting the journey of the protagonists was to create a fully immersive experience of the traditional elephant caregiver mahouts of southern India, in a way that honours the lifestyle and traditions of the Kattunayakan people, an ancient tribal community that Bomman and Bellie belong to who have been living with elephants for centuries. \n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Elephant Whisperers Team at the 95th Academy Awards\nOn the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes website, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 5 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10.[11]\n\n\nRomey Norton of *Ready Steady Cut* rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and said that \"It packs a small punch and is definitely worth the watch, especially if you love elephants.\"[12] Poulomi Das, reviewing for Firstpost, wrote that the \"narrative is fairly straightforward, [and] the storytelling manages to be simultaneously gentle and persuasive.\" Praising the cinematography, Das wrote \"the film is elevated by its stunning cinematography.\" Das opined that \"Much of the beauty of the film lies in the understated coming-of-age of the film\u2019s narrative that draws ample parallels between humans and animals.\" Das said that *The Elephant Whisperers* \"is ultimately a love-story about the power of community,\" and concluded by saying, \"the film champions the dignity of \u2014 all kinds of \u2014 life.\"[13] Manjeet Singh of Leisure Byte, reviewing the film, praised it, writing, \"the complete documentary appears more like an experience that needs to be felt, than rather just to be seen.\" Singh opined that \"The docufilm is capable of making you cry, or even sob\" and it is \"the finest presentation of the year.\"[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn an interview with the media outlet The Hindu, the tribal couple 'Bomman and Bellie' said they were exploited while shooting the 41-minute documentary. They further allege that the filmmakers did not remunerate them or deliver on the promises made, and that the director, who was amiable during the shoot, became distant after the movie won fame. All of these claims have been denied by the filmmaker. [15]\n\n\nBomman subsequently backtracked on his complaint in an video reported by India Today.\u00a0He stated that he did not know who sent the legal notice nor did he know the advocate, and he did not have any evidence.[16]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | 12 March 2023 | Best Documentary Short Film | Kartiki Gonsalves, Guneet Monga | Won\n | [17][3][18][19] |\n| DOC NYC | 9 November 2022\n | Shorts: Change Makers\n | *The Elephant Whisperers* | Shortlisted\n | [20] |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | 16 November 2022 | Score \u2013 Short Film (Documentary)\n | Sven Faulconer\n | Nominated\n | [21] |\n| IDA Documentary Awards | 10 December 2022\n | Best Short Documentary\n | *The Elephant Whisperers* | Nominated\n | [22] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Submissions for Best Documentary Short Academy Award\n* Mudumalai National Park\n* Theppakadu Elephant Camp\n* Tamil Nadu Forest Department\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Bomman and Bellie also speak this language of the Kattunayakan tribe, which is a mixture of Kannada, Malayalam and Tamil.[1][2]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Keswani, Pallavi (27 December 2022). \"'The Elephant Whisperers' documentary review: A strikingly-lush safari on the co-existence of man and nature\". *The Hindu*.
