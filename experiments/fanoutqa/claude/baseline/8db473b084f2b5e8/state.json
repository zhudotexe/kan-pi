Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany's oldest university and one of the world's oldest surviving universities; it was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire after Vienna and Prague. Since 1899, it has been a coeducational institution. \n\n\nHeidelberg is one of the most prestigious universities in Germany.[6] It is a German Excellence University, part of the U15, as well as a founding member of the League of European Research Universities and the Coimbra Group. The university consists of twelve faculties and offers degree programmes at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in some 100 disciplines.[7] The language of instruction is usually German, while a considerable number of graduate degrees are offered in English as well as some in French.[8][9]\n\n\nAs of 2021,[update] 57 Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with the city of Heidelberg and 33 with the university itself.[10] Modern scientific psychiatry, psychopharmacology, experimental psychology, psychiatric genetics, Mathematical statistics,[11] environmental physics,[12] and modern sociology[13] were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg students or faculty. Approximately 1,000 doctorates are completed every year, with more than one third of the doctoral students coming from abroad.[14][15] International students from some 130 countries account for more than 20 percent of the entire student body.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Heidelberg University\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1386, Heidelberg University was founded by Rupert I on instruction of Pope Urban VI who demanded modelling it after the ancient University of Paris.\nThe Great Schism of 1378 made it possible for Heidelberg, a relatively small city and capital of the Electorate of the Palatinate, to gain its own university.[17] The Great Schism was initiated by the election of two popes after the death of Pope Gregory XI in the same year.[17] One successor resided in Avignon (elected by the French) and the other in Rome (elected by the Italian cardinals).[17] The German secular and spiritual leaders voiced their support for the successor in Rome, which had far-reaching consequences for the German students and teachers in Paris: they lost their stipends and had to leave.[18]\n\n\nRupert I recognized the opportunity and initiated talks with the Curia, which ultimately led to a papal bull for foundation of a university. After having received, on 23 October 1385, permission from pope Urban VI to create a school of general studies (Latin: *studium generale*), the final decision to found the university was taken on 26 June 1386 at the behest of Rupert I, Count Palatine of the Rhine.[19] As specified in the papal charter, the university was modelled after the University of Paris and included four faculties: philosophy, theology, jurisprudence, and medicine.[20]\n\n\nOn 18 October 1386 a special Pontifical High Mass in the *Heiliggeistkirche* was the ceremony that established the university.[19] On 19 October 1386 the first lecture was held,[19] making Heidelberg the oldest university in Germany.[21] In November 1386, Marsilius of Inghen was elected first rector of the university.[22] The rector seal motto was *semper apertus*\u2014i.e., \"the book of learning is always open.\"[23] The university grew quickly and in March 1390, 185 students were enrolled at the university.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Solemn Mass was offered in the *Heiliggeistkirche* in 1386 to mark and bless the establishment of the university.\n### Late Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1414 and 1418, theology and jurisprudence professors of the university took part in the Council of Constance and acted as counselors for Louis III, who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm. This resulted in establishing a good reputation for the university and its professors.[25]\n\n\nDue to the influence of Marsilius, the university initially taught the nominalism or *via moderna*. In 1412, both realism and the teachings of John Wycliffe were forbidden at the university but later, around 1454, the university decided that realism or *via antique* would also be taught, thus introducing two parallel ways (*ambae viae*).[26]\n\n\nThe transition from scholastic to humanistic culture was effected by the chancellor and bishop Johann von Dalberg in the late 15th century. Humanism was represented at Heidelberg University particularly by the founder of the older German Humanistic School Rudolph Agricola, Conrad Celtes, Jakob Wimpfeling, and Johann Reuchlin. \u00c6neas Silvius Piccolomini was chancellor of the university in his capacity as provost of Worms, and later always favored it with his friendship and good-will as Pope Pius II. In 1482, Pope Sixtus IV permitted laymen and married men to be appointed professors in the ordinary of medicine through a papal dispensation. In 1553, Pope Julius III sanctioned the allotment of ecclesiastical benefices to secular professors.[27]\n\n\n\n### Reformation and modern era[edit]\n\n\nMartin Luther's disputation at Heidelberg in April 1518 made a lasting impact, and his adherents among the masters and scholars soon became leading Reformationists in Southwest Germany. With the Electorate of the Palatinate turn to the Reformed faith, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, converted the university into a calvinistic institution. In 1563, the Heidelberg Catechism was created under collaboration of members of the university's divinity school.\n\n\nAs the 16th century was passing, the late humanism stepped beside Calvinism as a predominant school of thought; and figures like Paul Schede, Jan Gruter, Martin Opitz, and Matth\u00e4us Merian taught at the university. It attracted scholars from all over the continent and developed into a cultural and academic center.[28] However, with the beginning of the Thirty Years' War in 1618, the intellectual and fiscal wealth of the university declined. In 1622, the then-world-famous Bibliotheca Palatina (the library of the university) was stolen from the University Cathedral and taken to Rome. The reconstruction efforts thereafter were defeated by the troops of King Louis XIV, who destroyed Heidelberg in 1693 almost completely.[29][30]\n\n\nAs a consequence of the late Counter-Reformation, the university lost its Protestant character, and was channeled by Jesuits. From 1712 to 1728, the Old University was constructed at University Square, then known as Domus Wilhelmina. Through the efforts of the Jesuits a preparatory seminary was established, the Seminarium ad Carolum Borrom\u00e6um, whose pupils were also registered in the university. After the suppression of the Jesuit Order, most of the schools they had conducted passed into the hands of the French Congregation of Lazarists in 1773. They deteriorated from that time forward.\n\n\nMeanwhile, the university itself continued to lose in prestige until the reign of the last elector Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, who established new chairs for all the faculties, founded scientific institutes such as the Electoral Academy of Science, and transferred the school of political economy from Kaiserslautern to Heidelberg, where it was combined with the university as the faculty of political economy. He also founded an observatory in the neighboring city of Mannheim, where Jesuit Christian Mayer labored as director. In connection with the four hundredth anniversary of the university, the elector approved a revised statute book that several professors had been commissioned to prepare. The financial affairs of the university, its receipts and expenditures, were put in order. At that time, the number of students varied from 300 to 400; in the jubilee year, 133 matriculated.\n\n\nAs a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.[31]\n\n\n\n### 19th and early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThis decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph G\u00f6rres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Old Assembly Hall or \"Great Hall\" was redesigned in 1886 in celebration of the university's quincentenary.\nThe German Students Association exerted great influence, which was at first patriotic and later political. After Romanticism had eventually died out, Heidelberg became a center of Liberalism and the movement in favor of German national unity.[28] The historians Friedrich Christoph Schlosser and Georg Gottfried Gervinus were the guides of the nation in political history. The modern scientific schools of medicine and natural science, particularly astronomy, were models in point of construction and equipment, and Heidelberg University was especially noted for its influential law school.[31] The university as a whole became the role model for the transformation of American liberal arts colleges into research universities, in particular for the then-newly established Johns Hopkins University.[32] Heidelberg's professors were important supporters of the Vorm\u00e4rz revolution and many of them were members of the first freely elected German parliament, the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848. During the late 19th century, the university housed a very liberal and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and a circle of colleagues around them.\n\n\nIn February 1900, the Grand Duchy of Baden issued a decree that gave women the right to access universities in Baden. Thus, the universities of Freiburg and Heidelberg were the first ones to allow women to study.\n\n\nIn the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber.[28] Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.[29]\n\n\n\n![](image)The main entrance of the New University building in 1988, showing the bronze bust of Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom\n### Nazi Germany[edit]\n\n\nSee also: University education in Nazi Germany\n\nAfter the establishment of Nazi Germany in 1933, the university supported Adolf Hitler and the Nazis like all other German universities at the time. It dismissed a large number of staff and students for political and racial reasons. Many dissident fellows had to emigrate and most Jewish and Communist professors who did not leave Germany were deported. At least two professors directly fell victim to Nazi terror.[33] On 17 May 1933, members of the university faculty and students took part in book burnings at *Universit\u00e4tsplatz* (\"University Square\")[34] and Heidelberg eventually became infamous as a NSDAP university. The inscription above the main entrance of the New University was changed from \"The Living Spirit\" to \"The German Spirit\",[35] and many professors paid homage to the new motto. The university was involved in Nazi eugenics: forced sterilizations were carried out at the women's clinic and the psychiatric clinic, then directed by Carl Schneider, was involved in Action T4 Euthanasia program.[36][37]\n\n\nThe heads of the university helped in the deportation of Jewish men, women and children directly to the gas chambers.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the university underwent an extensive denazification.\n\n\n\n### Federal Republic of Germany[edit]\n\n\nSince Heidelberg was spared from destruction during World War II, the reconstruction of the university was realized rather quickly. With the foundation of the Collegium Academicum, Heidelberg University became the home of Germany's first and, until today, only self-governed student hall. Newly laid statutes obliged the university to \"The Living Spirit of Truth, Justice and Humanity\".[29]\n\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the university grew dramatically in size. At this time, it developed into one of the main scenes of the left-wing student protests in Germany.[38] In 1975, a massive police force arrested the entire student parliament AStA. Shortly thereafter, the building of the Collegium Academicum, a progressive college in immediate vicinity to the university's main grounds, was stormed by over 700 police officers and closed once and for all. On the outskirts of the city, in the Neuenheimer Feld area, a large campus for medicine and natural sciences was constructed.[29]\n\n\nToday, about 28,000 students are enrolled for studies at Heidelberg University.[39] There are 4,196 full-time faculty, including 476 university professors.[15] In 2007, and again in 2012, the university was appointed *University of Excellence* under an initiative started by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the German Research Foundation. This enhanced the German university system by establishing a small network of exceptionally well-funded universities, which are expected to generate strong international appeal.[40]\n\n\nIn 2022, a mass shooting occurred in the university, killing a woman and injuring three other people. The gunman then committed suicide.[41]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Heidelberg\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \"I saw Heidelberg on a perfectly clear morning, with a pleasant air both cool and invigorating. The city, just so, with the totality of its ambiance is, one might say, something ideal.\"\n |\n| \u2014 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe[42] |\n\n\nHeidelberg is a city with approximately 140,000 inhabitants. It is situated in the Rhine Neckar Triangle, a European metropolitan area with approximately 2.4 million people living there, comprising the neighboring cities of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Ludwigshafen, and a number of smaller towns in the perimeter. Heidelberg is known as the cradle of Romanticism, and its old town and castle are among the most frequented tourist destinations in Germany. Its pedestrian zone is a shopping and night life magnet for the surrounding area and beyond. Heidelberg is about 40\u00a0minutes by train away from Frankfurt International Airport.[43]\nHeidelberg University's facilities are, generally speaking, separated in two parts. The faculties and institutes of humanities and social sciences are embedded in the Old Town Campus. The sciences faculties and the medical school, including three large university hospitals, are located on the New Campus in the Neuenheimer Feld on the outskirts of Heidelberg.[44]\n\n\n\n### Old Town Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The New University of 1931 as seen from the Old University\nThe so-called New University is regarded as the center of the Old Town Campus. It is situated at the *Universit\u00e4tsplatz* (University Square) in the pedestrian zone, in direct vicinity to the University Library and to the main administration buildings. The New University was officially opened in 1931. Its erection was largely financed by donations of wealthy American families, in line with a fundraising campaign of Jacob Gould Schurman, an alumnus of Heidelberg University and former United States Ambassador to Germany.[45] It houses the new assembly hall, the largest lecture halls, and a number of smaller seminar rooms, mostly used by faculties of humanities and social sciences. Education in humanities and social sciences takes place to a great extent in buildings spread over the ancient part of town, though most are less than ten minutes walk from University Square. The faculties maintain their own extensive libraries and work spaces for students. Seminars and tutorials are usually held in the faculty buildings.[44]\n\n\n\n### Neuenheimer Feld \u2013 New Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Campus (Heidelberg University)\n\n  \n\nIn the 1960s the university started building a new campus near the city district Neuenheim, called the Neuenheimer Feld. It is today the largest part of the university, and the largest campus for natural sciences and life science in Germany.[15] Almost all science faculties and institutes, the medical school, University Hospital Heidelberg, and the science branch of the University Library are situated on the New Campus. Most of the dormitories and the athletic facilities of the university can be found there as well.\n\n\nSeveral independent research institutes, such as the German Cancer Research Center and two of the Max-Planck-Institutes have settled there. The New Campus is also the seat of several biomedical spin-off companies. The old part of town can be reached by tram and bus in about 10\u00a0minutes. The Neuenheimer Feld campus has extensive parking lots for faculty and student vehicles for long term and short term parking, as well as visitors and patients of the various university hospitals. The Faculty of Physics and Astronomy is not located on either campus, but on the Philosophers' Walk, separated from the Old Town by the River Neckar, and some 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) away from the New Campus. It also maintains observatory facilities on the K\u00f6nigstuhl Mountain.[44]\n\n\nThe university maintains a botanical garden at Neuenheimer Feld.[46]\n\n\n\n### Bergheim Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Bergheim Campus houses Economics and the Social Sciences.\nThe Bergheim Campus is located in the former Ludolf Krehl clinic (named after Ludolf von Krehl) in the inner-city suburb of Heidelberg-Bergheim. Since March 2009 it has housed the institutes economics, political science, and sociology (together the Heidelberg University Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences) that formerly resided at the Old Town campus. The Bergheim campus offers one lecture theatre, several seminar rooms, the most modern of the university libraries, and a cafe (rather than the full cafeteria present in the other campuses). Since 2019, the Bergheim Campus has also become the location of the Centre for Asian and Transcultural Studies of the Heidelberg University.\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Heidelberg University Library\n\n![](image)The main building of the University Library, built in 1905\nThe University Library is the main library of the university. Together with the branch libraries, serving the faculties and institutes, it forms the integral university library system comprising approximately 6.2 million printed volumes. The University Library's holdings exceeded one million in 1934. Today, it comprises about 3.2 million books, about 500,000 other media such as microfilms and video tapes, as well as 6,000 printed scientific periodicals. Moreover, it has 6,900 manuscripts, 1,800 incunabula, 110,500 autographs, and a collection of old maps, paintings, and photographs. Furthermore, the 38 branch libraries add another 3.0 million printed books. In 2022, 43,600 active users accessed 746,000 books. Additionally, the University Library provides a wide array of online resources, among them 152,000 scientific e-journals.[47]\n\n\nThe origins of today's University Library date back to 1386, the year the university was founded. Surrounding the new university, the libraries of the faculty of the arts, the three higher faculties (theology, law, medicine) and the collegiate library grew. The acquisition of a box of records, which was housed in the Heiliggeistkirche, through the rector, Marsilius of Inghen, in 1388 contributed fundamentally to the development of the library. In the 16th century, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, combined the miscellaneous book collections accrued since the foundation of the university with the princely library housed in Heidelberg Castle to form the Bibliotheca Palatina and made them publicly accessible in the galleries of the Heiliggeistkirche. Among these collections, inherited records of the Fuggers (Augsburg, Ulrich Fugger the Elder) wereof particular importance. The majority of the library holdings, which enjoyed great contemporary renown, was looted during the Thirty Years\u2019 War, transported to Rome and was gifted to Pope Gregory XV by the victorious Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria in 1622. After the secularization in 1804, the holdings of the monasteries of Salem and Petershausen formed the foundation of the reconstruction of the library collection in the 19th century. In 1816, 847 German-language manuscripts from the Bibliotheca Palatina returned to Heidelberg. As part of an exchange, the Codex Manesse, which had ended up in the Royal Library in Paris, followed in 1888. Karl Zangemeister (1837\u20131902) became the first full-time head of the university library in 1912. Based on the designs of architect Joseph Durum, a dedicated library building, a richly ornamented, four-winged red sandstone construction, was erected from 1901 to 1905. In 1978, a branch library opened in the Neuenheimer Feld, serving the institutes of natural sciences and medicine.\n\n\nSince 2021, all manuscripts of the Bibliotheca Palatina are accessible digitally online (848 German-language Palatina manuscripts, 2,030 Latin, 423 Greek, 267 Hebrew and 20 manuscripts in other languages).[48] Their digitization was achieved through the cooperation of Heidelberg University Library and the Vatican Library.\n\n\nThe university library expands its publication services: The Heidelberg document server heiDOK is an open access platform for members of the university. The university bibliography heiBIB lists all academic publications by university members. In 2015, Heidelberg University founded the publishing house Heidelberg University Publishing \u2013 heiUP, which is part of the university library. The publisher releases quality-controlled scientific publications in open access.\n\n\n\n### Facilities abroad[edit]\n\n\nHeidelberg University founded a Center for Latin America in Santiago, Chile in 2001.[49] It has the task of organizing, managing, and marketing the courses of study maintained either independently by Heidelberg University or in cooperation with the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chile. The center has responsibility for programs of postgraduate education. It also coordinates the activities of Heidelberg University in Latin America, and provides a platform for scientific cooperation.[49] Heidelberg University's South Asia Institute maintains branch offices in New Delhi (India)), Islamabad (Pakistan), Kathmandu (Nepal), and Colombo (Sri Lanka).[50]\n\n\nThe university is also represented by a liaison office in New York. Its main tasks include promoting existing collaborations, building up new networks, creating joint study programs, and maintaining and expanding academic contacts with American universities.[51]\n\n\n\n### Museum[edit]\n\n\nThe university has its own museum, in the main building of the old campus. Visitors are able to view the Great Hall (when not in use), and the former \"student jail\".[52]\n\n\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\nThe Rectorate is the 'executive body' of the university, headed by rector Bernhard Eitel. The rectorate consists of the chancellor, Holger Schroeter, who is the head of the central administration and responsible for the university's budgeting, and three pro-rectors, who are responsible for international relations, teaching and communication, and research and structure respectively.\n\n\nThe Senate is the 'legislative branch' of the university. The rector and the members of the rectorate are senators *ex officio*, as are also the deans of the faculties, as well as the medical and managing directors of the University Hospital, and the university's equal opportunities officer. Another 20 senators are elected for four-year terms, within the following quotas: eight university professors; four academic staff; four delegates of the student body; and four employees of the university administration.\n\n\nThe University Council is the advisory board to the aforementioned entities and encompasses, among others, the former Israeli Ambassador to Germany Avi Primor, as well as CEOs of German industries.[53]\n\n\n\n### Faculties[edit]\n\n\nAfter a 2003 structural reformation, the university consists of 13 faculties, which in turn comprise several disciplines, departments, and institutes. As a consequence of the Bologna process, most faculties now offer Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD degrees to comply with the new European degree standard. Notable exceptions are the undergraduate programs in law, medicine, dentistry and pharmacy, from which students still graduate with the State Examination, a central examination at Master's level held by the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n\n\n* The Faculty of Behavioural Sciences and Empirical Cultural Sciences\n* The Faculty of Biosciences\n* The Faculty of Chemistry and Earth Sciences\n* The Faculty of Engineering[54]\n* The Faculty of Law\n* The Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science\n* The Faculty of Medicine\n* The Faculty of Medicine in Mannheim\n* The Faculty of Modern Languages\n* The Faculty of Philosophy and History\n* The Faculty of Physics and Astronomy\n* The Faculty of Theology\n* The Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences\n\n### Associated institutions[edit]\n\n\n* Network for Research on Ageing\n* Central Institute of Mental Health Mannheim\n* Heidelberg Center for American Studies\n* Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research,\n* Heidelberg State Observatory,[55]\n* University Hospital Heidelberg,\n* University Hospital Mannheim\n\n### Partnerships[edit]\n\n\nThe university has partnerships nationally and internationally. In particular, it maintains longstanding collaborations in research and education with the following independent research institutes located in and around Heidelberg:\n\n\n\n* Center for Jewish Studies Heidelberg\n* European Molecular Biology Laboratory\n* German Cancer Research Center (Helmholtz Association)\n* Heavy Ion Research Center Darmstadt (Helmholtz Association),\n* Heidelberg University of Education\n* Heidelberg Academy of Sciences\n* Karlsruhe Research Center (Helmholtz Association)\n* Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (Max Planck Society)\n* Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law (Max Planck Society)\n* Max Planck Institute for Medical Research (Max Planck Society)\n* Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics (Max Planck Society)\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### School statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe university employs more than 15,000 academic staff; most of them are physicians engaged in the University Hospital.[56] As of 2008, the faculty encompasses 4,196 full-time staff, excluding visiting professors as well as graduate research and teaching assistants. 673 faculty members have been drawn from abroad. Heidelberg University also attracts more than 500 international scholars as visiting professors each academic year.

In the 2024 edition of the QS World University Rankings, Heidelberg ranked 87th globally and 3rd in Germany.[57] According to the 2024 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, the university was ranked 47th in the world and held the position as the 3rd best university in the country.[58] Moreover, in the 2023 ARWU World Rankings, Heidelberg secured the 55th position worldwide and was ranked first nationally.[59]\n\n\nAccording to the funding report of the German Research Foundation (DFG) of 2018, which breaks down the grants from 2014 to 2016, the Heidelberg University ranked 2nd among German universities in the overall ranking, 7th in humanities and social sciences and 4th among German universities in the life sciences and natural sciences. The approvals were normalised to the size of the university. In a competitive selection process, the DFG selects the best research projects from researchers at universities and research institutes and finances them. The ranking is thus regarded as an indicator of the quality of research.[63]\n\n\nIn the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities (NTU ranking) 2019, which measures the research outputs of universities, Heidelberg University is ranked 1st in Germany and 5th in Continental Europe.[64]\n\n\nIn the CWTS Leiden Ranking 2019 Heidelberg University is ranked 1st in Germany and 13th in Continental Europe over all sciences according to the scientific impact (number of publications in core journals). According to the indicator \"Collaboration\", Heidelberg University is 1st in Germany and 10th in Europe.[65]\n\n\nRanked by the number of Nobel Laureates affiliated with the university at the time of Nobel Prize announcement, Heidelberg was placed 1st in Germany, 4th in Europe and 13th in the world by 2013.[66]\n\n\nAccording to the Third European Report on Science & Technology Indicators compiled by the European Commission, Heidelberg ranked 4th nationally and 9th in Europe.[67][68]\n\n\nThe German Center for Higher Education Development Excellence Ranking 2010, which measures academic performance of European graduate programs in biology, chemistry, economics, mathematics, physics, political sciences, and psychology, placed Heidelberg in the European excellence group for biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and psychology.[69]\n\n\nMeasured by the number of top managers in the German economy, Heidelberg University ranked 53rd in 2019.[70]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Organisation and length of courses[edit]\n\n\nThe academic year is divided into two semesters. The winter semester runs from 1 October to 31 March and the summer semester from 1 April to 30 September. Classes are held from mid-October to mid-February and mid-April to mid-July. Students can generally begin their studies either in the winter or the summer semester. However, there are several subjects students can begin only in the winter semester. The standard time required to finish a Bachelor's degree is principally six semesters, and a further four semesters for consecutive Master's degrees. The normal duration of PhD programmes for full-time students is 6 semesters. The overall period of study for an undergraduate degree is divided into two parts: a period of basic study, lasting at least four semesters, at the end of which students must sit a formal examination, and a period of advanced study, lasting at least two semesters, after which students take their final examinations.[71]\n\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\nIn the winter-semester 2006/2007, the university offered 3,926 places in undergraduate programs restricted by numerus clausus, with an overall acceptance rate of 16.3%.[72] Most selective are the undergraduate programs in clinical medicine, molecular biotechnology, political science, and law, with acceptance rates of 3.6%,[73] 3.8%,[72] 7.6%[74] and 9.1%[75] respectively. The selection is exercised by allocating the best qualified applicants to a given number of places available in the respective discipline, thus depending primarily on the chosen subjects and the grade point average of the Abitur or its equivalent. For some majors and minors in humanities\u2014particularly for conceptually non-vocational like classics and ancient history\u2014unrestricted admission is granted under certain criteria (e.g., relevant language proficiency), as applications regularly do not exceed the number of places available.\n\n\n\n![](image)The University Library's collection includes the Codex Manesse, an important German song manuscript of the Middle Ages.\nFor prospective international undergraduate students, a language test for German\u2014such as the DSH\u2014is required. Admission to consecutive Master's programs always requires at least an undergraduate degree equivalent to the German grade \"good\" (i.e., normally B+ in American, or 2:1 in British terms). Except for the Master's programs taught in English, a language test for German must be passed as well. PhD admission prerequisite is normally a strong Master's-level degree, but specific admission procedures vary and cannot be generalized.[76] International applicants usually make up considerably more than 20% of the applicant pool and are considered individually by the merits achieved in their respective country of origin.[77]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nThe German state heavily subsidizes university study to keep higher education affordable regardless of socio-economic background.[78]\nFrom 2007 to 2012, Heidelberg has charged tuition fees of approximately \u20ac1,200 p.a. for undergraduate, consecutive Master's, and doctoral programs, for both EU and non-EU citizens, and for any subject area. However, from spring term 2012 onwards, tuition fees have been abolished.[79] The usual housing costs for on-campus dormitories range from \u20ac2,200 to \u20ac3,000 p.a.[80]\n\n\nIn the fiscal year 2005, Heidelberg University had an overall operating budget of approximately \u20ac856\u00a0M, consisting of approximately \u20ac413\u00a0M government funds, approximately \u20ac311\u00a0M basic budget, and approximately \u20ac132\u00a0M from external grants. The university spent approximately \u20ac529\u00a0M in payroll costs and approximately \u20ac326\u00a0M in other expenditures.[81] Additionally, the university receives another \u20ac150\u00a0M in research grants, distributed over 5 years from 2012 onwards, due to the German Universities Excellence Initiative. In the fiscal year 2007, the university for the first time raised approximately \u20ac19\u00a0M through tuition fees, exclusively to further improve the conditions of study. Only approximately \u20ac9.5\u00a0M of these were spent at the end of the year and the rectorate had to urge the faculties to make use of their additional means.[82]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nFile:Haus Buhl.jpgThe Center for Advanced Study Marsilius Kolleg, situated in House Buhl, was founded in 2007.\nAmong historical scientific achievements of Heidelberg researchers features prominently the invention of spectroscopy,[83] and of the Bunsen burner;[84] the discovery of chemical elements Caesium and Rubidium;[83] the identification of the absolute point of ebullition;[85] and the identification and isolation of nicotine as the main pharmacologically active component of tobacco.[86] Modern scientific psychiatry; psychopharmacology; psychiatric genetics;[11] environmental physics;[12] and modern sociology[13] were introduced as scientific disciplines by Heidelberg faculty. Almost 800 dwarf planets, the North America Nebula, and the return of Halley's Comet have been discovered and documented at institutes of the Heidelberg Center for Astronomy.[87] Moreover, Heidelberg researchers invented the process of plastination to preserve body tissue,[88] conducted the first successful transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells,[89] and recently developed a new strategy for a vaccination against certain forms of cancer, which earned Harald zur Hausen of the university the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008.[90]\n\n\nToday, the university puts an emphasis on natural sciences and medicine, but it retains its traditions with highly ranked faculties of humanities and social sciences. The *Marsilius Kolleg*, named after Marsilius of Inghen, was established in 2007 as a Center for Advanced Study to promote interdisciplinary dialogue and research especially between the sciences and the humanities.[91] Other institutes such as the *Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing*, the *Interdisciplinary Center for Neurosciences*, the *Heidelberg Center for American Studies*, and the *South Asia Institute* also build a bridge between faculties and thus emphasize the concept of a comprehensive university.\n\n\nNoted regular publications of the Center for Astronomy include the Gliese catalogue of nearby stars, the fundamental catalogues FK5 and FK6 and the annual published Apparent places, a high precision catalog with pre-calculated positions for over 3,000 stars for each day.[92] The Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research publishes the annual Conflict Barometer, which describes the recent trends in global conflict developments, escalations, de-escalations, and settlements.[93] Regular publications by the Max Planck Institute for International Law include the *Heidelberg Journal of International Law*, the *Max Planck Yearbook of United Nations Law*; the *Journal of the History of International Law*; the *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law*; and the semi-annual bibliography *Public International Law*.[94]\n\n\nThe German Research Foundation (DFG) currently funds twelve long-term Collaborative Research Centers (SFB) with a duration of up to 12 years at Heidelberg,[95] four Priority Programs (SPP) with a duration of six years, two Research Units (FOR) with a duration of up to six years, as well as numerous individual projects at the university's faculties and institutes.[96] As a result of the German Universities Excellence Initiative, two Clusters of Excellence are funded with \u20ac6.5\u00a0M each\u2014\"*Cellular Networks: From Molecular Mechanisms to Quantitative Understanding of Complex Functions*\",[97] and \"Asia and Europe in a Global Context\".[98]\n\n\n\n### International cooperations[edit]\n\n\nHeidelberg is a founding member of the League of European Research Universities, the Coimbra Group, and the European University Association. The university forms part of the German-Japanese University Consortium HeKKSaGOn, and it participates in 7 European exchange schemes for researchers and students, such as ERASMUS. Furthermore, it is actively involved in the development of the German-speaking Andr\u00e1ssy University of Budapest, and co-runs the school of German law at the Jagiellonian University of Krak\u00f3w.[99] The city of Heidelberg being twinned with Cambridge, England, and Montpellier, France, there are close academic ties to the University of Cambridge and the Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier. Beyond Europe, the university and its faculties maintain specific agreements with 58 partner universities in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia and the Russian Federation. In total, the Higher Education Compass of the German Rector's Conference lists staff and student exchange agreements as well as research cooperations with 236 universities worldwide. Some of the most notable partner universities include Cornell University, Duke University, Georgetown University, Harvard University, Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po), Pantheon Sorbonne University, University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, Tsinghua University, and Yale University.[100]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Students rowing on the Neckar river\nThe university offers a broad variety of athletics, such as teams in 16 different court sports from American football to volleyball, courses in 11 different martial arts, 26 courses in physical fitness and body building, 9 courses in health sports from aquapower to yoga, and groups in 12 different dance styles. Moreover, equestrian sports, sailing, rowing, skiing in the French Alps, track and field, swimming, fencing, cycling, acrobatics, gymnastics, and much more. Most of the sports are free of charge.[101] Heidelberg's competition teams are particularly successful in soccer, volleyball, equestrian sports, judo, karate, track and field, and basketball. The University Sports Club men's basketball team, USC Heidelberg, is the championship record holder, won 13 national championships, and is the only university team playing at a professional level in the second division of Germany's national league.[102]\n\n\n\n### Groups[edit]\n\n\nMoreover, the university supports a number of student groups in various fields of interest. Among them are four drama clubs, the university orchestra Collegium Musicum, four choirs, six student media groups, six groups of international students, nine groups of political parties and NGO's, several departments of European organizations of students in certain disciplines, four clubs dedicated to fostering international relations and cultural exchange, a chess club, a literature club, two debate societies (one focused on English debating, the other focused on German debating), one student consulting group, and four religious student groups. Student unions structure themselves as \"Studierendenrat\" (Student body council) as well as on department level.[103]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nHeidelberg's student newspaper \"*ruprecht*\" is\u2014with editions of more than 10,000 copies\u2014one of Germany's largest student-run newspapers. It was recently distinguished by the MLP Pro Campus Press Award as Germany's best student newspaper. The jury of journalists from major newspapers commended its \"well balanced, though critical attitude\" and its \"simply great\" layout that \"suffices highest professional demands.\" The ruprecht is financed entirely by advertising revenues, thus retaining independence from university management. Some renowned journalists emerged from *ruprecht*'s editorial board.[104]\n\n\nHowever, the critical online student newspaper *UNiMUT*, which is run by the joint student council of the faculties, criticized the *ruprecht* often for being conformed, and exceedingly layout-oriented.[105]\n\n\nHeidelberg is also home of Germany's oldest student law review *Heidelberg Law Review*. The journal is published quarterly, at the beginning and end of each semester break, and is circulated throughout all of Germany.[106]\n\n\n\n### Studentenverbindung[edit]\n\n\nHeidelberg hosts 34 student corporations, which were largely founded in the 19th century. Corporations are to some extent comparable to the fraternities in the US. As traditional symbols (couleur) corporation members wear colored caps and ribbons at ceremonial occasions (*Kommers*) and some still practice the traditional academic fencing, a kind of duel, to \"shape their members for the challenges of life.\" In the 19th and early 20th century, corporations played an important role in Germany's student life. Today, however, corporations include only a relatively small number of students. Their self-declared mission is to keep academic traditions alive and to create friendships for life. The corporations' often representative 19th-century mansions are present throughout the Old Town.\n\n\n\n### Nightlife[edit]\n\n\nHeidelberg is not least famous for its student night life.[107] Besides the various parties regularly organized by the student councils of the faculties, the semester opening and closing parties of the university, the dormitory parties, and the soir\u00e9es of Heidelberg's 34 student fraternities, the city offers night life for any taste and budget.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Heidelberg University people\n\n* ![Pope Pius II](image)\n\nPope Pius II\n* ![Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel](image)\n\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel\n* ![Robert Schumann](image)\n\nRobert Schumann\n* ![Dmitri Mendeleev](image)\n\nDmitri Mendeleev\n* ![Ludwig Feuerbach](image)\n\nLudwig Feuerbach\n* ![Max Weber](image)\n\nMax Weber\n* ![Hirata Tosuke](image)\n\nHirata Tosuke\n* ![Carl Spitteler](image)\n\nCarl Spitteler\n* ![Arnold J.

Nine Nobel laureates received the award during their tenure at Heidelberg.[66]\n\n\nBesides several federal ministers of Germany and prime ministers of German states, five chancellors of Germany have attended the university, the latest being Helmut Kohl, the \"Chancellor of the Reunification\". Heads of state or government of Belgium, Bulgaria, Greece, Nicaragua, Serbia, Thailand, a British heir apparent, a secretary general of NATO and a director of the International Peace Bureau have also been educated at Heidelberg; among them Nobel Peace laureates Charles Albert Gobat and Auguste Beernaert. Former university affiliates in the field of religion include Pope Pius II, cardinals, bishops, and with Philipp Melanchthon and Zacharias Ursinus, two key leaders of the Protestant Reformation. Outstanding university affiliates in the legal profession include a president of the International Court of Justice, two presidents of the European Court of Human Rights, a president of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, a vice president of the International Criminal Court, an advocate general at the European Court of Justice, at least 16 justices of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, a president of the Federal Court of Justice, a president of the Federal Court of Finance, a president of the Federal Labor Court, two attorneys general of Germany, and a British law lord. In business, Heidelberg alumni and faculty notably founded, co-founded or presided over ABB; Astor corporate enterprises; BASF; BDA; Daimler AG; Deutsche Bank; EADS; Krupp AG; Siemens and Thyssen AG.\n\n\nAlumni in the field of arts include classical composer Robert Schumann, philosophers Ludwig Feuerbach and Edmund Montgomery, poet Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff and writers Christian Friedrich Hebbel, Gottfried Keller, Irene Frisch, Heinrich Hoffmann, Sir Muhammad Iqbal, National Hero of the Philippines Jos\u00e9 Rizal, W. Somerset Maugham, Jean Paul, Literature Nobel laureate Carl Spitteler, and novelist Jagoda Marini\u0107. Amongst Heidelberg alumni in other disciplines are the \"Father of Psychology\" Wilhelm Wundt, the \"Father of Physical Chemistry\" J. Willard Gibbs, the \"Father of American Anthropology\" Franz Boas, Dmitri Mendeleev, who created the periodic table of elements, inventor of the two-wheeler principle Karl Drais, Alfred Wegener, who discovered the continental drift, as well as political theorist Hannah Arendt, gender theorist Judith Butler, political scientist Carl Joachim Friedrich, and sociologists Karl Mannheim, Robert E. Park and Talcott Parsons.\n\n\nPhilosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Jaspers, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and J\u00fcrgen Habermas served as university professors, as did also the pioneering scientists Hermann von Helmholtz, Robert Wilhelm Bunsen, Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, Emil Kraepelin, the founder of scientific psychiatry, and outstanding social scientists such as Max Weber, the founding father of modern sociology.\n\n\nPresent faculty include Medicine Nobel Laureates Bert Sakmann (1991) and Harald zur Hausen (2008), Chemistry Nobel Laureate Stefan Hell (2014), seven Leibniz laureates, former justice of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany Paul Kirchhof, and R\u00fcdiger Wolfrum, the former president of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.\n\n\n\n## In fiction and popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nIn 1880 Mark Twain humorously detailed his impressions of Heidelberg's student life in *A Tramp Abroad*. He painted a picture of the university as a school for aristocrats, where students pursued a dandy's lifestyle, and described the great influence the student corporations exerted on the whole of Heidelberg's student life.[108]\n\n\nIn William Somerset Maugham's 1915 masterpiece novel *Of Human Bondage*, he described the one-year stay of the protagonist Philip Carey at Heidelberg University, in a largely autobiographical way. Heidelberg also featured in the respective film versions of the novel, released in 1934 (starring Leslie Howard as Philip, and Bette Davis as Mildred), 1946 (with Paul Henreid and Eleanor Parker in the lead roles), and 1964 (with Laurence Harvey and Kim Novak in the lead roles).[109]\n\n\nE. C. Gordon, the hero of Robert Heinlein's 1964 novel *Glory Road*, mentions his desire for a degree from Heidelberg and the dueling scars to go with it.\n\n\nIn Bernhard Schlink's semi-autobiographical 1995 novel *The Reader*, Heidelberg University is one of the main scenes of Part II. Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, Michael Berg, a law student at the university, re-encounters his former lover as she defends herself in a war-crimes trial, which he observes as part of a seminar. The university is also featured in the Academy Award-winning 2008 film version The Reader, starring Kate Winslet, David Kross and Ralph Fiennes.[110][111]\n\n\n\n### Film and television[edit]\n\n\nThe 1927 silent film *The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg*, based on Wilhelm Meyer-F\u00f6rster's play *Alt Heidelberg* (1903), starring Ram\u00f3n Novarro and Norma Shearer, continued Mark Twain's image of Heidelberg, showing the story of a German prince who comes to Heidelberg to study there, but falls in love with his innkeeper's daughter. Having been very popular in the first half of the 20th century, it presents the typical student life of the 19th and early 20th century, and it is today considered a masterpiece of the late silent film era.[112] MGM's 1954 color remake *The Student Prince*, featuring the voice of Mario Lanza, is based on Sigmund Romberg's operetta version of the story.[113]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of medieval universities\n* Mannheim University of Applied Sciences for jointly run programs\n* Rhine Neckar Metropolitan Area\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Mission Statement\". *uni-heidelberg.de*.

The university was founded on 2 December 1409 by Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and his brother William II, Margrave of Meissen, and originally comprised the four scholastic faculties. Since its inception, the university has engaged in teaching and research for over 600 years without interruption.\n\n\nFamous alumni include Angela Merkel, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Leopold von Ranke, Friedrich Nietzsche, Robert Schumann, Richard Wagner, Tycho Brahe, Georgius Agricola. The university is associated with ten Nobel laureates, most recently with Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial stone to the foundation of Leipzig University\n### Founding and development until 1900[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Leipzig University main building (1917). It was demolished by the socialist administration in 1968.\nThe university was modelled on the University of Prague, from which the German-speaking faculty members withdrew to Leipzig after the Jan Hus crisis and the Decree of Kutn\u00e1 Hora. The *Alma mater Lipsiensis* opened in 1409, after it had been officially chartered by Pope Alexander V in his *Bull of Acknowledgment* on (9 September of that year). Its first rector was Johannes Otto von M\u00fcnsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. \n\n\nLike many European universities, the University of Leipzig was structured into colleges (*collegia*) responsible for organising accommodation and collegiate lecturing. Among the colleges of Leipzig were the Small College, the Large College, the Red College (*Rotes Kolleg*, also known as the New College), the college of our Lady (*Frauenkolleg*) and the Pauliner-College (*Pauliner Kolleg*). There were also private residential halls (*bursen*, see English 'bursaries'). The colleges had jurisdiction over their members. The college structure was abandoned later[*timeframe?*] and today only the names survive.\n\n\nDuring the first centuries, the university grew slowly and was a rather regional institution. This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world-class institution of higher education and research.[*citation needed*] At the end of the 19th century, important scholars such as Bernhard Windscheid (one of the fathers of the German Civil Code) and Wilhelm Ostwald (viewed as a founder of modern physical chemistry) taught at Leipzig.\n\n\n\n![](image)Formerly organized as a collegiate university, the Red College of Leipzig University was established in the 16th century.\nLeipzig University was one of the first German universities to allow women to register as \"guest students\".[3] At its general assembly in 1873, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein\u00a0[de] thanked the University of Leipzig and Prague for allowing women to attend as guest students. This was the year that the first woman in Germany obtained her JD, Johanna von Evreinov.\n\n\nDuring the decline and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th and first decade of 20th century together with some other German universities Leipzig University turned into one of the centers of higher education for state administrations and elites of newly independent Balkan states (Romania, Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia) educating over 5,500 students from the region in 1859\u20131909 period.[4]\n\n\nUntil the beginning of the Second World War, Leipzig University attracted a number of renowned scholars and later Nobel Prize laureates, including Paul Ehrlich, Felix Bloch, Werner Heisenberg and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. Many of the university's alumni became important scientists.\n\n\n\n### Nazi period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: University education in Nazi Germany\n\nUnder Nazi rule many degrees of Jews were cancelled.[5] Some were later reinstated as Karl-Marx University degrees by the GDR. Noteworthy Nazis, such as Max Clara (chair of anatomy) taught at the university and were appointed to positions with great authority.\n\n\nThe university was kept open throughout World War II, even after the destruction of its buildings. During the war the acting rector, Erich Maschke, described the continuation of the university in a memo on 11 May 1945, announcing the vote for a new rector:\n\n\n\n\n> Since 4 December 1943 a fixed determination not to abandon the Leipzig University in the most difficult hour of its more than five-hundred-year history has bonded the professors with each other and with the students. The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage. After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone. This is what must be preserved as the great repository of value in the university.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\nBy the end of the war 60 per cent of the university's buildings and 70 per cent of its books had been destroyed.\n\n\n\n### The university under the German Democratic Republic[edit]\n\n\nThe university reopened after the war on 5 February 1946, but it was affected by the uniformity imposed on social institutions in the Soviet occupation zone. In 1948 the freely elected student council was disbanded and replaced by Free German Youth members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, Herbert Belter, was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The German Democratic Republic was created in 1949, and in 1953 for Karl Marx Year the university was renamed by its government the **Karl Marx University, Leipzig** after Karl Marx. In 1968, the partly damaged Augusteum, including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact Paulinerkirche, were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. The dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now City-Hochhaus Leipzig), built between 1968 and 1972 in the form of an open book.\n\n\n\n### After the reunification of Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Main building of Leipzig University since 2012, the Augusteum at Augustusplatz\n![](image)Leipzig's classicist university library, the Bibliotheca Albertina\nIn 1991, following the reunification of Germany, the university's name was restored to the original Leipzig University (*Alma mater lipsiensis*). The reconstruction of the University Library, which was heavily damaged during the war and in the GDR barely secured, was completed in 2002.\n\n\nWith the delivery of the University Tower to a private user, the university was forced to spread some faculties over several locations in the city. It controversially redesigned its historical centre at the Augustusplatz. In 2002, Behet Bonzio received the second prize in the architectural competition; a first prize was not awarded by the jury. A lobby with partial support of the provincial government called for the rebuilding of St. Paul's Church and Augusteum. This caused the resistance of the university leadership, the majority of the students and population of Leipzig. On 24 March 2004 a jury chose a design by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat, which was well received by almost all parties. He recalls the outer form of the St. Paul's Church (today called Paulinum) and Augusteum, and abstracted the original building complex. Renovations began in the summer of 2005.\n\n\nIn 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide \"Initiative of Excellence\" of Germany and it was granted the graduate school \"BuildMoNa: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences \u2013 Building with Molecules and Nano-objects\".[7] In addition, the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the \"Life\" project \u2013 a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the \"Bach Archive\" was associated with the university. In 2009, the Leipzig University celebrated its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions,[8] reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from its beginning.\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nThe university's urban campus comprises several locations. All in all, the university is spread across 38 locations in Leipzig. The main buildings in the city center (district Mitte) are still located on the same land plots as the earliest university buildings in 1409. The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction from 2005, the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euros. The new buildings were scheduled to be completed in 2009/2010, in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.\n\n\nBesides the faculties and other teaching institutions, several other bodies serve the university: the University Library, a university archive and administration, numerous museums (e.g. the Museum for Music Instruments and the Museum of Ancient Egypt) and the university hospital. The university's Leipzig Botanical Garden, the second-oldest botanical garden in Europe. was established in 1542.\nThe university's Musical Instrument Museum includes one of the world's three surviving pianos built by Bartolomeo Cristofori, the piano's inventor. Five other Cristofori instruments are included in the museum's collections.[9]\n\n\nKey Central institutions[10] of the university are\n\n\n\n* Centre for Biotechnology and Biomedicine\n* Career Service\n* German Institute for Literature\n* German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig\n* Higher Education Didactics Centre Saxony\n* Kustodie (Art Collection)\n* Leipzig University Music\n* Leipzig Research Centre Global Dynamics\n* Research Academy Leipzig\n* Language Centre\n* Saxon Preparatory Courses (Studienkolleg Sachsen)\n* Translational Centre for Regenerative Medicine Leipzig\n* University Archive\n* University Library\n* University Computer Centre\n* Centre for University Sport\n* Centre for Teacher Training and School Research\n* Centre for Media and Communikation\n\n## Library[edit]\n\n\nThe University Library of Leipzig was established in 1543. It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the Leipzig University as well as the general public in the region. Its extensive historical and special collections are nationally and internationally recognized. The library consists of the main building \"Bibliotheca Albertina\" and forty branches situated near their respective academic institutions. The current stock comprises 5 million volumes and about 7,700 periodicals. Collections range from important medieval and modern manuscripts to incunabula, papyri, autographs, ostraka and coins.\n\n\nThe Apel Codex, a manuscript of 16th century music, is housed in the Leipzig University library,[11] as well as the Papyrus Ebers.\n\n\nThe Leipzig University Library also owns parts of the Codex Sinaiticus, a Bible manuscript from the 4th century, brought from Sinai in 1843 by Constantin von Tischendorf.[12] Papyrus Ebers is the longest and oldest surviving medical manuscript from ancient Egypt, dated to around 1600 BC.[13] The Codex contains large parts of the Old Testament and a complete New Testament in ancient Greek, and is one of the most important known manuscripts of the Greek Old Testament and the New Testament. It is the oldest fully preserved copy of the New Testament.\n\n\nSome of the University Library locations[14] in Leipzig are:\n\n\n\n* Bibliotheca Albertina at Beethovenstra\u00dfe 6\n* Campus Library at Universit\u00e4tsstr. 3\n* Library of Deutsches Literaturinstitut at W\u00e4chterstr. 34\n* Library of Arts at Dittrichring 18\u201320\n* Library of Musicology at Neumarkt 9\u201319\n* Library of Law at Burgstr. 27\n* Library of Medicine at Johannisallee 34\n* Library of Medicine at K\u00e4the-Kollwitz-Str. 82\n* Library of Veterinary Medicine at the Tierkliniken 5\n* Library of Biosciences at Talstr. 35\n* Library of Chemistry and Physics at Johannisallee 29\n* Library of Earth Sciences at Talstr. 35\n* Library of Geography at Johannisallee 19\n* Library of Archaeology, Prehistory and Ancient History at Ritterstr. 14\n* Library of Oriental Studies at Schillerstr. 6\n* Library of Sports Science at Jahnallee 59\n\n\nIn addition to the university library, one of the two centers of the German National Library is based at Leipzig, the collections of which are open to use for academic research.\n\n\n\n## Faculties[edit]\n\n\nThe original four facilities were the Faculty of Arts, Theology, Medicine, and Law.

With over 29,000 students, it is Saxony's second-largest university. There are now more than 150 institutes and the university offers 190 study programs leading to Bachelor's degrees, Master's degrees, Staatsexamen, Diplom (equivalent to master's degree)[22] and Ph.D.s.\n\n\n\nThe university offers a number of courses in English and other foreign languages, and there are several programs which have been specially designed for foreign students. Exchange partner universities include the universities of Arizona, Oklahoma, Houston, Alberta, Ohio, and Edinburgh. Traditionally contacts to universities in Eastern Europe and the Far East are strong as well, e.g. there are cooperations with leading institutions such as Moscow's Lomonosov University and Renmin University in Beijing.\n\n![](image)Anatomy auditorium of the Faculty of MedicineThere are several International Master's programs: American Studies, Global Studies, Sustainable Development Studies, SEPT[23] (MBA in SME Promotion)[24] and one Bachelor/Master's/Ph.D. program (International Physics Studies Program[25]) taught in English. American Studies Leipzig was awarded three international professorships: The Fulbright-Leipzig Chair for American Studies, the DAAD Professorship for American and International Studies, and the Picador Guest Professorship for Literature.[26] It is also the home of *Aspeers \u2013 Emerging voices in American Studies*, a graduate-level peer-reviewed scholarly journal for American studies. Erasmus Mundus Global Studies is an interdisciplinary, research-based Master offered by a consortium of five European universities: Leipzig University, the London School of Economics, University of Vienna, University of Wroclaw and Roskilde University. In the field of anthropology, the university is cooperating with the Leipzig Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. In 1995, the Leibniz-Institute for Jewish History and Culture named after Simon Dubnow was formed as a research institution related to the university. Since 2008 the university is also home to one of Germany's few Confucius Institutes. The institute is based on an agreement of June 2006 between the university administration and representatives of the Chinese Embassy to establish a Confucius Institute in cooperation with the Renmin University and the \"National Office for Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language\". Leipzig University has been the home of the first German chair for Chinese and East Asian Languages in the 19th century, which later became the Institute of East Asian Studies, which still exists today (see Georg von der Gabelentz).\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Overall \u2013 Global & National |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***QS* World** 2024[27] |  479 |  29 |\n| ***THE* World**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***ARWU* World** 2023[28] |  201-300 |  10-19 |\n| ***QS* Europe**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***QS* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***THE* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nLeipzig University is recognized in several university ranking systems.

It was founded in 1379,[3] and closed in 1816. It was re-established in 1994, three years after German reunification. Therefore, it claims to be both the oldest and youngest university in Germany. The institution identifies itself as a reform university, due to its most famous alumnus Martin Luther, the instigator of the Reformation, who studied there from 1501 to 1505. Today, the main foci centre on multidisciplinarity, internationality, and mentoring.\n\n\nThe university is home to the Max Weber Center for Advanced Cultural and Social Studies, the Gotha Research Center for Cultural and Social Scientific Studies, and the Willy Brandt School of Public Policy.\n\n\nThe Gotha Research Library, which has one of Germany's largest collections of early modern manuscripts, is part of the university. The University Library is also the keeper of the *Bibliotheca Amploniana*, a collection of nearly 1000 medieval manuscripts collected by the scholar Amplonius Rating de Berka (c.1363\u20131435), who was a former rector\u00a0[de] of the university.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### 1379\u20131816\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Erfurt was founded in 1379[3] in the Holy Roman Empire, in territory which is now modern day Germany. When the town of Erfurt became part of Prussia in 1816, the government closed the university after more than 400 years of operation.\n\n\n\n![](image)Collegium Maius\n### 1994\u2013present\n\n[edit]\n\nErfurt was in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) from 1949 to 1990. In December 1993, the State Government of Thuringia in reunified Germany, Landtag of Thuringia, voted to re-establish the university. The university was re-founded on 1 January 1994. Lectures began in the winter term of 1999/2000. Shortly afterwards, the Rector who had overseen the founding, Peter Glotz, a politician in the Social Democratic Party, left the university. The position was taken over by Wolfgang Bergsdorf.\n\n\nIn 2001, the Erfurt Teachers' Training College (*P\u00e4dagogische Hochschule Erfurt*), founded in 1953, became part of the university. On 1 January 2003, a fourth faculty was added to the university: the Roman Catholic Theological Faculty, which had belonged to Erfurt's Philosophical and Theological Centre (*Philosophisch-Theologisches Studium Erfurt*).\n\n\nThe University of Erfurt is a liberal arts university with reform and socio-cultural profile. The close integration of the Philosophical, Educational Research, Governmental Studies, the Catholic Theological Faculty, and the Max Weber Center, promotes interdisciplinary alongside innovative approaches to research and teaching through a mentoring program.\n\n\n\n![](image)University of Erfurt's library\nThe University of Erfurt has no tuition fees and represents the first institution of higher education to receive the family-friendly certificate for employers.\n\n\n\n![](image)Faculty of Economics, Law and Social Sciences\n## Faculties and institutions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Erfurt has five faculties and three academic institutes:\n\n\n\n* Faculty of Education\n* Faculty of Catholic Theology\n* Faculty of Philosophy\n* Faculty of Governance (Law, Economics and Social Science), the only one in Germany\n* Max Weber Center for Advanced Cultural and Social Studies\n\n\nThe academic institutes are:\n\n\n\n* Erfurt School of Education\n* Research Centre for Social and Cultural Studies in Gotha\n* The Willy Brandt School of Public Policy, the former Erfurt School of Public Policy (ESPP), which is partly financed by tuition fees.\n\n\n![](image)Faculty of Catholic Theology\n![](image)Registrar's Office (\"Studium und Lehre\" department)\n## Academic programs and priorities\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Willy Brandt School of Public Policy at the University of Erfurt\n### Academic priorities\n\n[edit]\n\n* Religious studies\n* Sociology\n* Governance (Law and economics)\n* Education\n\n\n### Regular summer schools\n\n[edit]\n\n* International Summer Course for German Language, Literature and Culture\n* Summer School \"Muslims in the West\"\n* Summer Program in Communications Erfurt (SPICE)\n* International Spring School\n\n\n## University research groups and projects\n\n[edit]\n\n### Current research groups\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrently following colleges and research teams are part of the Erfurt doctoral and postdoctoral program (EPPP):\n\n\n\n* The research group Communication and Digital Media (COMDIGMED) is an interdisciplinary and international scale embedded and association of researchers. This project will combine to support the research activities of its members on the field of communication science, educational science, psychology and social science and networking of research and teaching help. COMDIGMED is co-creator of university education focus.\n* In the Center for Empirical Research in Economics and Behavior (Cereb) scientists work together on economic and behavioral sciences, focusing on the theoretical modeling of human decision behavior, the design of social institutions and educational and career choices as long-term Selbststeuerungsprozesse. The university is involved in this specialization.\n* The Graduate School \"Religion in modernization processes\" engages religion-related research projects from the religious, social, literary, media, and history of science, theology and philosophy. It engages young scientists with the problems in this area, and offers attractive conditions for their work to develop new understandings of religion in modernization processes.\n* The research program of Max Weber Center is directed to the problems of religion, science and law as interpretation and control powers, interactions between cultures, social systems and mentalities in radical change, and action-bases of cultural and social sciences and their relation to normative, especially ethical issues.\n* The DFG-Graduiertenkolleg \"Human Dignity and Human Rights\" employs young researchers at the Max Weber Center and the University of Jena with creation, development and application of a central value of Modernity: the human dignity, including consideration of less history of violence.\n* The projects of the Research \"Proficiency\" deal with the theory-based coverage and promotion of linguistic competence. These are all language modalities (reading, listening, writing, speaking), both at the primary are taken as well in second language acquisition in the eye. The research group is actively involved in the design of the gravity profile the Education of the University of Erfurt.\n* The Research Training Group of the Forum \"Texte.Zeichen.Medien.\" her profile is not covered by the thematic orientation, but by the transphilologische and interdisciplinary nature of their access to their objects \u2013 texts, symbols and media.\n* The DFG Research Training Group \"Media historiographies\" deals with the mutual relationship between history and media. The question of a \"history of the media 'with the question of\" media history \"intertwined: how different media to determine the encoding of historical situations and processes? And how media and media techniques to bring out their own particular history?\n* The Platform regions of the world & Interactions\n\n\n### University projects\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the summer semester of 2003, a project group was formed at the university to take part in the National Model United Nations (NMUN) in New York City in April 2004. The pilot project has become a regular, student-organized seminar at the university. The various groups received several awards for their participation at the conference in 2006, 2007, and 2008.\n\n\n\n## People\n\n[edit]\n\n### Original foundation (1392\u20131816)\n\n[edit]\n\n* Martin Luther, theologian\n* Ulrich von Hutten, Lutheran supporter\n* Johannes Gutenberg, printer (attendance debated)\n* Christoph Martin Wieland, poet\n* Konrad of Megenberg, historian[5]\n* Johannes de Indagine, Carthusian monk and theologian\n* Johann Hieronymus Kniphof, physician and botanist\n\n\n### Re-establishment (since 1996)\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Presidents\n\n[edit]\n\n* Peter Glotz, politician and social scientist (1996\u20131999)\n* Wolfgang Bergsdorf, political scientist(2000\u20132007)\n* Kai Brodersen, ancient historian (2008\u20132014)\n* Walter Bauer-Wabnegg, narratologist (2014 -)\n\n\n#### Faculty\n\n[edit]\n\n* Cornelia Betsch, psychologist\n* Beate Hampe, linguist\n* Martin Mulsow, historian\n* Susanne Rau, historian\n* J\u00f6rg R\u00fcpke, classicist and historian of religions\n* Gila Schauer, linguist\n\n\n#### Alumni\n\n[edit]\n\n* Andreas Bausewein, politician\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of medieval universities\n* List of universities in Germany\n* Education in Germany\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Jahresbericht 2015 der Universit\u00e4t Erfurt\" (PDF). *University of Erfurt* (in German). pp.\u00a058\u201361.

Founded in 1419,[3][4][5] it is the third-oldest university in Germany. It is the oldest university in continental northern Europe and the Baltic Sea area,[5] and 8th oldest in Central Europe.[6] It was the 5th university established in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\nThe university has been associated with four Nobel laureates: Albrecht Kossel, Karl von Frisch, Otto Stern, and Walter H. Schottky. It is a member of the European University Association. According to a ranking published by *Times Higher Education* in 2018, it is the most beautiful university in Germany and the fourth most beautiful university in all of Europe.[7] The language of instruction is usually German and English for some postgraduate studies.\n\n\n\n![](image)Detail of the central building depicting the coat of arms of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n![](image)Memorial stone to the foundation of Rostock University, quadrangle of Wittenberg University\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1419\u20131919[edit]\n\n\nThe university was founded in 1419 by confirmation of Pope Martin V and thus is one of the oldest universities in Northern Europe.\n\n\nIn Germany, there are only five universities that were founded earlier, while only Heidelberg and Leipzig operated continuously since then: Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388), Erfurt (1392/1994), W\u00fcrzburg (1402/1582) and Leipzig (1409).\nThat makes Rostock University the third oldest German university in continuous operation.\n\n\nThroughout the 15th and 16th centuries, the University of Rostock had about 400 to 500 students each year and was among the most important universities in Germany and Northern Europe at the time, with many of its students originating from the Low Countries, Scandinavia or other countries bordering the Baltic Sea.\n\n\nIn the course of political struggles and due to pressure from the church, the university moved to Greifswald in 1437 and remained there until 1443. From 1487 to 1488 teaching took place in L\u00fcbeck. A few years after the city of Rostock, the university became Protestant in 1542. Henceforth, Humanism and Lutheranism were defining characteristics of the university.\n\n\nIn the 16th century, Rostock was the first university to teach Copernicanism, which was introduced by Professor Duncan Liddel.[8] After the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), however, for about two centuries the University of Rostock played only a regional role. After the \"ownership\" of the university had moved from the city to the state (Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) in 1827, however, things changed for the better. The second half of the 19th century saw generous building activity in Rostock's *alma mater* and the university soon regained its old reputation amongst German universities.\n\n\n\n### 1919 to present[edit]\n\n\nOn the occasion of the 500th anniversary of the university, Albert Einstein and Max Planck received honorary doctorates on 12 November 1919. This made the University of Rostock the world's first institute of higher learning to award this honour to Einstein. The doctorate was not revoked during the Nazi rule in Germany (1933\u20131945), despite such orders by the Nazis. The reason for this remains unknown. Psychologist David Katz and professor of dentistry and dean of the medical faculty Hans Moral\u00a0[de] lost their posts in 1933 among others.\n\n\nThe end of the Second World War in 1945 brought many changes. The university, now finding itself in the Soviet Zone of Germany (the later German Democratic Republic), was re-opened on 24 February 1946. The Faculty of Law was closed in 1951, a Faculty of Agriculture was introduced in 1950 and in 1951 saw the opening of a Department of Shipbuilding (renamed Faculty of Technology in 1963). The University of Rostock was the first traditional university in Germany to open a technical faculty. In 1952, the Faculty of Aviation was opened, but eventually relocated to Dresden.\n\n\nIn 1976 the university was renamed Wilhelm-Pieck-Universit\u00e4t after Wilhelm Pieck, the first president of the German Democratic Republic. The renaming was annulled after the German reunification.\n\n\nExternal funding increased by 83\u00a0% between 2005 and 2010 alone and currently is above 47\u00a0million Euros per year. Over 500\u00a0million Euros have been invested in the university infrastructure since 1991, reaching 750\u00a0million Euros by 2015. The numbers of young people from Germany and of international students who choose Rostock as a place to study are increasing every year. As of today, students from at least 99 different countries have studied at Rostock. In 2007, the University of Rostock reorganized its research capacities into three profile lines: *Life, Light & Matter*, *Maritime Systems*, and *Aging of Individuals and Societies*. In 2010, a fourth profile was added, called *Knowledge \u2013 Culture \u2013 Transformation*.\n\n\n\n## Organization and structure[edit]\n\n\nLike many continental European universities, the University of Rostock is divided into academic faculties (German: *Fakult\u00e4t*). Those can be sub-divided into academic departments (German: *Institut*) and chairs (German: *Lehrstuhl*).\n\n\n\n### Faculties[edit]\n\n\nIt is divided into the following nine faculties:\n\n\n\n* **Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences**\n\t+ Plants and Soil\n\t+ Ecology and (Coastal)-Landscape\n\t+ Biomass, Aqua and Livestock Sciences\n* **Faculty of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering**\n\t+ Institute of Computer Science\n\t+ Institute for Visual and Analytic Computing\n\t+ Institute of Electrical Engineering\n\t+ Department of Computational Engineering\n* **Faculty of Law**\n\t+ Department of Law\n\t+ International Commercial Law\n\t+ International Business Administration\n* **Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Marine Technology**\n\t+ Mechanical Engineering\n\t+ Marine Technology\n\t+ Mechatronics\n\t+ Biomedical Technology\n* **Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences**\n\t+ Institute of Biology\n\t+ Institute of Chemistry\n\t+ Institute of Mathematics\n\t+ Institute of Physics\n* **Interdisciplinary Faculty**\n\t+ Department of Life, Light and Matter\n\t+ Department of Maritime Systems\n\t+ Department of Knowledge \u2013 Culture \u2013 Transformation\n\t+ Department of Ageing of Individuals and Society\n* **Faculty of Medicine**\n\t+ Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration\n\t+ General Medicine\n\t+ Dental Medicine\n\t+ Anatomy\n\t+ Medical Biotechnology\n\t+ Informatics in Medicine and Gerontology\n\t+ Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology\n\t+ Experimental Surgery\n\t+ History of Medicine\n\t+ Immunology\n\t+ Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine\n\t+ Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology\n\t+ Medical Biology\n\t+ Medical Genetics\n\t+ Medical Microbiology\n\t+ Medical Psychology and Sociology\n\t+ Pathology\n\t+ Pharmacology and Toxicology\n\t+ Physiology\n\t+ Proteome Center Rostock\n\t+ Forensic Medicine\n\t+ Transfusion Medicine\n\t+ Institute of Experimental Gene Therapy and Tumor Research\n\t+ Cell Biology\n* **Faculty of Theology**\n\t+ Institute of Image Theory\n\t+ Institute of Text and Culture\n* **Faculty of Humanities**\n\t+ Institute of General and Social Pedagogy\n\t+ Institute of Educational Psychology Rosa and David Katz\n\t+ Institute for School Pedagogy and Educational Research\n\t+ Institute for Elementary School Pedagogy\n\t+ Institute for Special Education Development and Rehabilitation\n\t+ Institute for Vocational Education\n\t+ Institute for English/American Studies\n\t+ Institute for German Studies\n\t+ Institute for Romance Studies\n\t+ Heinrich Schliemann Institute of Classical Studies\n\t+ Historical Institute\n\t+ Institute for Media Research\n\t+ Institute of Philosophy\n\t+ Institute of Sports Science\n\t+ Wossidlo Research Center for European Ethnology/Folklore\n\t+ Moritz Schlick Research Center\n\t+ Uwe Johnson Research Center\n\t+ Research and Documentation Center of the State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on the History of Dictatorships in Germany\n* **Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences**\n\t+ Institute of Business Administration\n\t+ Institute of Marketing and Services Research\n\t+ Institute of Sociology and Demography\n\t+ Institute of Political and Administrative Sciences\n\t+ Institute of Economics\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Rostock University Library[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michaeliskloster, part of the Rostock University Library (Special Historical Library Collections)\nThe Rostock University Library consists of 3 divisional libraries and several specialized libraries provides scientific literature and information for research, education and study. The university statistics shows about 3 million physical volumes recorded in the catalogue. It provides access to electronic journals (EZB) and specialized databases (DBIS). The library possesses large special collections of culturally historical and scientifically historical old books.[9] In the Patents and Standards Centre (PNZ), all DIN norms and regulations as well as the VDI guidelines are provided.[10] Moreover, the library also contains the university archive and the art treasure collection.[11]\n\n\n\n### Rostock Student Services[edit]\n\n\nThe Rostock Student Services (German: *Studentenwerk Rostock*) provides accommodation for newly arrived international students who plan to study at the University of Rostock and the Rostock University of Music and Theatre. International students, who have not lived or studied in Germany, are considered for a Starter Package service. However, short-time students and students on a programme (ERASMUS; Sokrates) are given a low priority.[12]\n\n\n\n### Rostock University Hospital[edit]\n\n\nThe university operates a hospital, which has several teaching and research institutes.[13] Among those are the Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration.\n\n\n\n## Points of interest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Rostocker Pfeilstorch*, on display at the Institute of Zoology\n* Botanischer Garten Universit\u00e4t Rostock, the university's botanical garden\n* Zoological Collection Rostock, founded in 1775 by Oluf Gerhard Tychsen.

While some other German universities like the University of Erfurt (1379) were founded earlier, they had periods where they were closed down and later re-established, so they are not considered among the 5 oldest continuously operating universities in Germany.\n\nWould you like me to search for information about the current leadership of the Universities of Greifswald and Freiburg to complete the list?",
