The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\nBefore entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\nRegional tournaments for national teams existed before the advent of a truly pan-European competition. Starting in 1883, the British Home Championship was an annual competition contested between the United Kingdom's four national teams, England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Until these national teams entered the FIFA World Cup in 1950, it was the most important international tournament these nations competed in. Similarly, from 1927 until 1960, the Central European International Cup was held six times. It brought together the national teams of Austria, Hungary, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The idea for a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by the French Football Federation's secretary-general Henri Delaunay in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started, three years after Delaunay's death.[6] In honour of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him.[7] The 1960 tournament, held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition.[8] It was won by the Soviet Union, beating Yugoslavia 2–1 in a tense final in Paris.[9] Spain withdrew from its quarter-final match against the Soviet Union because of two political protests.[10] Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, the Netherlands, West Germany and Italy.[11]\n\n\nSpain held the next tournament in 1964, which saw an increase in entries to the qualification tournament, with 29 entering;[12] West Germany was a notable absentee once again and Greece withdrew after being drawn against Albania, with whom they were still at war.[13] The hosts beat the title holders, the Soviet Union, 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.[14]\n\n\nThe tournament format stayed the same for the 1968 tournament, hosted and won by Italy.[15][16] For the first and only time, a match was decided on a coin toss (the semi-final between Italy and the Soviet Union)[17] and the final went to a replay, after the match against Yugoslavia finished 1–1.[18] Italy won the replay 2–0.[19] More teams entered this tournament (31), a testament to its burgeoning popularity.[20]\n\n\nBelgium hosted the 1972 tournament, which West Germany won, beating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final, with goals coming from Gerd Müller (twice) and Herbert Wimmer at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.[21] This tournament would provide a taste of things to come, as the German side contained many of the key members of the 1974 FIFA World Cup Champions.[22][23]\n\n\nThe 1976 tournament in Yugoslavia was the last in which only four teams took part in the final tournament, and the last in which the hosts had to qualify. Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in the newly introduced penalty shootout. After seven successful conversions, Uli Hoeneß missed, leaving Czechoslovakian Antonín Panenka with the opportunity to score and win the tournament. An \"audacious\" chipped shot,[24] described by UEFA as \"perhaps the most famous spot kick of all time\" secured the victory as Czechoslovakia won 5–3 on penalties.[25]\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 8 teams[edit]\n\n\nThe competition was expanded to eight teams in the 1980 tournament, again hosted by Italy. It involved a group stage, with the winners of the groups going on to contest the final, and the runners-up playing in the third place play-off.[26] West Germany won their second European title by beating Belgium 2–1, with two goals scored by Horst Hrubesch at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.[27] Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before René Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half. With two minutes remaining, Hrubesch headed the winner for West Germany from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner.[28]\n\n\nFrance won their first major title at home in the 1984 tournament, with their captain Michel Platini scoring 9 goals in just 5 games, including the opening goal in the final, in which they beat Spain 2–0.[29][30] The format also changed, with the top two teams in each group going through to a semi-final stage, instead of the winners of each group going straight into the final. The third place play-off was also abolished.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruud Gullit and the Netherlands team celebrating their victory in 1988\nWest Germany hosted UEFA Euro 1988, but lost 2–1 to the Netherlands, their traditional rivals, in the semi-finals, which sparked vigorous celebrations in the Netherlands.[32][33] The Netherlands went on to win the tournament in a rematch of their first game of the group stage, beating the Soviet Union 2–0 at the Olympia Stadion in Munich.[34] Marco van Basten scored the second goal, a volley over the keeper from the right wing which is often considered one of the best goals ever scored.[35]\n\n\nUEFA Euro 1992 was held in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who were only in the finals after UN sanctions prevented Yugoslavia's participation as some of the states constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other.[36][37] The Danes beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals,[38] then defeated world champion Germany 2–0.[39] This was the first tournament in which a unified Germany took part and also the first major tournament to have the players' names printed on their backs.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 16 teams[edit]\n\n\nEngland hosted UEFA Euro 1996, the first tournament to use the nomenclature \"Euro [year]\" and would see the number of teams taking part double to 16.[40] The hosts, in a replay of the 1990 FIFA World Cup semi-final, were knocked out on penalties by Germany.[41] The surprise team of the tournament was the newly formed Czech Republic, participating on its first international competition following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which reached the final after beating Portugal and France in the knockout stage. Germany would go on to win the Final 2–1 thanks to the first golden goal ever in a major tournament, scored by Oliver Bierhoff five minutes into extra time.[42][43] This was Germany's first title as a unified nation.\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 was the first tournament to be held by two countries, in the Netherlands and Belgium.[44] France, the reigning World Cup champions, were favoured to win, and they lived up to expectations when they beat Italy 2–1 after extra time, having come from being 1–0 down: Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the last minute of regular time and David Trezeguet scored the winning golden goal in extra time.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)The UEFA Euro 2004 opening ceremony in Portugal.\nUEFA Euro 2004, like 1992, produced an upset: Greece, who had only qualified for one World Cup (1994) and one European Championship (1980) before, beat hosts Portugal 1–0 in the final (after having also beaten them in the opening game) with a goal scored by Angelos Charisteas in the 57th minute to win a tournament that they had been given odds of 150–1 to win before it began[46] (being the second least likely team to have any success after Latvia)[*citation needed*]. On their way to the Final, they also beat holders France[47] as well as the Czech Republic with a silver goal,[48][49] a rule which replaced the previous golden goal in 2003, before being abolished itself shortly after this tournament.\n\n\nThe 2008 tournament, hosted by Austria and Switzerland, marked the second time that two nations co-hosted and the first edition where the new trophy was awarded.[50] It commenced on 7 June and finished on 29 June.[51] The Final between Germany and Spain was held at the Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna.[52] Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with a goal scored by Fernando Torres in the 33rd minute, sparking much celebration across the country.[53] This was their first title since the 1964 tournament. Spain were the highest scoring team with 12 goals scored and David Villa finished as the top scorer with four goals. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament, and nine Spanish players were picked for the team of the tournament.\n\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2012 tournament was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.[54] Spain defeated Italy 4–0 in the Final, thus becoming the first nation to defend a European Championship title, as well as the first European team to win three consecutive major tournaments.[55] In scoring the third goal of the final, Torres became the first player to score in two European Championship finals. He was equal top scorer for the tournament with three goals in total, along with Mario Balotelli, Alan Dzagoev, Mario Gómez, Mario Mandžukić, and Cristiano Ronaldo, despite only being used as a substitute player. The tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a Euro tournament (26 out of 76 goals in total); a disallowed goal in the England versus Ukraine group game which replays showed had crossed the goal line, and which prompted President of FIFA Sepp Blatter to tweet, \"GLT (Goal-line technology) is no longer an alternative but a necessity\",[56] thus reversing his long-held reluctance to embrace such technology; and some crowd violence in group games.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 24 teams[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, the Football Association of Ireland and Scottish Football Association proposed the expansion of the tournament, which was later confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee in September 2008.[57][58] Out of the 54 member associations of UEFA, only three, including England and Germany, opposed the expansion.[59] On 28 May 2010, UEFA announced that UEFA Euro 2016 would be hosted by France. France beat bids of Turkey (7–6 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round.[60] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals.[61] This was the third time France have hosted the competition. Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1–0 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal's world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. This was the first time Portugal won a major tournament.\n\n\nFor the 2020 tournament, three bids were proposed, including a bid from Turkey,[62] a joint bid from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales,[63] and a joint bid from Georgia and Azerbaijan.[64] In December 2012, however, UEFA announced that the 2020 tournament would be hosted in several cities in various countries across Europe, with the semi-finals and Final being played in London.[65][66] The venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[67] However, Brussels was removed as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium.[68] On 17 March 2020, UEFA announced that Euro 2020 would be delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and proposed it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021. The competition was postponed in order to reduce pressure on the public services in affected countries and to provide space in the calendar for the completion of domestic leagues that had been suspended.[69] Before the Euro 2020, Dublin was also removed as one of the host cities due to its inability to guarantee spectators to the stadium, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville for the same reason.[70][71] In the Final, Italy defeated maiden finalists England 3–2 on penalties, after the game was tied 1–1 after extra time, to win their second European Championship.[72]\n\n\n\n## Trophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The trophy on display in 2021\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship, is named in honour of Henri Delaunay, the first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years before the first tournament in 1960. His son Pierre was in charge of creating the trophy.[73] Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning team for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament. This trophy bore the words *Coupe d'Europe* (\"European Cup\"), *Coupe Henri Delaunay* (\"Henri Delaunay Cup\"), and *Championnat d'Europe* (\"European Championship\") on the front and a juggling boy on the back.\n\n\nFor the 2008 tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy was remodelled to make it larger, as the old trophy was overshadowed by UEFA's other trophies such as the new European Champion Clubs' Cup. The new trophy, which is made of sterling silver, now weighs 8 kilograms (18 lb) and is 60 centimetres (24 in) tall, being 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) heavier and 18 centimetres (7.1 in) longer than the old one. The marble plinth that was serving as base was removed. The new silver base of the trophy had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plaques glued to the plinth are now engraved on the back of the trophy,[74] under the word *Coupe Henri Delaunay* and are written in English rather than French its predecessor had. The 1972 and 1980 winning country, West Germany, is written as just *Germany*.[*citation needed*] Since 2016, the juggling boy was returned on the trophy's back.\n\n\nThe players and coaches of the winning team and the runner-up team are awarded gold and silver medals, respectively. Each association that competes in the final tournament receives a commemorative plaque. Each time the team losing semi-finalist, as well as each finalist, receive a dedicated plaque. Though there is no longer a third place play-off, UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,[75] and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.[76] However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.[77] Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.\n\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\n### The competition[edit]\n\n\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the World Cup than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\n\nIn 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and the inclusion of Israel and Kazakhstan. The new president of UEFA, Michel Platini, was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's executive committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.[78] On 25 September, it was announced by Franz Beckenbauer that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.[79]\n\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in 1960 and 1964 through home and away play-offs; from 1968 through a combination of both qualifying groups and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from 1980, the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n\nIn most tournaments, the tournament consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Year\n | Host\n | Teams\n | Matches\n | Round 1\n | Final stages\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1960 | ![](image) France | 4\n | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches (not counting replays)\n |\n| 2\n | 1964 | ![](image) Spain |\n| 3\n | 1968 | ![](image) Italy | 5\n |\n| 4\n | 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches\n |\n| 5\n | 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia |\n| 6\n | 1980 | ![](image) Italy | 8\n | 14\n | 2 groups of 4 teams: 12 matches\n | final (round 1 group winners) and third-place match (round 1 group runners-up)\n |\n| 7\n | 1984 | ![](image) France | 15\n | knockout of 4 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 3 matches\n |\n| 8\n | 1988 | ![](image) West Germany |\n| 9\n | 1992 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| 10\n | 1996 | ![](image) England | 16\n | 31\n | 4 groups of 4 teams: 24 matches\n | knockout of 8 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 7 matches\n |\n| 11\n | 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands |\n| 12\n | 2004 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| 13\n | 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland |\n| 14\n | 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine |\n| 15\n | 2016 | ![](image) France | 24\n | 51\n | 6 groups of 4 teams: 36 matches\n | knockout of 16 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up, plus four best third-placed teams): 15 matches\n |\n| 16\n | 2020[s 1] | ![](image) Europe[s 2] |\n| *17* | *2024* | *![](image) Germany* |\n| *18* | *2028* | *![](image) England![](image) Northern Ireland![](image) Republic of Ireland![](image) Scotland![](image) Wales* |\n| *19* | *2032* | *![](image) Italy![](image) Turkey* |\n\n\n1. **^** Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe\n2. **^** Pan–European edition hosted by eleven countries: Azerbaijan, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain\n\nUp to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.\n\n\nNo third place play-off has been played since 1980.\n\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA European Championship qualifying\n\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using seeding. Seeded teams include reigning champions and other teams based on their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams' abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n\n\n1. Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n2. Average goal difference.\n3. Average number of goals scored.\n4. Average number of away goals scored.\n5. Drawing of lots.\n\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For UEFA Euro 2020, the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the UEFA Nations League. As with most leagues, the points are awarded as three for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n2. Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n4. Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n5. Results of all group matches:\n\t1. Superior goal difference\n\t2. Higher number of goals scored\n\t3. Higher number of goals scored away from home\n\t4. Fair play conduct.\n6. Drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Final tournament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of countries' best results. 10 countries have won, counting Germany and West Germany as one\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the 2012 tournament. They were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.\n\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.[77]\n\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of UEFA European Championship finals\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Host\n |  | Final\n |  | Third place playoff\n |  | Number of teams\n |\n| Winners\n | Score and venue\n | Runners-up\n | Third place\n | Score and venue\n | Fourth place\n |\n| 1960 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Soviet Union** | **2–1** (a.e.t.)Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 2–0 Stade Vélodrome, Marseille | ![](image)France | 4\n |\n| 1964 | ![](image) Spain | **![](image)Spain** | **2–1**Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Hungary | 3–1 (a.e.t.)Camp Nou, Barcelona | ![](image)Denmark | 4\n |\n| 1968 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)Italy** | **1–1** (a.e.t.)**2–0** (replay)Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)England | 2–0 Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Soviet Union | 4\n |\n| 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | **![](image)West Germany** | **3–0**Heysel Stadium, Brussels | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Belgium | 2–1Stade Maurice Dufrasne, Liège | ![](image)Hungary | 4\n |\n| 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia | **![](image)Czechoslovakia** | **2–2** (a.e.t.)(5–3 p)Red Star Stadium, Belgrade | ![](image)West Germany | ![](image)Netherlands | 3–2 (a.e.t.)Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb | ![](image)Yugoslavia | 4\n |\n| 1980 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)West Germany** | **2–1**Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Belgium | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 1–1 [a](9–8 p)Stadio San Paolo, Naples | ![](image)Italy | 8\n |\n| Losing semi-finalists[b] |\n| 1984 | ![](image) France | **![](image)France** | **2–0**Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Spain | ![](image) Denmark and ![](image) Portugal | 8\n |\n| 1988 | ![](image) West Germany | **![](image)Netherlands** | **2–0**Olympiastadion, Munich | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image) Italy and ![](image) West Germany | 8\n |\n| 1992 | ![](image) Sweden | **![](image)Denmark** | **2–0**Ullevi, Gothenburg | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Sweden | 8\n |\n| 1996 | ![](image) England | **![](image)Germany** | **2–1** (g.g.)Wembley Stadium, London | ![](image)Czech Republic | ![](image) England and ![](image) France | 16\n |\n| 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands | **![](image)France** | **2–1** (g.g.)De Kuip, Rotterdam | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2004 | ![](image) Portugal | **![](image)Greece** | **1–0**Estádio da Luz, Lisbon | ![](image)Portugal | ![](image) Czech Republic and ![](image) Netherlands | 16\n |\n| 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland | **![](image)Spain** | **1–0**Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Russia and ![](image) Turkey | 16\n |\n| 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine | **![](image)Spain** | **4–0**Olimpiyskiy, Kyiv | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Germany and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2016 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Portugal** | **1–0** (a.e.t.)

The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\nBefore entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\nRegional tournaments for national teams existed before the advent of a truly pan-European competition. Starting in 1883, the British Home Championship was an annual competition contested between the United Kingdom's four national teams, England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Until these national teams entered the FIFA World Cup in 1950, it was the most important international tournament these nations competed in. Similarly, from 1927 until 1960, the Central European International Cup was held six times. It brought together the national teams of Austria, Hungary, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The idea for a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by the French Football Federation's secretary-general Henri Delaunay in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started, three years after Delaunay's death.[6] In honour of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him.[7] The 1960 tournament, held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition.[8] It was won by the Soviet Union, beating Yugoslavia 2–1 in a tense final in Paris.[9] Spain withdrew from its quarter-final match against the Soviet Union because of two political protests.[10] Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, the Netherlands, West Germany and Italy.[11]\n\n\nSpain held the next tournament in 1964, which saw an increase in entries to the qualification tournament, with 29 entering;[12] West Germany was a notable absentee once again and Greece withdrew after being drawn against Albania, with whom they were still at war.[13] The hosts beat the title holders, the Soviet Union, 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.[14]\n\n\nThe tournament format stayed the same for the 1968 tournament, hosted and won by Italy.[15][16] For the first and only time, a match was decided on a coin toss (the semi-final between Italy and the Soviet Union)[17] and the final went to a replay, after the match against Yugoslavia finished 1–1.[18] Italy won the replay 2–0.[19] More teams entered this tournament (31), a testament to its burgeoning popularity.[20]\n\n\nBelgium hosted the 1972 tournament, which West Germany won, beating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final, with goals coming from Gerd Müller (twice) and Herbert Wimmer at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels.[21] This tournament would provide a taste of things to come, as the German side contained many of the key members of the 1974 FIFA World Cup Champions.[22][23]\n\n\nThe 1976 tournament in Yugoslavia was the last in which only four teams took part in the final tournament, and the last in which the hosts had to qualify. Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in the newly introduced penalty shootout. After seven successful conversions, Uli Hoeneß missed, leaving Czechoslovakian Antonín Panenka with the opportunity to score and win the tournament. An \"audacious\" chipped shot,[24] described by UEFA as \"perhaps the most famous spot kick of all time\" secured the victory as Czechoslovakia won 5–3 on penalties.[25]\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 8 teams[edit]\n\n\nThe competition was expanded to eight teams in the 1980 tournament, again hosted by Italy. It involved a group stage, with the winners of the groups going on to contest the final, and the runners-up playing in the third place play-off.[26] West Germany won their second European title by beating Belgium 2–1, with two goals scored by Horst Hrubesch at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome.[27] Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before René Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half. With two minutes remaining, Hrubesch headed the winner for West Germany from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner.[28]\n\n\nFrance won their first major title at home in the 1984 tournament, with their captain Michel Platini scoring 9 goals in just 5 games, including the opening goal in the final, in which they beat Spain 2–0.[29][30] The format also changed, with the top two teams in each group going through to a semi-final stage, instead of the winners of each group going straight into the final. The third place play-off was also abolished.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruud Gullit and the Netherlands team celebrating their victory in 1988\nWest Germany hosted UEFA Euro 1988, but lost 2–1 to the Netherlands, their traditional rivals, in the semi-finals, which sparked vigorous celebrations in the Netherlands.[32][33] The Netherlands went on to win the tournament in a rematch of their first game of the group stage, beating the Soviet Union 2–0 at the Olympia Stadion in Munich.[34] Marco van Basten scored the second goal, a volley over the keeper from the right wing which is often considered one of the best goals ever scored.[35]\n\n\nUEFA Euro 1992 was held in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who were only in the finals after UN sanctions prevented Yugoslavia's participation as some of the states constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other.[36][37] The Danes beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals,[38] then defeated world champion Germany 2–0.[39] This was the first tournament in which a unified Germany took part and also the first major tournament to have the players' names printed on their backs.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 16 teams[edit]\n\n\nEngland hosted UEFA Euro 1996, the first tournament to use the nomenclature \"Euro [year]\" and would see the number of teams taking part double to 16.[40] The hosts, in a replay of the 1990 FIFA World Cup semi-final, were knocked out on penalties by Germany.[41] The surprise team of the tournament was the newly formed Czech Republic, participating on its first international competition following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which reached the final after beating Portugal and France in the knockout stage. Germany would go on to win the Final 2–1 thanks to the first golden goal ever in a major tournament, scored by Oliver Bierhoff five minutes into extra time.[42][43] This was Germany's first title as a unified nation.\n\n\nUEFA Euro 2000 was the first tournament to be held by two countries, in the Netherlands and Belgium.[44] France, the reigning World Cup champions, were favoured to win, and they lived up to expectations when they beat Italy 2–1 after extra time, having come from being 1–0 down: Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the last minute of regular time and David Trezeguet scored the winning golden goal in extra time.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)The UEFA Euro 2004 opening ceremony in Portugal.\nUEFA Euro 2004, like 1992, produced an upset: Greece, who had only qualified for one World Cup (1994) and one European Championship (1980) before, beat hosts Portugal 1–0 in the final (after having also beaten them in the opening game) with a goal scored by Angelos Charisteas in the 57th minute to win a tournament that they had been given odds of 150–1 to win before it began[46] (being the second least likely team to have any success after Latvia)[*citation needed*]. On their way to the Final, they also beat holders France[47] as well as the Czech Republic with a silver goal,[48][49] a rule which replaced the previous golden goal in 2003, before being abolished itself shortly after this tournament.\n\n\nThe 2008 tournament, hosted by Austria and Switzerland, marked the second time that two nations co-hosted and the first edition where the new trophy was awarded.[50] It commenced on 7 June and finished on 29 June.[51] The Final between Germany and Spain was held at the Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna.[52] Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with a goal scored by Fernando Torres in the 33rd minute, sparking much celebration across the country.[53] This was their first title since the 1964 tournament. Spain were the highest scoring team with 12 goals scored and David Villa finished as the top scorer with four goals. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament, and nine Spanish players were picked for the team of the tournament.\n\n\nThe UEFA Euro 2012 tournament was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.[54] Spain defeated Italy 4–0 in the Final, thus becoming the first nation to defend a European Championship title, as well as the first European team to win three consecutive major tournaments.[55] In scoring the third goal of the final, Torres became the first player to score in two European Championship finals. He was equal top scorer for the tournament with three goals in total, along with Mario Balotelli, Alan Dzagoev, Mario Gómez, Mario Mandžukić, and Cristiano Ronaldo, despite only being used as a substitute player. The tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a Euro tournament (26 out of 76 goals in total); a disallowed goal in the England versus Ukraine group game which replays showed had crossed the goal line, and which prompted President of FIFA Sepp Blatter to tweet, \"GLT (Goal-line technology) is no longer an alternative but a necessity\",[56] thus reversing his long-held reluctance to embrace such technology; and some crowd violence in group games.\n\n\n\n### Expansion to 24 teams[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, the Football Association of Ireland and Scottish Football Association proposed the expansion of the tournament, which was later confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee in September 2008.[57][58] Out of the 54 member associations of UEFA, only three, including England and Germany, opposed the expansion.[59] On 28 May 2010, UEFA announced that UEFA Euro 2016 would be hosted by France. France beat bids of Turkey (7–6 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round.[60] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals.[61] This was the third time France have hosted the competition. Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1–0 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal's world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. This was the first time Portugal won a major tournament.\n\n\nFor the 2020 tournament, three bids were proposed, including a bid from Turkey,[62] a joint bid from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales,[63] and a joint bid from Georgia and Azerbaijan.[64] In December 2012, however, UEFA announced that the 2020 tournament would be hosted in several cities in various countries across Europe, with the semi-finals and Final being played in London.[65][66] The venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014.[67] However, Brussels was removed as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium.[68] On 17 March 2020, UEFA announced that Euro 2020 would be delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and proposed it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021. The competition was postponed in order to reduce pressure on the public services in affected countries and to provide space in the calendar for the completion of domestic leagues that had been suspended.[69] Before the Euro 2020, Dublin was also removed as one of the host cities due to its inability to guarantee spectators to the stadium, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville for the same reason.[70][71] In the Final, Italy defeated maiden finalists England 3–2 on penalties, after the game was tied 1–1 after extra time, to win their second European Championship.[72]\n\n\n\n## Trophy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The trophy on display in 2021\nThe Henri Delaunay Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship, is named in honour of Henri Delaunay, the first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years before the first tournament in 1960. His son Pierre was in charge of creating the trophy.[73] Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning team for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament. This trophy bore the words *Coupe d'Europe* (\"European Cup\"), *Coupe Henri Delaunay* (\"Henri Delaunay Cup\"), and *Championnat d'Europe* (\"European Championship\") on the front and a juggling boy on the back.\n\n\nFor the 2008 tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy was remodelled to make it larger, as the old trophy was overshadowed by UEFA's other trophies such as the new European Champion Clubs' Cup. The new trophy, which is made of sterling silver, now weighs 8 kilograms (18 lb) and is 60 centimetres (24 in) tall, being 2 kilograms (4.4 lb) heavier and 18 centimetres (7.1 in) longer than the old one. The marble plinth that was serving as base was removed. The new silver base of the trophy had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plaques glued to the plinth are now engraved on the back of the trophy,[74] under the word *Coupe Henri Delaunay* and are written in English rather than French its predecessor had. The 1972 and 1980 winning country, West Germany, is written as just *Germany*.[*citation needed*] Since 2016, the juggling boy was returned on the trophy's back.\n\n\nThe players and coaches of the winning team and the runner-up team are awarded gold and silver medals, respectively. Each association that competes in the final tournament receives a commemorative plaque. Each time the team losing semi-finalist, as well as each finalist, receive a dedicated plaque. Though there is no longer a third place play-off, UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time,[75] and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals.[76] However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards.[77] Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.\n\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\n### The competition[edit]\n\n\nBefore 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the World Cup than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.\n\n\nIn 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and the inclusion of Israel and Kazakhstan. The new president of UEFA, Michel Platini, was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA's executive committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016.[78] On 25 September, it was announced by Franz Beckenbauer that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.[79]\n\n\nThe competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in 1960 and 1964 through home and away play-offs; from 1968 through a combination of both qualifying groups and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.\n\n\nSince the expansion of the final tournament starting from 1980, the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.\n\n\nIn most tournaments, the tournament consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No.\n | Year\n | Host\n | Teams\n | Matches\n | Round 1\n | Final stages\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1960 | ![](image) France | 4\n | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches (not counting replays)\n |\n| 2\n | 1964 | ![](image) Spain |\n| 3\n | 1968 | ![](image) Italy | 5\n |\n| 4\n | 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | 4\n | knockout: 4 matches\n |\n| 5\n | 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia |\n| 6\n | 1980 | ![](image) Italy | 8\n | 14\n | 2 groups of 4 teams: 12 matches\n | final (round 1 group winners) and third-place match (round 1 group runners-up)\n |\n| 7\n | 1984 | ![](image) France | 15\n | knockout of 4 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 3 matches\n |\n| 8\n | 1988 | ![](image) West Germany |\n| 9\n | 1992 | ![](image) Sweden |\n| 10\n | 1996 | ![](image) England | 16\n | 31\n | 4 groups of 4 teams: 24 matches\n | knockout of 8 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up): 7 matches\n |\n| 11\n | 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands |\n| 12\n | 2004 | ![](image) Portugal |\n| 13\n | 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland |\n| 14\n | 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine |\n| 15\n | 2016 | ![](image) France | 24\n | 51\n | 6 groups of 4 teams: 36 matches\n | knockout of 16 teams (round 1 group winners and runners-up, plus four best third-placed teams): 15 matches\n |\n| 16\n | 2020[s 1] | ![](image) Europe[s 2] |\n| *17* | *2024* | *![](image) Germany* |\n| *18* | *2028* | *![](image) England![](image) Northern Ireland![](image) Republic of Ireland![](image) Scotland![](image) Wales* |\n| *19* | *2032* | *![](image) Italy![](image) Turkey* |\n\n\n1. **^** Postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe\n2. **^** Pan–European edition hosted by eleven countries: Azerbaijan, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain\n\nUp to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.\n\n\nNo third place play-off has been played since 1980.\n\n\n\n### Qualifying[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA European Championship qualifying\n\nTo qualify, a team must finish in one of the qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically. The qualifying phase begins in the autumn after the preceding FIFA World Cup, almost two years before the finals.\n\n\nThe groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using seeding. Seeded teams include reigning champions and other teams based on their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams' abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:\n\n\n\n1. Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.\n2. Average goal difference.\n3. Average number of goals scored.\n4. Average number of away goals scored.\n5. Drawing of lots.\n\n\nThe qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup's qualifying competition. For UEFA Euro 2020, the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.\n\n\nEach group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the UEFA Nations League. As with most leagues, the points are awarded as three for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:\n\n\n\n1. Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n2. Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.\n3. Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n4. Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.\n5. Results of all group matches:\n\t1. Superior goal difference\n\t2. Higher number of goals scored\n\t3. Higher number of goals scored away from home\n\t4. Fair play conduct.\n6. Drawing of lots.\n\n\n### Final tournament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of countries' best results. 10 countries have won, counting Germany and West Germany as one\nSixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the 2012 tournament. They were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.\n\n\nFor the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.[77]\n\n\nThe groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of UEFA European Championship finals\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Year\n | Host\n |  | Final\n |  | Third place playoff\n |  | Number of teams\n |\n| Winners\n | Score and venue\n | Runners-up\n | Third place\n | Score and venue\n | Fourth place\n |\n| 1960 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Soviet Union** | **2–1** (a.e.t.)Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 2–0 Stade Vélodrome, Marseille | ![](image)France | 4\n |\n| 1964 | ![](image) Spain | **![](image)Spain** | **2–1**Santiago Bernabéu, Madrid | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Hungary | 3–1 (a.e.t.)Camp Nou, Barcelona | ![](image)Denmark | 4\n |\n| 1968 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)Italy** | **1–1** (a.e.t.)**2–0** (replay)Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Yugoslavia | ![](image)England | 2–0 Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Soviet Union | 4\n |\n| 1972 | ![](image) Belgium | **![](image)West Germany** | **3–0**Heysel Stadium, Brussels | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image)Belgium | 2–1Stade Maurice Dufrasne, Liège | ![](image)Hungary | 4\n |\n| 1976 | ![](image) Yugoslavia | **![](image)Czechoslovakia** | **2–2** (a.e.t.)(5–3 p)Red Star Stadium, Belgrade | ![](image)West Germany | ![](image)Netherlands | 3–2 (a.e.t.)Stadion Maksimir, Zagreb | ![](image)Yugoslavia | 4\n |\n| 1980 | ![](image) Italy | **![](image)West Germany** | **2–1**Stadio Olimpico, Rome | ![](image)Belgium | ![](image)Czechoslovakia | 1–1 [a](9–8 p)Stadio San Paolo, Naples | ![](image)Italy | 8\n |\n| Losing semi-finalists[b] |\n| 1984 | ![](image) France | **![](image)France** | **2–0**Parc des Princes, Paris | ![](image)Spain | ![](image) Denmark and ![](image) Portugal | 8\n |\n| 1988 | ![](image) West Germany | **![](image)Netherlands** | **2–0**Olympiastadion, Munich | ![](image)Soviet Union | ![](image) Italy and ![](image) West Germany | 8\n |\n| 1992 | ![](image) Sweden | **![](image)Denmark** | **2–0**Ullevi, Gothenburg | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Sweden | 8\n |\n| 1996 | ![](image) England | **![](image)Germany** | **2–1** (g.g.)Wembley Stadium, London | ![](image)Czech Republic | ![](image) England and ![](image) France | 16\n |\n| 2000 | ![](image) Belgium![](image) Netherlands | **![](image)France** | **2–1** (g.g.)De Kuip, Rotterdam | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Netherlands and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2004 | ![](image) Portugal | **![](image)Greece** | **1–0**Estádio da Luz, Lisbon | ![](image)Portugal | ![](image) Czech Republic and ![](image) Netherlands | 16\n |\n| 2008 | ![](image) Austria![](image)  Switzerland | **![](image)Spain** | **1–0**Ernst-Happel-Stadion, Vienna | ![](image)Germany | ![](image) Russia and ![](image) Turkey | 16\n |\n| 2012 | ![](image) Poland![](image) Ukraine | **![](image)Spain** | **4–0**Olimpiyskiy, Kyiv | ![](image)Italy | ![](image) Germany and ![](image) Portugal | 16\n |\n| 2016 | ![](image) France | **![](image)Portugal** | **1–0** (a.e.t.)

As of January 2020, there were 47,431,256 people living in Spain.[2] Its population density, at 91.4 inhabitants per square kilometre (237/sq mi), is lower than other Western European countries yet, with the exception of microstates, it has the highest real density population in Europe, based on density of inhabited areas.[3] With the exception of the capital Madrid, the most densely populated areas lie around the coast.\n\n\nThe population of Spain doubled during the twentieth century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural interior to the industrial cities. Eleven of Spain's fifty provinces saw an absolute decline in population over the century.\n\n\nThe last quarter of the century saw a dramatic fall in birth rates. Spain's fertility rate of 1.47 (the number of children the average woman will have during her lifetime) has climbed every year since the late 1990s. The birth rate has climbed in 10 years from 9.10 births per 1000 people per year in 1996 to 10.9 in 2006, before declining again to 7.13 by 2021.\n\n\nIn 2021 the Total Fertility Rate of Spain (average number of children per woman) was 1.19, and 3.7% was the percent of births to women that were their 4th+ child.\n\n\nSpain accepted 478,990 new immigrant residents in the first six months of 2022 alone. During these first six months, 220,443 people also emigrated from Spain, leaving a record-breaking net migration figure of 258,547.[4] The data shows that more women than men chose to move to Spain during 2022, this is due to higher rates of emigration from Latin America.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nNotable events in modern Spanish demography:\n\n\n\n* 1808-1814. Peninsular War and Spanish War of Independence: 0.24-0.4-1.0 million deaths.\n* Late 19th century and early 20th century: Relative economic stagnation and mass emigration to American countries.\n* 1918. Flu pandemic, over 200,000 dead in Spain.\n* 1936. Start of the Spanish Civil War.\n* 1939. End of the Civil War. Establishment of a dictatorship, Start of rationing policies. Deepening of economic depression, mass emigration to European and American countries due to economic and political motives (Republican exile).\n* 1941. Approval of benefits for large families, with at least four children.[5]\n* 1945. Establishment of tax deductions for parents.[6]\n* 1952. End of rationing policies.\n* 1975. End of the dictatorship, mass return of emigrated people.\n* 1977. Legalization of contraception. Decline of birth rates.\n* 1985. Legalization of abortion.\n* 1988. After centuries of outwards emigration, the first events of illegal immigration from Africa occur.[7]\n* 1991. Spain becomes a net receiver of immigrants, after decades of mass emigration.[8]\n* 1994. Lowering of threshold of requirements to become a large family, only three children needed.[5]\n* 2007. Approval of €2,500 benefit for births.\n* 2010. Legalization of elective abortion.\n* 2011. Withdrawal of the €2,500 benefit for births.\n* 2015. First negative natural change since the Civil War due to the aging of Spanish population.\n\n\nThe population of Spain doubled during the twentieth century as a result of the demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s. After that time, the birth rate fell during the 1980s and Spain's population became stalled.\n\n\nMany demographers have linked Spain's very low fertility rate to the country's lack of a family support policy. Spain spends the least on family support out of all western European countries—0.5% of GDP. A graphic illustration of the enormous social gulf in this field is the fact[*citation needed*] that a Spanish family would need to have 57 children to enjoy the same financial support as a family with 3 children in Luxembourg[*citation needed*].[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring the early 2000s, the mean year-on-year demographic growth set a new record with its 2003 peak variation of 2.1%, doubling the previous record reached back in the 1960s when a mean year-on-year growth of 1% was experienced.[9] In 2005 alone, the immigrant population of Spain increased by 700,000 people.[10]\n\n\nThe arrival of migrating young adults was the main reason for the slight increase in Spain's fertility rate.[11] From 2002 through 2008 the Spanish population grew by 8%, of which 7% were foreign.[12]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the World Population Review in 2019.[13]\n\n\n\n* One birth every minute\n* One death every minute\n* Net gain of one person every 131 minutes\n* One net migrant every 13 minutes\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In some cases some of the territorial identities may conflict with the dominant Spanish culture. Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the Basques, Catalans, Galicians, Andalusians and Valencians,[*failed verification*][26] although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities may claim a distinct local identity.\nDefinition of ethnicity or nationality in Spain is fraught politically. The term \"Spanish people\" (*pueblo español*) is defined in the 1978 constitution as the political sovereign, i.e. the citizens of the Kingdom of Spain. The same constitution in its preamble speaks of \"peoples and nationalities of Spain\" (*pueblos y nacionalidades de España*) and their respective cultures, traditions, languages and institutions.\nThe formerly nomadic Gitanos and Mercheros are distinctly marked by endogamy and discrimination but they are dispersed through the country.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe native Canarians are partly the descendants of the North African population of the Canary Islands prior to Spanish colonization in the 15th century although many Spaniards have varying levels of North African admixture as a result of the Islamic period. Also included are many Spanish citizens who are descendants of people from Spain's former colonies, mostly from Venezuela, Argentina, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Morocco and Cuba. There is also a sizable number of Spaniards of Eastern European, Maghrebian, Sub Saharan-African, Indian subcontinent and Middle Eastern descent.[27]\n\n\nThe arrival of the *gitanos* (Spanish for \"gypsies\"), a Romani people, began in the 16th century; estimates of the Spanish Roma population range from 750,000 to over one million.[28][29][30][31][32] There are also the *mercheros* (also called *quinquis*), a formerly nomadic minority group. Their origin is unclear.\n\n\nHistorically, Sephardic Jews and Moriscos are the main minority groups originating in Spain and with a contribution to Spanish culture.[33] The Spanish government is offering Spanish nationality to Sephardic Jews.[34]\n\n\n\n## Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Spain\n\nIn terms of emigration vs. immigration, after decades of net emigration after the Spanish Civil War, Spain has experienced massive large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history over the past 30 years. As of 2020, there were 7,231,195 foreign-born people in Spain, making up to 15.23% of the Spanish population including 5,015,263 (10.57%) born in a non-European country.[35] Of these, 5,434,153 (11.45%) didn't have the Spanish citizenship.[36][37] This makes Spain one of the world's preferred destinations to immigrate to, being the 4th country in Europe by immigration numbers and the 10th worldwide. Of these, more than 860,000 were Romanian, and 760,000 were Moroccan while the number of Ecuadorians was around 390,000. Colombian population amounted to around 300,000. There are also a significant number of British (359,076 as of 2011, but more than one million are estimated to live permanently in Spain) and German (195,842) citizens, mainly in Alicante, Málaga provinces, Balearic Islands and Canary Islands. The largest Asian immigrant group, the Chinese, number slightly over 166,000. Immigrants from several sub-Saharan African countries have also settled in Spain as contract workers, representing 4.08% of all the foreign residents in the country. \n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation by country

2020) [46]\n\n\n\nNon-practicing Catholic (41.6%)\nPracticing Catholic (20.1%)\nAgnostic/Non-believer (20.8%)\nAtheist (13.6%)\nOther denominations and religions (2.7%)\nDid not answer (1.2%)\n\nThe Reconquista was the long process by which the Catholics reconquered Spain from Islamic rule by 1492. The Spanish Inquisition was established in 1478 to complete the religious orthodoxy of the Iberian Peninsula. In the centuries that followed, Spain saw itself as the bulwark of Catholicism and doctrinal purity; since then, Catholicism has been the main religion in Spain.[47][48]\n\n\nSpanish missionaries carried Catholicism to the Americas and the Philippines, establishing various missions in the newly colonized lands. The missions served as a base for both administering colonies as well as spreading Christianity.[49][50][51]\n\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978 abolished Catholicism as the official state religion, but recognizing the role it plays in Spanish society.[52]\nFrom the end of the Francoist dictatorship to the present day, a secularization process has taken place that has meant a progressive decrease in religious practice, in the attendance at the different religious rites (baptisms, communions and Catholic marriages) and in the percentage of Spaniards who identify as Catholic,[53] Consequently, a majority of Spaniards today ignore Catholic doctrines on matters such as pre-marital sex, homosexuality and contraception.[54][55] Despite the drop, Catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of Spain's culture.[53]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], 68.5% of the population define themselves as Catholic, 26.4% as non-believers or atheists, and 2.6% other religions according to the official Spanish Center for Sociological Research.[56] Among believers, 59% assert they almost never go to any religious service, by contrast, 16.3% attend one or more religious service almost every week.[56][57]\n\n\nThere have been three Popes from what is now Spain, all of them from the Crown of Aragon: Calixtus III, Alexander VI and Benedict XIII. Spanish mysticism provided an important intellectual resource against Protestantism with Carmelites like Teresa of Ávila, a reformist nun and John of the Cross, a priest, taking the lead in their reform movement. Later, they became Doctors of the Church. The Society of Jesus was co-founded by Ignatius of Loyola, whose Spiritual Exercises and movement led to the establishment of hundreds of colleges and universities in the world, including 28 in the United States alone. The Society's co-founder, Francis Xavier, was a missionary who reached India and later Japan. In the 1960s, Jesuits Pedro Arrupe and Ignacio Ellacuría supported the movement of Liberation Theology.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA study made by the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain demonstrated that there were about 1,700,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain as of 2012[update], accounting for 3–4% of the total population of Spain. The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from Morocco and other African countries. More than 514,000 (30%) of them had Spanish nationality.[58] The recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs and Hindus. After the Reconquista in 1492, Muslims did not live in Spain for centuries. Their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration, especially from Morocco and Algeria.[*citation needed*]\nJudaism was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population. Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews. Approximately 80,000 Jews are thought to have lived in Spain prior to its expulsion.[59] However the Jewish Encyclopedia states the number over 800,000 to be too large and 235,000 as too small: 165,000 is given as expelled as possibly too small in favour of 200,000, and the numbers of converts after the 1391 pogroms as less. Other sources suggest 200,000 converts mostly after the pogroms of 1391 and upwards of 100,000 expelled. Descendants of these Sephardic Jews expelled in 1492 are given Spanish nationality if they request it.[60]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\n* Spanish 99% (88% mother tongue[61]) (official nationwide)\n* Catalan 16%[62] (9% mother tongue[61]) (co-official in Catalonia, Balearic Islands, and Valencia — see Valencian)\n* Galician 7% (5% mother tongue[61]) (co-official in Galicia)\n* Basque 1.6% (1% mother tongue[61]) (co-official in Basque Country and designated areas in Navarre).\n* Aranese (a variant of Gascon Occitan) is co-official in Val d'Aran, a small valley in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n*Others with no official status:*\n\n\n\n* Asturian-Leonese (in the former Kingdom of León and Asturias)\n* Aragonese (in the province of Huesca, Aragon)\n* Arabic (in the autonomous city of Ceuta)\n* Tarifit (in the autonomous city of Melilla)\n\n\n## Educational system[edit]\n\n\nAbout 70% of Spain's students in non-university education attend public schools,[63] whereas 79,1% of students in higher education are enrolled at public universities.[64] The remainder attend private schools or universities, many of which are operated by the Catholic Church.[65]\n\n\nCompulsory education begins with primary school or general basic education for ages 6–16. It is free in public schools and in many private schools, most of which receive government subsidies[*citation needed*]. Following graduation, students attend either a secondary school offering a general high school diploma or a school of professional study in all fields – law, sciences, humanities, and medicine – and the technical schools offer programs in engineering and architecture.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Demographics of Spain.\n\n* Health in Spain\n* List of Spaniards\n* Romani people in Spain\n* Ranked list of Spanish autonomous communities\n* Singular population entity\n* Contemporary history of Spain\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and has been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and the result is that the population decreases.\n2. **^** The term 'nationality' (Spanish: *nacionalidad*) was chosen carefully in order to avoid the more politically charged term 'nation'.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Encuesta trimestral de coste laboral\". *ine.es*. 18 June 2019.

As of January 2020, there were 47,431,256 people living in Spain.[2] Its population density, at 91.4 inhabitants per square kilometre (237/sq mi), is lower than other Western European countries yet, with the exception of microstates, it has the highest real density population in Europe, based on density of inhabited areas.[3] With the exception of the capital Madrid, the most densely populated areas lie around the coast.\n\n\nThe population of Spain doubled during the twentieth century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven due to large-scale internal migration from the rural interior to the industrial cities. Eleven of Spain's fifty provinces saw an absolute decline in population over the century.\n\n\nThe last quarter of the century saw a dramatic fall in birth rates. Spain's fertility rate of 1.47 (the number of children the average woman will have during her lifetime) has climbed every year since the late 1990s. The birth rate has climbed in 10 years from 9.10 births per 1000 people per year in 1996 to 10.9 in 2006, before declining again to 7.13 by 2021.\n\n\nIn 2021 the Total Fertility Rate of Spain (average number of children per woman) was 1.19, and 3.7% was the percent of births to women that were their 4th+ child.\n\n\nSpain accepted 478,990 new immigrant residents in the first six months of 2022 alone. During these first six months, 220,443 people also emigrated from Spain, leaving a record-breaking net migration figure of 258,547.[4] The data shows that more women than men chose to move to Spain during 2022, this is due to higher rates of emigration from Latin America.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nNotable events in modern Spanish demography:\n\n\n\n* 1808-1814. Peninsular War and Spanish War of Independence: 0.24-0.4-1.0 million deaths.\n* Late 19th century and early 20th century: Relative economic stagnation and mass emigration to American countries.\n* 1918. Flu pandemic, over 200,000 dead in Spain.\n* 1936. Start of the Spanish Civil War.\n* 1939. End of the Civil War. Establishment of a dictatorship, Start of rationing policies. Deepening of economic depression, mass emigration to European and American countries due to economic and political motives (Republican exile).\n* 1941. Approval of benefits for large families, with at least four children.[5]\n* 1945. Establishment of tax deductions for parents.[6]\n* 1952. End of rationing policies.\n* 1975. End of the dictatorship, mass return of emigrated people.\n* 1977. Legalization of contraception. Decline of birth rates.\n* 1985. Legalization of abortion.\n* 1988. After centuries of outwards emigration, the first events of illegal immigration from Africa occur.[7]\n* 1991. Spain becomes a net receiver of immigrants, after decades of mass emigration.[8]\n* 1994. Lowering of threshold of requirements to become a large family, only three children needed.[5]\n* 2007. Approval of €2,500 benefit for births.\n* 2010. Legalization of elective abortion.\n* 2011. Withdrawal of the €2,500 benefit for births.\n* 2015. First negative natural change since the Civil War due to the aging of Spanish population.\n\n\nThe population of Spain doubled during the twentieth century as a result of the demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s. After that time, the birth rate fell during the 1980s and Spain's population became stalled.\n\n\nMany demographers have linked Spain's very low fertility rate to the country's lack of a family support policy. Spain spends the least on family support out of all western European countries—0.5% of GDP. A graphic illustration of the enormous social gulf in this field is the fact[*citation needed*] that a Spanish family would need to have 57 children to enjoy the same financial support as a family with 3 children in Luxembourg[*citation needed*].[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring the early 2000s, the mean year-on-year demographic growth set a new record with its 2003 peak variation of 2.1%, doubling the previous record reached back in the 1960s when a mean year-on-year growth of 1% was experienced.[9] In 2005 alone, the immigrant population of Spain increased by 700,000 people.[10]\n\n\nThe arrival of migrating young adults was the main reason for the slight increase in Spain's fertility rate.[11] From 2002 through 2008 the Spanish population grew by 8%, of which 7% were foreign.[12]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the World Population Review in 2019.[13]\n\n\n\n* One birth every minute\n* One death every minute\n* Net gain of one person every 131 minutes\n* One net migrant every 13 minutes\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In some cases some of the territorial identities may conflict with the dominant Spanish culture. Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the Basques, Catalans, Galicians, Andalusians and Valencians,[*failed verification*][26] although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities may claim a distinct local identity.\nDefinition of ethnicity or nationality in Spain is fraught politically. The term \"Spanish people\" (*pueblo español*) is defined in the 1978 constitution as the political sovereign, i.e. the citizens of the Kingdom of Spain. The same constitution in its preamble speaks of \"peoples and nationalities of Spain\" (*pueblos y nacionalidades de España*) and their respective cultures, traditions, languages and institutions.\nThe formerly nomadic Gitanos and Mercheros are distinctly marked by endogamy and discrimination but they are dispersed through the country.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe native Canarians are partly the descendants of the North African population of the Canary Islands prior to Spanish colonization in the 15th century although many Spaniards have varying levels of North African admixture as a result of the Islamic period. Also included are many Spanish citizens who are descendants of people from Spain's former colonies, mostly from Venezuela, Argentina, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Morocco and Cuba. There is also a sizable number of Spaniards of Eastern European, Maghrebian, Sub Saharan-African, Indian subcontinent and Middle Eastern descent.[27]\n\n\nThe arrival of the *gitanos* (Spanish for \"gypsies\"), a Romani people, began in the 16th century; estimates of the Spanish Roma population range from 750,000 to over one million.[28][29][30][31][32] There are also the *mercheros* (also called *quinquis*), a formerly nomadic minority group. Their origin is unclear.\n\n\nHistorically, Sephardic Jews and Moriscos are the main minority groups originating in Spain and with a contribution to Spanish culture.[33] The Spanish government is offering Spanish nationality to Sephardic Jews.[34]\n\n\n\n## Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Spain\n\nIn terms of emigration vs. immigration, after decades of net emigration after the Spanish Civil War, Spain has experienced massive large-scale immigration for the first time in modern history over the past 30 years. As of 2020, there were 7,231,195 foreign-born people in Spain, making up to 15.23% of the Spanish population including 5,015,263 (10.57%) born in a non-European country.[35] Of these, 5,434,153 (11.45%) didn't have the Spanish citizenship.[36][37] This makes Spain one of the world's preferred destinations to immigrate to, being the 4th country in Europe by immigration numbers and the 10th worldwide. Of these, more than 860,000 were Romanian, and 760,000 were Moroccan while the number of Ecuadorians was around 390,000. Colombian population amounted to around 300,000. There are also a significant number of British (359,076 as of 2011, but more than one million are estimated to live permanently in Spain) and German (195,842) citizens, mainly in Alicante, Málaga provinces, Balearic Islands and Canary Islands. The largest Asian immigrant group, the Chinese, number slightly over 166,000. Immigrants from several sub-Saharan African countries have also settled in Spain as contract workers, representing 4.08% of all the foreign residents in the country. \n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation by country

2020) [46]\n\n\n\nNon-practicing Catholic (41.6%)\nPracticing Catholic (20.1%)\nAgnostic/Non-believer (20.8%)\nAtheist (13.6%)\nOther denominations and religions (2.7%)\nDid not answer (1.2%)\n\nThe Reconquista was the long process by which the Catholics reconquered Spain from Islamic rule by 1492. The Spanish Inquisition was established in 1478 to complete the religious orthodoxy of the Iberian Peninsula. In the centuries that followed, Spain saw itself as the bulwark of Catholicism and doctrinal purity; since then, Catholicism has been the main religion in Spain.[47][48]\n\n\nSpanish missionaries carried Catholicism to the Americas and the Philippines, establishing various missions in the newly colonized lands. The missions served as a base for both administering colonies as well as spreading Christianity.[49][50][51]\n\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978 abolished Catholicism as the official state religion, but recognizing the role it plays in Spanish society.[52]\nFrom the end of the Francoist dictatorship to the present day, a secularization process has taken place that has meant a progressive decrease in religious practice, in the attendance at the different religious rites (baptisms, communions and Catholic marriages) and in the percentage of Spaniards who identify as Catholic,[53] Consequently, a majority of Spaniards today ignore Catholic doctrines on matters such as pre-marital sex, homosexuality and contraception.[54][55] Despite the drop, Catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of Spain's culture.[53]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], 68.5% of the population define themselves as Catholic, 26.4% as non-believers or atheists, and 2.6% other religions according to the official Spanish Center for Sociological Research.[56] Among believers, 59% assert they almost never go to any religious service, by contrast, 16.3% attend one or more religious service almost every week.[56][57]\n\n\nThere have been three Popes from what is now Spain, all of them from the Crown of Aragon: Calixtus III, Alexander VI and Benedict XIII. Spanish mysticism provided an important intellectual resource against Protestantism with Carmelites like Teresa of Ávila, a reformist nun and John of the Cross, a priest, taking the lead in their reform movement. Later, they became Doctors of the Church. The Society of Jesus was co-founded by Ignatius of Loyola, whose Spiritual Exercises and movement led to the establishment of hundreds of colleges and universities in the world, including 28 in the United States alone. The Society's co-founder, Francis Xavier, was a missionary who reached India and later Japan. In the 1960s, Jesuits Pedro Arrupe and Ignacio Ellacuría supported the movement of Liberation Theology.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA study made by the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain demonstrated that there were about 1,700,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain as of 2012[update], accounting for 3–4% of the total population of Spain. The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from Morocco and other African countries. More than 514,000 (30%) of them had Spanish nationality.[58] The recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs and Hindus. After the Reconquista in 1492, Muslims did not live in Spain for centuries. Their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration, especially from Morocco and Algeria.[*citation needed*]\nJudaism was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population. Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews. Approximately 80,000 Jews are thought to have lived in Spain prior to its expulsion.[59] However the Jewish Encyclopedia states the number over 800,000 to be too large and 235,000 as too small: 165,000 is given as expelled as possibly too small in favour of 200,000, and the numbers of converts after the 1391 pogroms as less. Other sources suggest 200,000 converts mostly after the pogroms of 1391 and upwards of 100,000 expelled. Descendants of these Sephardic Jews expelled in 1492 are given Spanish nationality if they request it.[60]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\n* Spanish 99% (88% mother tongue[61]) (official nationwide)\n* Catalan 16%[62] (9% mother tongue[61]) (co-official in Catalonia, Balearic Islands, and Valencia — see Valencian)\n* Galician 7% (5% mother tongue[61]) (co-official in Galicia)\n* Basque 1.6% (1% mother tongue[61]) (co-official in Basque Country and designated areas in Navarre).\n* Aranese (a variant of Gascon Occitan) is co-official in Val d'Aran, a small valley in the Pyrenees.\n\n\n*Others with no official status:*\n\n\n\n* Asturian-Leonese (in the former Kingdom of León and Asturias)\n* Aragonese (in the province of Huesca, Aragon)\n* Arabic (in the autonomous city of Ceuta)\n* Tarifit (in the autonomous city of Melilla)\n\n\n## Educational system[edit]\n\n\nAbout 70% of Spain's students in non-university education attend public schools,[63] whereas 79,1% of students in higher education are enrolled at public universities.[64] The remainder attend private schools or universities, many of which are operated by the Catholic Church.[65]\n\n\nCompulsory education begins with primary school or general basic education for ages 6–16. It is free in public schools and in many private schools, most of which receive government subsidies[*citation needed*]. Following graduation, students attend either a secondary school offering a general high school diploma or a school of professional study in all fields – law, sciences, humanities, and medicine – and the technical schools offer programs in engineering and architecture.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Demographics of Spain.\n\n* Health in Spain\n* List of Spaniards\n* Romani people in Spain\n* Ranked list of Spanish autonomous communities\n* Singular population entity\n* Contemporary history of Spain\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and has been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and the result is that the population decreases.\n2. **^** The term 'nationality' (Spanish: *nacionalidad*) was chosen carefully in order to avoid the more politically charged term 'nation'.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Encuesta trimestral de coste laboral\". *ine.es*. 18 June 2019.
