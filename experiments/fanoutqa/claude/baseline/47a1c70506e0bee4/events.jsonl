There are also corporations having foundation in the United States, such as corporate headquarters, operational headquarters and independent subsidiaries. The list excludes large privately held companies such as Cargill and Koch Industries whose financial data is not necessarily available to the public. However, this list does include several government-sponsored enterprises that were created by acts of Congress and later became publicly traded.\n\n\n\n\n## List of the largest
