The investment yields a return that funds a portion of an institution's operational expenses while the principal exists in perpetuity. U.S. colleges and universities maintain some of the largest endowments in the world and make up the vast majority of higher education institutions with endowments greater than $1 billion.\n\n\nThe National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) maintains information on endowments at U.S. higher education institutions by fiscal year (FY).[1] As of FY2022[update], the total endowment market value of U.S. institutions stood at $807.332 billion, with an average across all institutions of $1.185 billion and a median of $208.735 million.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Enhancements and levies[edit]\n\n\nThe tabulated data below are from NACUBO. Some universities benefit from endowments that are not under their direct control but which are nonetheless dedicated to the welfare of one or several institutions. Examples of these foundations include The Duke Endowment, the Robert A. Welch Foundation, and the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust.\n\n\nIn 2017, a federal endowment tax was enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the form of an excise tax of 1.4% on institutions that have at least 500 tuition-paying students and net assets of at least $500,000 per student. The $500,000 is not adjusted for inflation, so the threshold is effectively lowered over time.[4][5]\n\n\nThe endowment tax provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been criticized as funding tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy at the expense of education. Critics note that the tax could threaten financial aid for low-income students, stifle social mobility, and obstruct life-saving research.[6][7][8] Lobbyists representing wealthy private universities continue to advocate for its repeal.[9][10] The Don't Tax Higher Education Act, which would repeal the endowment tax, was introduced in the 115th United States Congress,[11] 116th United States Congress,[12] and 117th United States Congress[13] but died in the Ways and Means Committee each time.\n\n\n\n## Endowments greater than $1 billion[edit]\n\n\n### Private schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University has the second-largest endowment of all private colleges and universities in the United States.\n\n\n\n| Institution | State | Endowment[3](billions USD -

Hartzell** is an American economist and the 30th President of The University of Texas at Austin.[1] Additionally, he holds the Centennial Chair in Business Education Leadership and the Trammell Crow Regents Professor in Business at UT Austin.[2][3]\n\n\n\n## Education and career\n\n[edit]\n\nHartzell was born in Kansas and grew up in Oklahoma. He graduated from Trinity University in San Antonio cum laude with a B.S. in business administration and economics. After receiving a doctorate in finance from UT Austin, he served as an assistant professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business.[4]\n\n\n\n### The University of Texas at Austin\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Hartzell returned to UT Austin as a faculty member in the McCombs School of Business. Since then, he has served in various capacities, including as the senior associate dean for academic affairs, the executive director of the business school's Real Estate Finance and Investment Center, and as the chair of UT Austin's finance department.[5] In 2016, he was named dean of the McCombs School of Business. As dean, Hartzell launched the Goff Real Estate Labs, elevated the Canfield Business Honors program and opened Rowling Hall, the home of UT Austin's MBA program. He helped create many significant partnerships with colleges and schools across campus including the Dell Medical School, the College of Fine Arts, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Natural Sciences and the Moody College of Communication. He established the position of Associate Dean of Diversity and Inclusion at the McCombs School and the McCombs Diversity and Inclusion Committee.[6] He also established McCombs’ one-year Master of Science in Finance degree, created the Undergraduate Real Estate Certificate Program and oversaw the completion of the fundraising, construction and opening of Rowling Hall, a 500,000-square-foot graduate business facility.[7]\n\n\nIn April 2020, the University of Texas System's Board of Regents appointed Hartzell to serve as interim president of UT Austin.[7]\n\n\nIn July 2020, in response to concerns raised by student athletes, alumni and other UT Austin community members, Hartzell announced a series of measures designed to create a more diverse and welcoming campus at UT Austin.[8] The measures included: working with a group of students, faculty members, staffers and alumni to allocate a multimillion-dollar investment from Athletics’ revenue to UT Austin programs to recruit, attract, retain and support Black students; renaming the Robert L. Moore Building as the Physics, Math and Astronomy Building; honoring Heman M. Sweatt, UT Austin's first Black student, in a variety of ways on campus; commissioning a new monument for the Precursors, the first Black undergraduates to attend UT Austin; erecting a statue for Julius Whittier, UT Austin's first Black football player; and renaming Joe Jamail Field for Heisman Trophy winners Earl Campbell and Ricky Williams.[9] He has at the same time also received criticism from Black lawmakers and UT students concerning his defence of the song \"Eyes of Texas\" although considered a racist tradition of the university by many [10]\n\n\nThroughout the summer of 2020, Hartzell led UT Austin's response to the COVID-19 crisis, and on August 13, 2020, the UT System Board of Regents announced Hartzell as the sole finalist for the position of UT Austin president.[5]\n\n\nOn September 23, 2020, the UT System Board of Regents unanimously voted to name Hartzell the 30th president of UT Austin, effective immediately.[1]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mekelburg, Madlin (September 23, 2020). \"Jay Hartzell named UT Austin president\". *Austin American-Statesman*.

Hartzell** is an American economist and the 30th President of The University of Texas at Austin.[1] Additionally, he holds the Centennial Chair in Business Education Leadership and the Trammell Crow Regents Professor in Business at UT Austin.[2][3]\n\n\n\n## Education and career\n\n[edit]\n\nHartzell was born in Kansas and grew up in Oklahoma. He graduated from Trinity University in San Antonio cum laude with a B.S. in business administration and economics. After receiving a doctorate in finance from UT Austin, he served as an assistant professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business.[4]\n\n\n\n### The University of Texas at Austin\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2001, Hartzell returned to UT Austin as a faculty member in the McCombs School of Business. Since then, he has served in various capacities, including as the senior associate dean for academic affairs, the executive director of the business school's Real Estate Finance and Investment Center, and as the chair of UT Austin's finance department.[5] In 2016, he was named dean of the McCombs School of Business. As dean, Hartzell launched the Goff Real Estate Labs, elevated the Canfield Business Honors program and opened Rowling Hall, the home of UT Austin's MBA program. He helped create many significant partnerships with colleges and schools across campus including the Dell Medical School, the College of Fine Arts, the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Natural Sciences and the Moody College of Communication. He established the position of Associate Dean of Diversity and Inclusion at the McCombs School and the McCombs Diversity and Inclusion Committee.[6] He also established McCombs’ one-year Master of Science in Finance degree, created the Undergraduate Real Estate Certificate Program and oversaw the completion of the fundraising, construction and opening of Rowling Hall, a 500,000-square-foot graduate business facility.[7]\n\n\nIn April 2020, the University of Texas System's Board of Regents appointed Hartzell to serve as interim president of UT Austin.[7]\n\n\nIn July 2020, in response to concerns raised by student athletes, alumni and other UT Austin community members, Hartzell announced a series of measures designed to create a more diverse and welcoming campus at UT Austin.[8] The measures included: working with a group of students, faculty members, staffers and alumni to allocate a multimillion-dollar investment from Athletics’ revenue to UT Austin programs to recruit, attract, retain and support Black students; renaming the Robert L. Moore Building as the Physics, Math and Astronomy Building; honoring Heman M. Sweatt, UT Austin's first Black student, in a variety of ways on campus; commissioning a new monument for the Precursors, the first Black undergraduates to attend UT Austin; erecting a statue for Julius Whittier, UT Austin's first Black football player; and renaming Joe Jamail Field for Heisman Trophy winners Earl Campbell and Ricky Williams.[9] He has at the same time also received criticism from Black lawmakers and UT students concerning his defence of the song \"Eyes of Texas\" although considered a racist tradition of the university by many [10]\n\n\nThroughout the summer of 2020, Hartzell led UT Austin's response to the COVID-19 crisis, and on August 13, 2020, the UT System Board of Regents announced Hartzell as the sole finalist for the position of UT Austin president.[5]\n\n\nOn September 23, 2020, the UT System Board of Regents unanimously voted to name Hartzell the 30th president of UT Austin, effective immediately.[1]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mekelburg, Madlin (September 23, 2020). \"Jay Hartzell named UT Austin president\". *Austin American-Statesman*.

[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in 1962, Santa Ono is the son of mathematician Takashi Ono, who immigrated to the United States from Japan in the late 1950s. Ono was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where his father worked as an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of British Columbia from 1961 to 1964. As a result, Ono acquired United States citizenship by *jus sanguinis* and Canadian citizenship by *jus soli*.[1] Ono was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Towson, Maryland, where his father worked as a tenured professor at the University of Pennsylvania from 1964 to 1969 and at Johns Hopkins University from 1969 to 2011.[1][5]\n\n\nOno earned a Bachelor of Arts with a major in biological science from the University of Chicago in 1984 and a Doctor of Philosophy in experimental medicine from McGill University in Canada in 1991.[6]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Science and research[edit]\n\n\nOno completed his postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University supported by the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation[7] and then held faculty positions at Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, University College London, and Emory University. He was GlaxoSmithKline Chair of Biomedical Science and head of the department of immunology at the University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and honorary staff member at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.[8] From March 2006 until September 2008, he served as vice provost for academic initiatives and deputy to the provost at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. He was promoted to senior vice provost for undergraduate education and academic affairs of Emory University in September 2008 and also served as professor of ophthalmology, medicine, pediatrics and biology. In September 2010, he became senior vice president and provost for academic affairs at the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Human Major Histocompatibility Complex : HLA region of Chromosome 6.

Allergic conjunctivitis involves mast cell-dependent inflammation in the mucosal surface (conjunctiva) of the eye. Macular degeneration results from photoreceptor death in the macula.\n![](image)Normal vision.\n![](image)The same view with age-related macular degeneration.\nOno has studied on ocular surface inflammation and the immune basis of age-related macular degeneration. His early work focused on the association of certain MHC haplotypes with susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. Using a number of recombinant and congenic rat strains, the work mapped susceptibility genes in the BB rat to the class II MHC loci. His work also showed that class I and II MHC gene products are expressed at higher levels or de novo on the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans.[9][10][11][12] He focused much of his research in the next decade on the regulation of MHC gene expression.[13] He showed that the different class II MHC isotypes are differentially expressed[14] and showed that the X2-box cis-element controls this differential expression.[15] His work also showed that the bZIP transcription factor: XBP1 forms a hetero-dimer with c-Fos.[16] This has turned out to be relevant to the developmental control of B cell differentiation. His lab also discovered the NFX1 transcription factor and cloned both the human and murine cDNAs.[17][18] This factor can bind DNA, RNA and protein via a reiterated RING finger motifs in the central domain of the polypeptide. The protein appears to have important roles in neuronal development and mRNA transport.[19][20] NFX1 is also a probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase.[21] These enzymes are of interest as they have been shown to participate in 3 metabolic pathways: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, parkinson's disease, and huntington's disease. His lab also demonstrated that the non- histone chromosomal protein HMGA is required for the induction of multiple genes, including MHC genes, interferon-gamma and rhodopsin.[22][23][24][25] They mapped the interaction of HMGA1a and the paired homeodomain motif within Crx and showed that these interactions help recruit such transcriptional activators to the promoter/enhancer.[24][26]\n\n\nUsing transgenic mouse technology, they also showed (concurrently and independently of Alfredo Fusco), that fusion proteins between HMGA2 and other C terminal peptides (following chromosomal translocation) can drive the development of lipomas and generate obese mice.[27] Further contributions in the field include the mapping of the HMGA2 promoter/enhancer.[28][29]\n\n\nMore recently, his laboratory determined the role of beta-chemokines in mast cell-dependent inflammation in the ocular surface.[30][31] The work showed that chemokines not only contribute to leukocyte recruitment, but can cooperate with other mast cell activation signals to trigger mast cell degranulation.[32] Finally, his lab showed that certain autoantibodies might contribute to the pathogenesis or exacerbation of AMD and other rapid onset retinal degenerative diseases and may constitute useful biomarkers for the screening for AMD and its progression.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Administrative work[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard, he served as head of the Inflammation, Immunity and Transplantation Focus Group at the Schepens Eye Research Institute. There, he served on the executive committee of the Harvard Program in Immunology and on two NIH Training grants within ophthalmology (Ocular Immunology and Molecular Bases of Eye Diseases). He worked with the late president J. Wayne Streilein and COO Ken Trevett and others in developing a strategic plan for the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Harvard and helped attract funding from entities such as the Markey Charitable Trust and the Fidelity Investments.\n\n\nOno was then recruited to University College London to the Cumberlege Chair and then as GSK Professor. Major funding from the Wellcome Trust, Fight for Sight, and GSK supported the development of a new immunology division at the University College London-Institute of Ophthalmology which grew to 27 members.[35] While at UCL, he also took on administrative duties including as associate dean of students and as a member of the University College London Council (the university's governing board).[36]\n\n\nIn 2006, Ono moved to Emory University as senior vice provost for undergraduate education and academic affairs.[37] He had oversight of student enrollment activities, certain aspects of academic affairs and other responsibilities related to initiatives within the university strategic plan.\n\n\nIn June 2010, he was named senior vice president for academic affairs and university provost at the University of Cincinnati, with oversight of budgets, personnel, and planning.[38][39] During that time, he helped lead major initiatives, including Phase I of the university's Academic Master Plan which was released on April 11, 2011.[40]\n\n\nIn 2012, Ono was named the 28th president of the University of Cincinnati,[36] and became the first Asian-American president of that university and in the state of Ohio. At the University of Cincinnati, Ono lead the implementation of the Academic Master Plan that invested $100 million into academics at the institution, including strengthening advising, the Honors Program and Study Abroad.

[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in 1962, Santa Ono is the son of mathematician Takashi Ono, who immigrated to the United States from Japan in the late 1950s. Ono was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where his father worked as an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of British Columbia from 1961 to 1964. As a result, Ono acquired United States citizenship by *jus sanguinis* and Canadian citizenship by *jus soli*.[1] Ono was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Towson, Maryland, where his father worked as a tenured professor at the University of Pennsylvania from 1964 to 1969 and at Johns Hopkins University from 1969 to 2011.[1][5]\n\n\nOno earned a Bachelor of Arts with a major in biological science from the University of Chicago in 1984 and a Doctor of Philosophy in experimental medicine from McGill University in Canada in 1991.[6]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Science and research[edit]\n\n\nOno completed his postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University supported by the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation[7] and then held faculty positions at Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, University College London, and Emory University. He was GlaxoSmithKline Chair of Biomedical Science and head of the department of immunology at the University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and honorary staff member at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.[8] From March 2006 until September 2008, he served as vice provost for academic initiatives and deputy to the provost at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. He was promoted to senior vice provost for undergraduate education and academic affairs of Emory University in September 2008 and also served as professor of ophthalmology, medicine, pediatrics and biology. In September 2010, he became senior vice president and provost for academic affairs at the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Human Major Histocompatibility Complex : HLA region of Chromosome 6.

Allergic conjunctivitis involves mast cell-dependent inflammation in the mucosal surface (conjunctiva) of the eye. Macular degeneration results from photoreceptor death in the macula.\n![](image)Normal vision.\n![](image)The same view with age-related macular degeneration.\nOno has studied on ocular surface inflammation and the immune basis of age-related macular degeneration. His early work focused on the association of certain MHC haplotypes with susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. Using a number of recombinant and congenic rat strains, the work mapped susceptibility genes in the BB rat to the class II MHC loci. His work also showed that class I and II MHC gene products are expressed at higher levels or de novo on the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans.[9][10][11][12] He focused much of his research in the next decade on the regulation of MHC gene expression.[13] He showed that the different class II MHC isotypes are differentially expressed[14] and showed that the X2-box cis-element controls this differential expression.[15] His work also showed that the bZIP transcription factor: XBP1 forms a hetero-dimer with c-Fos.[16] This has turned out to be relevant to the developmental control of B cell differentiation. His lab also discovered the NFX1 transcription factor and cloned both the human and murine cDNAs.[17][18] This factor can bind DNA, RNA and protein via a reiterated RING finger motifs in the central domain of the polypeptide. The protein appears to have important roles in neuronal development and mRNA transport.[19][20] NFX1 is also a probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase.[21] These enzymes are of interest as they have been shown to participate in 3 metabolic pathways: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, parkinson's disease, and huntington's disease. His lab also demonstrated that the non- histone chromosomal protein HMGA is required for the induction of multiple genes, including MHC genes, interferon-gamma and rhodopsin.[22][23][24][25] They mapped the interaction of HMGA1a and the paired homeodomain motif within Crx and showed that these interactions help recruit such transcriptional activators to the promoter/enhancer.[24][26]\n\n\nUsing transgenic mouse technology, they also showed (concurrently and independently of Alfredo Fusco), that fusion proteins between HMGA2 and other C terminal peptides (following chromosomal translocation) can drive the development of lipomas and generate obese mice.[27] Further contributions in the field include the mapping of the HMGA2 promoter/enhancer.[28][29]\n\n\nMore recently, his laboratory determined the role of beta-chemokines in mast cell-dependent inflammation in the ocular surface.[30][31] The work showed that chemokines not only contribute to leukocyte recruitment, but can cooperate with other mast cell activation signals to trigger mast cell degranulation.[32] Finally, his lab showed that certain autoantibodies might contribute to the pathogenesis or exacerbation of AMD and other rapid onset retinal degenerative diseases and may constitute useful biomarkers for the screening for AMD and its progression.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### Administrative work[edit]\n\n\nAt Harvard, he served as head of the Inflammation, Immunity and Transplantation Focus Group at the Schepens Eye Research Institute. There, he served on the executive committee of the Harvard Program in Immunology and on two NIH Training grants within ophthalmology (Ocular Immunology and Molecular Bases of Eye Diseases). He worked with the late president J. Wayne Streilein and COO Ken Trevett and others in developing a strategic plan for the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Harvard and helped attract funding from entities such as the Markey Charitable Trust and the Fidelity Investments.\n\n\nOno was then recruited to University College London to the Cumberlege Chair and then as GSK Professor. Major funding from the Wellcome Trust, Fight for Sight, and GSK supported the development of a new immunology division at the University College London-Institute of Ophthalmology which grew to 27 members.[35] While at UCL, he also took on administrative duties including as associate dean of students and as a member of the University College London Council (the university's governing board).[36]\n\n\nIn 2006, Ono moved to Emory University as senior vice provost for undergraduate education and academic affairs.[37] He had oversight of student enrollment activities, certain aspects of academic affairs and other responsibilities related to initiatives within the university strategic plan.\n\n\nIn June 2010, he was named senior vice president for academic affairs and university provost at the University of Cincinnati, with oversight of budgets, personnel, and planning.[38][39] During that time, he helped lead major initiatives, including Phase I of the university's Academic Master Plan which was released on April 11, 2011.[40]\n\n\nIn 2012, Ono was named the 28th president of the University of Cincinnati,[36] and became the first Asian-American president of that university and in the state of Ohio. At the University of Cincinnati, Ono lead the implementation of the Academic Master Plan that invested $100 million into academics at the institution, including strengthening advising, the Honors Program and Study Abroad. During his tenure the university completed a $1 billion capital campaign 5 months ahead of schedule. Considerable investment in the campus and surrounding area occurred during his tenure, including renovations of 6 colleges and of Nippert Stadium and Fifth Third Arena. U Square at the Loop, a $78 million mixed use development was opened during his presidency.[41] The University of Cincinnati also invested heavily in faculty recruitment, bringing more than 300 new faculty to the university in cluster hires.\n\n\nInside Higher Education named Ono America's most notable university president in 2015.[42] Upworthy has profiled him as one of 9 high-profile CEOs in the world who exemplify servant leadership.[43]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2016, Ono was named the 15th president and vice chancellor of the University of British Columbia in Canada, effective August 15.[44] He was re-appointed for a second five-year term on August 11, 2020.[45]\n\n\nOn July 13, 2022, Ono was named the 15th president of the University of Michigan in the United States. He became the first Asian American to lead the university when his five-year term began.[2][46]\n\n\n\n### Public communications[edit]\n\n\nOno has written on research and innovation,[47] college rankings,[48] healthcare,[49] STEM education,[50] diversity,[50] social media,[51] and more.[51]\n\n\nOno has also reached out to the public by giving talks at K–12 schools in the US, the UK and Canada and to the general public at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, where he gave talks to K–12 students in the Student Education program and to adult audiences in the Talking Points Evening Lecture Series.[52] He has also served as an invited panelist to discuss the Reith Lectures at Windsor Castle on BBC Radio 4.\n\n\nHe has spoken and written frequently on the issue of mental health in adolescents and young adults and advocated for enhanced funding for identifying at-risk youth and for early mental health interventions.[53][54]\n\n\nDuring his term as president of the University of Michigan, Santa Ono showed strong support against terrorism. Santa Ono condemned the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas twice[55][56] and prevented tearing down posters of Israeli hostages hang around the campus.[57]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nOno received an honorary doctorate degree from Chiba University in Japan in 2016[58] and an honorary doctor of divinity from the Vancouver School of Theology of the University of British Columbia in 2020.[59]\n\n\nOno is the recipient of the Pharmacia International Award in Allergy Research (the top international prize awarded to inflammation researchers under the age of 40), a Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship, the American Diabetes Association Career Development Award, the Arthritis Foundation Investigator Award, a Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust Award, the Medal in Bronze from Osaka City University and the Roche Award presented at University of Texas Medical Branch.\n\n\nIn 2016, he was awarded the Reginald Wilson Diversity Leadership Award from the American Council on Education and the NAAAP100 Award from the National Association of Asian American Professionals. In 2017, he received a Professional Achievement Award from the University of Chicago Alumni Association.[60] He has been recognized as an outstanding mentor at Phi Beta Kappa ceremonies and received the JW McConnell Award for Potential in Teaching at McGill University.\n\n\nOno was elected into the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2022 [61] He has also been elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Academy of Inventors, the Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars, the Royal Society of Medicine, the Royal Society of Chemistry and Fellow of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was elected International Fellow, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and of the Collegium Internationale Allergologicum and in 2017 the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences.[62] He has been a member of the Faculty of 1000 since 2003.[63]\n\n\nHe has delivered plenary or major lectures at: the International Congress of Immunology, the International Congress of Eye Research, the Annual Meetings of ARVO and AAAAI and the Kyoto Cornea Conference. Ono has been a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Visiting Professor at Kyoto University and a Genentech Visiting Professor at the University of Cincinnati.\n\n\n\n## Advisory roles[edit]\n\n\nOn January 23, 2017, Ono was appointed chief advisor of the British Columbia Innovation Network and a member of the British Columbia Technology Council.[64]\n\n\nOno has served on the governing bodies/board of trustees of University College London, Intervarsity Christian Fellowship US, World Affairs Council of Cincinnati, Alois Alzheimer Center, Strive for College, the Japan America Society, the Taft Center at University of Cincinnati, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, University of Cincinnati Foundation and Trent School Cockfosters, Church of England.
