Xi has also served as the president of the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 2013. He belongs to the fifth generation of Chinese leadership.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This article is part of a series about\nXi Jinping |\n\n |\n| * **Xi Jinping Administration**\n* 2012 election as General Secretary\n* 2017 reelection as General Secretary\n* 2022 reelection as General Secretary\n* New Zhijiang Army\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nPolicies and theories\n* Belt and Road Initiative\n* Chinese Dream\n* Common prosperity\n* Four Confidences\n* Four Comprehensives\n* Comprehensively Deepening Reforms\n* Chinese-style modernization\n* Foreign policy\n* Eight Musts\n* Eight-point Regulation\n* New productive forces\n* Targeted Poverty Alleviation\n* Two Establishes and Two Upholds\n* Xi Jinping Thought\n\t+ Culture\n\t+ Diplomacy\n* Holistic security concept\n* Personality cult\n* Party media takes the party's last name\n* Three Stricts and Three Honests\n* Two Centenaries\n* Wolf warrior diplomacy\n* Whole-process people's democracy\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nKey events\n* Anti-corruption campaign\n* 709 crackdown\n* Persecution of Uyghurs in China\n\t+ Xinjiang internment camps\n* China\u2013US trade war\n* 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n\t+ Response\n* CCP centenary\n* Historical resolution\n* 2020\u20132021 reform spree\n* 2022 Hong Kong visit\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nDiplomatic activities\n* Xi\u2013Chu meeting\n* Xi\u2013Ma Meeting\n* Xi\u2013Kim meetings\n* 2015 Pakistan visit\n* 2015 United States visit\n* 2015 United Kingdom visit\n* 2019 Italy and France visit\n* CPC and World Political Parties Summit\n* 2023 Russia visit\n* 2024 France, Serbia and Hungary visit\n\n\n\n---\n\n* *Speech series*\n* *Governance of China*\n\n\n\n---\n\n |\n| ![](image)\u3000![](image)![](image) |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran Xi Zhongxun, Xi was exiled to rural Yanchuan County as a teenager following his father's purge during the Cultural Revolution. He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the Central Secretariat in October 2007. In 2008, he was designated as Hu Jintao's presumed successor as paramount leader; to that end, Xi was appointed vice president of the PRC and vice chairman of the CMC. He officially received the title of leadership core from the CCP in 2016.\n\n\nXi is the first CCP general secretary born after the establishment of the PRC. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China's relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. He has also promoted \"common prosperity\", a series of policies designed with stated goal to increase equality, and used the term to justify a broad crackdown and major slew of regulations against the tech and tutoring sectors in 2021. Xi met with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou in 2015, the first time PRC and Republic of China leaders met, though relations deteriorated after Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016. He responded to the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China with a zero-COVID approach from January 2020 until December 2022, afterwards shifting towards a mitigation strategy. Xi also oversaw the passage of a national security law in Hong Kong, clamping down on political opposition in the city, especially pro-democracy activists.\n\n\nOften described as an authoritarian leader by political and academic observers, Xi's tenure has included an increase of censorship and mass surveillance, deterioration in human rights, including the internment of one million Uyghurs in Xinjiang (which some observers have described as part of a genocide), a cult of personality developing around Xi, and the removal of term limits for the presidency in 2018. Xi's political ideas and principles, known as Xi Jinping Thought, have been incorporated into the party and national constitutions, and he has emphasized the importance of national security and the need for CCP leadership over the country. As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the PRC, Xi has centralized institutional power by taking on multiple positions, including chairing the National Security Commission and new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. He and the CCP Central Committee passed a \"historical resolution\" in November 2021, the third such resolution after Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, the second leader of the CCP to do so after Mao, and in March 2023 was reelected state president for a third term, the first head of state to be so.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nXi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953,[2] the third child of Xi Zhongxun and his second wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (\u5b89\u5b89; *\u0100n'\u0101n*), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nXi went to the Beijing Bayi School,[7][8] and then the Beijing No. 25 School,[9] in the 1960s. He became friends with Liu He, who attended Beijing No. 101 School in the same district, who later became China's vice premier and a close advisor to Xi after he became China's paramount leader.[10][11] In 1963, when he was aged 10, his father was purged from the CCP and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan.[12] In May 1966, the Cultural Revolution cut short Xi's secondary education when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. Student militants ransacked the Xi family home and one of Xi's sisters, Xi Heping, committed suicide from the pressure.[13]\n\n\nLater, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement.[14] He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house.[15] According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor.[16] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but he later returned to the village. He then spent a total of seven years there.[17][18]\n\n\nThe misfortunes and suffering of his family in his early years hardened Xi's view of politics. During an interview in 2000, he said, \"People who have little contact with power, who are far from it, always see these things as mysterious and novel. But what I see is not just the superficial things: the power, the flowers, the glory, the applause. I see the bullpens and how people can blow hot and cold. I understand politics on a deeper level.\" The \"bullpens\" (\u725b\u68da) was a reference to Red Guards' detention houses during the Cultural Revolution.[16]\n\n\nAfter seven rejections, Xi joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1971 on his eighth attempt after he befriended a local official.[8] He reunited with his father in 1972, because of a family reunion ordered by premier Zhou Enlai.[13] From 1973, he applied to join the CCP ten times and was finally accepted on his tenth attempt in 1974.[19][20][21] From 1975 to 1979, Xi studied chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student in Beijing. The engineering majors there spent about 15 percent of their time studying Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism and 5 percent of their time doing farm work and \"learning from the People's Liberation Army\".[22]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1979 to 1982, Xi served as secretary for his father's former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and secretary-general of the CMC.[8] In 1982, he was sent to Zhengding County in Hebei as deputy party secretary of Zhengding County. He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county.[23] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982\u20131985), Fujian (1985\u20132002), Zhejiang (2002\u20132007), and Shanghai (2007).[24] Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.[b][25]\n\n\nFrom 1998 to 2002, Xi studied Marxist theory and ideological education in Tsinghua University,[26] graduating with a doctorate in law and ideology in 2002.[27] In 1999, he was promoted to the office of Vice Governor of Fujian, and became governor a year later. In Fujian, Xi made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to strengthen the private sector of the provincial economy.[28] In February 2000, he and then-provincial party secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top members of PSC\u00a0\u2013 general secretary Jiang Zemin, premier Zhu Rongji, vice president Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection secretary Wei Jianxing\u00a0\u2013 to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.[29]\n\n\nIn 2002, Xi left Fujian and took up leading political positions in neighbouring Zhejiang. He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year.[30] His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders.[31] Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi's chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.[32]\n\n\nFollowing the dismissal of Shanghai Party secretary Chen Liangyu in September 2006 due to a social security fund scandal, Xi was transferred to Shanghai in March 2007, where he was the party secretary there for seven months.[33][34] In Shanghai, Xi avoided controversy and was known for strictly observing party discipline. For example, Shanghai administrators attempted to earn favour with him by arranging a special train to shuttle him between Shanghai and Hangzhou for him to complete handing off his work to his successor as Zhejiang party secretary Zhao Hongzhu. However, Xi reportedly refused to take the train, citing a loosely enforced party regulation that stipulated that special trains can only be reserved for \"national leaders\".[35] While in Shanghai, he worked on preserving unity of the local party organisation. He pledged there would be no 'purges' during his administration, despite the fact many local officials were thought to have been implicated in the Chen Liangyu corruption scandal.[36] On most issues, Xi largely echoed the line of the central leadership.[37]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping greeting U.S. president George W. Bush in August 2008\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Russian president Dmitry Medvedev on 28 September 2010\nXi was appointed to the nine-man PSC at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. He was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the first secretary of the CCP's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as vice president of the PRC.[38] Following his elevation, Xi held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new president of the Central Party School of the CCP, its cadre-training and ideological education wing. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. He made his first foreign trip as vice president to North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008.[39] After the Olympics, Xi was assigned the post of committee chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of the PRC. He was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level CCP committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of politically sensitive anniversaries in 2009.[40]\n\n\nXi's position as the apparent successor to become the paramount leader was threatened with the rapid rise of Bo Xilai, the party secretary of Chongqing at the time. Bo was expected to join the PSC at the 18th Party Congress, with most expecting that he would try to eventually maneuver himself into replacing Xi.[41] Bo's policies in Chongqing inspired imitations throughout China and received praise from Xi himself during Xi's visit to Chongqing in 2010. Records of praises from Xi were later erased after he became paramount leader. Bo's downfall would come with the Wang Lijun incident, which opened the door for Xi to come to power without challengers.[42]\n\n\nXi is considered one of the most successful members of the Princelings, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Former prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was \"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations\".[43] Lee also commented: \"I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive\".[44] Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as \"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line\".[45] Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi \"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man\".[46]\n\n\n\n### Trips as Vice President[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2009, in his capacity as vice-president, Xi Jinping embarked on a tour of Latin America, visiting Mexico,[47] Jamaica,[48] Colombia,[49] Venezuela,[50] Brazil,[51] and Malta, after which he returned to China.[52] On 11 February 2009, while visiting Mexico, Xi spoke in front of a group of overseas Chinese and explained China's contributions during the international financial crisis, saying that it was \"the greatest contribution towards the whole of human race, made by China, to prevent its 1.3\u00a0billion people from hunger\".[c] He went on to remark: \"There are some bored foreigners, with full stomachs, who have nothing better to do than point fingers at us. First, China doesn't export revolution; second, China doesn't export hunger and poverty; third, China doesn't come and cause you headaches. What more is there to be said?\"[d][53] The story was reported on some local television stations. The news led to a flood of discussions on Chinese Internet forums and it was reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was caught off-guard by Xi's remarks, as the actual video was shot by some accompanying Hong Kong reporters and broadcast on Hong Kong TV, which then turned up on various Internet video websites.[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Muscatine, Iowa house where Xi stayed with an American family during a 1985 agricultural visit to the United States. The home was turned into a museum decades later.\nIn the European Union, Xi visited Belgium, Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania from 7 to 21 October 2009.[55] He visited Japan, South Korea, Cambodia, and Myanmar on his Asian trip from 14 to 22 December 2009.[56] He later visited the United States, Ireland and Turkey in February 2012. This visit included meeting with then U.S. president Barack Obama at the White House[57] and then vice president Joe Biden; and stops in California and Iowa, where he met with the family that previously hosted him during his 1985 tour as a Hebei provincial official.[58]\n\n\n\n### Accession to top posts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Generations of Chinese leadership and Succession of power in China\n\nA few months before his ascendancy to the party leadership, Xi disappeared from official media coverage and cancelled meeting with foreign officials for several weeks beginning on 1 September 2012, causing rumors.[8] He then reappeared on 15 September.[59] On 15 November 2012, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee of the CCP. This made him, informally, the paramount leader and the first to be born after the founding of the PRC. The following day Xi led the new line-up of the PSC onto the stage in their first public appearance.[60] The PSC was reduced from nine to seven, with only Xi and Li Keqiang retaining their seats; the other five members were new.[61][62][63] In a marked departure from the common practice of Chinese leaders, Xi's first speech as general secretary was plainly worded and did not include any political slogans or mention his predecessors.[64] Xi mentioned the aspirations of the average person, remarking, \"Our people ... expect better education, more stable jobs, better income, more reliable social security, medical care of a higher standard, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful environment.\" Xi also vowed to tackle corruption at the highest levels, alluding that it would threaten the CCP's survival; he was reticent about far-reaching economic reforms.[65]\n\n\nIn December 2012, Xi visited Guangdong in his first trip outside Beijing since taking the Party leadership. The overarching theme of the trip was to call for further economic reform and a strengthened military. Xi visited the statue of Deng Xiaoping and his trip was described as following in the footsteps of Deng's own southern trip in 1992, which provided the impetus for further economic reforms in China after conservative party leaders stalled many of Deng's reforms in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. On his trip, Xi consistently alluded to his signature slogan, the \"Chinese Dream\". \"This dream can be said to be the dream of a strong nation. And for the military, it is a dream of a strong military\", Xi told sailors.[66] Xi's trip was significant in that he departed from the established convention of Chinese leaders' travel routines in multiple ways. Rather than dining out, Xi and his entourage ate regular hotel buffet. He travelled in a large van with his colleagues rather than a fleet of limousines, and did not restrict traffic on the parts of the highway he travelled.[67]\n\n\nXi was elected president on 14 March 2013, in a confirmation vote by the 12th National People's Congress in Beijing. He received 2,952 for, one vote against, and three abstentions.[60] He replaced Hu Jintao, who retired after serving two terms.[68] In his new capacity as president, on 16 March 2013 Xi expressed support for non-interference in China\u2013Sri Lanka relations amid a United Nations Security Council vote to condemn that country over government abuses during the Sri Lankan Civil War.[69] On 17 March, Xi and his new ministers arranged a meeting with the chief executive of Hong Kong, CY Leung, confirming his support for Leung.[70] Within hours of his election, Xi discussed cyber security and North Korea with U.S. President Barack Obama over the phone. Obama announced the visits of treasury and state secretaries Jacob Lew and John F. Kerry to China the following week.[71]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping Administration\n\n### Anti-corruption campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping\n\n> \n> \u201cTo speak the truth\u201d means to focus on the nature of things, to speak frankly, and follow the truth. This is an important embodiment of a leading official\u2019s characteristics of truth seeking, embodying justice, devotion to public interests, and uprightness. Moreover, he highlighted that the premise of telling the truth is to listen to the truth.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Xi Jinping during a speech in 2012[72][73]\n\nXi vowed to crack down on corruption almost immediately after he ascended to power at the 18th Party Congress. In his inaugural speech as general secretary, Xi mentioned that fighting corruption was one of the toughest challenges for the party.[74] A few months into his term, Xi outlined the Eight-point Regulation, listing rules intended to curb corruption and waste during official party business; it aimed at stricter discipline on the conduct of party officials. Xi also vowed to root out \"tigers and flies\", that is, high-ranking officials and ordinary party functionaries.[75]\n\n\nXi initiated cases against former CMC vice-chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, former PSC member and security chief Zhou Yongkang and former Hu Jintao chief aide Ling Jihua.[76] Along with new disciplinary chief Wang Qishan, Xi's administration spearheaded the formation of \"centrally-dispatched inspection teams\" (\u4e2d\u592e\u5de1\u89c6\u7ec4). These were essentially cross-jurisdictional squads of officials whose main task was to gain more in-depth understanding of the operations of provincial and local party organizations, and in the process, also enforce party discipline mandated by Beijing. Many of the work teams also had the effect of identifying and initiating investigations of high-ranking officials. Over one hundred provincial-ministerial level officials were implicated during a massive nationwide anti-corruption campaign. These included former and current regional officials (Su Rong, Bai Enpei, Wan Qingliang), leading figures of state-owned enterprises and central government organs (Song Lin, Liu Tienan), and highly ranked generals in the military (Gu Junshan). In June 2014, the Shanxi provincial political establishment was decimated, with four officials dismissed within a week from the provincial party organization's top ranks. Within the first two years of the campaign alone, over 200,000 low-ranking officials received warnings, fines, and demotions.[77]\n\n\nThe campaign has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including members of the PSC.[78] Xi's anti-corruption campaign is seen by critics, such as *The Economist*, as a political tool with the aim of removing potential opponents and consolidating power.[79][80] Xi's establishment of a new anti-corruption agency, the National Supervision Commission, ranked higher than the supreme court, has been described by Amnesty International's East Asia director as a \"systemic threat to human rights\" that \"places tens of millions of people at the mercy of a secretive and virtually unaccountable system that is above the law.\"[81][82]\n\n\nXi has overseen significant reforms of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CCP's highest internal control institution.[83] He and CCDI Secretary Wang Qishan further institutionalized CCDI's independence from the day-to-day operations of the CCP, improving its ability to function as a *bona fide* control body.[83] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, any anti-corruption punishment to officials at or above the vice ministerial level need approval from Xi.[84] Another article from *The Wall Street Journal* said that when he wants to neutralize a political rival, he asks inspectors to prepare hundreds of pages of evidence. The article also said that he sometimes authorizes investigations on close associates of a high-ranking politician to replace them with his own proteges and puts political rivals in less important positions to separate them from their political bases. Reportedly, these tactics have even been used against Wang Qishan, Xi's close friend.[85]\n\n\nAccording to historian and sinologist Wang Gungwu, Xi Jinping inherited a political party that was faced with pervasive corruption.[86][87] Xi believed that the amount of corruption at the higher levels of the CCP put both the party and the country at risk of collapse.[86] Wang further adds that Xi has a belief that only the CCP is capable of governing China, and that a collapse of the party would be disastrous for the Chinese people. Xi and the new generational leaders reacted by launching the anti-corruption campaign to eliminate corruption at the higher levels of the government.[86]\n\n\n\n### Censorship[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Censorship in China and Internet censorship in China\n\nSince Xi became the CCP general secretary, censorship, including internet censorship, has been significantly stepped up.[88][89] Chairing the 2018 China Cyberspace Governance Conference on 20 and 21 April 2018, Xi committed to \"fiercely crack down on criminal offenses including hacking, telecom fraud, and violation of citizens' privacy.\"[90] During a visit to Chinese state media, Xi stated that \"party and government-owned media must hold the family name of the party\" (\u515a\u548c\u653f\u5e9c\u4e3b\u529e\u7684\u5a92\u4f53\u5fc5\u987b\u59d3\u515a) and that the state media \"must embody the party's will, safeguard the party's authority\".[91]\n\n\nHis administration has overseen more Internet restrictions imposed in China, and is described as being \"stricter across the board\" on speech than previous administrations.[92] Xi has taken a very strong stand to control internet usage inside China, including Google and Facebook,[93] advocating Internet censorship in the country under the concept of internet sovereignty.[94][95] The censorship of Wikipedia has also been stringent; in April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia were blocked in China.[96] Likewise, the situation for users of Weibo has been described as a change from fearing that individual posts would be deleted, or at worst one's account, to fear of arrest.[97]\n\n\nA law enacted in September 2013 authorized a three-year prison term for bloggers who shared more than 500 times any content considered \"defamatory\".[98] The State Internet Information Department summoned a group of influential bloggers to a seminar instructing them to avoid writing about politics, the CCP, or making statements contradicting official narratives. Many bloggers stopped writing about controversial topics, and Weibo went into decline, with much of its readership shifting to WeChat users speaking to very limited social circles.[98] In 2017, telecommunications carriers in China were instructed by the government to block individuals' use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) by February 2018.[99]\n\n\nXi has spoken out against \"historical nihilism\", meaning historical viewpoints that challenge the official line of the CCP.[100] Xi said that one of the reasons for the collapse of the Soviet Union has been historical nihilism.[101] The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has established a telephone hotline for people to report acts of historical nihilism, while Toutiao and Douyin urged its user to report instances of historical nihilism.[102] In May 2021, the CAC reported that it removed two million online posts for historical nihilism.[103]\n\n\n\n### Consolidation of power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Xi in Beijing, September 2015\nSee also: New Zhijiang Army and Fujian clique\n\nPolitical observers have called Xi the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, especially since the ending of presidential two-term limits in 2018.[104][105][106][107] Xi has notably departed from the collective leadership practices of his post-Mao predecessors. He has centralised his power and created working groups with himself at the head to subvert government bureaucracy, making himself become the unmistakable central figure of the new administration.[108] Beginning in 2013, the CCP under Xi has created a series of Central Leading Groups: supra-ministerial steering committees, designed to bypass existing institutions when making decisions, and ostensibly make policy-making a more efficient process. The most notable new body is the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms. It has broad jurisdiction over economic restructuring and social reforms, and is said to have displaced some of the power previously held by the State Council and its premier.[109]\n\n\nXi also became the leader of the Central Leading Group for Internet Security and Informatization, in charge of cyber-security and Internet policy. The Third Plenum held in 2013 also saw the creation of the National Security Commission of the CCP, another body chaired by Xi, which commentators have said would help Xi consolidate over national security affairs.[110][111] In the opinion of at least one political scientist, Xi \"has surrounded himself with cadres he met while stationed on the coast, Fujian and Shanghai and in Zhejiang.\"[112] Control of Beijing is seen as crucial to Chinese leaders; Xi has selected Cai Qi, one of the cadres mentioned above, to manage the capital.[113] Xi was also believed to have diluted the authority of premier Li Keqiang, taking authority over the economy which has generally been considered to be the domain of the premier.[114][115]\n\n\nSince coming to power, various observers have said that Xi has seriously diluted the influence of the once-dominant \"Tuanpai\", also called the Youth League Faction, which were CCP officials who rose through the Party's Communist Youth League (CYLC).[116] He criticized the cadres of the CYLC, saying that [these cadres] can't talk about science, literature and art, work or life [with young people]. All they can do is just repeat the same old bureaucratic, stereotypical talk.\"[117] Its budget was also cut, dropping from around 700 million yuan ($96 million) in 2012 to 260 million yuan ($40 million) in 2021, while its membership dropped from 90 million to 74 million in the same period.[116] He also led to the closure of the Central School of the Communist Youth League of China, merging it with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and effectively demoted Qin Yizhi, first secretary of the CYLC, in 2017.[118]\n\n\nIn March 2018, the National People's Congress (NPC) passed a set of constitutional amendments including removal of term limits for the president and vice president, the creation of a National Supervisory Commission, as well as enhancing the central role of the CCP.[119][120] On 17 March 2018, the Chinese legislature reappointed Xi as president, now without term limits; Wang Qishan was appointed vice president.[121][122] The following day, Li Keqiang was reappointed premier and longtime allies of Xi, Xu Qiliang and Zhang Youxia, were voted in as vice-chairmen of the CMC.[123] Foreign minister Wang Yi was promoted to state councillor and General Wei Fenghe was named defence minister.[124] According to the *Financial Times*, Xi expressed his views of constitutional amendment at meetings with Chinese officials and foreign dignitaries. Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts\u2014general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC\u2014which have no term limits. However, Xi did not say whether he intended to serve as party general secretary, CMC chairman and state president, for three or more terms.[125]\n\n\nIn its sixth plenary session in November 2021, CCP adopted a historical resolution, a kind of document that evaluated the party's history. This was the third of its kind after ones adopted by Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping,[126][127] and the document for the first time credited Xi as being the \"main innovator\" of Xi Jinping Thought[128] while also declaring Xi's leadership as being \"the key to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".[129] In comparison with the other historical resolutions, Xi's one did not herald a major change in how the CCP evaluated its history.[130] To accompany the historical resolution, the CCP promoted the terms Two Establishes and Two Safeguards, calling the CCP to unite around and protect Xi's core status within the party.[131] In 2022, Xi appointed his close ally Wang Xiaohong as the Minister of Public Security, giving him further control over the security establishment.[132]\n\n\nThe 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, held between 16 and 22 October 2022, has overseen amendments in the CCP constitution and the re-election of Xi as general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC for a third term, with the overall result of the Congress being further strengthening of Xi's power.[133] The newly amended CCP constitution included the term two safeguards, reinforcing Xi's power.[134] It also included concepts promoted by Xi like common prosperity, \"Chinese-style modernization\" and \"whole-process people's democracy\".[135] Xi's re-election made him the first party leader since Mao Zedong to be chosen for a third term, though Deng Xiaoping ruled the country informally for a longer period.[136] Xi was further re-elected as the PRC president and chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission on 10 March 2023 during the opening of the 14th National People's Congress.[137]\n\n\nThe new Politburo Standing Committee elected just after the CCP Congress was filled almost completely with people close to Xi, with four out of the seven members of the previous PSC including premier Li Keqiang and CPPCC chairman Wang Yang stepping down.[138] Li Qiang, a close Xi ally, became the second-ranking member of the PSC, and was further promoted to premier in 2023.[133][139] Other allies of Xi, including Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang and Li Xi have also joined the PSC, and became the first secretary of the CCP Secretariat, first vice premier, and secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection respectively.[140] The only remaining members of the previous PSC except Xi were Zhao Leji and Wang Huning, though their ranking and positions changed,[140] and became the NPC Standing Committee and CPPCC chairmen respectively on 10 March 2023.[141][142] Reuters remarked that the retirement of Wang Yang and Li Keqiang, as well as the demotion of vice premier Hu Chunhua from the Politburo meant the wipeout of Tuanpai,[116] while Willy Wo-Lap Lam wrote that there were no representatives from the Tuanpai or the Shanghai clique, leading to a total dominance of Xi's own faction.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Cult of personality[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping's cult of personality\n\nXi has had a cult of personality constructed around himself since entering office[144][145] with books, cartoons, pop songs and dance routines honouring his rule.[146] Following Xi's ascension to the leadership core of the CCP, he had been referred to as *Xi Dada* (\u4e60\u5927\u5927, Uncle or Papa Xi),[146][147] though this stopped in April 2016.[148] The village of Liangjiahe, where Xi was sent to work, has become a \"modern-day shrine\" decorated with CCP propaganda and murals extolling the formative years of his life.[149] The CCP's Politburo named Xi Jinping *lingxiu* (\u9886\u8896), a reverent term for \"leader\" and a title previously only given to Mao Zedong and his immediate successor Hua Guofeng.[150][151][152] He is also sometimes called the \"pilot at the helm\" (\u9886\u822a\u638c\u8235).[153] On 25 December 2019, the Politburo officially named Xi as \"People's Leader\" (\u4eba\u6c11\u9886\u8896; *r\u00e9nm\u00edn l\u01d0ngxi\u00f9*), a title only Mao had held previously.[154]\n\n\n\n### Economy and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of China\n\nXi was initially seen as a market reformist,[155] and the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee under him announced that \"market forces\" would begin to play a \"decisive\" role in allocating resources.[156] This meant that the state would gradually reduce its involvement in the distribution of capital, and restructure China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to allow further competition, potentially by attracting foreign and private sector players in industries that were previously highly regulated. This policy aimed to address the bloated state sector that had unduly profited from an earlier round of re-structuring by purchasing assets at below-market prices, assets that were no longer being used productively. Xi also launched the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone in August 2013, which was seen as part of the economic reforms.[157] In However, by 2017, Xi's promise of economic reforms has been said to stall by experts.[158][155] In 2015, the Chinese stock market bubble popped, which led Xi to use state forces to fix the issue.[159] From 2012 to 2022, the share of the market value of private sector firms in China's top listed companies has increased from around 10% to over 40%.[160] He has also overseen the relaxation of restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) and increased cross-border holdings of stocks and bonds.[160]\n\n\nXi has increased state control over China's economy, voicing support for SOEs,[161][155] while also supporting the country's private sector.[162] CCP control of SOEs has increased under Xi, while some limited steps towards market liberalization, such as increasing mixed ownership of SOEs were also undertaken.[163] Under Xi, \"government guidance funds\", public-private investment funds set up by or for government bodies, have raised more than $900 billion for early funding to companies that work in sectors the government deems as strategic.[164] Xi has increased the role of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission at the expense of the State Council.[165] His administration made it easier for banks to issue mortgages, increased foreign participation in the bond market, and increased the national currency renminbi's global role, helping it to join IMF's basket of special drawing right.[166] In the 40th anniversary of the launching of Chinese economic reforms in 2018, he has promised to continue reforms but has warned that nobody \"can dictate to the Chinese people\".[167]\n\n\nXi has also personally made eradicating extreme poverty through \"targeted poverty alleviation\" a key goal.[168] In 2021, Xi declared a \"complete victory\" over extreme poverty, saying that nearly 100 million people have been lifted out of poverty under his tenure, though some experts said that China's poverty threshold was relatively lower than the one set by the World Bank.[169] In 2020, premier Li Keqiang, citing the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said that China still had 600 million people living with less than 1000 yuan ($140) a month, although an article from *The Economist* said that the methodology NBS used was flawed, stating that the figure took the combined income, which was then equally divided.[170]\n\n\nChina's economy has grown under Xi, with GDP in nominal terms more than doubling from $8.53 trillion in 2012 to $17.73 trillion in 2021,[171] while China's nominal GDP per capita surpassed the world average in 2021,[172] though the rate of growth has slowed from 7.9% in 2012 to 6% in 2019.[173] Xi has stressed the importance of \"high-quality growth\" rather than \"inflated growth\".[174] He has additionally stated that China will focus on quality of economic growth and that it has abandoned a growth-at-all-costs strategy which Xi refers to as \"GDP heroism\".[175]:\u200a22 Instead, Xi said that other social issues such as environmental protection are important.[175]:\u200a22 His administration pursued a debt-deleveraging campaign, seeking to slow and cut the unsustainable amount of debt China has accrued during its economic growth.[176] Though China's total non-financial-sector debt-to-GDP ratio reached a record 270.9% by 2020 during the COVID-19 crisis, it fell to reach around 262.5% by 2021 before going up again to 273.2% in 2022, mainly due to the pressure put by the zero-COVID policy to local finances.[177]\n\n\nXi has circulated a policy called \"dual circulation\", meaning reorienting the economy towards domestic consumption while remaining open to foreign trade and investment.[178] Xi has also made boosting productivity in the economy a priority.[179] Xi has attempted to reform the property sector to combat the steep increase in the property prices and to cut Chinese economy's dependence on the real estate sector.[180] In the 19th CCP National Congress, Xi declared \"Houses are built to be inhabited, not for speculation\".[181] In 2020, Xi's government formulated the \"three red lines\" policy that aimed to deleverage the heavily indebted property sector.[182] Xi additionally has supported a property tax, for which he has faced resistance from members of the CCP.[183]\n\n\nXi's administration has promoted \"Made in China 2025\" plan that aims to make China self-reliant in key technologies, although publicly China de-emphasised this plan due to the outbreak of a trade war with the U.S. Since the outbreak of the trade war in 2018, Xi has revived calls for \"self-reliance\", especially on the matters of technology.[184] Domestic spending on R&D has significantly increased under Xi, surpassing the total of the European Union (EU) and reaching a record $564 billion in 2020.[185] In August 2022, Xi's administration has allocated more than $100 billion to support China's efforts at semiconductor independence.[186] The Chinese government has also supported technology companies like Huawei through grants, tax breaks, credit facilities and other forms of assistance, enabling their rise but also leading to countermeasures by the U.S.[187] Xi has also been personally involved in the development of Xiong'an, a new area announced in 2017, planned to become a major metropolis near Beijing and Tianjin in Hebei province; the relocation aspect is estimated to last until 2035 while it is planned to developed into a \"modern socialist city\" by 2050.[188]\n\n\n\n> \n> Common prosperity is an essential requirement of socialism and a key feature of Chinese-style modernization. The common prosperity we are pursuing is for all, affluence both in material and spiritual life, but not for a small portion nor for uniform egalitarianism.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Xi Jinping during a speech in 2021[189]\n\nIn November 2020, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Xi personally ordered a halt to Ant Group's initial public offering (IPO), in reaction to its founder Jack Ma criticizing government regulation in finance.[190] Xi's administration has also overseen a decrease in offshore IPOs by Chinese companies, with most Chinese IPOs taking place either in Shanghai or Shenzhen as of 2022[update], and has increasingly directed funding to IPOs of companies that works in sectors it deems as strategic, including electric vehicles, biotechnology, renewable energy, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and other high-technology manufacturing.[164]\n\n\nSince 2021, Xi has promoted the term \"common prosperity\", a term which he defined as an \"essential requirement of socialism\", described as affluence for all and said entailed reasonable adjustments to excess incomes.[189][191] Common prosperity has been used as the justification for large-scale crackdowns and regulations towards the perceived \"excesses\" of several sectors, most prominently tech and tutoring industries.[192] The examples of actions taken against tech companies have included fining large tech companies[193] and passing of laws such as the Data Security Law. China also banned private tutoring companies from making profits and teaching school syllabus during weekends and holidays, effectively destroying the whole industry.[194] Xi additionally opened a new stock exchange in Beijing targeted for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which was another part of his common prosperity campaign.[195] There have also been other numerous cultural regulations, such as limiting video game usage by minors to 90 minutes during weekdays and 3 hours during weekends,[196] complete banning of cryptocurrency,[197] cracking down on idol worship, fandom and celebrity culture[198] and cracking down on \"sissy men\".[199] *The Wall Street Journal* has also reported in October 2021 that Xi had launched a round of inspections of the country's financial institutions, including state-owned banks, investment funds and financial regulators, on whether their ties to private firms had become too close, with the investigations being led by Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.[200]\n\n\n\n### Reforms[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2013, at the conclusion of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, the Communist Party delivered a far-reaching reform agenda that alluded to changes in both economic and social policy. Xi signaled at the plenum that he was consolidating control of the massive internal security organization that was formerly the domain of Zhou Yongkang.[156] A new National Security Commission was formed with Xi at its helm. The Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reforms\u2014another *ad hoc* policy coordination body led by Xi upgraded to a commission in 2018\u2014was also formed to oversee the implementation of the reform agenda.[201] Termed \"comprehensive deepening reforms\" (\u5168\u9762\u6df1\u5316\u6539\u9769; *qu\u00e1nmi\u00e0n sh\u0113nhu\u00e0 g\u01ceig\u00e9*), they were said to be the most significant since Deng Xiaoping's 1992 Southern Tour. The plenum also announced economic reforms and resolved to abolish the *laogai* system of \"re-education through labour\", which was largely seen as a blot on China's human rights record. The system has faced significant criticism for years from domestic critics and foreign observers.[156] In January 2016, a two-child policy replaced the one-child policy,[202] which was in turn was replaced with a three-child policy in May 2021.[203] In July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed.[204]\n\n\n\n#### Political reforms[edit]\n\n\nXi's administration taken a number of changes to the structure of the CCP and state bodies, especially in a large overhaul in 2018. In March 2014, the CCP Central Committee merged the Office for External Propaganda (OEP), externally known as the State Council Information Office (SCIO), to the CCP's Central Propaganda Department. SCIO is now used by the Central Propaganda Department as an external name under an arrangement called \"one institution with two names\".[205] February earlier that year oversaw the creation of the Central Leading Group for Cybersecurity and Informatization. The State Internet Information Office (SIIO), previously under the OEP and SCIO, was transferred to the central leading group and renamed in English into the Cyberspace Administration of China.[206] As part of managing the financial system, the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a State Council body, was established in 2017. Chaired by vice premier Liu He during its existence, the committee was disestablished by the newly established Central Financial Commission during the 2023 Party and state reforms.[207]\n\n\n2018 has seen larger reforms to the bureaucracy. In that year, several central leading groups including reform, cyberspace affairs, finance and economics. and foreign affairs were upgraded to commissions.[208][209] In the area of media, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) was renamed into the National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) with its film, news media and publications being transferred to the Central Propaganda Department.[209] Additionally, the control of China Central Television (CCTV, including its international edition, China Global Television), China National Radio (CNR) and China Radio International (CRI) were transferred to the newly established China Media Group (CMG) under the control of the Central Propaganda Department.[209][210] Two State Council departments. one dealing with overseas Chinese, and other one dealing with religious affairs, were merged into the United Front Work Department while another commission dealing with ethnic affairs was brought under formal UFWD leadership.[209]\n\n\n2023 has seen further reforms to the CCP and state bureaucracy, most notably the strengthening of Party control over the financial and technology domains.[211] This included the creation of two CCP bodies for overseeing finance; the Central Financial Commission (CFC), as well as the revival of the Central Financial Work Commission (CFWC) that was previously dissolved in 2002.[211] The CFC would broadly manage the financial system while the CFWC would focus on strengthening the ideological and political role of the CCP in the sector.[207] Additionally, a new CCP Central Science and Technology Commission would be established to broadly oversee the technology sector, while a newly created Social Work Department was tasked with CCP interactions with several sectors, including civic groups, chambers of commerce and industry groups, as well as handling public petition and grievance work.[211] A new Central Hong Kong and Macau Work Office would also be established, with the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office being turned into the new body's external name.[211]\n\n\nAt the State Council, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission was replaced by the National Administration of Financial Regulation (NAFR), which is taking a much larger responsibility on financial regulation, effectively overseeing all financial activities except the securities industry, which was continued to be regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, now elevated to a government body.[212] Several regulatory responsibilities were also transferred from the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to the SAFS, while the PBoC will also reopen offices around the country that were closed in a previous reorganization.[213]\n\n\n\n#### Legal reforms[edit]\n\n\n> \n> Efforts should be made to enable the people to see that justice is served in every judicial case.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Xi Jinping during a speech in November 2020[214]\n\nThe party under Xi announced a raft of legal reforms at the Fourth Plenum held in the fall 2014, and he called for \"Chinese socialistic rule of law\" immediately afterwards. The party aimed to reform the legal system, which had been perceived as ineffective at delivering justice and affected by corruption, local government interference and lack of constitutional oversight. The plenum, while emphasizing the absolute leadership of the party, also called for a greater role of the constitution in the affairs of state and a strengthening of the role of the National People's Congress Standing Committee in interpreting the constitution.[215] It also called for more transparency in legal proceedings, more involvement of ordinary citizens in the legislative process, and an overall \"professionalization\" of the legal workforce. The party also planned to institute cross-jurisdictional circuit legal tribunals as well as giving provinces consolidated administrative oversight over lower level legal resources, which is intended to reduce local government involvement in legal proceedings.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Military reforms[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Modernization of the People's Liberation Army and 2015 People's Republic of China military reform\nSince taking power in 2012, Xi has undertaken an overhaul of the People's Liberation Army, including both political reform and its modernization.[217] Military-civil fusion has advanced under Xi.[218][219] Xi has been active in his participation in military affairs, taking a direct hands-on approach to military reform. In addition to being the Chairman of the CMC and leader of the Central Leading Group for Military Reform founded in 2014 to oversee comprehensive military reforms, Xi has delivered numerous high-profile pronouncements vowing to clean up malfeasance and complacency in the military. Xi has repeatedly warned that the depoliticization of the PLA from the CCP would lead to a collapse similar to that of the Soviet Union.[220] Xi held the New Gutian Conference in 2014, gathering China's top military officers, re-emphasizing the principle of \"the party has absolute control over the army\" first established by Mao at the 1929 Gutian Conference.[221]\n\n\n> \n> In the USSR, where the military was depoliticized, separated from the party and nationalized, the party was disarmed. When the Soviet Union came to crisis point, a big party was gone just like that. Proportionally, the Soviet Communist Party had more members than we do, but nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Xi Jinping during a speech[222]\n\nThough predating Xi, his administration has taken a more assertive stance towards maritime affairs, and has boosted CCP control over the maritime security forces.[223] In 2013, the previously separate rival maritime law enforcements of China were merged into the China Coast Guard. Initially under the joint administration of the State Oceanic Administration and the Ministry of Public Security, it was placed squarely under the administration of the People's Armed Police (PAP) in 2018.[223]\n\n\nXi announced a reduction of 300,000 troops from the PLA in 2015, bringing its size to 2 million troops. Xi described this as a gesture of peace, while analysts such as Rory Medcalf have said that the cut was done to reduce costs as well as part of PLA's modernization.[224] On 2016, he reduced the number of theater commands of the PLA from seven to five.[225] He has also abolished the four autonomous general departments of the PLA, replacing them with 15 agencies directly reporting to the CMC.[217] Two new branches of the PLA were created under his reforms, the Strategic Support Force[226] and the Joint Logistics Support Force.[227] In 2018, the PAP was placed under the sole control of the CMC; the PAP was previously under the joint command of the CMC and the State Council through the Ministry of Public Security.[228]:\u200a15\n\n\nOn 21 April 2016, Xi was named commander-in-chief of the country's new Joint Operations Command Center of the PLA by Xinhua News Agency and the broadcaster China Central Television.[229][230] Some analysts interpreted this move as an attempt to display strength and strong leadership and as being more \"political than military\".[231] According to Ni Lexiong, a military affairs expert, Xi \"not only controls the military but also does it in an absolute manner, and that in wartime, he is ready to command personally\".[232] According to a University of California, San Diego expert on Chinese military, Xi \"has been able to take political control of the military to an extent that exceeds what Mao and Deng have done\".[233]\n\n\nUnder Xi, China's official military budget has more than doubled,[185] reaching a record $224 billion in 2023.[234] The PLA Navy has grown rapidly under Xi, with China adding more warships, submarines, support ships and major amphibious vessels than the than the entire number of ships under the United Kingdom navy between 2014 and 2018.[235] In 2017, China established the navy's first overseas base in Djibouti.[236] Xi has also undertaken an expansion of China's nuclear arsenal, with him calling China to \"establish a strong system of strategic deterrence\". The Federation of American Scientists (FAS) has estimated China's total amount of nuclear arsenals to be 410 in 2023, with the US Department of Defense estimating that China's arsenal could reach 1,000 by 2030.[237]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of Xi Jinping\nSee also: List of international trips made by Xi Jinping\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet in 2016![](image)World leaders assemble for \"family photo\" at G20 summit in HamburgXi has taken a harder line on security issues as well as foreign affairs, projecting a more nationalistic and assertive China on the world stage.[238] His political program calls for a China more united and confident of its own value system and political structure.[239] Foreign analysts and observers have frequently said that Xi's main foreign policy objective is to restore China's position on the global stage as a great power.[240][222][241] Xi advocates \"baseline thinking\" in China's foreign policy: setting explicit red lines that other countries must not cross.[242] In the Chinese perspective, these tough stances on baseline issues reduce strategic uncertainty, preventing other nations from misjudging China's positions or underestimating China's resolve in asserting what it perceives to be in its national interest.[242] Xi stated during the 20th CCP National Congress that he wanted to ensure China \"leads the world in terms of composite national strength and international influence\" by 2049.[243]\n\n\nXi has promoted \"major-country diplomacy\" (\u5927\u56fd\u5916\u4ea4), stating that China is already a \"big power\" and breaking away from previous Chinese leaders who had a more precautious diplomacy.[244] He has adopted a hawkish foreign policy posture called \"wolf warrior diplomacy\",[245] while his foreign policy thoughts are collectively known as \"Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy\".[246] In March 2021, he said that \"the East is rising and the West is declining\" (\u4e1c\u5347\u897f\u964d), saying that the power of the Western world was in decline and their COVID-19 response was an example of this, and that China was entering a period of opportunity because of this.[247] Xi has frequently alluded to \"community with a shared future for mankind\", which Chinese diplomats have said doesn't imply an intention to change the international order,[248] but which foreign observers say China wants a new order that puts it more at the centre.[249] Under Xi, China has, along with Russia, also focused on increasing relations with the Global South in order to blunt the effect of Western sanctions.[250]\n\n\nXi has put an emphasis on increasing China's \"international discourse power\" (\u56fd\u9645\u8bdd\u8bed\u6743) to create a more favorable global opinion of China in the world.[251] In this pursuit, Xi has emphasised the need to \"tell China's story well\" (\u8bb2\u597d\u4e2d\u56fd\u6545\u4e8b), meaning expanding China's external propaganda (\u5916\u5ba3) and communications.[252] Xi has expanded the focus and scope of the united front, which aims to consolidate support for CCP in non-CCP elements both inside and outside China, and has accordingly expanded the United Front Work Department.[253] Xi has unveiled the Global Development Initiative (GDI),[254] the Global Security Initiative (GSI),[255] and the Global Civilisation Initiative (GCI), in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, aiming to increase China's influence in the international order.[256]\n\n\n\n#### Security[edit]\n\n\nUnder Xi, China has promoted reformation of the international system, with Xi calling for a \"rejection of hegemonic power structures in global governance\".[257] Addressing a regional conference in Shanghai on 21 May 2014, he called on Asian countries to unite and forge a way together, rather than get involved with third party powers, seen as a reference to the United States. \"Matters in Asia ultimately must be taken care of by Asians. Asia's problems ultimately must be resolved by Asians and Asia's security ultimately must be protected by Asians\", he told the conference.[258] His proposed Global Security Initiative has been aiming to create a new global security architecture, incorporating the term \"indivisible security\", a concept also supported by Russia.[255] He has also advocated for international security cooperation; during a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in September 2021, he spoke out against \"interference in other countries' internal affairs\", and called for joint cooperation in warding off against \"colour revolutions\".[259]\n\n\n\n#### Africa[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sino-African relations\n\nUnder Xi, China has cut back lending to Africa after fears that African countries couldn't repay their debts to China.[260] Xi has also promised that China would write off debts of some African countries.[261] In November 2021, Xi promised African nations 1 billion doses of China's COVID-19 vaccines, which was in addition to the 200 million already supplied before. This has been said to be part of China's vaccine diplomacy.[262]\n\n\n\n#### European Union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013European Union relations\n\n![](image)Xi in an official visit to Warsaw, where he and Poland's president Andrzej Duda signed a declaration on strategic partnership.China's efforts under Xi has been for the European Union (EU) to stay in a neutral position in their contest with the U.S.[263] China and the EU announced the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) in 2020, although the deal was later frozen due to mutual sanctions over Xinjiang.[264] Xi has supported calls for EU to achieve \"strategic autonomy\",[265] and has also called on the EU to view China \"independently\".[266]\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013India relations\n\n![](image)The BRICS leaders in 2023, from left to right: Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Xi Jinping, Cyril Ramaphosa, Narendra Modi and Sergey Lavrov (representing Vladimir Putin).\nRelations between China and India had ups and downs under Xi, later deteriorating due to various factors. In 2013, the two countries had a standoff in Depsang for three weeks, which ended with no border change.[267] In 2017, the two countries again had a standoff over a Chinese construction of a road in Doklam, a territory both claimed by Bhutan, India's ally, and China,[268] though by 28 August, both countries mutually disengaged.[269] The most serious crisis in the relationship came when the two countries had a deadly clash in 2020 at the Line of Actual Control, leaving some soldiers dead.[270][271] The clashes created a serious deterioration in relations, with China seizing a small chunk of territory that India controlled.[272]\n\n\n\n#### Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013Japan relations\n\nChina\u2013Japan relations have initially soured under Xi's administration; the most thorny issue between the two countries remains the dispute over the Senkaku islands, which China calls Diaoyu. In response to Japan's continued robust stance on the issue, China declared an Air Defense Identification Zone in November 2013.[273] However, the relations later started to improve, with Xi being invited to visit in 2020,[274] though the trip was later delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[275] In August 2022, Kyodo News reported that Xi personally decided to let ballistic missiles land within Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) during the military exercises held around Taiwan, to send a warning to Japan.[276]\n\n\n\n#### Middle East[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi with Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, 23 January 2016\nWhile China has historically been wary of getting closer to the Middle East countries, Xi has changed this approach.[277] China has grown closer to both Iran and Saudi Arabia under Xi.[277] During a visit to Iran in 2016, Xi proposed a large cooperation program with Iran,[278] a deal that was later signed in 2021.[279] China has also sold ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia and is helping build 7,000 schools in Iraq.[277] In 2013, Xi proposed a peace deal between Israel and Palestine that entails a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.[280] Turkey, with whom relations were long strained over Uyghurs, has also grown closer to China.[281] On 10 March 2023, Saudi Arabia and Iran agreed to restore diplomatic ties cut in 2016 after a deal brokered between the two countries by China following secret talks in Beijing.[282]\n\n\n\n#### North Korea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013North Korea relations\n\nUnder Xi, China initially took a more critical stance on North Korea due to its nuclear tests.[283] However, starting in 2018, the relations started to improve due to meetings between Xi and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.[284] Xi has also supported denuclearization of North Korea,[285] and has voiced support for economic reforms in the country.[286] At the G20 meeting in Japan, Xi called for a \"timely easing\" of sanctions imposed on North Korea.[287] After the 20th CCP National Congress in 2022, *Rodong Sinmun*, official newspaper of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, wrote a long editorial praising Xi, titling both Kim and Xi *Suryong* (\uc218\ub839), a title historically reserved for North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung.[288]\n\n\n\n#### Russia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013Russia relations\n\n![](image)Xi with his wife Peng Liyuan during the Moscow Victory Day Parade on 9 May 2015\nXi has cultivated stronger relations with Russia, particularly in the wake of the Ukraine crisis of 2014. He seems to have developed a strong personal relationship with president Vladimir Putin. Both are viewed as strong leaders with a nationalist orientation who are not afraid to assert themselves against Western interests.[289] Xi attended the opening ceremonies of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Under Xi, China signed a $400\u00a0billion gas deal with Russia; China has also become Russia's largest trading partner.[289]\n\n\nXi and Putin met on 4 February 2022 during the run up to the 2022 Beijing Olympics during the massive Russian build-up of force on the Ukrainian border, with the two expressing that the two countries are nearly united in their anti-US alignment and that both nations shared \"no limits\" to their commitments.[290][291] U.S. officials said that China had asked Russia to wait for the invasion of Ukraine until after the Beijing Olympics ended on 20 February.[291] In April 2022, Xi Jinping expressed opposition to sanctions against Russia.[292] On 15 June 2022, Xi Jinping reasserted China's support for Russia on issues of sovereignty and security.[293] However, Xi also said China is committed to respecting \"the territorial integrity of all countries\",[294] and said China was \"pained to see the flames of war reignited in Europe\".[295] China has additionally kept a distance from Russia's actions, instead putting itself as a neutral party.[291] In February 2023, China released a 12-point peace plan to \"settle the acute crisis in Ukraine\"; the plan was praised by Putin but criticized by the U.S. and European countries.[296]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vladimir Putin welcomes Xi in Moscow during Xi's visit to Russia in March 2023\nDuring the war Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given a nuanced take to China,[297] saying that the country has the economic leverage to pressure Putin to end the war, adding \"I'm sure that without the Chinese market for the Russian Federation, Russia would be feeling complete economic isolation. That's something that China can do \u2013 to limit the trade [with Russia] until the war is over.\" In August 2022, Zelenskyy said that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Xi Jinping did not respond to his requests for direct talks with him.[298] He additionally said that while he would like China to take a different approach to the war in Ukraine, he also wanted the relationship to improve every year and said that China and Ukraine shared similar values.[299] On 26 April 2023, Zelenskyy and Xi held their first phone call since the start of the war.[300]\n\n\n\n#### South Korea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013South Korea relations\n\nXi has initially improved relationships with South Korea,[283] and the two countries signed a free-trade agreement in December 2015.[301] Starting in 2017, China's relationship with South Korea soured over the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD), a missile defence system, purchase of the latter. which China sees as a threat but which South Korea says is a defence measure against North Korea.[302] Ultimately, South Korea halted the purchase of the THAAD after China imposed unofficial sanctions.[303] China's relations with South Korea improved again under president Moon Jae-in.[304]\n\n\n\n#### Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping with Philippine President Bongbong Marcos in Bangkok, November 2022\nSince Xi came to power, China has been rapidly building and militarizing islands in the South China Sea, a decision *Study Times* of the Central Party School said was personally taken by Xi.[305] In April 2015, new satellite imagery revealed that China was rapidly constructing an airfield on Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea.[306] In November 2014, in a major policy address, Xi called for a decrease in the use of force, preferring dialogue and consultation to solve the current issues plaguing the relationship between China and its South East Asian neighbors.[307]\n\n\n\n#### Taiwan[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cross-Strait relations and Ma\u2013Xi meeting\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping met with then-Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou in November 2015 in their capacity as the leader of mainland China and Taiwan respectively.\nIn 2015, Xi met with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou, which marked the first time the political leaders of both sides of the Taiwan Strait have met since the end of the Chinese Civil War in Mainland China in 1950.[308] Xi said that China and Taiwan are \"one family\" that cannot be pulled apart.[309] However, the relations started deteriorating after Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won the presidential elections in 2016.[310]\n\n\nIn the 19th Party Congress held in 2017, Xi reaffirmed six of the nine principles that had been affirmed continuously since the 16th Party Congress in 2002, with the notable exception of \"Placing hopes on the Taiwan people as a force to help bring about unification\".[311] According to the Brookings Institution, Xi used stronger language on potential Taiwan independence than his predecessors towards previous DPP governments in Taiwan.[311] He said that \"we will never allow any person, any organisation, or any political party to split any part of the Chinese territory from China at any time at any form.\"[311] In March 2018, Xi said that Taiwan would face the \"punishment of history\" for any attempts at separatism.[312]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Xi Jinping called on Taiwan to reject its formal independence from China, saying: \"We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means.\" Those options, he said, could be used against \"external interference\". Xi also said that they \"are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification, but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities.\"[313][314] President Tsai responded to the speech by saying Taiwan would not accept a one country, two systems arrangement with the mainland, while stressing the need for all cross-strait negotiations to be on a government-to-government basis.[315]\n\n\nIn 2022, after the Chinese military exercises around Taiwan, the PRC published a white paper called \"The Taiwan Question and China's Reunification in the New Era\", which was the first white paper regards to Taiwan since 2000.[316] The paper urged Taiwan to become a special administrative region of the PRC under the one country two systems formula,[316] and said that \"a small number of countries, the U.S. foremost amongst them\" are \"using Taiwan to contain China\".[317] Notably, the new white paper excluded a part that previously said the PRC would not send troops or officials to Taiwan after unification.[317]\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: China\u2013United States relations\n\n![](image)U.S. president Donald Trump arrives in China, 8 November 2017Xi has called China\u2013United States relations in the contemporary world a \"new type of great-power relations\", a phrase the Obama administration had been reluctant to embrace.[318] Under his administration the U.S.\u2013China Strategic and Economic Dialogue that began under Hu Jintao has continued, until it was suspended by the administration of Donald Trump.[319] On China\u2013U.S. relations, Xi said, \"If [China and the United States] are in confrontation, it would surely spell disaster for both countries\".[320] The U.S. has been critical of Chinese actions in the South China Sea.[318] In 2014, Chinese hackers compromised the computer system of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management,[321] resulting in the theft of approximately 22 million personnel records handled by the office.[322] Xi has also indirectly spoken out critically on the U.S. \"strategic pivot\" to Asia.[323]\nRelations with the U.S. soured after Donald Trump became president in 2017.[324] Since 2018, U.S. and China have been engaged in an escalating trade war.[325] In 2020, the relations further deteriorated due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[326] In 2021, Xi has called the U.S. the biggest threat to China's development, saying that \"the biggest source of chaos in the present-day world is the United States\".[247] Xi has also scrapped a previous policy in which China did not challenge the U.S. in most instances, while Chinese officials said that they now see China as an \"equal\" to the U.S.[327] On 6 March 2023, during a speech to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Xi said that \"Western countries\u2014led by the U.S.\u2014have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression\" against China, which he said brought \"unprecedentedly severe challenges to our country's development\".[328]\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping with U.S. President Joe Biden at the margins of the 2022 G20 Bali summit\n#### Economic relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Belt and Road Initiative\n![](image)Countries that signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative\nThe Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was unveiled by Xi in September and October 2013 during visits to Kazakhstan and Indonesia,[329] and was thereafter promoted by Premier Li Keqiang during state visits to Asia and Europe. Xi made the announcement for the initiative while in Astana, Kazakhstan, and called it a \"golden opportunity\".[330] BRI has been called Xi's \"signature project\", involving numerous infrastructure development and investment projects throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas.[331] BRI was added to the CCP Constitution at the closing session of the 19th Party Congress on 24 October 2017,[332] further elevating its importance.[333] Since the BRI was launched, China became the world's largest lender, lending about $1 trillion in a decade to almost 150 countries. However, by 2022, many BRI projects have stalled, and most of China's debt became held by countries in financial distress, leading the Chinese leaders to adopt a more conservative approach to BRI, dubbed as \"Belt and Road Initiative 2.0\".[334]\n\n\nXi officially proposed the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) in October 2013 during a visit to Indonesia,[335] which officially launched in January 2016.[336] The membership of the AIIB has included numerous countries, including allies of the United States and Western countries, despite opposition from the US.[336] Since its launch until 2022, AIIB has invested $36.43 billion to 190 projects.[337] Xi's tenure has seen a signing of several free-trade deals, including with Australia in 2014,[338] South Korea in 2015,[301] and the larger Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in 2020.[339] Xi has also expressed his interest in China joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), with China formally applying to join in September 2021.[340]\n\n\n\n### National security[edit]\n\n\nXi has devoted a large amount of work towards national security, calling for a \"holistic national security architecture\" that encompasses \"all aspects of the work of the party and the country\".[341] During a private talk with U.S. president Obama and vice president Biden, he said that China had been a target of \"colour revolutions\", foreshadowing his focus on national security.[342] Since its creation by Xi, the National Security Commission has established local security committees, focusing on dissent.[342] In the name of national security, Xi's government has passed numerous laws including a counterespionage law in 2014,[343] national security[344] and a counterterrorism law in 2015,[345] a cybersecurity law[346] and a law restricting foreign NGOs in 2016,[347] a national intelligence law in 2017,[348] and a data security law in 2021.[349] Under Xi, China's mass surveillance network has dramatically grown, with comprehensive profiles being built for each citizen.[350]\n\n\n\n### Hong Kong[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hong Kong protesters throw eggs at Xi Jinping's portrait on National DayDuring his leadership, Xi has supported and pursued a greater political and economic integration of Hong Kong to mainland China, including through projects such as the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge.[351] He has pushed for the Greater Bay Area project, which aims to integrate Hong Kong, Macau, and nine other cities in Guangdong.[351] Xi's push for greater integration has created fears of decreasing freedoms in Hong Kong.[352] Many of the views held by the central government and eventually implemented in Hong Kong were outlined in a white paper published by the State Council in 2014 named *The Practice of the 'One Country, Two Systems' Policy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region*, which outlined that the China's central government has \"comprehensive jurisdiction\" over Hong Kong.[353] Under Xi, the Chinese government also declared the Sino-British Joint Declaration to be legally void.[353]\n\n\nIn August 2014, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) made a decision allowing universal suffrage for the 2017 election of the chief executive of Hong Kong, but also requiring the candidates to \"love the country, and love Hong Kong\", as well as other measures that ensured the Chinese leadership would be the ultimate decision-maker on the selection, leading to protests,[354] and the eventual rejection of the reform bill in the Legislative Council due to a walk-out by the pro-Beijing camp to delay to vote.[355] In the 2017 chief executive election, Carrie Lam was victorious, reportedly with the endorsement of the CCP Politburo.[356]\n\n\n\nXi has supported the Hong Kong Government and Carrie Lam against the protesters in the 2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests, which broke out after a proposed bill that would allow extraditions to China.[357] He has defended the Hong Kong police's use of force, saying that \"We sternly support the Hong Kong police to take forceful actions in enforcing the law, and the Hong Kong judiciary to punish in accordance with the law those who have committed violent crimes.\"[358] While visiting Macau on 20 December 2019 as part of the 20th anniversary of its return to China, Xi warned of foreign forces interfering in Hong Kong and Macau,[359] while also hinting that Macau could be a model for Hong Kong to follow.[360]\n\n![](image)Xi swearing in John Lee as chief executive during the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China\nIn 2020, the NPCSC passed a national security law in Hong Kong that dramatically expanded government clampdown over the opposition in the city; amongst the measures were the dramatic restriction on political opposition and the creation of a central government office outside Hong Kong jurisdiction to oversee the enforcement of the law.[353] This was seem as the culmination of a long-term project under Xi to further closely integrate Hong Kong with the mainland.[353] Xi visited Hong Kong as president in 2017 and 2022, in the 20th and 25th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong respectively.[361] In his 2022 visit, he swore in John Lee as chief executive, a former police officer that was backed by the Chinese government to expand control over the city.[362][363] While in the city, he said Hong Kong had moved from \"chaos\" to \"stability\".[364] Since John Lee became chief executive, Hong Kong government officials including Lee himself have shown public displays of loyalty towards Xi, similar to the mainland but previously unheard in the city.[365]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Human rights in China, Uyghur genocide, and Antireligious campaigns in China\n\nAccording to the Human Rights Watch, Xi has \"started a broad and sustained offensive on human rights\" since he became leader in 2012.[366] The HRW also said that repression in China is \"at its worst level since the Tiananmen Square massacre.\"[367] Since taking power, Xi has cracked down on grassroots activism, with hundreds being detained.[368] He presided over the 709 crackdown on 9 July 2015, which saw more than 200 lawyers, legal assistants and human rights activists being detained.[369] His term has seen the arrest and imprisonment of activists such as Xu Zhiyong, as well as numerous others who identified with the New Citizens' Movement. Prominent legal activist Pu Zhiqiang of the Weiquan movement was also arrested and detained.[370]\n\n\nIn 2017, the local government of the Jiangxi province told Christians to replace their pictures of Jesus with Xi Jinping as part of a general campaign on unofficial churches in the country.[371][372][373] According to local social media, officials \"transformed them from believing in religion to believing in the party\".[371] According to activists, \"Xi is waging the most severe systematic suppression of Christianity in the country since religious freedom was written into the Chinese constitution in 1982\", and according to pastors and a group that monitors religion in China, has involved \"destroying crosses, burning bibles, shutting churches and ordering followers to sign papers renouncing their faith\".[374]\n\n\nUnder Xi, the CCP has embraced assimilationist policies towards ethnic minorities, scaling back affirmative action in the country by 2019,[375] and scrapping a wording in October 2021 that guaranteed the rights of minority children to be educated in their native language, replacing it with one that emphasized teaching the national language.[376] In 2020, Chen Xiaojiang was appointed as head of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission, the first Han Chinese head of the body since 1954.[377] On 24 June 2022, Pan Yue, another Han Chinese, became the head of the commission, with him reportedly holding assimilationist policies toward ethnic minorities.[378] Xi outlined his official views relations between the majority Han Chinese and ethnic minorities by saying \"[n]either Han chauvinism nor local ethnic chauvinism is conducive to the development of a community for the Chinese nation\".[379]\n\n\n\n#### Xinjiang[edit]\n\n\nFollowing several terrorist attacks in Xinjiang in 2013 and 2014, the CCP leaders held a secret meeting to find a solution to the attacks,[380] leading to Xi to launch the Strike Hard Campaign Against Violent Terrorism in 2014, which involved mass detention, and surveillance of ethnic Uyghurs there.[381][382] Xi made an inspection tour in Xinjiang between 27 and 30 April in 2014.[383] The program was massively expanded in 2016, after the appointment of Chen Quanguo as the Xinjiang CCP secretary. The campaign included the detainment of 1.8 million people in internment camps, mostly Uyghurs but also including other ethnic and religious minorities, by 2020,[380] and a birth suppression campaign that led to a large drop in the Uyghur birth rate by 2019.[384] Various human rights groups and former inmates have described the camps as \"concentration camps\", where Uyghurs and other minorities have been forcibly assimilated into China's majority ethnic Han society.[385] This program has been called a genocide by some observers, while a report by the UN Human Rights Office said they may amount to crimes against humanity.[386][387]\n\n\nInternal Chinese government documents leaked to the press in November 2019 showed that Xi personally ordered a security crackdown in Xinjiang, saying that the party must show \"absolutely no mercy\" and that officials use all the \"weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship\" to suppress those \"infected with the virus of extremism\".[382][388] The papers also showed that Xi repeatedly discussed about Islamic extremism in his speeches, likening it to a \"virus\" or a \"drug\" that could be only addressed by \"a period of painful, interventionary treatment.\"[382] However, he also warned against the discrimination against Uyghurs and rejected proposals to eradicate Islam in China, calling that kind of viewpoint \"biased, even wrong\".[382] Xi's exact role in the building of internment camps has not been publicly reported, though he's widely believed to be behind them and his words have been the source for major justifications in the crackdown in Xinjiang.[389][390] In the Xinjiang Police Files leaked in 2022, a document quoting Minister of Public Security Zhao Kezhi suggested that Xi had been aware of the internment camps.[391]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chinese government response to COVID-19 and COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China\nOn 20 January 2020, Xi commented for the first time on the emerging COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, and ordered \"efforts to curb the spread\" of the virus.[392] He gave premier Li Keqiang some responsibility over the COVID-19 response, in what has been suggested by *The Wall Street Journal* was an attempt to potentially insulate himself from criticism if the response failed.[393] The government initially responded to the pandemic with a lockdown and censorship, with the initial response causing widespread backlash within China.[394] He met with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), on 28 January.[395] *Der Spiegel* reported that in January 2020 Xi pressured Tedros Adhanom to hold off on issuing a global warning about the outbreak of COVID-19 and hold back information on human-to-human transmission of the virus, allegations denied by the WHO.[396] On 5 February, Xi met with Cambodian prime minister Hun Sen in Beijing, the first foreign leader allowed into China since the outbreak.[395] After the COVID-19 outbreak got under control in Wuhan, Xi visited the city on 10 March.[397]\n\n\n![](image)Italian president Sergio Mattarella with Xi in March 2019\nAfter getting the outbreak in Wuhan under control, Xi has favoured what has officially been termed \"dynamic zero-COVID policy\"[398] that aims to control and suppress the virus as much as possible within the country's borders. This has involved local lockdowns and mass-testing.[399] While initially credited for China's suppression of the COVID-19 outbreak, the policy was later criticized by foreign and some domestic observers for being out of touch with the rest of the world and taking a heavy toll on the economy.[399] This approach has especially come under criticism during a 2022 lockdown on Shanghai, which forced millions to their homes and damaged the city's economy,[400] denting the image of Li Qiang, close Xi ally and Party secretary of the city.[401] Conversely, Xi has said that the policy was designed to protect people's life safety.[402] On 23 July 2022, the National Health Commission reported that Xi and other top leaders have taken the local COVID-19 vaccines.[403]\n\n\nAt the 20th CCP Congress, Xi confirmed the continuation of the zero-COVID policy,[404] stating he would \"unswervingly\" carry out \"dynamic zero-COVID\" and promising to \"resolutely win the battle,\"[405] though China started a limited easing of the policies in the following weeks.[406] In November 2022, protests broke out against China's COVID-19 policies, with a fire in a high-rise apartment building in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi being the trigger.[407] The protests were held in multiple major cities, with some of the protesters demanding the end of Xi's and the CCP's rule.[407] The protests were mostly suppressed by December,[407] though the government further eased COVID-19 restrictions in the time since.[408] On 7 December 2022, China announced large-scale changes to its COVID-19 policy, including allowing quarantine at home for mild infections, reducing of PCR testing, and decreasing the power of local officials to implement lockdowns.[409]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental policy in China\n\nIn September 2020, Xi announced that China will \"strengthen its 2030 climate target (NDC), peak emissions before 2030 and aim to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060\".[410] If accomplished, this would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2\u20130.3\u00a0\u00b0C \u2013 \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\".[410] Xi mentioned the link between the COVID-19 pandemic and nature destruction as one of the reasons for the decision, saying that \"Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of nature.\"[411] On 27 September, Chinese scientists presented a detailed plan how to achieve the target.[412] In September 2021, Xi announced that China will not build \"coal-fired power projects abroad, which was said to be potentially \"pivotal\" in reducing emissions. The Belt and Road Initiative did not include financing such projects already in the first half of 2021.[413]\n\n\nXi Jinping did not attend COP26 personally. However, a Chinese delegation led by climate change envoy Xie Zhenhua did attend.[414][415] During the conference, the United States and China agreed on a framework to reduce GHG emission by co-operating on different measures.[416]\n\n\n\n### Governance style[edit]\n\n\nKnown as a very secretive leader, little is known publicly about how Xi makes political decisions, or how he came to power.[417][418] Xi's speeches generally get released months or years after they are made.[417] Xi has also never given a press conference since becoming paramount leader, except in rare joint press conferences with foreign leaders.[417][419] *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Xi prefers micromanaging in governance, in contrast to previous leaders such as Hu Jintao who left details of major policies to lower-ranking officials.[84] Reportedly, ministerial officials try to get Xi's attention in various ways, with some creating slide shows and audio reports. *The Wall Street Journal* also reported that Xi created a performance-review system in 2018 to give evaluations on officials on various measures, including loyalty.[84] According to *The Economist*, Xi's orders have generally been vague, leaving lower level officials to interpret his words.[389] Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency said that Xi \"personally reviews every draft of major policy documents\" and \"all reports submitted to him, no matter how late in the evening, were returned with instructions the following morning\".[420] With regard to behavior of Communist Party members, Xi emphasizes the \"Two Musts\" (members must not be arrogant or rash and must keep their hard-working spirit) and the \"Six Nos\" (members must say no to formalism, bureaucracy, gift-giving, luxurious birthday celebrations, hedonism, and extravagance).[175]:\u200a52 Xi called for officials to practice self-criticism which, according to observers, is in order to appear less corrupt and more popular among the people.[421][422][423]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ideology of the Chinese Communist Party\n\n### Chinese Dream[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chinese Dream\n\n![](image)According to *Qiushi*, the Chinese Dream is about Chinese prosperity, collective effort, socialism, and national glory.\nXi and CCP ideologues coined the phrase \"Chinese Dream\" to describe his overarching plans for China as its leader. Xi first used the phrase during a high-profile visit to the National Museum of China on 29 November 2012, where he and his Standing Committee colleagues were attending a \"national revival\" exhibition. Since then, the phrase has become the signature political slogan of the Xi era.[424][425] The origin of the term \"Chinese Dream\" is unclear. While the phrase has been used before by journalists and scholars,[426] some publications have posited the term likely drew its inspiration from the concept of the American Dream.[427] *The Economist* noted the abstract and seemingly accessible nature of the concept with no specific overarching policy stipulations may be a deliberate departure from the jargon-heavy ideologies of his predecessors.[428] Xi has linked the \"Chinese Dream\" with the phrase \"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation\".[429][e]\n\n\n\n### Cultural revival[edit]\n\n\nIn recent years, top political leaders of the CCP such as Xi have overseen the rehabilitation of ancient Chinese philosophical figures like Han Fei into the mainstream of Chinese thought alongside Confucianism. At a meeting with other officials in 2013, he quoted Confucius, saying \"he who rules by virtue is like the Pole Star, it maintains its place, and the multitude of stars pay homage.\" While visiting Shandong, the birthplace of Confucius, in November, he told scholars that the Western world was \"suffering a crisis of confidence\" and that the CCP has been \"the loyal inheritor and promoter of China's outstanding traditional culture.\"[430]\n\n\nAccording to several analysts, Xi's leadership has been characterised by a resurgence of the ancient political philosophy Legalism.[431][432][433] Han Fei gained new prominence with favourable citations; one sentence of Han Fei's that Xi quoted appeared thousands of times in official Chinese media at the local, provincial, and national levels.[433] Xi has additionally supported the Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Yangming, telling local leaders to promote him.[434]\n\n\nXi has also overseen a revival of traditional Chinese culture, breaking from the CCP's previous path, which had often attacked it.[435] He has called traditional culture the \"soul\" of the nation and the \"foundation\" of the CCP's culture.[436] Xi has also called for integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China's traditional culture.[256] Hanfu, the traditional dress of Han Chinese, has seen a revival under him, associated with the revival of traditional culture.[437] He has established the \"four matters of confidence\", which has later been added to the CCP constitution, calling for CCP members, government officials and the Chinese people to be \"confident in our chosen path, confident in our guiding theories, confident in our political system, and confident in our culture\". He has unveiled Global Civilisation initiative in 2023, calling for \"respecting the diversity of civilisations, advocating the common values of humanity, valuing the inheritance and innovation of civilisations, and strengthening international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation\"[256]\n\n\n\n### Ideology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Eight-point Regulation\n\nXi has said that \"only socialism can save China\".[438] Xi has also declared socialism with Chinese characteristics to be the \"only correct path to realize national rejuvenation\".[439] According to BBC News, while the CCP was perceived to have abandoned its communist ideology since it initiated economic reforms in the 1970s, Xi is believed by some observers to be more believing in the \"idea of a communist project\",[440] being described as a Marxist\u2013Leninist by former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd.[441] Xi's emphasis on prioritizing ideology has included re-asserting the Party's goal of eventually realizing communism and reprimanding those who dismiss communism as impractical or irrelevant.[163] Xi described the communist ideal as the \"calcium\" in a Party member's spine, without which the Party member would suffer the \"osteoporosis\" of political decay and be unable to stand upright.[163]\n\n\nSubscribing to the view that socialism will eventually triumph over capitalism, Xi has said \"Marx and Engels's analysis of the basic contradictions of capitalist society is not outdated, nor is the historical materialist view that capitalism is bound to die out and socialism bound to win\".[442] Xi has overseen the increase of \"Socialist Political Economy With Chinese Characteristics\" as a major study topic for academics in China, aiming to decrease the influence of Western-influenced economics.[442] Though he has called a stop to what he considers to be \"disorderly expansion of capital\", he has also said that \"it is necessary to stimulate the vitality of capital of all types, including nonpublic capital, and give full play to its positive role\".[442]\n\n\n\n> \n> China's success proves that socialism is not dead. It is thriving. Just imagine this: had socialism failed in China, had our communist party collapsed like the party in the Soviet Union, then global socialism would lapse into a long dark age. And communism, like Karl Marx once said, would be a haunting spectre lingering in limbo.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014 Xi Jinping during a speech in 2018[443]\n\nXi has supported greater CCP control over the PRC, saying \"government, the military, society and schools, north, south, east and west \u2013 the party leads them all\".[444] During the 100th anniversary of the CCP in 2021, he said that \"without the Communist Party of China, there would be no new China and no national rejuvenation\", and that \"the leadership of the Party is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and constitutes the greatest strength of this system\".[445] He has said that China, despite many setbacks, has achieved great progress under the CCP, saying that \"socialism with Chinese characteristics has become the standard-bearer of 21st-century socialist development\".[443] However, he has also warned that it will take a long time for China under the CCP to complete its rejuvenation, and during this timeframe, party members must be vigilant to not let CCP rule collapse.[443]\n\n\nXi has ruled out a multi-party system for China, saying that \"constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentarism, a multi-party system and a presidential system, we considered them, tried them, but none worked\".[446] However, Xi considers China to be a democracy, saying that \"China's socialist democracy is the most comprehensive, genuine and effective democracy\".[447] China's definition of democracy is different from liberal democracies and is rooted in Marxism\u2013Leninism, and is based on the phrases \"people's democratic dictatorship\" and \"democratic centralism\".[447] Xi has additionally coined the term \"whole-process people's democracy\" which he said was about having \"the people as masters\".[448] Foreign analysts and observers have widely disputed that China is a democracy, saying that it is a one-party authoritarian state and Xi an authoritarian leader.[455] Some observers, including German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock,[456] have called Xi a dictator, citing the large centralisation of power around him unseen compared to his predecessors.[457][458] Xi has additionally rejected Westernisation as the only way to modernize, instead promoting what he says is \"Chinese-style modernisation\".[459] He has identified five concepts as part of Chinese-style modernisation, including modernisation of a huge population, common prosperity, material and cultural-ethical advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and peaceful development.[460]\n\n\n\n#### Xi Jinping Thought[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xi Jinping Thought\n\n![](image)A billboard promoting Xi Jinping Thought in Shenzhen\nIn September 2017, the CCP Central Committee decided that Xi's political philosophies, generally referred to as \"Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\", would become part of the Party Constitution.[461][462] Xi first made mention of the \"Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era\" in his opening day speech delivered to the 19th Party Congress in October 2017. His Politburo Standing Committee colleagues, in their own reviews of Xi's keynote address at the Congress, prepended the name \"Xi Jinping\" in front of \"Thought\".[463] On 24 October 2017, at its closing session, the 19th Party Congress approved the incorporation of Xi Jinping Thought into the Constitution of the CCP,[104] while in March 2018, the National People's Congress changed the state constitution to include Xi Jinping Thought.[464]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Governance of China* in different languages presented at Shanghai Library\nXi himself has described the Thought as part of the broad framework created around socialism with Chinese characteristics, a term coined by Deng Xiaoping that places China in the primary stage of socialism. In official party documentation and pronouncements by Xi's colleagues, the Thought is said to be a continuation of Marxism\u2013Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, as part of a series of guiding ideologies that embody \"Marxism adopted to Chinese conditions\" and contemporary considerations.[463] It has additionally been described as the \"21st century Marxism\" by two professors in the Central Party School of the CCP.[16] Wang Huning, a top political adviser and a close ally of Xi, has been described as pivotal to developing Xi Jinping Thought.[16] The concepts and context behind Xi Jinping Thought are elaborated in Xi's *The Governance of China* book series, published by the Foreign Languages Press for an international audience. Volume one was published in September 2014, followed by volume two in November 2017.[465]\n\n\nAn app for teaching Xi Jinping Thought had become the most popular smartphone app in China in 2019, as the country's ruling CCP launched a new campaign that calls on its cadres to immerse themselves in the political doctrine every day. *Xuexi Qiangguo* is now the most downloaded item on Apple's domestic App Store, surpassing in demand social media apps such as WeChat and TikTok.[466] In 2021, the government included Xi Jinping Thought in the curriculum including to students from primary schools to university, which created pushback from parents. For much of the preceding 30 years, political ideology and communist doctrine were not a standard taught in Chinese schools until middle school, and textbooks featured a wider set of Chinese leaders with less emphasis on a single leader like Xi.[467]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Xi Jinping, Peng Liyuan and U.S. president Barack Obama in the Lincoln Bedroom\nXi's first marriage was to Ke Lingling, the daughter of Ke Hua, China's ambassador to the United Kingdom in the early 1980s. They divorced within a few years.[468] The two were said to fight \"almost every day\", and after the divorce Ke moved to England.[8] In 1987, Xi married the prominent Chinese folk singer Peng Liyuan.[469] Xi and Peng were introduced by friends as many Chinese couples were in the 1980s. Xi was reputedly academic during their courtship, inquiring about singing techniques.[470] Peng Liyuan, a household name in China, was better known to the public than Xi until his political elevation. The couple frequently lived apart due largely to their separate professional lives. Peng has played a much more visible role as China's \"first lady\" compared to her predecessors; for example, Peng hosted U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama on her high-profile visit to China in March 2014.[471]\n\n\nXi and Peng have a daughter named Xi Mingze, who graduated from Harvard University in the spring of 2015. While at Harvard, she used a pseudonym and studied Psychology and English.[472] Xi's family has a home in Jade Spring Hill, a garden and residential area in north-western Beijing run by the CMC.[473]\n\n\nIn June 2012, *Bloomberg News* reported that members of Xi's extended family have substantial business interests, although there was no evidence he had intervened to assist them.[474] The *Bloomberg* website was blocked in mainland China in response to the article.[475] Since Xi embarked on an anti-corruption campaign, *The New York Times* reported members of his family were selling their corporate and real estate investments beginning in 2012.[476] Relatives of highly placed Chinese officials, including seven current and former senior leaders of the Politburo of the CCP, have been named in the Panama Papers, including Deng Jiagui,[477] Xi's brother-in-law. Deng had two shell companies in the British Virgin Islands while Xi was a member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but they were dormant by the time Xi became general secretary of the CCP in November 2012.[478]\n\n\n\n### Personality[edit]\n\n\nPeng described Xi as hardworking and down-to-earth: \"When he comes home, I've never felt as if there's some leader in the house. In my eyes, he's just my husband.\"[479] In 1992, *The Washington Post* journalist Lena H. Sun had an interview with Xi, then CCP secretary of Fuzhou; Sun described Xi as considerably more at ease and confident than many officials his age, and said that he talked without consulting notes.[480] He was described in a 2011 *The Washington Post* article by those who know him as \"pragmatic, serious, cautious, hard-working, down to earth and low-key\". He was described as a good hand at problem solving and \"seemingly uninterested in the trappings of high office\".[481]\n\n\n\n## Public life[edit]\n\n\nIt is hard to gauge the opinion of the Chinese public on Xi, as no independent surveys exist in China and social media is heavily censored.[482] However, he is believed to be widely popular in the country.[483][484] According to a 2014 poll co-sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, Xi ranked 9 out of 10 in domestic approval ratings.[485] A YouGov poll released in July 2019 found that about 22% of people in mainland China list Xi as the person they admire the most, a plurality, although this figure was less than 5% for residents of Hong Kong.[486] In the spring of 2019, the Pew Research Center made a survey on confidence on Xi Jinping among six-country medians based on Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Philippines and South Korea, which indicated that a median 29% have confidence in Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs, meanwhile a median of 45% have no confidence; these numbers are slightly higher than those of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (23% confidence, 53% no confidence).[487] A poll by Politico and Morning Consult in 2021 found that 5% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Xi, 38% unfavorable, 17% no opinion and 40%, a plurality, never hearing of him.[488]\n\n\nIn 2017, *The Economist* named him the most powerful person in the world.[489] In 2018, *Forbes* ranked him as the most powerful and influential person in the world, replacing Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been ranked so for five consecutive years.[490] Since 2013, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Xi among the list of press freedom predators.[491]\n\n\nUnlike previous Chinese leaders, Chinese state media has given a more encompassing view of Xi's private life, although still strictly controlled. According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi would swim one kilometer and walk every day as long as there was time, and is interested in foreign writers, especially Russian.[420] He is known to love films and TV shows such as *Saving Private Ryan*, *The Departed,* *The Godfather* and *Game of Thrones,*[492][493][494] also praising the independent film-maker Jia Zhangke.[495] The Chinese state media has also cast him as a fatherly figure and a man of the people, determined to stand up for Chinese interests.[418]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Decoration\n | Country/Organisation\n | Date\n | Note\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | The Golden Olympic Order | ![](image)\u00a0International Olympic Committee | 19 November 2013\n | The highest award of the Olympic movement\n | [496] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 30 March 2014\n | The highest order of Belgium\n | [497] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of the Liberator | ![](image)\u00a0Venezuela | 20 July 2014\n | The highest order of Venezuela\n | [498] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed | ![](image)\u00a0Cuba | 22 July 2014\n | Order of Cuba\n | [499] |\n| ![](image) | Nishan-e-Pakistan | ![](image)\u00a0Pakistan | 21 April 2015\n | The highest civilian award of Pakistan\n | [500] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Abdulaziz al Saud | ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | 19 January 2016\n | Saudi Arabian order of merit\n | [501] |\n| ![](image) | Collar of the Order of the Republic of Serbia | ![](image)\u00a0Serbia | 18 June 2016\n | The highest state order of Serbia\n | [502] |\n| ![](image) | Order for Promotion of Peace and Friendship | ![](image)\u00a0Belarus | 29 September 2016\n | Order of Belarus\n | [503] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross Medal of Honor\n | ![](image)\u00a0Peru | 21 November 2016\n | Medal of Peru\n | [504] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Saint Andrew | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 3 July 2017\n | The highest order of Russia\n | [505] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Collar of the State of Palestine | ![](image)\u00a0Palestine | 18 July 2017\n | The highest civilian order of Palestine\n | [506] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Zayed | ![](image)\u00a0United Arab Emirates | 20 July 2018\n | The highest civilian decoration of the United Arab Emirates\n | [507] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of the Lion | ![](image)\u00a0Senegal | 29 July 2018\n | Order of Senegal\n | [508] |\n| ![](image) | Collar of the Order of the Liberator General San Martin | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | 2 December 2018\n | Order of Argentina\n | [509] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Manas | ![](image)\u00a0Kyrgyzstan | 13 June 2019\n | The highest order of Kyrgyzstan\n | [510] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Crown | ![](image)\u00a0Tajikistan | 15 June 2019\n | Order of Tajikistan\n | [511] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Golden Eagle | ![](image)\u00a0Kazakhstan | 14 September 2022\n | The highest order of Kazakhstan\n | [512] |\n| ![](image) | Order of Friendship | ![](image)\u00a0Uzbekistan | 15 September 2022\n | State award of Uzbekistan\n | [513] |\n|  | Order of South Africa | ![](image)\u00a0South Africa | 22 August 2023\n | State award of South Africa\n | [514] |\n\n\n### Key to the City[edit]\n\n\nXi holds a \"key to the city\", an honor granted to attending guests to symbolize their significance, in:\n\n\n\n* ![](image)![Iowa](image) Muscatine, Iowa, United States (26 April 1985)[515][516]\n* ![](image) Montego Bay, Jamaica (13 February 2009)[48]\n* ![](image)![](image) Muscatine, Iowa, United States (14 February 2012)[515]\n* ![](image)![](image)\u00a0San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica (3 June 2013)[517]\n* ![](image)![](image)\u00a0Mexico City, Mexico (5 June 2013)[518]\n* ![](image)![](image)\u00a0Buenos Aires, Argentina (19 July 2014)[519]\n* ![](image)![](image)\u00a0Prague, Czech Republic (29 March 2016)[520]\n* ![](image)![Madrid](image) Madrid, Spain (28 November 2018)[521]\n\n\n### Honorary doctorates[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Nazarbayev University (7 September 2013)[522]\n* ![](image) University of Johannesburg (11 April 2019)[523]\n* ![](image) Saint Petersburg State University (6 June 2019)[524]\n* ![](image) King Saud University (8 December 2022)[525]\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* Xi, Jinping (1999). *Theory and Practice on Modern Agriculture*.

Party (CCP) from 2002 to 2012, the president of China from 2003 to 2013, and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) from 2004 to 2012. He was a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, China's *de facto* top decision-making body, from 1992 to 2012. Hu was the fifth paramount leader of China from 2002 to 2012.[b]\n\n\nHu rose to power through the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), notably as Party Committee secretary for Guizhou province and the Tibet Autonomous Region, where his harsh repression of dissent gained him attention from the highest levels. He moved up to first secretary of the CCP Central Secretariat and vice president under CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin. Hu was the first leader of the Communist Party from a generation younger than those who participated in the civil war and the founding of the republic. Influential sponsors from the older generation promoted his rapid rise, including Song Ping, Hu Yaobang, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin.[1]\n\n\nDuring his term in office, Hu reintroduced state control in some sectors of the economy that were relaxed by the previous administration, and was conservative with political reforms. Along with his colleague Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, Hu presided over nearly a decade of consistent economic growth and development that cemented China as a major world power. He sought to improve socio-economic equality domestically through the Scientific Outlook on Development, which aimed to build a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\" that was prosperous and free of social conflict. Under his leadership, the authorities also cracked down on social disturbances, ethnic minority protests, and dissident figures, which also led to many controversial events such as the unrest in Tibet and the passing of the Anti-Secession Law. In foreign policy, Hu advocated for \"China's peaceful development\", pursuing soft power in international relations and a corporate approach to diplomacy. Throughout Hu's tenure, China's influence in Africa, Latin America, and other developing regions increased.\n\n\nHu possessed a modest and reserved leadership style. His tenure was characterized by collective leadership and consensus-based rule.[2] These traits made Hu a rather enigmatic figure in the public eye. His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping. Following the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu is the only living former paramount leader of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu's birthplace, Jiangyan, Jiangsu.\n\nHu Jintao was born on 21 December 1942[4] in Tai County, Jiangsu province, which was under Japanese occupation at the time. He is a direct descendant of the Ming dynasty general Hu Zongxian, known for fighting Japanese pirates.[5] His branch of the family migrated from Jixi County, Anhui to Taizhou during his grandfather's generation. Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor. His mother was a teacher and died when he was 7, and he was raised by an aunt. Hu's father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution, an event that (together with his relatively humble origins) apparently had a deep effect upon Hu, who diligently tried to clear his father's name.[6]\n\n\nHe joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1964. That year he graduated from Tsinghua University after studying hub hydropower stations at the Water Conservancy Engineering Department. He worked as a political counselor at Tsinghua.[7]:\u200a107 In July 1965, Hu began work as an engineer.[8]\n\n\nIn 1968, during the Third Front construction,[9]:\u200a179 Hu volunteered for his service in Gansu and worked on the construction of Liujiaxia Hydroelectric Station[10] while also managing CCP affairs for the local branch of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. From 1969 to 1974, he worked for Sinohydro Engineering Bureau.[11]\n\n\nHu is married[*when?*] to Liu Yongqing, whom he met at Tsinghua University when they were studying there. They have two children together, Hu Haifeng and Hu Haiqing. Unlike Wen Jiabao, the premier, he never granted a public one-on-one interview with the media.[12][13]\nHe has been noted for his liking of table tennis and ballroom dancing.[14][15]\nHu is also said to possess a photographic memory that became evident in his high school days.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1973, Hu was transferred to the Construction Department of Gansu as a secretary. The next year he was promoted to deputy senior party secretary. In 1980, Deng Xiaoping implemented the \"Four Transformations\" program, which aimed to produce communist leaders who were \"more revolutionary, younger, more knowledgeable, and more specialized.\" In response to this nationwide search for young party members, Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu's governor) discovered Hu Jintao and promoted him several ranks to the position of deputy head of the commission.[18] Another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Song, Wen Jiabao, also became prominent at the same time.\n\n\nIn 1982, Hu was promoted to the position of Communist Youth League Gansu Branch secretary and was appointed as the director of the All-China Youth Federation.[19][1] His mentor, Song Ping, was transferred to Beijing as Minister of Organization of the Chinese Communist Party, and was in charge of senior cadres' recommendation, candidacy and promotion. With the support of Hu Yaobang (no relation) and Deng Xiaoping, Hu was assured of a bright future in the party. At Song Ping's suggestion, in 1982 central CCP authorities invited Hu to Beijing to study at the Central Party School.[20] Soon after, he was transferred to Beijing and appointed to a position in the secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee (\"CY Central\"). Two years later Hu was promoted to first secretary of CY Central, thus its actual leader. During his term in the Youth League, Hu escorted Hu Yaobang, who was CCP general secretary then, in visits around the country. Hu Yaobang, himself a veteran coming from the Youth League, could reminiscence his youth through Hu's company.[21]\n\n\n\n### Leading the party in Guizhou[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Communist Party general secretary Hu Yaobang pushed for Hu Jintao to be transferred to Guizhou as the provincial Committee secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.[22] Hu attempted to improve the economy of the backwater province, and reputedly visited all of its eighty-six counties.[23] While in Guizhou, Hu was careful to follow Beijing's directives and had a reputation of being \"airtight\"; he rarely would offer his views on policy matters in public.[23] While Hu was generally seen as an official with integrity and honesty, some locals preferred his predecessor Zhu Houze. In 1987, Hu Jintao handled the local students protest parallel to the Democracy Wall carefully, whereas in Beijing similar protests resulted in Hu Yaobang's forced resignation.\n\n\n\n### Tenure in Tibet[edit]\n\n\nHu Yaobang was purged by Deng Xiaoping in 1987 due to his 'liberal' tendencies, and his departure from the political scene was initially seen as unfavourable towards Hu Jintao, who drew criticism from party elders for failing to criticize the ousted reformer.[24] In 1988, Hu Jintao was transferred to become Party Regional Committee secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, while also taking on the role of Political Commissar of the local People's Liberation Army units. This made Hu effectively the number-one figure in the vast, restive region. A number of Tibetans have long been opposed to government policy in the region. Unrest and ethnic conflict were brewing, particularly anti-Han sentiments among segments of ethnic Tibetan society. Minor clashes had been occurring since 1987, and when the scale of unrest grew, Hu responded with the deployment of some 1,700 People's Armed Police into Lhasa in February 1989 in an attempt to warn against further disturbance.[25] Increased clashes culminated in serious rioting in Lhasa's core on 5 March 1989, five days before the 30th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising.[26] What occurred after is a matter of dispute. Rioters accused the police of shooting them arbitrarily, and the police claimed that they had acted in self-defense. In addition, there was speculation that Hu delayed his orders to clamp down on the protesters until late into the evening, when the police chief was forced to act because the situation was spiraling out of control. The protesters were suppressed early into the next day, and Hu asked Beijing to declare martial law on 8 March.[27]\n\n\nHu's role in the demonstrations and rioting on 5 March was never made clear. While it is general protocol that Hu must have at least implicitly approved the use of force against protesters, whether he actually gave orders throughout 5 March is a matter of debate.[c] In addition, John Tkacik cites that Hu had been coordinating with the Chengdu Military Region for troops to be on full alert as the situation progressed.[25] Some diplomatic analysts linked what they saw as Hu's brutal use of force to the suppression of activists and students in Tiananmen Square, which took place three months later. Whether Hu provided \"inspiration\" for the PLA on 4 June is a matter of debate, but it was clear that Hu's actions in Lhasa earned him unprecedented attention in the upper echelons of party power, including by \"paramount leader\" Deng Xiaoping.[1] When tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square, Hu was one of the first regional leaders to publicly declare his support for the central authorities.[25]\n\n\nHu experienced high-altitude sickness in June 1990, and returned to Beijing, but remained in his position for another two years, during which he achieved little. His departure to Beijing was seen, however, simply as a pretext to return to the center of Chinese politics, which led to some doubts as to whether or not he was as ill as he had claimed.[25] Martin Seiff of United Press International commented on Putin and Hu: \"Both are tough and able authoritarians who had extensive experience of repressing dissent on their rise to the top.\"[28]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu Jintao during a defense meeting held at the Pentagon, May 2002\nBefore the opening of the 14th National Congress of the CCP in 1992, senior party leaders, including Deng and Chen Yun, were to select candidates for the CCP Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) to ensure a smooth transition of power from the so-called second-generation leaders (Deng, Chen, Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, etc.) to third-generation leaders (Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi etc.). Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders.[29] Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader. As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.\n\n\nIn 1992, Hu took charge of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party as its first secretary, which oversaw day-to-day operations of the CCP Central Committee, and the Central Party School, which was convenient for him to bring up his own supporters among senior CCP cadres. Hu was also put in charge of the ideological work of the CCP. Although Hu was considered heir apparent to Jiang, he always took great care to ensure that Jiang be at the center of the spotlight. In late 1998, Hu promoted Jiang's unpopular movement of the \"Three Stresses\"\u00a0\u2013 \"stress study, stress politics, and stress healthy trends\"\u00a0\u2013 giving speeches to promote it. In 2001, he publicized Jiang's Three Represents theory, which Jiang hoped to place himself on the same level as other Marxist theoreticians.[30] In 1998, Hu became vice president, and Jiang wanted Hu to play a more active role in foreign affairs. Hu became China's leading voice during the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999.[31]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hu\u2013Wen Administration\n\n### Succeeded Jiang Zemin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu Jintao speech as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and President of China\nOn 15 November 2002, after the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, a new Hu Jintao-led Politburo nominally succeeded Jiang's, while Hu became the CCP general secretary, effectively making him the paramount leader. Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier. However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary.[32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post. Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\nDeng Xiaoping appointed three party General Secretaries, all designed to be successors, and was instrumental in the ousting of two of them, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. His third and final selection, Jiang Zemin, won Deng's continued, although ambiguous, backing and was the only general secretary in Communist Chinese history to voluntarily leave his post when his term ended.\n\n\nAlthough Jiang, then 76, stepped down as general secretary and from the Politburo Standing Committee to make way for a younger leadership, there was speculation that Jiang would retain significant influence because Hu was not associated with Jiang's influential Shanghai clique, to which six out of the nine members of the all-powerful Standing Committee were believed to be linked. However, later developments show that many of its members had shifted their positions. Zeng Qinghong, for example, moved from a disciple of Jiang to serving as an intermediary between the two factions.[33]\n\n\nHu and Premier Wen Jiabao inherited a China wrought with internal social, political and environmental problems. One of the biggest challenges Hu faced was the large wealth disparity between the Chinese rich and poor, for which discontent and anger mounted to a degree which wreaked havoc on the Communist Party's rule. Furthermore, the cronyism and corruption plaguing China's civil service, military, educational, judicial and medical systems threatened to destabilize the country bit by bit.\n\n\nHu was mostly conservative on political reforms during his tenure.[34] In the beginning of 2006, Hu launched the \"8 Honours and 8 Shames\" movement in a bid to promote a more selfless and moral outlook amongst the population.[1]\nAt the 17th CCP National Congress, Hu was re-elected as general secretary of the Central Committee and chairman of the CCP Central Military Commission on 22 October 2007. At the 11th National People's Congress, Hu was re-elected as president on 15 March 2008. He was also re-elected as chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission.[35]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\n#### SARS crisis[edit]\n\n\nThe first crisis of Hu's leadership happened during the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Following strong criticism of China for initially covering up and responding slowly to the crisis, he dismissed several party and government officials, including the health minister, who supported Jiang, and the Mayor of Beijing, Meng Xuenong, widely perceived as Hu's prot\u00e9g\u00e9.[1]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hu talks with U.S. President Barack Obama at the 2009 Pittsburgh G-20 Summit\n![](image)Hu with George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush in Beijing, 10 August 2008\n#### Economic policies[edit]\n\n\nHu and Wen Jiabao took a more conservative approach towards reforms, and began to reverse some of Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 2005. Observers note that the government adopted more egalitarian and populist policies.[36] The administration increased subsidies and control over the health care sector,[37] increased funding for education, halted privatization,[38] and adopted a loose monetary policy, which led to the formation of a U.S.-style property bubble in which property prices tripled.[39]\n\n\nThe privileged state sector was the primary recipient of government investment, which, under the new administration, promoted the rise of large \"national champions\" which could compete with large foreign corporations.[38] During Hu's administration, the Chinese government increasingly funded the consolidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), supplying massive subsidies and favoring SOEs in regulatory matters.[9]:\u200a217 These efforts helped SOEs to crowd out foreign and domestic private sector competitors.[9]:\u200a217 Nevertheless, the share of SOEs in the total number of companies have continued to fall, dropping to 5%, though their share of total output remained at 26%. Exchange rates for the yuan were also liberalized and the peg to the U.S. dollar was broken, leading the yuan to rise by 31% against the dollar from 2005 to 2012.[40] China's economic growth has averaged around 10% under Hu, while the economy surpassed the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan.[41][40]\n\n\nAfter taking over, Hu and Wen proposed to set up a Harmonious Society which aimed at lessening inequality and changing the style of the \"GDP first and Welfare Second\" policies.[42] They focused on sectors of the Chinese population that had been left behind by the economic reform, and took a number of high-profile trips to the poorer areas of China with the stated goal of understanding these areas better. Hu and Wen Jiabao also attempted to move China away from a policy of favouring economic growth at all costs and toward a more balanced view of growth that includes factors in social inequality and environmental damage, including the use of the green gross domestic product in personnel decisions. Jiang's clique, however, maintained control in most developing areas; as a result, Hu and Wen's macroeconomic regulation measures faced great resistance.[1]\n\n\n\n#### Tibet[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Tibetan unrest\n\n#### Hong Kong[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Democratic development in Hong Kong\n\n![](image)Protests against Hu Jintao in Hong Kong, July 2012\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of international trips made by Hu Jintao\n\n![](image)Hu Jintao with Leaders of the BRICS countries, from left, Singh, Medvedev, Rousseff and Zuma in April 2011\n![](image)Hu Jintao, Vice President Joseph Biden and Hillary Rodham Clinton\n![](image)The Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh and the President of China, Hu Jintao during G-8 Summit, at Sapporo, Japan on July 08, 2008\n![](image)Protests against Hu Jintao during his US visit, 18 January 2011\nUnder Hu's leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Jiang Zemin.[43] China's international behavior continued to be generally pragmatic and predictable.[43] Hu pledged that China would seek peaceful development in a harmonious world to assure the international community that China's rise offered opportunities and benefits rather than conflicts.[44] The key attributes of a harmonious world view of foreign policy are building and accepting a world where countries diverge in their paths of national development and political systems, coexistence of diverse civilizations, and rejected unilateralism and hegemonic ambitions.[45]\n\n\nIn 2006, Hu articulated the four phases of China's foreign policy developmental objectives: (1) big powers were the key, (2) periphery countries the priority, (3) developing countries the foundation, and (4) multilateralism the stage.[44]\n\n\nIn 2009, Chinese leader Hu Jintao called for a bolstered arms control agenda at the United Nations General Assembly, joining United States President Barack Obama's earlier calls for a nuclear-free world.[46]\n\n\nThroughout Hu's tenure, China's influence in Africa, Latin America, and other developing regions increased.[47] He sought to develop China's relationship with Japan, which he visited in 2008.[48] He downgraded relations with Russia because of unfulfilled deals.[49]\n\n\nHu emphasized an international relations premise of \"shared responsibility\": China would contribute to global common good, but it must not adversely affect its core interests in doing so, and its commitments must be conditional to those of other nations.[50] In the analysis of academic Suisheng Zhao, under Hu's leadership, \"China remained a reluctant rising power and selectively took on global and regional obligations. Chinese foreign policy became omnidirectional, multilevel, and multidimensional.\"[44]\n\n\n\n#### Taiwan[edit]\n\n\nEarly in his leadership, Hu faced a pro-independence counterpart in then Republic of China (ROC) president Chen Shui-bian. Chen called for talks without any preconditions, repudiating the 1992 consensus. Chen Shui-bian and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had continued to express an ultimate goal of de jure Taiwanese independence, and made statements on the political status of Taiwan that the PRC considers provocative. Hu's initial response was a combination of \"soft\" and \"hard\" approaches. On the one hand, Hu expressed a flexibility to negotiate on many issues of concern to Taiwan. On the other hand, he continued to refuse talks without preconditions and remained committed to Chinese unification as an ultimate goal. While Hu gave some signs of being more flexible with regard to political relationships with Taiwan as in his May 17 Statement, where he offered to address the issue of \"international living space\" for Taiwan, Hu's government remained firm in its position that the PRC would not tolerate any attempt by the Taiwanese government to declare de jure independence from China.[51]\n\n\nAfter Chen's re-election in 2004, Hu's government changed tactics, conducting a no-contact policy with Taiwan due to Chen and the DPP's independence leanings and repudiation of the 1992 consensus. The government maintained its military build-up against Taiwan, and pursued a vigorous policy of isolating Taiwan diplomatically. In March 2005, the Anti-Secession Law was passed by the National People's Congress, formalizing \"non-peaceful means\" as an option of response to a declaration of independence in Taiwan.\n\n\nHu's government increased contacts with the Kuomintang (KMT), its former foe in the Chinese Civil War, and still a major party in Taiwan.[52]:\u200a138 The increased contacts culminated in the 2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China, including a historic meeting between Hu and then-KMT chairman Lien Chan in April 2005. This was the first meeting between the leaders of the two parties since the conclusion of World War II.[53][54]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2008, the Kuomintang under Ma Ying-jeou won the presidency in Taiwan, and a majority in the Legislative Yuan. Thereafter Hu immediately turned to a more 'soft' diplomatic approach and opened the way to a thaw in relations between the two sides.[55] A series of historic meetings between the CCP and KMT have followed. On 12 April 2008, Hu Jintao met with Taiwan's vice president-elect Vincent Siew in the latter's role as chairman of the Cross-strait Common Market Foundation during the Boao Forum for Asia. On 28 May 2008, Hu met with KMT chairman Wu Po-hsiung, the first meeting between the heads of the CCP and the KMT as ruling parties. During this meeting, Hu and Wu agreed that both sides should re-commence official dialogue under the 1992 consensus \u2013 that \"both sides recognize there is only one China, but agree to differ on its definition.\" Wu committed the new government in Taiwan against Taiwanese independence; Hu committed his government to addressing the concerns of the Taiwanese people in regard to security, dignity, and \"international living space\", with a priority given to allowing Taiwan to participate in the World Health Organization.\n\n\nIn addition to the party-to-party dialogue, de facto governmental dialogue took place via the Straits Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits in June 2008 on the basis of the 1992 Consensus, with the first meeting held in Beijing. Both Hu and his new counterpart Ma Ying-jeou agreed that the 1992 Consensus is the basis for negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan strait. On 26 March 2008, Hu Jintao held a telephone talk with then US president George W. Bush, in which he became the first Chinese leader to officially recognize the 1992 Consensus.[56] After several months of negotiations, in December 2008, the two sides agreed on the resumption of the Three Links, i.e., a re-opening of mail, trade, and direct air links between the two sides. Relations continued to be cordial between the two sides during Hu's tenure, and trade increased immensely, culminating in the signing of the preferential trade agreement Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) in 2010.\n\n\n\n### Power transition of Xi Jinping[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party\n\nSee also: 12th National People's Congress\n\nOn 15 November 2012, immediately after the 18th CCP National Congress, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee, succeeding Hu.[57] On 14 March 2013, he was succeeded by Xi as president.[58]\n\n\n\n## After retirement[edit]\n\n\nSince his retirement, Hu has kept a low-profile, rarely making public appearances. In September 2013, Hu visited an ancestral family home in Huangshan, Anhui, though the trip was not covered by state media.[59] In April 2014, he made an appearance in Hunan, visiting Hunan University and other historical sites.[60] He attended the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017.[61] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2019, and the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in July 2021.[62]\n\n\n\n### 20th Communist Party Congress[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hu Jintao's removal from the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party\n\nAt the closing ceremony of the 20th CCP National Congress on 22 October, Hu Jintao, who had been sitting next to Xi, was pulled from his seat and escorted out of the hall by two men in suits and with name badges.[63][64][65] This incident occurred before the votes that day, and Hu was absent from the voting due to this incident.[66][67] Xinhua News Agency, China's official press agency, stated that Hu was not feeling well,[68] while foreign news speculated whether Hu was genuinely sick or whether this was a deliberate political signal by Xi.[69][70][71] The incident was not broadcast in China and both Hu's and Hu's son's names were blocked by Chinese censors.[72]\n\n\n\n### Jiang Zemin's funeral[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu was appointed to serve on the funeral committee, ranked 36th on the list out of over 700 names.[73] Hu Jintao appeared in public alongside Xi Jinping on 5 December 2022, attending the farewell ceremony before Jiang's body was cremated in Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery.[74] He was accompanied by an aide.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nHu presided over a decade of consistent economic growth, led China through the storm of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, and increased China's international stature immensely.[75] China's achievements under Hu included modernizing China's infrastructure, launching China's first crewed space probe, and sponsoring two successful international events: the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai Expo.[75] In addition, Hu's \"soft approach\" to Taiwan, coinciding with the election of a Kuomintang government in Taipei, improved the relationship between mainland China and Taiwan. Trade and contact between the two sides increased significantly during Hu's tenure. In addition, Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao's populist policies have resulted in the elimination of agricultural taxes for farmers, more flexible policies towards migrant workers living in cities, more balanced development between the coastal regions and the hinterlands, enforcing minimum wage in cities and the promotion of sustainable and affordable housing developments. The response to the SARS public health crisis and the massive expansion of health insurance coverage for middle- to low-income citizens earned Hu accolades domestically. Generally speaking, these policies have been well received by the Chinese public.[76]\n\n\nIn foreign policy, Hu's critics say that his government was overly aggressive in asserting its new power, overestimated its reach, and raised the ire and apprehension of various neighbours, including Southeast Asian countries, India, and Japan. Such policies are also said to be provocative towards the United States.[77] Domestic critics, including the country's elites, intellectuals, and particularly dissidents, point to various shortcomings of the Hu administration and his failure in implementing his signature \"Socialist Harmonious Society\" policy. They cite, for example, that China's internal security budget exceeded its military budget during Hu's tenure as protests and other 'mass incidents' continued to increase across the country.[78] China's Gini coefficient climbed to 0.47 by 2010, indicating a potentially unsustainable gap between the rich and the poor.[75] The Hu administration's inability to rein in the wealth gap and its renewed emphasis on the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the economy led some economists to believe that Hu missed a critical opportunity for reform and structural adjustment.[79] Hu's increased support for SOEs, including to merger and consolidate, is a trend that has continued during the administration of Xi Jinping.[9]:\u200a217\n\n\nHu's tough-on-corruption policies saw mixed results. While there were some attempts to increase transparency in the expenditures of official organs and bureaucrats, deeply entrenched systemic issues that were contributing to the growth of corruption remained unresolved. In addition, the massive corruption scandal that ensnared the military shortly after Hu's departure from office showed that Hu was unable to tackle entrenched interests in the military. In his own departing speech at the 18th Party Congress, Hu emphasized the potentially devastating effects that unchecked corruption would have on the party and the country. Moreover, the Hu administration's insistence on censorship and the curtailing of freedom of speech drew extensive criticism from human rights organizations and Western governments,[75] while artists and writers inside the country chided increased restrictions on cultural expressions during Hu's term. Although in the early years of his tenure Hu attempted to pioneer a form of \"intraparty democracy\" that called for greater participation from lower-ranked members to determine policy and select the leadership, there was little evidence of meaningful changes to the party's governing structure and decision-making process.[78]\n\n\nConsensus-based decision-making became a hallmark of the Hu era. Hu was never a strongman, did not rule with an iron fist, and was often seen as first-among-equals with his Politburo Standing Committee colleagues. Some called China's political landscape during Hu's era one of \"nine dragons taming the water\" (\u4e5d\u9f99\u6cbb\u6c34), that is, nine PSC members each ruling over their own fief. In addition, Hu not only faced a profusion of special interest groups and political factions within the party, his ability to implement a cohesive program was also constrained by the influence of former leader Jiang Zemin.[80] Consequently, there is debate on how much power Hu held personally to effect change. Nevertheless, within the context of the system he was placed in, Hu was credited for being an effective mediator and consensus-builder.[75] Hu also won praise for stepping down as military chief in favour of his successor Xi Jinping, and at the same time relinquishing his position as general secretary. This was seen as a message to the establishment and Jiang Zemin that elders should retire according to protocol and avoid meddling in the affairs of their successors.[81]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Scientific Outlook on Development[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Scientific Outlook on Development\n\nPolitical observers indicate that Hu distinguished himself from his predecessor in both domestic and foreign policy. Hu's political philosophy during his leadership is summarized by three slogans\u00a0\u2014 a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\" domestically and \"Peaceful Development\" internationally, the former aided by the Scientific Development Concept, which seeks integrated sets of solutions to arrays of economic, environmental and social problems, and recognizes, in inner circles, a need for cautious and gradual political reforms.[42] The Scientific Outlook on Development was written into the CCP and State Constitutions in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The role of the Party has changed, as formulated by Deng Xiaoping and implemented by Jiang Zemin, from a revolutionary party to a ruling party. During his tenure he continued the Party's modernization, calling for both \"Advancement\" of the Party and its increasing transparency in governance.\n\n\nWhat emerges from these philosophies, in Hu's view, is a country with a systematic approach to national structure and development that combines dynamic economic growth, a free market energized by a vigorous \"nonpublic\" (i.e., private) sector, heavy-handed political and media control, personal but not political freedoms, concern for the welfare of all citizens, cultural enlightenment, and a synergistic approach to diverse social issues (the Scientific Development Perspective) that lead, in Hu's vision, to a \"Harmonious Socialist Society\". In the view of the Chinese government, these philosophies, which have created a new \"China Model\" of governance, serve as a legitimate alternative to the West's \"Democracy Model\", particularly for developing countries. In Hu's words, \"A Harmonious Socialist Society should feature democracy, the rule of law, equity, justice, sincerity, amity and vitality.\"[42] Such a society, he says, will give full scope to people's talent and creativity, enable all the people to share the social wealth brought by reform and development, and forge an ever-closer relationship between the people and government. Hu even emphasized the potential of religious communities to contribute to economic and social development under the banner of \"Building a Harmonious Socialist Society.\"[82]\n\n\nSome observers attribute the political origins of low-carbon development strategy to Hu's Scientific Outlook on Development, although some industrial support in this area had already begun before Hu's formulation of the Scientific Outlook on Development.[83]:\u200a23\n\n\nWestern criticism of Hu, particularly regarding human rights, exposes his hypersensitivity to social stability but does not lay as much emphasis on his fresh commitment to address China's multi-faceted social problems.[42] Hu's pragmatic, non-ideological agenda had two core values\u2014maintaining social stability to further economic development and sustaining Chinese culture to enrich national sovereignty. In domestic policy, he seems to want more openness to the public on governmental functions and meetings. Recently, China's news agency published many Politburo Standing Committee meeting details. He also cancelled many events that are traditionally practiced, such as the lavish send-off and welcoming-back ceremonies of Chinese leaders when visiting foreign lands. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership under Hu also focused on such problems as the gap between rich and poor and uneven development between the interior and coastal regions. Both party and state seem to have moved away from a definition of development that focuses solely on GDP growth and toward a definition which includes social equality and environment effects.[51]\n\n\nIn 2004, Hu gave an unprecedented showing and ordered all cadres from the five major power functions to stop the tradition of going to the Beidaihe seaside retreat for their annual summer meeting, which, before, was commonly seen as a gathering of ruling elites from both current and elder cadres to decide China's destiny, and also an unnecessary waste of public funds. The move was seen by the Chinese public as symbolic of Hu's attitude towards corruption.\n\n\nIn June 2007, Hu gave an important speech at the Central Party School that was indicative of his position of power and his guiding philosophies. In the speech Hu used a very populist tone to appeal to ordinary Chinese, making serious note of the recent challenges China was facing, especially with regards to income disparity. In addition, Hu noted the need for \"increased democracy\" in the country.[84]\n\n\n\n### Moral guidance[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the great number of social problems in China, in March 2006, Hu Jintao released the \"Eight Honors and Eight Shames\" as a set of moral codes to be followed by the Chinese people, and emphasized the need to spread the message to the youth.[85] Alternatively known as the \"Eight Honors and Disgraces\", it contained eight poetic lines which summarized what a good citizen should regard as an honor and what to regard as a shame. It has been widely regarded as one of Hu Jintao's ideological solutions to the perceived increasing lack of morality in China after Chinese economic reforms brought in a generation of Chinese predominantly concerned with earning money and power in an increasingly frail social fabric.[86]\n\n\nIt has become a norm for Chinese communist leaders to make their own contributions to Marxist\u2013Leninist theory. Whether this is Hu's contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory is debatable, but its general reception with the Chinese public has been moderate. Its promotion, however, is visible almost everywhere: in classroom posters, banners on the street, and electronic display boards for the preparation of the 2008 Olympics, and Expo 2010 in Shanghai. The codes differ from the ideologies of his predecessors, namely, Jiang's Three Represents, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and Mao Zedong Thought in that the focus, for the first time, has been shifted to codifying moral standards as opposed to setting social or economic goals.[87]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n*Newsweek* named Hu the second most powerful person in the world in 2009, referring to him as \"the man behind the wheel of the world's most supercharged economy.\"[88] *Forbes* also named him the second most powerful person in the world later that year.[89] Hu was named the 2010 World's Most Powerful Person by *Forbes Magazine*.[90] Hu was listed four times (2008, 2007, 2005 and 2004) on the Time 100 annual list of most influential people. In 2010, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Hu among the list of press freedom predators.[91]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* Colombia:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit (21 January 1997)[92]\n* Cuba:\n\t+ ![](image) Member of the Order of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (23 November 2004)[93]\n* Jordan:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance (14 January 2001)[94]\n* Madagascar:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cordon of the National Order of Madagascar (25 January 1999)[95]\n* Pakistan:\n\t+ ![](image) Recipient of the Nishan-e-Pakistan (24 November 2006)[96]\n* Peru:\n\t+ ![](image) Grand Cross of Order of the Sun of Peru (19 November 2008)[97]\n* Turkmenistan:\n\t+ ![](image) Member of the Order of Saparmurat T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy the Great (29 August 2008)[98]\n* Ukraine:\n\t+ ![](image) Member 1st Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise (31 August 2010)[99]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* History of the People's Republic of China (2002\u2013present)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** /hu\u02d0 d\u0292\u026an\u02c8ta\u028a/; Chinese: \u80e1\u9526\u6d9b; pinyin: *H\u00fa J\u01d0nt\u0101o*; Mandarin pronunciation: [xu\u030c\u00a0t\u0255i\u0300n.t\u02b0a\u0301\u028a]\n2. **^** \"Paramount leader\" is not a formal title; it is a reference occasionally used by media outlets and scholars to refer to the foremost political leader in China at a given time.

Jiang was the third paramount leader of China from 1989 to 2002. He was the core leader of the third generation of Chinese leadership, one of four core leaders alongside Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Xi Jinping.\n\n\nBorn in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, Jiang joined the CCP while he was in college. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, he received training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s, later returning to Shanghai in 1962 to serve in various institutes, later being sent between 1970 and 1972 to Romania as part of an expert team to establish machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After 1979, he was appointed as the vice chair of two commissions by vice premier Gu Mu to oversee the newly established special economic zones (SEZs). He became the vice minister of the newly established Ministry of Electronics Industry and a member of the CCP Central Committee in 1982.\n\n\nJiang was appointed as the mayor of Shanghai in 1985, later being promoted to its Communist Party secretary, as well as a member of the CCP Politburo, in 1987. Jiang came to power unexpectedly as a compromise candidate following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, when he replaced Zhao Ziyang as CCP general secretary after Zhao was ousted for his support for the student movement. As the involvement of the \"Eight Elders\" in Chinese politics steadily declined,[1] Jiang consolidated his hold on power to become the \"paramount leader\" in the country during the 1990s.[b] Urged by Deng Xiaoping's southern tour in 1992, Jiang officially introduced the term \"socialist market economy\" in his speech during the 14th CCP National Congress held later that year, which accelerated \"opening up and reform\".[2]\n\n\nUnder Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of market reforms. The returning of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom in 1997 and of Macau from Portugal in 1999, and entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, were landmark moments of his era.[3] China also witnessed improved relations with the outside world, while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the state. Jiang faced criticism over human rights abuses, including the crackdown on the Falun Gong movement. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the \"Three Represents\", were written into the CCP constitution in 2002. Jiang gradually vacated his official leadership titles from 2002 to 2005, being succeeded in these roles by Hu Jintao, although he and his political faction continued to influence affairs until much later. In 2022, Jiang died in Shanghai.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduation photo of Jiang, taken in 1947\nJiang Zemin was born in the city of Yangzhou, Jiangsu, on 17 August 1926.[4] His ancestral home was the Jiangcun Village (\u6c5f\u6751) in Jingde County, Anhui. This was also the hometown of a number of prominent figures in Chinese academic and intellectual establishments.[5] Jiang grew up during the years of Japanese occupation. His uncle and foster father, Jiang Shangqing, died fighting the Japanese and was considered in Jiang Zemin's time to be a national hero.[6]:\u200a40 After Shangqing's death, Zemin became his male heir.[7]\n\n\nJiang attended the Department of Electrical Engineering at the National Central University in Japanese-occupied Nanjing before transferring to National Chiao Tung University (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University). He graduated there in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.[8] Jiang joined the Chinese Communist Party when he was in college.[9] After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, Jiang received his training at the Stalin Automobile Works in Moscow in the 1950s.[10] He also worked for Changchun's First Automobile Works.[11] As Jiang became increasingly involved in the Communist Party, his main work shifted from the technical side of engineering to administrative and political tasks.[6]:\u200a140\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang in 1962\nIn 1962, he returned to Shanghai and became the deputy director of the Shanghai Electric Research Institute. In 1966, he was appointed as the director and deputy party secretary of a thermal engineering research institute in Wuhan, which was established by the First Ministry of Machine Building. When the Cultural Revolution began in the same year, he did not suffer greatly during the turmoil, but was pulled down from his position as director of the institute and was sent to a May Seventh Cadre School. In 1970, after leaving the cadre school, he became the deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the ministry and was sent to the Socialist Republic of Romania, where he served as head of the expert team to establish fifteen machinery manufacturing plants in the country. After the completion of his mission in 1972, he returned to China.[12][13][14]\n\n\nIn 1979, following a thawing of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, Deng Xiaoping decided to encourage special economic zones (SEZs) as part of his Four Modernizations.[15] China's State Council established two ministerial commissions to increase trade and foreign investment. The commissions were headed by vice premier Gu Mu, who appointed Jiang as vice chairman of both commissions, a position equivalent to vice minister.[16] Jiang's role was to ensure these SEZs increased economic prosperity without becoming \"conduits\" for foreign ideology.[16] In 1980, Jiang headed a delegation which toured other SEZs in twelve countries; upon his return, he issued a radical report which recommended allowing local authorities to issue tax breaks and land leases, and increasing the power of foreign joint ventures.[17] The report initially \"caused consternation\" among party leaders, but his pragmatic and empirical presentation appealed to Deng Xiaoping. His proposals were approved at the National People's Congress, cementing Jiang as an \"early implementer\" of Deng Xiaoping Theory.[18]\n\n\nIn March 1982, he was pushed out as vice chairman of two commissions. After pressure from premier Gu and Shanghai mayor Wang Daohan, \"ardent reformist\" Zhao Ziyang appointed Jiang as the first vice minister and party secretary of the newly established Ministry of Electronics Industry.[19]\n\n\nAt the 12th Party Congress held in September 1982, Jiang became a member of the Central Committee of the CCP, which determines policy and elects the members of the Politburo.[19]\n\n\n\n## Career in Shanghai[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Jiang became mayor of Shanghai. Jiang received mixed reviews as mayor. Many of his critics dismissed him as a \"flower pot\", a Chinese term for someone who only seems useful, but actually gets nothing done.[20] Many credited Shanghai's growth during the period to Zhu Rongji.[21] Jiang was an ardent believer, during this period, in Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms. In an attempt to curb student discontent in 1986, Jiang recited the Gettysburg Address in English in front of a group of student protesters.[22][23][24]\n\n\nAt the 13th National Congress of the CCP held in October 1987, Jiang was promoted from mayor to Shanghai party secretary, the most powerful position in the city, reporting directly to the central government.[25] He also joined the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with customs for party secretaries of major cities.[25]\n\n\n\n### Tiananmen Square protests[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1989, former general secretary Hu Yaobang died; he had previously been forced to resign in January 1987 and accused of supporting \"bourgeois liberalization\".[22] His death catalyzed the Tiananmen Square protests,[26] leading to an ideological crisis between \"liberals\" (who supported Deng's aggressive reforms) and \"conservatives\" (who favored slower change).[27] After the Shanghai-based *World Economic Herald* tried to publish a eulogy rehabilitating Hu and praising his reformist stance, Jiang took control of the newspaper's editorial board.[28][29] As the protests continued to grow, the Party imposed martial law and deploy troops in Beijing in May.[30] In Shanghai, 100,000 protestors marched in the streets, and 450 students went on a hunger strike.[31] After the third day, Jiang personally met with them to assure them that the Party shared their goals, and to promise future dialogue. He simultaneously sent a telegram to the Central Committee firmly supporting their martial law declaration.[30]\n\n\nHis careful public appeals were well received by both pro-democracy students and socialist party elders.[32] On 20 May 1989, paramount leader Deng Xiaoping decided to appoint Jiang as the new general secretary, replacing Zhao Ziyang,[32] who had supported the protestors.[33][34] Jiang was selected as a compromise candidate over Tianjin's Li Ruihuan, premier Li Peng, elders Li Xiannian, Chen Yun, and the retired elders to become the new general secretary.[35] Before that, he had been considered to be an unlikely candidate.[36]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power[edit]\n\n\nJiang was appointed as general secretary at the fourth plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee on 24 June 1989 with a fairly small power base inside the party, and thus, very little actual power.[37][9] His most reliable allies were the powerful party elders Chen Yun and Li Xiannian. He was believed to be simply a transitional figure until a more stable successor government to Deng could be put in place.[38] Other prominent Party and military figures like President Yang Shangkun and his brother Yang Baibing were believed to be planning a coup.[39]\n\n\nAt the first meeting of the new CCP Politburo Standing Committee, after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, Jiang criticized the previous period as \"hard on the economy, soft on politics\" and advocated increasing political thought work.[40] Anne-Marie Brady wrote that \"Jiang Zemin was a long time political cadre with a nose for ideological work and its importance. This meeting marked the beginning of a new era in propaganda and political thought work in China.\" Soon after, the Central Propaganda Department was given more resources and power, \"including the power to go in to the propaganda-related work units and cleanse the ranks of those who had been supportive of the democracy movement.\"[40]\n\n\nThe Politburo also issued a list of \"seven things\" regarding \"matters of universal concern to the masses\", with party corruption as the top priority.[41] Jiang was also appointed as the chairman of the Central Military Commission on 9 November 1989, succeeding Deng,[42] and president of the PRC on 27 March 1993;[43] this marked the start of the arrangement in which the paramount leader of China simultaneously serves as Party leader, president and chair of the CMC.[44]\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the People's Republic of China (1989\u20132002)\nIn the first few years, Jiang depended on the support of Deng Xiaoping to remain in power,[45] which forced Jiang into an \"ultranationalist stance\" towards Taiwan and the US.[46] Jiang had supported Deng's calls against \"bourgeois liberalization\", but while Jiang was seen as a \"thoughtful reformer\",[47] he \"[skewed] to the more conservative views of the elders and his Politburo colleagues\".[48] Deng was far more supportive of reforms, saying that \"deviating to the Left is an even greater danger\" than deviating to the right.[49]\n\n\nDeng grew critical of Jiang's leadership in 1992. During Deng's southern tour, he subtly suggested that the pace of reform was not fast enough.[50] Jiang grew ever more cautious, and rallied behind Deng's reforms completely. Jiang coined the new \"socialist market economy\" to move China's centrally-planned socialist economy into essentially a government-regulated market economy.[51] It was a huge step to take in the realization of Deng's \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics.\"[52] At the same time, Jiang elevated many of his supporters from Shanghai to high government positions, after regaining Deng's confidence. He abolished the outdated Central Advisory Commission in 1992, an advisory body composed of revolutionary party elders.\n\n\n\n### Economic development[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, post-Tiananmen economic reforms by Zhu Rongji with Jiang's support had stabilized and the country was on a consistent growth trajectory. At the same time, China faced myriad economic and social problems. At Deng's state funeral in 1997, Jiang delivered the elder statesman's eulogy. Jiang had inherited a China rampant with political corruption, and regional economies growing too rapidly for the stability of the entire country. Deng's policy that \"some areas can get rich before others\" led to an opening wealth gap between coastal regions and the interior provinces. The unprecedented economic growth and the deregulation in a number of heavy industries led to the closing of many state-owned enterprises (SOEs), breaking many people's iron rice bowl and initially removing as many as 40 million jobs from SOEs.[53][54] As a result, unemployment rates skyrocketed, rising as high as 40% in some urban areas. Stock markets fluctuated greatly. The scale of rural migration into urban areas was unprecedented anywhere, and little was being done to address an ever-increasing urban-rural wealth gap. Official reports put the figure on the percentage of China's GDP being moved and abused by corrupt officials at 10%.[55]\n\n\nJiang's biggest aim in the economy was stability, and he believed that a stable government with highly centralized power would be a prerequisite, choosing to postpone political reform, which in many facets of governance exacerbated the ongoing problems.[56] After the coastal regions and SEZs were sufficiently developed, Jiang worked to reduce geographic disparities by encouraging richer cities to \"provide financial, technological, and managerial assistance to the poorer, western ones.\"[57] The construction various infrastructure projects such as the Qinghai\u2013Tibet railway and the Three Gorges Dam began under Jiang's leadership.[58]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang with US president Bill Clinton in 1999\n![](image)Jiang with President of Russia Vladimir Putin at APEC summit in Shanghai (2001)\nUnder Jiang's leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping.[59] China's international behavior was generally both pragmatic and predictable.[59] During Jiang's presidency, serious flare-ups between China and the United States occurred.[60] Nonetheless, Jiang's foreign policy was for the most part passive and non-confrontational.\n\n\nIn July 1993, the United States Navy stopped a Chinese container ship, the *Yinhe*, based on the incorrect suspicion that it was carrying chemical weapon precursors bound for Iran.[61] Although China denied the allegation, the United States cut off the *Yinhe*'s GPS, causing it to lose direction and anchor on the high seas for twenty-four days until it acceded to an inspection.[61] There were no chemical precursors on the ship.[61] Although China sought a formal apology, the United States refused to apologize and refused to pay compensation.[61] Despite the humiliation of the *Yinhe* incident, Jiang took a stance of goodwill towards the United States and adopted the \"sixteen-characters formula\" for working with the United States: \"enhancing confidence, reducing troubles, expanding cooperation, and avoiding confrontation.\"[61]\n\n\nJiang oversaw a series of missile tests in the waters surrounding Taiwan in 1996 in protest to the Republic of China government under President Lee Teng-hui, who had been seen as moving its foreign policy away from the One-China policy.\n\n\nJiang went on a state visit to the United States in 1997, drawing various crowds in protest from the Tibet Independence Movement to supporters of the Chinese democracy movement. He made a speech at Harvard University, part of it in English, but could not escape questions on democracy and freedom. In the official summit meeting with president Bill Clinton, the tone was relaxed as they sought common ground while largely ignoring areas of disagreement. Clinton would visit China in June 1998, and vowed that China and the United States were partners in the world, and not adversaries.[62]\n\n\nAfter the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999, Jiang seemed to have put up a harsh stance for show at home, but in reality only performed symbolic gestures of protest, and no solid action.[56] Jiang deemed the United States-China bilateral relation too important to be harmed in the emotion of the moment and sought to soothe the Chinese public's outrage.[63]\n\n\nThe Hainan island incident was another tense event in the China-United States relations which occurred during Jiang's presidency.[64] On April 1, 2001, a United States US EP-3 surveillance aircraft collided mid-air with a Chinese Shenyang J-8 jet fighter over the South China Sea.[64] China sought a formal apology, and accepted United States Secretary of State Colin Powell's expression of \"very sorry\" as sufficient.[64] The incident nonetheless created negative feelings towards the United States by the Chinese public and increased public feelings of Chinese nationalism.[64]\n\n\nA personal friend of former Canadian prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien,[65] Jiang strengthened China's economic stature abroad, attempting to establish cordial relations with countries whose trade is largely confined to the American economic sphere.\n\n\n\n### Media depiction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang Zemin delivered a speech at the South Korean National Assembly in 1995\nThe *People's Daily* and CCTV-1's 7\u00a0pm *Xinwen Lianbo* each had Jiang-related events as the front-page or top stories, a fact that remained until Hu Jintao's media administrative changes in 2006. Jiang appeared casual in front of Western media, and gave an unprecedented interview with Mike Wallace of CBS in 2000 at Beidaihe. He would often use foreign languages in front of the camera; once, he gave a 40-minute speech entirely in Russian.[66] In an encounter with Hong Kong reporter Sharon Cheung in 2000 regarding the central government's apparent \"imperial order\" of supporting Tung Chee-hwa to seek a second term as Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Jiang scolded the Hong Kong journalists as \"too simple, sometimes naive\" in English.[67]\n\n\n\n### \"Three Represents\"[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Three Represents\n\nOn 25 February 2000, Jiang introduced the theory of Three Represents, which was later enshrined in both Party and State constitutions as an \"important thought\", following in the footsteps of Marxism\u2013Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.[68][69] Officially termed as the latest development of socialism with Chinese characters under Jiang's tenure,[70] the Three Represents justified the incorporation of the new capitalist business class into the party, and changed the founding ideology of the CCP from protecting the interests of the peasantry and workers to that of the \"overwhelming majority of the people\", a euphemism aimed at placating the growing entrepreneurial class. Conservative critics within the party, such as hardline leftist Deng Liqun, denounced this as betrayal of \"true\" communist ideology.[68]\n\n\nBefore he transferred power to a younger generation of leaders, Jiang had his theory of Three Represents written into the Party's constitution, alongside Marxism\u2013Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory at the 16th CCP Congress in 2002.[71]\n\n\n\n### Crackdown on Falun Gong[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Persecution of Falun Gong\n\nIn June 1999, Jiang established an extralegal department, the 610 Office, to crack down on Falun Gong. Cook and Lemish state this was because Jiang was worried that the popular new religious movement was \"quietly infiltrating the CCP and state apparatus.\"[72] On 20 July, security forces arrested thousands of Falun Gong organizers they identified as leaders.[73] The persecution that followed was characterized a nationwide campaign of propaganda, as well as the large-scale arbitrary imprisonment and coercive reeducation of Falun Gong organizers, sometimes resulting in death due to mistreatment in detention.[74][75][76]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Shanghai clique\n\n![](image)Jiang with his wife and George W. Bush with his wife in Crawford, Texas, 25 October 2002\nIn the run-up to the 16th National Congress of the CCP, Hu Jintao had \"almost unanimous support\" to become the new CCP general secretary.[77] To maintain China's image as a stable and respected country, Jiang and Hu emphasized their unity, striving to make this transition the first \"smooth and harmonious\" one in the PRC's history.[78][79] Jiang stepped down as general secretary and left the Politburo Standing Committee, but retained the chairmanship of the Central Military Commission,[80] which controlled the army and the nation's foreign policy.[81] Jiang would continue conselling Hu from \"behind the curtain\", and it was formally agreed that Jiang would be \"consulted on all matters of state importance\".[81] Both men also reached a \"tacit understanding\" that Hu would not be considered a \"core\" leader like Jiang, Deng and Mao.[82]\n\n\nAt the 16th Party Congress, the majority of new members for Standing Committee were considered part of Jiang's so-called \"Shanghai clique\", the most prominent being vice president Zeng Qinghong, who had served as Jiang's chief of staff for many years, and vice premier Huang Ju, a former party secretary of Shanghai.[83]\n\n\nAfter Hu succeeded Jiang as general secretary, the latter continued to \"[dominate] public life\" for several years.[84] The *South China Morning Post* announced that \"a new era has begun in China. But it is not that of Vice President Hu Jintao [...] Rather, it is a new era of President Jiang Zemin, who has just stepped down as the Party's general secretary.\"[80] Early in the 2003 SARS crisis, Jiang remained conspicuously silent, and observers were divided over whether it signified his waning influence, or respect for Hu.[85] It has been argued that the institutional arrangements created by the 16th Congress left Jiang in a position where he could not exercise much influence.[86]\n\n\nAlthough Jiang retained the chairmanship of the CMC, most members of the commission were professional military men. *People's Liberation Army Daily*, a publication thought to represent the views of the CMC majority, printed an article on 11 March 2003 which quotes two army delegates as saying, \"Having one center is called 'loyalty', while having two centers will result in 'problems.'\" This was interpreted as a criticism of Jiang's attempt to exercise dual leadership with Hu on the model of Deng Xiaoping.[87]\n\n\nOn 19 September 2004, after the 4th Plenary Session of the 16th Central Committee, Jiang, at the age of 78, relinquished his post as chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, his last post in the party. Six months later in March 2005, Jiang resigned his last significant post, chairman of the Central Military Commission of the state, which marked the end of Jiang's political career.[*clarification needed*] This followed weeks of speculation that forces inside the party were pressing Jiang to step aside. Jiang's term was supposed to have lasted until 2007. Hu also succeeded Jiang as the CMC chairman, but, in an apparent political defeat for Jiang, General Xu Caihou, and not Zeng Qinghong was appointed to succeed Hu as vice chairman, as was initially speculated. This power transition formally marked the end of Jiang's era in China, which roughly lasted from 1989 to 2004.[88]\n\n\nIn 2008, Jiang published an academic article on China's clean energy resources and another on China's information technology development.[89]:\u200a100\n\n\n\n### Official appearances after retirement[edit]\n\n\nJiang continued to make official appearances after giving up his last title in 2004. In China's strictly defined protocol sequence, Jiang's name always appeared immediately after Hu Jintao's and in front of the remaining sitting members of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee. In 2007, Jiang was seen with Hu Jintao on stage at a ceremony celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army,[90] and toured the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution with Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and other former senior officials.[91] On 8 August 2008, Jiang appeared at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics.[92] He also stood beside Hu Jintao during the mass parade celebrating the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China in October 2009.[93]\n\n\nBeginning in July 2011, false reports of Jiang's death began circulating on the news media outside of mainland China and on the internet.[94][95] While Jiang may indeed have been ill and receiving treatment, the rumors were denied by official sources.[96] On 9 October 2011, Jiang made his first public appearance since his premature obituary in Beijing at a celebration to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution.[97] Jiang reappeared at the 18th Party Congress in October 2012, and took part in the 65th Anniversary banquet of the founding of the People's Republic of China in October 2014. At the banquet he sat next to Xi Jinping, who had then succeeded Hu Jintao as CCP general secretary. In September 2015, Jiang attended the parade celebrating 70 years since end of World War II; there, Jiang again sat next to Xi Jinping and Hu Jintao.[98] He appeared on 29 May 2017 at Shanghai Technology University.[99]\n\n\nAfter Xi Jinping assumed power in 2012, Jiang's position in the protocol sequence of leaders retreated; while he was often seated next to Xi Jinping at official events, his name was often reported after all standing members of the Communist Party's Politburo.[100] Jiang reappeared at the 19th Party Congress on 18 October 2017.[101] He appeared on 29 July 2019 at the funeral of former premier Li Peng.[102][103][104] He also attended the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China mass parade in October 2019, marking his last public appearance prior to his death.[105] He did not attend the 20th Party Congress in October 2022.[106]\n\n\n\n## Family and personal life[edit]\n\n\nJiang married Wang Yeping, also a native of Yangzhou, in 1949.[107] She was his cousin, as Jiang's adoptive mother was Wang's aunt. Wang graduated from Shanghai International Studies University.[108] They had two sons together, Jiang Mianheng and Jiang Miankang.[109] Jiang Mianheng went on to be an academic and businessman, working within the Chinese space program, and founded Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation.[110]\n\n\nIt is believed that Jiang had a long-running friendship with the singer Song Zuying, Chen Zhili, and others.[111][112][113][114][115][116] Following the rise of Xi Jinping, Song and other Jiang loyalists, including her brother Song Zuyu, fell under investigation for corruption.[117][118]\n\n\nJiang had a passable command of several foreign languages,[119] including English and Russian. Jiang remains the only paramount leader of China known to be able to speak in English.[119] He enjoyed engaging foreign visitors in small talk on arts and literature in their native language, in addition to singing foreign songs in the original. In 1987, he sang *When We Were Young* and danced with Dianne Feinstein, who was mayor of San Francisco at the time.[120] Jiang also played the ukulele during his 1997 visit to Hawai'i.[120]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Service for Jiang Zemin at the Great Hall of the People\nMain article: Death and state funeral of Jiang Zemin\n\nJiang died on 30 November 2022, at the age of 96, in Shanghai. According to the Chinese state media Xinhua News Agency, he died at 12:13\u00a0pm from leukemia and multiple organ failures.[121][122] On the day of Jiang's death, the government released a notice that the national flags would be flown half-staff in key locations of Beijing and diplomatic missions abroad. Foreigners were not invited to attend official mourning activities.[123]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jiang's inscription engraved on a stone in his hometown, Yangzhou\nThe policies of his successors, Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, have widely been seen as efforts to address perceived imbalances and move away from a sole focus on economic growth toward a broader view of development which incorporates non-economic factors such as health and the environment.[124]\n\n\nDomestically, Jiang's legacy and reputation is mixed. While some[125] people attributed the period of relative stability and growth in the 1990s to Jiang's term, others argue that Jiang did little to correct systemic imbalance and an accumulation of problems which resulted from years of breakneck-pace economic reforms, leaving the next administration facing innumerable challenges, some of which may have been too late to solve.[126]\n\n\nThe fact that Jiang rose to power as the direct beneficiary of the political aftermath of Tiananmen has shaped the perception of his rule. Following the Tiananmen protests, Jiang threw his support behind elder Chen Yun's conservative economic policies, but subsequently changed his allegiance to Deng Xiaoping's reform-oriented agenda following the latter's \"Southern Tour\". This shift was not only seen as the exercise of a political opportunist, it also sowed confusion among party loyalists in regards to what direction the party was headed or what the party truly believed in.[127] While continued economic reforms resulted in an explosion of wealth around the country, it also led to the formation of special interest groups in many sectors of the economy, and the exercise of state power without any meaningful oversight. This opened the way for the sub-optimal distribution of the fruits of growth, and an expanding culture of corruption among bureaucrats and party officials.[126]\n\n\nHistorian and former Xinhua journalist Yang Jisheng wrote that Jiang might well have been given a positive historical assessment had it not been for his decision to 'overstay his welcome' by remaining in the Central Military Commission post after Hu had formally assumed the party leadership. Moreover, Jiang took credit for all the gains made during the 13 years \"between 1989 and 2002\", which not only evoked the memories of Jiang being a beneficiary of Tiananmen, but also neglected the economic foundations laid by Deng, whose authority was still paramount until the mid-1990s. Additionally, Jiang was also criticized for his insistence on writing the \"Three Represents\" into the party and state constitutions (see below), which Yang called Jiang's attempt at \"self-deification\", i.e., that he saw himself as a visionary along the same lines as Deng and Mao. Yang contended, \"The 'Three Represents' is just common sense. It is not a proper theoretical framework. It's what any ruler would tell the people to justify the continued rule of the governing party.\"[128]\n\n\nJiang did not specialize in economics, and in 1997 handed most of the economic governance of the country to premier Zhu Rongji and remained in office through the Asian financial crisis. Under their joint leadership, Mainland China sustained an average of 8% GDP growth annually, achieving the highest rate of per capita economic growth in major world economies, raising eyebrows around the world with its astonishing speed. This was mostly achieved by continuing the process of a transition to a market economy. Additionally, he helped increase China's international standing with China joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 and Beijing winning the bid to host the 2008 Summer Olympics.[129]\n\n\nSome have also associated Jiang with the widespread corruption and cronyism that had become a notable feature of the Communist power apparatus since Jiang's years in power. In the military, the two vice-chairmen who sat atop the Central Military Commission hierarchy \u2013 nominally as assistants to then chairman Hu Jintao \u2013 Vice Chairmen Xu Caihou and Guo Boxiong, were said to have obstructed Hu Jintao's exercise of power in the military. Xu and Guo were characterized as \"Jiang's proxies in the military\". Eventually, both men were reported to have taken massive bribes, and both fell under the axe of the anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping.[130]\n\n\nAt the same time, many biographers of Jiang have noted his government resembled an oligarchy as opposed to an autocratic dictatorship.[131] Many of the policies of his era had been attributed to others in government, notably premier Zhu Rongji. Jiang was also characterized as a leader who was mindful to seek the opinion of his close advisers. Jiang is often credited with the improvement in foreign relations during his term,[132] but at the same time many Chinese have criticized him for being too conciliatory towards the United States and Russia. The issue of Chinese unification between the mainland and Taiwan gained ground during Jiang's term.[133]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Decoration\n | Country\n | Date\n | Note\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Order of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed | ![](image)\u00a0Cuba | 21 November 1993\n | Order of Cuba\n | [134] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of the Southern Cross | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 23 November 1993\n | Brazilian order of chivalry\n | [135] |\n| ![](image) | First Class of the Order of Prince Yaroslav the Wise | ![](image)\u00a0Ukraine | 2 December 1995\n | Award of Ukraine\n | [136] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the National Order of Mali | ![](image)\u00a0Mali | 17 May 1996\n | The highest honorific order of Mali\n | [137] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Great Star of Djibouti\n | ![](image)\u00a0Djibouti | 18 August 1998\n | Order of Djibouti\n | [138] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Good Hope | ![](image)\u00a0South Africa | 5 May 1999\n | Order of merit of South Africa\n | [139] |\n| ![](image) | Order of the Golden Eagle | ![](image)\u00a0Kazakhstan | 19 November 1999\n | The highest order of Kazakhstan\n | [140] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Merit\n | ![](image)\u00a0Republic of the Congo | 20 March 2000\n | Order of the Republic of Congo\n | [141] |\n| ![](image) | Medal 'Bethlehem 2000'\n | ![](image)\u00a0Palestine | 15 April 2000\n | Medal of the State of Palestine\n | [142] |\n| ![](image) | First Class of the Order of the State of Republic of Turkey | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 19 April 2000\n | The highest state order awarded to foreigners\n | [143] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer | ![](image)\u00a0Greece | 22 April 2000\n | Highest decoration of Greece\n | [144] |\n| ![](image) | Athens Gold Medal\n | ![](image)\u00a0Greece | 22 April 2000\n | Medal of Athens | [145] |\n| ![](image) | Royal Family Order of the Crown of Brunei | ![](image)\u00a0Brunei | 17 November 2000\n | Order of Brunei\n | [146] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cross of the Order of Tahiti Nui | ![](image)\u00a0French Polynesia | 3 April 2001\n | Order of French Polynesia\n | [147][148] |\n| ![](image) | Grand Cordon of the Order of the Liberator | ![](image)\u00a0Venezuela | 17 April 2001\n | The highest order of Venezuela\n | [149] |\n| ![](image) | Medal of Pushkin | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 31 October 2007\n | State decoration of Russia\n | [150] |\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* Jiang Zemin (2010). *Selected Works of Jiang Zemin*.

He went on to hold high office under both Mao Zedong and later Deng Xiaoping; from 1945 to 1965 he was Director of the General Office and from 1945 to 1956 Secretary\u2013General of the Central Military Commission (CMC). In these positions, Yang oversaw much of the day-to-day running of government and Party affairs, both political and military, amassing a great deal of bureaucratic power by controlling things like the flow of documents, the keeping of records, and the approval and allocation of funds.[2] Purged, arrested and imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, he spent 12 years in prison but staged a comeback in 1978, becoming a key ally of Deng, serving as Mayor of Guangzhou (1979\u201381), and returning to the CMC as Secretary\u2013General and also Vice Chairman (1981\u201389), before assuming the presidency.[2]\n\n\nOne of the earliest supporters of Chinese economic reform, Yang justified it with references to Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy. However, he strongly opposed any form of political reform, and, despite his own suffering during the Cultural Revolution, actively defended the image and record of Mao. Together with his half-brother, General Yang Baibing, Yang Shangkun effectively controlled the PLA for the entire 1980s and into the early 1990s. Despite his initial hesitation, he went on to play a leading role in crushing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and was actually the one who planned and supervised the operations to clear the square and surrounding streets. Yang's downfall came in 1993, when he failed in his attempts to undermine the new leadership of Jiang Zemin and to retain control of the PLA, and was forced to retire by a coalition of Party elders, including Deng himself.\n\n\n\n\n## Early political and military activities[edit]\n\n\nYang was born to a land-owning family[3] in Shuangjiang, Tongnan County, near the city of Chongqing in Sichuan, and studied at Chengdu Higher Normal School and its affiliated secondary school in 1920\u201325, and then returned to Chongqing. His older brother, Yang Yingong[4] was one of the founding Executive Committee members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in Sichuan, and influenced Yang Shangkun's ideological orientation. After joining the Communist Youth League in 1925, and the CCP in 1926, he enrolled in Shanghai University, where he studied politics.[5] Later in 1927 Yang traveled to the Soviet Union and enrolled at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, where he studied Marxist theory and techniques of political organization and mobilization.[2][3]\n\n\nYang was a member of a group of Chinese students who studied in Moscow and returned to China to take a leading role in the CCP, later known as the 28 Bolsheviks.[5] The Comintern sent Yang back to China to assist and support other pro-Comintern CCP leaders, including Bo Gu, Wang Ming, and Zhang Guotao, but Yang and some of the other 28 Bolsheviks, including Ye Jianying, Wang Jiaxiang and Zhang Wentian supported Mao Zedong instead. On his return from Moscow in 1931, Yang Shangkun started his military career in the Chinese Red Army, serving as Director of the Political Department in the 1st Red Army and moving around different battle areas under the command of Zhu De and Zhou Enlai. In January 1934, he was appointed Political Commissar of the 3rd Red Army, commanded by Peng Dehuai.[6]\n\n\n\n## Second Sino\u2013Japanese War and Chinese Civil War[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Second Sino\u2013Japanese War Yang Shangkun was Deputy Secretary of the CCP North China Bureau and worked with Liu Shaoqi behind the Japanese lines. In January 1939, Yang became Secretary of the North China Bureau and worked with Zhu De and Peng Dehuai to cooperate with the military operations of the Eighth Route Army, including the Hundred Regiments Campaign. In 1941, Yang returned to Yan'an and worked as personal aide to Mao. In 1945, he became the Director of the General Office of the Party, as well as Secretary\u2013General of the Central Military Commission, that was chaired by Mao himself. In these capacities, he was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration of the Party's military and political work, and carried out this duty with much success.[2]\n\n\nIn the subsequent Chinese Civil War 1949, Yang was Commander of the \"*Central Security Force*\" protecting the Party Center, and, in his roles as Director of the General Office and Secretary\u2013General of the CMC, played a significant role in the ultimate Communist victory and the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.[3]\n\n\n\n## People's Republic[edit]\n\n\nAfter the founding of the PRC in October 1949 and until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Yang Shangkun was one of very few CCP leaders who worked closely with Mao Zedong at Zhongnanhai on a daily basis. As the Director of the General Office and Secretary\u2013General of the CMC, he oversaw much of the actual day-to-day work of most party activities and military affairs.[3] On the eve of the Cultural Revolution Yang was identified as a supporter of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, and was purged as a counter-revolutionary.[7] After being ejected from the Communist Party and removed from all positions, Yang was persecuted by Red Guards, who accused Yang of planting a covert listening device to spy on Mao, the same accusation shared by Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\nYang remained in prison until Mao died and Deng Xiaoping rose to power, in 1978. After Deng gained control of the military he recalled Yang, raised him to the position of general, and gave Yang the responsibility of reforming China's army, which Deng considered as larger than necessary and engaged in too many non-military activities. Deng raised Yang to the position of Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission in order to give Yang the authority to complete these reforms (Deng was chairman). In 1982 Yang was also appointed as a full member of the Politburo.[8]\n\n\nYang had a close friendship with Deng and shared many of Deng's long-term economic goals, but was far less enthusiastic about the agenda of political liberalization promoted by other senior leaders favored by Deng, including Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang, Wan Li, and Hu Qili. Yang justified his support of economic reforms by referencing Vladimir Lenin and the New Economic Policy, and he emphasized that the Communist Party should still enjoy overall control of the economy, even in private businesses, through the system of Party committees in all enterprises. He also always defended Mao Zedong as a great and historic leader, despite his own suffering at the hands of radical Maoists.\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, Yang explicitly backed the efforts of a foreign China historian, Harrison Salisbury, to compile an account of the Long March by conducting extensive interviews with surviving Long March participants. The resulting book, *Long March: The Untold Story*, has been praised by China scholars as an excellent synthesis of first-hand oral sources. Within China, many Chinese veterans asked why it took a foreigner to produce such a book.[9]\n\n\n\n## Presidency[edit]\n\n\nFile:Bush and Yang 5-1987.jpgYang with Vice President George H. W. Bush aboard the USS *Sequoia* during his visit to the United States in 1987\nIn 1988, Yang was appointed President of the People's Republic of China replacing Li Xiannian. Under the conventions of the 1982 Constitution, the president's role was largely symbolic,[8] with formal executive power wielded by the General Secretary of the Communist Party and the Premier of the State Council. In practice, party and state leaders still deferred to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who, however, was not all-powerful, as he still had to compromise on some policies with other party elders such as Chen Yun and Li Xiannian.\n\n\nYang's role during the Tiananmen protests of 1989 caused a fundamental shift in China's political structure. Yang was at first sympathetic to the students and sided with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang in supporting them. As the Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission, he even praised Zhao's position by claiming that Zhao \"Ziyang\u2019s notion of pacifying the student movement through democracy and law is good and seems quite workable right now.\" Zhao's position was contested by Premier Li Peng and Party elder Li Xiannian, who wanted to use force to suppress the student demonstrations and engaged in an internal power struggle with Zhao to convince other senior leaders of their position.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the hardliners gained the upper hand, Yang changed his position and supported the use of force to suppress student protestors. In May 1989 Yang appeared on Chinese television, where he denounced the student demonstrations as \"anarchy\" and defended the imposition of martial law on several areas of Beijing affected by the protests. Yang then mobilized and planned the suppression of the demonstrators, an operation in which several hundred protesters were killed on 4 June and subsequent days.[8] Yang's nephew, Yang Jianhua, commanded the highly disciplined 27th Group Army, which was brought into Beijing from Hebei to suppress the demonstrators.\n\n\n\n![](image)Yang (first row, fifth from right) at Kim Il Sung's 80th birthday celebrations in 1992\nThroughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Yang Shangkun was hugely influential within the People's Liberation Army. Yang and his younger half-brother, Yang Baibing, purged China's military of any officers who had not sufficiently supported the government's violent crackdown on students. Yang then began an organized attempt to fill as many senior military positions as possible with his supporters, generating an attitude of resentment among other military elders, who accused Yang of attempting to dominate the army and possibly challenge Deng's authority by developing a \"Yang family clique\". When Yang resisted the rise of Jiang Zemin (who had been the Party secretary of Shanghai), whom Deng began to groom to succeed him as paramount leader, party elders, including Deng himself forced Yang to retire in 1993, along with some of his family.[7]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Voice of America, before Yang Shangkun died in 1998, he allegedly told army doctor Jiang Yanyong that the crackdown on 4 June had been the most serious mistake committed by Li Peng and the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang believed he could not correct, but which he believed would eventually be corrected.[10]\n\n\nYang died on 14 September 1998, aged 91. His official obituary described him as \"a great proletarian revolutionary, a statesman, a military strategist, a staunch Marxist, an outstanding leader of the party, the state, and the people's army.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1929, he married Li Bozhao, a woman who participated in the Long March alongside Yang. They had three sons.[11]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Politics of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"\u65cf\u8c31\u5e2e\u5927\u5fd9\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6768\u5c1a\u6606\u8bde\u8fb0\u65e5\u4e3a8\u67083\u65e5--\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u65b0\u95fb--\u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u65b0\u95fb-\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51\".
