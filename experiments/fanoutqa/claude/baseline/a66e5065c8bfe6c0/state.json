The only tool available to me is a Wikipedia search function, which wouldn't give me reliable year-by-year statistical data to answer your specific question about California wildfire frequency in the last decade.\n\nTo accurately answer this question, you would need access to official fire records from organizations like:\n- CAL FIRE (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection)\n- National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)\n- California Office of Emergency Services\n\nThese organizations maintain detailed statistics about wildfire occurrences by year. I recommend consulting their official websites or databases for this specific information.",
