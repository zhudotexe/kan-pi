He previously served as head coach for the Toronto Raptors, whom he led to an NBA championship in 2019 and with whom he was named the NBA Coach of the Year in 2020.\n\n\nNurse played college basketball for the Northern Iowa Panthers. He played professional basketball with the Derby Rams in the British Basketball League.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Carroll, Iowa,[1][2] Nurse played at the University of Northern Iowa from 1985 to 1989, appearing in 111 games. He is the school's all-time three-point percentage leader at .468 (170 of 363).[3] While playing at University of Northern Iowa, he was a teammate of current Division I college coach Greg McDermott. During their successful 1989\u201390 season, Nurse was the sole student assistant coach for Northern Iowa in his final year with the team. Nurse graduated from Northern Iowa in May 1990 with a B.A. in accounting.[1]\n\n\n\n## Playing career[edit]\n\n\nNurse became a player-coach for the Derby Rams in the British Basketball League during the 1990\u201391 season; following the 1990\u201391 season, Nurse never played professionally again, opting to pursue a full-time coaching career.[4]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1991, Nurse got his first full-time head coaching job at Grand View University when he was only 23 years old; at the time, he was the youngest college basketball head coach in the country.[5] He coached at Grand View for two seasons before taking on an assistant coaching role at the University of South Dakota for two seasons.\n\n\nNurse later spent 11 seasons coaching in Europe, mostly in the British Basketball League (BBL).[5] During that time, he won two BBL championships as a head coach, one with the Birmingham Bullets in 1996 and one with the Manchester Giants in 2000, while also helping London Towers in the Euroleague.[6] Nurse also won the BBL Coach of the Year Award in the 1999\u20132000 and 2003\u201304 seasons.[7] He also coached for the Telindus Oostende of the Ethias League in 1998, as well as became an assistant coach for the Oklahoma Storm of the United States Basketball League in both 2001 and 2005.\n\n\n\n### D-League[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Nurse accepted the head coaching job for the Iowa Energy, who were preparing for their first season in the NBA D-League (now called the NBA G League).[8] The Energy won division titles under Nurse in the 2008\u201309 and 2009\u201310 seasons.\n\n\n\n### Iowa State University[edit]\n\n\nAfter three seasons with the Energy, Nurse agreed to join the coaching staff of the Iowa State Cyclones as an associate head coach in April 2010.[7] Four days after Nurse's hiring was announced on April 22, Greg McDermott left to become the head coach at Creighton. Nurse was not offered a spot on the new staff, but received $175,000 in a settlement for his four days as an assistant.[9]\n\n\n\n### Return to the D-League[edit]\n\n\nNurse immediately returned to his former position as head coach with the Energy.[10][11] In the 2010\u201311 NBA D-League season, Nurse received the Dennis Johnson Coach of the Year Award after helping Iowa achieve the best record in the league (37\u201313).[12] Nurse and the Energy then went on to win the 2011 D-League championship.[13] Nurse joined Joey Meyer as the only NBA G League coaches to win multiple championships.\n\n\nBefore the 2011\u201312 season, Nurse left the Energy for the D-League's Rio Grande Valley Vipers.[14][15] In the 2012\u201313 season, the Vipers finished with a record of 35\u201315 and won the D-League finals in a two-game sweep of the Santa Cruz Warriors.[16]\n\n\nDuring his six seasons coaching in the D-League, Nurse had 23 players on his rosters called up to the NBA.[17]\n\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Nurse departed the Vipers for an assistant job on the coaching staff of the Toronto Raptors under Dwane Casey.[18] He was in charge of the offense during his time under Casey,[17][19] and in the 2017\u201318 season he was credited for changes to the Raptors' offensive game plan which included increases in passing and three-point attempts.[20][21][22] The improved offense helped the Raptors win a franchise-record 59 games, but the team was swept in the second round of the 2018 NBA playoffs by the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Casey was fired shortly thereafter.[23]\n\n\nOn June 14, 2018, the Raptors promoted Nurse to the position of head coach to succeed Casey.[24] In his first season, he guided the Raptors to a 58\u201324 record, led by offseason acquisition (and eventual Finals MVP) Kawhi Leonard and emerging star Pascal Siakam, who would go on to win the NBA's Most Improved Player award.[25] On May 25, 2019, Nurse coached the Raptors to the 2019 NBA Finals, the first for the franchise, after taking the Eastern Conference Championship by defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in six games.[26] On June 13, Nurse became the first head coach to win both the NBA and NBA D-League/G League titles,[27] when the Raptors defeated the Golden State Warriors in game 6 of the NBA Finals, winning the Raptors their first championship in franchise history.[28]\n\n\nIn Nurse's second season, the Raptors finished with a 53\u201319 record, despite losing Leonard to free agency, in a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic.[29] He was widely praised for his creativity and innovation in ensuring that the Raptors were able to maintain a high level of play despite losing Leonard.[30][31] That season, Nurse qualified to be a head coach in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game as the Eastern Conference representative.[32] On August 22, 2020, Nurse was named NBA Coach of the Year.[33] However, the Raptors were unable to repeat their playoff success of the previous season, and were eliminated in the conference semifinals, losing in 7 games at the hands of the Boston Celtics.[34]\n\n\nOn September 15, 2020, the Raptors announced that Nurse had signed a multi-year contract extension.[35] After an unsuccessful 2020\u201321 season in which the Raptors played in Tampa Bay due to COVID-19, Nurse guided the team to 48 wins and a return to the playoffs in 2022.\n\n\nOn April 21, 2023, the Raptors announced that they had fired Nurse, after the team failed to make the playoffs due to their loss to the Chicago Bulls in the Play-in Tournament.[36]\n\n\nOn June 1, 2023, the Philadelphia 76ers announced that Nurse had been hired as their head coach.[37]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nNurse was an assistant coach under Chris Finch, for the Great Britain national team from 2009 to 2012, including the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\n\n\nOn June 24, 2019, Nurse was named the head coach of the Canadian men's national team for the 2019 FIBA World Cup and beyond.[38][39] On June 27, 2023, Nurse resigned from his role as national team head coach.[40]\n\n\n\n## Head coaching

named David, who previously worked with the Brooklyn Nets before becoming a personal trainer for professional players.[42]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Nurse's mother Marcella died.[43]\n\n\nNurse is a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan and was a guest conductor of the seventh-inning stretch at Wrigley Field in 2019, singing \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game.\"[44]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2019, Nurse joined Hamilton-based rock band Arkells at their sold-out Toronto concert to perform a cover of Stevie Wonder's hit song \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I'm Yours)\" on guitar.[45][46]\n\n\nIn May 2022, after completing his dissertation and comprehensive exam, Nurse graduated from Concordia University Chicago with a Ph.D. in Sports Leadership.[47][48][49]\n\n\nNurse is a big fan of the musician Prince, and was the master of ceremonies at a performance by the New Power Generation in Toronto on July 26, 2022.\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* *Rapture: Fifteen Teams, Four Countries, One NBA

After one year of college basketball with the Kansas Jayhawks, he was drafted third overall by the 76ers in the 2014 NBA draft. The 7-foot (2.1\u00a0m) Embiid is a six-time NBA All-Star, a five-time member of the All-NBA Team and a three-time member of the All-Defensive Team. He was named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2023.\n\n\nMultiple foot and knee injuries delayed Embiid's debut for two seasons until 2016\u201317, when he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team despite playing only 31 games. He has nicknamed himself \"**the Process**\" in response to a refrain from 76ers fans during the Sam Hinkie era to \"trust the process\".[3][4][5][6] Embiid led the NBA in scoring during the 2021\u201322 and 2022\u201323 seasons, becoming the first center to do so since Shaquille O'Neal (2000), and was also the first center since Moses Malone (1982) to average over 30 points per game, while also being the first foreign player to lead the NBA in scoring.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nEmbiid was born in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, to military officer Thomas Embiid[7] and his wife, Christine.[8] He played volleyball and soccer[9] in childhood and originally planned to play professional volleyball in Europe[10] but started playing basketball at age 15, modeling his game after NBA Hall of Fame center Hakeem Olajuwon.[7][10] Embiid was discovered at a basketball camp by Luc Mbah a Moute, a fellow native of Yaound\u00e9 and an NBA player.[10][11] With Mbah a Moute as his mentor, Embiid moved to the United States at age 16 to devote himself to becoming a professional basketball player.[12]\n\n\nEmbiid enrolled at Montverde Academy, Mbah a Moute's alma mater, but transferred after his first year due to a lack of playing time.[10][13] He then attended The Rock School, a Christian academy, in Gainesville, Florida.[13] As a senior, he led their team to a 33\u20134 record and state championship, averaging 13.0 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks per game.\n\n\nEmbiid was a five-star recruit according to Rivals.com[14][15] and committed to Kansas in November 2012.[12]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Embiid with the Kansas Jayhawks in 2014\nEmbiid attended the University of Kansas for one year alongside notable teammate Andrew Wiggins. On 13 February 2014, he was named one of the 30 finalists for the Naismith College Player of the Year.[16] In 2013\u201314, he played 28 games, averaging 11.2 points, 8.1 rebounds, 1.4 assists, and 2.6 blocks in 23.1 minutes per game.[17] He had over 15 points in seven games and over 5 blocks in six games. He subsequently earned Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year honors and was named second-team All-Big 12.\n\n\nEmbiid suffered a stress fracture in his back in March 2014.[18] He missed that year's Big 12 tournament and NCAA tournament. Kansas lost in the second round (round of 32) of the NCAA tournament.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2014 NBA draft[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 April 2014, Embiid declared for the 2014 NBA draft, forgoing his final three years of college eligibility.[19] On 20 June 2014, he underwent surgery on a broken navicular bone in his right foot, and was subsequently ruled out for four to six months.[20] Six days later, he was selected with the third overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers.[21] That selection made him the third Cameroonian-born NBA player after Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje and Luc Mbah a Moute, as well as the highest selected player from Cameroon.[7]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia 76ers (2014\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n#### Injury-plagued seasons (2014\u20132016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Embiid practicing with the 76ers in 2014\nOn 26 August 2014, Embiid signed his rookie scale contract with the 76ers.[22][23] He was later ruled unlikely to play at all in the 2014\u201315 season due to the broken navicular bone in his foot.[24] After missing the entire 2014\u201315 season, it was announced on 13 June 2015 that Embiid had suffered a setback in his recovery after a CT scan revealed less healing than anticipated.[25] It was later determined that Embiid's chances of playing in the 2015\u201316 season were slim following a second round of surgery on his right foot on 18 August 2015.[26][27] He missed the entire 2015\u201316 season.\n\n\n\n#### 2016\u201317 season: All-Rookie honors[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 October 2016, Embiid started at center in the 76ers' first preseason game against the Boston Celtics.[28] In his first action, he recorded six points, four rebounds, and two blocks in 13 minutes en route to a 92\u201389 victory.[29] On 26 October 2016, Embiid made his long-awaited NBA regular-season debut in the 76ers' season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Fellow Cameroon-born NBA player Luc Mbah a Moute has voiced his opinion on Embiid representing his country saying, \"It would be great for our team, our country and Joel\".[143] Embiid ultimately did not compete for Cameroon at AfroBasket 2017.[144]\n\n\nIn July 2022, Embiid was granted citizenship by France as \"a foreigner [...] whose naturalization is of exceptional interest\".[145][146] Later in September, he also became a U.S. citizen.[147]\n\n\nIn October 2023, Embiid committed to playing for the United States for the 2024 Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Embiid with his son at the NBA All-Star Game in 2022\nEmbiid's younger brother, Arthur, died on October 16, 2014, in a car crash in his home country of Cameroon.[148][149] He also has a younger sister.[150] In addition to English, Embiid is fluent in French and Basaa.[151] Embiid has been in a relationship with Brazilian model Anne de Paula since 2018.[152] In September 2020, they had their first child together: a son named Arthur in honor of his late brother.[153] The couple was married in 2023.[154]\n\n\nEmbiid is known for his playful personality and social media presence, particularly for his trolling.[155][156][157] He is Catholic and a teetotaler.[155][158]\n\n\nEmbiid is an avid supporter of Real Madrid CF, frequently posting on Twitter during the team\u2019s matches.[159]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Embiid donated $100,000, his 2021 NBA All-Star Game winnings, to fight homelessness in Philadelphia,[160] for which he received the NBA Cares Community Assist Award in April 2021.[161][162]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n| \u00a0\u00a0GP\n | Games played\n | \u00a0\u00a0GS\u00a0\n | Games started\n | \u00a0MPG\u00a0\n | Minutes per game\n |\n| \u00a0FG%\u00a0\n | Field goal percentage\n | \u00a03P%\u00a0\n | 3-point field goal percentage\n | \u00a0FT%\u00a0\n | Free throw percentage\n |\n| \u00a0RPG\u00a0\n | Rebounds per game\n | \u00a0APG\u00a0\n | Assists per game\n | \u00a0SPG\u00a0\n | Steals per game\n |\n| \u00a0BPG\u00a0\n | Blocks per game\n | \u00a0PPG\u00a0\n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n| \u00a0\\*\u00a0\n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016\u201317 | Philadelphia | 31 | 31 | 25.4 | .466 | .367 | .783 | 7.8 | 2.1 | .9 | **2.5** | 20.2\n |\n| 2017\u201318 | Philadelphia | 63 | 63 | 30.3 | .483 | .308 | .769 | 11.0 | 3.2 | .6 | 1.8 | 22.9\n |\n| 2018\u201319 | Philadelphia | 64 | 64 | 33.7 | .484 | .300 | .804 | **13.6** | 3.7 | .7 | 1.9 | 27.5\n |\n| 2019\u201320 | Philadelphia | 51 | 51 | 29.5 | .477 | .331 | .807 | 11.6 | 3.0 | .9 | 1.3 | 23.0\n |\n| 2020\u201321 | Philadelphia | 51 | 51 | 31.1 | .513 | **.377** | **.859** | 10.6 | 2.8 | 1.0 | 1.4 | 28.5\n |\n| 2021\u201322 | Philadelphia | **68** | **68** | 33.8 | .499 | .371 | .814 | 11.7 | **4.2** | **1.1** | 1.5 | 30.6\\*\n |\n| 2022\u201323 | Philadelphia | 66 | 66 | **34.6** | **.548** | .330 | .857 | 10.2 | **4.2** | 1.0 | 1.7 | **33.1\\*** |\n| Career\n | 394 | 394 | 31.8 | .501 | .337 | .819 | 11.2 | 3.4 | .9 | 1.7 | 27.2\n |\n| All-Star\n | 5 | 5 | 26.1 | .623 | .440 | .750 | 9.4 | 1.2 | .6 | .8 | 23.8\n |\n\n\n#### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018 | Philadelphia | 8 | 8 | 34.8 | .435 | .276 | .705 | **12.6** | 3.0 | .9 | 1.9 | 21.4\n |\n| 2019 | Philadelphia | **11** | **11** | 30.4 | .428 | .308 | .822 | 10.5 | **3.4** | .7 | 2.3 | 20.2\n |\n| 2020 | Philadelphia | 4 | 4 | 36.2 | .459 | .250 | .814 | 12.3 | 1.3 | **1.5** | 1.3 | **30.0** |\n| 2021 | Philadelphia | **11** | **11** | 32.4 | **.513** | **.390** | .835 | 10.5 | **3.4** | 1.0 | 1.5 | 28.1\n |\n| 2022 | Philadelphia | 10 | 10 | **38.5** | .484 | .212 | .820 | 10.7 | 2.1 | .4 | .8 | 23.6\n |\n| 2023 | Philadelphia | 9 | 9 | 37.3 | .431 | .179 | **.905** | 9.8 | 2.7 | .7 | **2.8** | 23.7\n |\n| Career\n | 53 | 53 | 34.6 | .461 | .280 | .823 | 10.9 | 2.8 | .8 | 1.8 | 24.0\n |\n\n\n### College[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2013\u201314 | Kansas | 28 | 20 | 23.1 | .626 | .200 | .685 | 8.1 | 1.4 | .9 | 2.6 | 11.2\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Basketball portal\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* List of foreign NBA players\n* List of NBA annual scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association single-season scoring leaders\n* List of NBA All-Stars\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"76ers Media Guide 2017\u201318, page 98 (roster)\" (PDF).

He played college basketball for the Texas Longhorns. He was highly regarded by scouts due to his 7\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in (2.39\u00a0m) wingspan. He attended Cardigan Mountain School in Canaan, New Hampshire, and Westtown School in West Chester, Pennsylvania, and was considered one of the top high school prospects for the class of 2017.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBamba was born on May 12, 1998, in Harlem, New York to Lancine Bamba and Aminata Johnson, who both emigrated from the Ivory Coast.[2][3][4] Bamba's grandparents were born and brought up in Mali.[3] His older brother, Sidiki Johnson, played college basketball at Arizona, Providence, and Wabash Valley.[5] Another member of his family, estranged brother Ibrahim Johnson, also played college basketball at multiple universities, including both Farmingdale State and Montevallo.[6][7] Bamba first became interested in basketball at age six, inspired by the game's popularity in his hometown.[3]\n\n\n\n## High school career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bamba at the 2017 McDonald's All-American Boys Game\nIn eighth and ninth grade, Bamba attended Cardigan Mountain School, an all-boys boarding school in Canaan, New Hampshire.[3]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Cardigan, Bamba went on to Westtown School in Westtown, Pennsylvania.[3][8] As a junior he averaged 14 points, 11 rebounds, and six blocks per game. He played in the 2017 McDonald's All American Game and the Nike Hoop Summit.[9][10]\n\n\nBamba was rated as a five-star recruit and was ranked among the top recruits in his class.[11][12] His final four schools were Kentucky, Duke, Texas and Michigan.[13][14][15][16] Ultimately, Bamba chose to play for the University of Texas for his college career. Before playing a single game for Texas, his half-brother Ibrahim Johnson posted a 22-minute-long video on Facebook Live, talking about how there were some illegal benefits from a Michigan-based investor involved during the decision-making and that he was reporting the information to the NCAA.[17] However, the NCAA reported that nothing involved there would ultimately affect Bamba's eligibility for his freshman season.[18]\n\n\n\n\n\nUS college sports recruiting information for high school athletes\n| Name\n | Hometown\n | High school / college\n | Height\n | Weight\n | Commit date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Mo Bamba** *C* | Harlem, N.Y.\n | Westtown School | 7\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in (2.16\u00a0m)\n | 216\u00a0lb (98\u00a0kg)\n | May 18, 2017\u00a0\n |\n| **Recruiting star ratings:** Scout:![5/5 stars](image)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rivals:![5/5 stars](image)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0247Sports:![5/5 stars](image) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ESPN:![5/5 stars](image)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ESPN grade:\u00a096\n |\n| **Overall recruiting rankings:** Scout: *2, 1 (C)* \u00a0\u00a0Rivals: *2, 1 (C)*\u00a0\u00a0ESPN: *3, 2 (C), 1 (NY)* |\n| * \n* *Note*: In many cases, Scout, Rivals, 247Sports, and ESPN may conflict in their listings of height\u00a0and weight.\n* In these cases, the average was taken.
