It borders Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Luxembourg is the only surviving grand duchy in the world. Its capital and most populous city, Luxembourg,[10] is one of the four institutional seats of the European Union (together with Brussels, Frankfurt, and Strasbourg) and the seat of several EU institutions, notably the Court of Justice of the European Union, the highest judicial authority.[11][12] Luxembourg's culture, people, and languages are highly intertwined with its French and German neighbors; while Luxembourgish is the only national language of the Luxembourgish people and of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,[13][14] French is the only language for legislation, and all three\u00a0\u2013 Luxembourgish, French and German\u00a0\u2013 are used for administrative matters in the country.[13]\n\n\nWith an area of 2,586 square kilometers (998\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Luxembourg is Europe's seventh-smallest country.[15] In 2023, it had a population of 660,809, which makes it one of the least-populated countries in Europe,[16] albeit with the highest population growth rate;[17] foreigners account for nearly half the population.[18] Luxembourg is a representative democracy headed by a constitutional monarch, Grand Duke Henri, making it the world's only remaining sovereign grand duchy.\n\n\nLuxembourg is a developed country with an advanced economy and one of the world's highest GDP (PPP) per capita as per IMF and World Bank estimates. The nation's levels of human development and LGBT equality are ranked among the highest in Europe.[19][8] The city of Luxembourg was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994 due to the exceptional preservation of its vast fortifications and historic quarters.[20] Luxembourg is a founding member of the European Union,[21] OECD, the United Nations, NATO, and the Benelux.[22][23] It served on the United Nations Security Council for the first time in 2013 and 2014.[24]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Luxembourg\nThe history of Luxembourg is considered to begin in the year 963, when Count Siegfried acquired a rocky promontory and its Roman-era fortifications, known as *Lucilinburhuc*, \"little castle\", and the surrounding area from the Imperial Abbey of St. Maximin in nearby Trier.[25][26] Siegfried's descendants increased their territory through marriage, conquest, and vassalage. By the end of the 13th century, the counts of Luxembourg reigned over a considerable territory.[27] In 1308, Count of Luxembourg Henry VII became King of the Romans and later Holy Roman Emperor;[28] the House of Luxembourg would produce four Holy Roman Emperors during the High Middle Ages. In 1354, Charles IV elevated the county to the Duchy of Luxembourg.[29] The duchy eventually became part of the Burgundian Circle and then one of the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands.[30]\n\n\nOver the centuries, the City and Fortress of Luxembourg\u2014of great strategic importance due to its location between the Kingdom of France and the Habsburg territories\u2014was gradually built up to be one of the most reputed fortifications in Europe.[31] After belonging to both the France of Louis XIV and the Austria of Maria Theresa, Luxembourg became part of the First French Republic and Empire under Napoleon.[32]\n\n\nThe present-day state of Luxembourg first emerged at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Grand Duchy, with its powerful fortress, became an independent state under the personal possession of William I of the Netherlands with a Prussian garrison to guard the city against another invasion from France.[33][29] In 1839, following the turmoil of the Belgian Revolution, the purely French-speaking part of Luxembourg was ceded to Belgium and the Luxembourgish-speaking part (except the Arelerland, the area around Arlon) became what is the present state of Luxembourg.[34]\n\n\n\n### Before AD 963[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Celtic Luxembourg\n\n![](image)Text page from the Codex Aureus of Echternach, an important surviving codex, was produced in the Abbey of Echternach in the 11th century.[35]\nThe first traces of settlement in what is now Luxembourg are dated back to the Paleolithic Age, about 35,000 years ago. From the 2nd century BC, Celtic tribes settled in the region between the rivers Rhine and Meuse.[36]\n\n\nSix centuries later the Romans would name the Celtic tribes inhabiting these exact regions collectively as the *Treveri*. Many examples of archaeological evidence proving their existence in Luxembourg have been discovered, the most famous being the Oppidum of the Titelberg.\n\n\nIn around 58 to 51 BC, the Romans invaded the country when Julius Caesar conquered Gaul and part of Germania up to the Rhine border, thus the area of what is now Luxembourg became part of the Roman Empire for the next 450 years, living in relative peace under the Pax Romana.\n\n\nSimilar to those in Gaul, the Celts of Luxembourg adopted Roman culture, language, morals and a way of life, effectively becoming what historians later described as Gallo-Roman civilization.[37] Evidence from that period includes the Dalheim Ricciacum and the Vichten mosaic, on display at the National Museum of History and Art in Luxembourg City.[38]\n\n\nThe territory was infiltrated by the Germanic Franks from the 4th century, and was abandoned by Rome in AD 406,[39]:\u200a65 after which it became part of the Kingdom of the Franks. The Salian Franks who settled in the area are often described as the ones having brought the Germanic language to present-day Luxembourg, since the old Frankish language spoken by them is considered by linguists to be a direct forerunner of the Moselle Franconian dialect, which later evolved into, among others, the modern-day Luxembourgish language.[39]:\u200a70[40]\n\n\nThe Christianization of Luxembourg is usually dated back to the end of the 7th century. The most famous figure in this context is Willibrord, a Northumbrian missionary saint, who together with other monks established the Abbey of Echternach in AD 698[41] and is celebrated annually in the dancing procession of Echternach. For a few centuries the abbey would become one of northern Europe's most influential abbeys. The Codex Aureus of Echternach, an important surviving codex written entirely in gold ink, was produced here in the 11th century.[35] The so-called Emperor's Bible and the Golden Gospels of Henry III were also produced in Echternach at this time.[42][43]:\u200a9\u201325\n\n\n\n### Emergence and expansion of the County of Luxemburg (963\u20131312)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: County of Luxemburg\n\n![](image)Charles IV, the 14th-century Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia from the House of Luxembourg[44]\nWhen the Carolingian Empire was divided many times starting with the Treaty of Verdun in 843, today's Luxembourgish territory became successively part of the Kingdom of Middle Francia (843\u2013855), the Kingdom of Lotharingia (855\u2013959) and finally of the Duchy of Lorraine (959\u20131059), which itself had become a state of the Holy Roman Empire.[45]\n\n\nThe recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the acquisition of *Lucilinburhuc*[46] (today Luxembourg Castle) situated on the Bock rock by Siegfried, Count of the Ardennes, in 963 through an exchange act with St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier.[47] Around this fort, a town gradually developed, which became the center of a state of great strategic value within the Duchy of Lorraine.[20] Over the years, the fortress was extended by Siegfried's descendants and by 1083, one of them, Conrad I, was the first to call himself a \"Count of Luxembourg\", and with it effectively creating the independent County of Luxembourg (which was still a state within the Holy Roman Empire).[48]\n\n\nBy the middle of the 13th century the counts of Luxembourg had managed to gain considerable wealth and power and had expanded their territory from the river Meuse to the Moselle. By the time of the reign of Henry V the Blonde, Bitburg, La Roche-en-Ardenne, Durbuy, Arlon, Thionville, Marville, Longwy, and in 1264 the competing County of Vianden (and with it St Vith and Schleiden) had either been incorporated directly or become vassal states to the County of Luxembourg.[49] The only major setback during their rise in power came in 1288, when Henry VI and his three brothers died at the Battle of Worringen while trying unsuccessfully to add the Duchy of Limburg to their realm. But despite the defeat, the Battle of Worringen helped the Counts of Luxembourg to achieve military glory, which they had previously lacked, as they had mostly enlarged their territory by means of inheritances, marriages and fiefdoms.[50]\n\n\nThe ascension of the Counts of Luxembourg culminated when Henry VII became King of the Romans, King of Italy and finally, in 1312, Holy Roman Emperor.[51]\n\n\n\n### Golden Age: The House of Luxembourg contending for supremacy in Central Europe (1312\u20131443)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Duchy of Luxemburg\n\n![](image)Historic map (undated) of Luxembourg City's fortifications\nWith the ascension of Henry VII as Emperor, the dynasty of the House of Luxembourg not only began to rule the Holy Roman Empire, but rapidly began to exercise growing influence over other parts of Central Europe as well.\n\n\nHenry's son, John the Blind, in addition to being Count of Luxembourg, also became King of Bohemia. He remains a major figure in Luxembourgish history and folklore and is considered by many historians the epitome of chivalry in medieval times. He is also known for having founded the Schueberfouer in 1340 and for his heroic death at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy in 1346.[52][53] John the Blind is considered a national hero in Luxembourg.[54]\n\n\nIn the 14th and early 15th centuries, three more members of the House of Luxembourg reigned as Holy Roman Emperors and Bohemian Kings: John's descendants Charles IV, Sigismund (who also was King of Hungary and Croatia), and Wenceslaus IV. Charles IV created the long-lasting Golden Bull of 1356, a decree which fixed important aspects of the constitutional structure of the Empire. Luxembourg remained an independent fief (county) of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 1354, Charles IV elevated it to the status of a duchy with his half-brother Wenceslaus I becoming the first Duke of Luxembourg. While his kin were occupied ruling and expanding their power within the Holy Roman Empire and elsewhere, Wenceslaus, annexed the County of Chiny in 1364, and with it, the territories of the new Duchy of Luxembourg reached its greatest extent.[55]\n\n\nDuring these 130 years, the House of Luxembourg was contending with the House of Habsburg for supremacy within the Holy Roman Empire and Central Europe. It all came to end in 1443, when the House of Luxembourg suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne. Since Sigismund and Elizabeth of G\u00f6rlitz were both heirless, all possessions of the Luxembourg Dynasty were redistributed among the European aristocracy.[56] The Duchy of Luxembourg become a possession of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy.[57]\n\n\nAs the House of Luxembourg had become extinct and Luxembourg now became part of the Burgundian Netherlands, this would mark the start of nearly 400 years of foreign rule over Luxembourg.\n\n\n\n### Luxembourg under Habsburg rule and repeated French invasions (1444\u20131794)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Fortress of Luxembourg\n\nIn 1482, Philip the Handsome inherited all of what became then known as the Habsburg Netherlands, and with it the Duchy of Luxembourg. For nearly 320 years Luxembourg would remain a possession of the mighty House of Habsburg, at first under Austrian rule (1506\u20131556), then under Spanish rule (1556\u20131714), before going back again to Austrian rule (1714\u20131794).  \n\nWith having become a Habsburg possession, the Duchy of Luxembourg became, like many countries in Europe at the time, heavily involved into the many conflicts for dominance of Europe between the Habsburg-held countries and the Kingdom of France.\n\n\nIn 1542, the King of France, Francois I, invaded Luxembourg twice, but the Habsburgs under Charles V managed to reconquer the Duchy each time.[58]\n\n\nLuxembourg became part of the Spanish Netherlands in 1556, and when France and Spain went to war in 1635 it resulted in the Treaty of the Pyrenees, in which the first partition of Luxembourg was decided. Under the Treaty, Spain ceded the Luxembourgish fortresses of Stenay, Thionville, and Montm\u00e9dy, and the surrounding territory to France, effectively reducing the size of Luxembourg for the first time in centuries.[59]\n\n\nIn context of the Nine Years' War in 1684, France invaded Luxembourg again, conquering and occupying the Duchy until 1697 when it was returned to the Spanish in order to garner support for the Bourbon cause during the prelude to the War of the Spanish Succession. When the war broke out in 1701 Luxembourg and the Spanish Netherlands were administered by the pro-French faction under the governor Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and sided with the Bourbons. The duchy was subsequently occupied by the pro-Austrian allied forces during the conflict and was awarded to Austria at its conclusion in 1714.[60]\n\n\nAs the Duchy of Luxembourg repeatedly passed back and forth from Spanish and Austrian to French rule, each of the conquering nations contributed to strengthening and expanding the Fortress that the Castle of Luxembourg had become over the years. One example of this includes French military engineer Marquis de Vauban who advanced the fortifications around and on the heights of the city, fortification walls that are still visible today.[59]\n\n\n\n### Luxembourg under French rule (1794\u20131815)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: For\u00eats and Secularism in France\n\nDuring the War of the First Coalition, Revolutionary France invaded the Austrian Netherlands, and with it, Luxembourg, yet again. In the years 1793 and 1794 most of the Duchy was conquered relatively quickly and the French Revolutionary Army committed many atrocities and pillages against the Luxembourgish civilian population and abbeys, the most infamous being the massacres of Differdange and Dudelange, as well as the destruction of the abbeys of Clairefontaine, Echternach and Orval.[61][62] However the Fortress of Luxembourg resisted for nearly 7 months before the Austrian forces holding it surrendered. Luxembourg's long defense led Lazare Carnot to call Luxembourg \"the best fortress in the world, except Gibraltar\", giving rise to the city's nickname *the Gibraltar of the North*.[63]\n\n\nLuxembourg was annexed by France, becoming the *d\u00e9partement des for\u00eats* (department of forests), and the incorporation of the former Duchy as a *d\u00e9partement* into France was formalised at the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797.[63]\nFrom the start of the occupation the new French officials in Luxembourg, who spoke only French, implemented many republican reforms, among them the principle of laicism, which led to an outcry in strongly Catholic Luxembourg. Additionally French was implemented as the only official language and Luxembourgish people were barred access to all civil services.[64] When the French Army introduced military duty for the local population, riots broke out which culminated in 1798 when Luxembourgish peasants started a rebellion.[64] Even though the French managed to rapidly suppress this revolt called *Kl\u00ebppelkrich*, it had a profound effect on the historical memory of the country and its citizens.[65]\n\n\nHowever, many republican ideas of this era continue to have a lasting effect on Luxembourg: one of the many examples features the implementation of the Napoleonic Code Civil which was introduced in 1804 and is still valid today.[66]\n\n\n\n### National awakening and independence (1815\u20131890)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the Duchy of Luxembourg was restored. However, as the territory had been part of the Holy Roman Empire as well as the Habsburgian Netherlands in the past, both the Kingdom of Prussia and the United Kingdom of the Netherlands now claimed possession of the territory. At the Congress of Vienna the great powers decided that Luxembourg would become a member state of the newly formed German Confederation, but at the same time William I of the Netherlands, the King of the Netherlands, would become, in personal union, the head of state. To satisfy Prussia, it was decided that not only the Fortress of Luxembourg be manned by Prussian troops, but also that large parts of Luxembourgish territory (mainly the areas around Bitburg and St. Vith) become Prussian possessions.[67] This marked the second time that the Duchy of Luxembourg was reduced in size, and is generally known as the Second Partition of Luxembourg. To compensate the Duchy for this loss, it was decided to elevate the Duchy to a Grand-Duchy, thus giving the Dutch monarchs the additional title of Grand-Duke of Luxembourg.\n\n\nAfter Belgium became an independent country following the victorious Belgian Revolution of 1830\u20131831, it claimed the entire Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg as being part of Belgium, however, the Dutch King who was also Grand Duke of Luxembourg, as well as Prussia, did not want to lose their grip on the mighty fortress of Luxembourg and did not agree with the Belgian claims.[68] The dispute would be solved at the 1839 Treaty of London where the decision of the Third Partition of Luxembourg was taken. This time the territory was reduced by more than half, as the predominantly francophone western part of the country (but also the then Luxembourgish-speaking part of Arelerland) was transferred to the new state of Belgium, thereby giving Luxembourg its modern-day borders. The treaty of 1839 also established full independence of the remaining Germanic-speaking Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg.[69][70][71][72]\n\n\nIn 1842 Luxembourg joined the German Customs Union (*Zollverein*).[73][74] This resulted in the opening of the German market, the development of Luxembourg's steel industry, and expansion of Luxembourg's railway network from 1855 to 1875.\n\n\nAfter the Luxembourg Crisis of 1866 nearly led to war between Prussia and France, as both were unwilling to see the other taking influence over Luxembourg and its mighty fortress, the Grand Duchy's independence and neutrality were reaffirmed by the Second Treaty of London and Prussia was finally willing to withdraw its troops from the Fortress of Luxembourg under the condition that the fortifications would be dismantled. That happened the same year.[75] At the time of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, Luxembourg's neutrality was respected, and neither France nor Germany invaded the country.[76][77]\n\n\nAs a result of the recurring disputes between the major European powers, the people of Luxembourg gradually developed a consciousness of independence and a national awakening took place in the 19th century.[78] The people of Luxembourg began referring to themselves as *Luxembourgers*, rather than being part of one of the larger surrounding nations. This consciousness of *Mir w\u00eblle bleiwe wat mir sinn* (\u201c*We want to remain what we are \u201d)* culminated in 1890, when the last step towards full independence was finally taken: due to a succession crisis the Dutch monarchy ceased to hold the title Grand-Duke of Luxembourg. Beginning with Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg, the Grand-Duchy would have their own monarchy, thus reaffirming its full independence.[79]\n\n\n\n### Two German occupations and interwar political crisis (1890\u20131945)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Frontier with Alsace-Lorraine from 1871 to 1918\nSee also: German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I and German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II\n\nIn August 1914, during World War I, Imperial Germany violated Luxembourg's neutrality by invading it in order to defeat France. Nevertheless, despite the German occupation, Luxembourg was allowed to maintain much of its independence and political mechanisms.[80] Unaware of the fact that Germany secretly planned to annex the Grand-Duchy in case of a German victory (the Septemberprogramm), the Luxembourgish government continued to pursue a policy of strict neutrality. However, the Luxembourgish population did not believe Germany had good intentions, fearing that it would annex Luxembourg. Around 3,700 Luxembourgers served in the French army, of whom 2,000 died.[81] Their sacrifices have been commemorated at the G\u00eblle Fra.\n\n\nAfter the war, Grand-Duchess Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, was seen by many people (including the French and Belgian governments) as having collaborated with the Germans and calls for her abdication and the establishment of a Republic became louder.[82][83] After the retreat of the German army, communists in Luxembourg City and Esch-sur-Alzette tried to establish a soviet worker's republic similar to the ones emerging in Germany, but these attempts lasted only 2 days.[83][82]\nIn November 1918, a motion in the Chamber of Deputies demanding the abolition of the monarchy was defeated narrowly by 21 votes to 19 (with 3 abstentions).[84]\n\n\nFrance questioned the Luxembourgish government's, and especially Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde's, neutrality during the war, and calls for an annexation of Luxembourg to either France or Belgium grew louder in both countries.[85]\nIn January 1919, a company of the Luxembourgish Army rebelled, declaring itself to be the army of the new republic, but French troops intervened and put an end to the rebellion.[85] Nonetheless, the disloyalty shown by her own armed forces was too much for Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde, who abdicated in favor of her sister Charlotte 5 days later.[86]\nThe same year, in a popular referendum, 77.8% of the Luxembourgish population declared in favor of maintaining monarchy and rejected the establishment of a republic.\nDuring this time, Belgium pushed for an annexation of Luxembourg. However, all such claims were ultimately dismissed at the Paris Peace Conference, thus securing Luxembourg's independence.[87]\n\n\nIn 1940, after the outbreak of World War II, Luxembourg's neutrality was violated again when Nazi Germany's *Wehrmacht* entered the country, \"entirely without justification\".[88] In contrast to the First World War, under the German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II, the country was treated as German territory and informally annexed to the adjacent province of Nazi Germany, Gau Moselland. This time, Luxembourg did not remain neutral as Luxembourg's government in exile based in London supported the Allies, sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the Normandy invasion, and multiple resistance groups formed inside the occupied country.[89]\n\n\nWith 2.45% of its prewar population killed, and a third of all buildings in Luxembourg being destroyed or heavily damaged (mainly due to the Battle of the Bulge), Luxembourg suffered the highest such loss in Western Europe and its commitment to the Allied war effort was never questioned.[90] Around 1,000-2,500 of Luxembourg's Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.\n\n\n\n### Integration into NATO and European Union (1945\u2013)[edit]\n\n\nThe Grand Duchy became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. Luxembourg's neutral status under the constitution formally ended in 1948, and in April 1949 it also became a founding member of NATO.[91] During the Cold War, Luxembourg continued its involvements on the side of the Western Bloc. In the early fifties a small contingent of troops fought in the Korean War.[92]\nLuxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support ISAF.[93]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the European Communities, following the 1952 establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, and subsequent 1958 creations of the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community. In 1993, the former two of these were incorporated into the European Union. With Robert Schuman (one of the founding fathers of the EU), Pierre Werner (considered the father of the Euro), Gaston Thorn, Jacques Santer and Jean-Claude Juncker (all former Presidents of the European Commission), Luxembourgish politicians contributed substantially to the EU's formation and establishment. In 1999, Luxembourg joined the eurozone. Thereafter, the country was elected non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (2013\u201314).\n\n\nThe steel industry exploiting the Red Lands' rich iron-ore grounds in the beginning of the 20th century drove Luxembourg's industrialization. After the decline of the steel industry in the 1970s, the country focused on establishing itself as a global financial center and developed into the banking hub it is reputed to be. Since the beginning of the 21st century, its governments have focused on developing the country into a knowledge economy, with the founding of the University of Luxembourg and a national space program.\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Luxembourg and Law of Luxembourg\n\n![](image)The Hall of the Chamber of Deputies, the meeting place of the Luxembourgish national legislature, the Chamber of Deputies, in Luxembourg City\nLuxembourg is described as a \"full democracy\",[94] with a parliamentary democracy headed by a constitutional monarch. Executive power is exercised by the grand duke and the cabinet, which consists of several other ministers.[95] The Constitution of Luxembourg, the supreme law of Luxembourg, was adopted on 17 October 1868.[96] The grand duke has the power to dissolve the legislature, in which case new elections must be held within three months. But since 1919, sovereignty has resided with the nation, exercised by the grand duke in accordance with the Constitution and the law.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Grand Ducal Palace in Luxembourg City, the official residence of the grand duke of Luxembourg\nLegislative power is vested in the Chamber of Deputies, a unicameral legislature of sixty members, who are directly elected to five-year terms from four constituencies. A second body, the Council of State (*Conseil d'\u00c9tat*), composed of 21 ordinary citizens appointed by the grand duke, advises the Chamber of Deputies in the drafting of legislation.[98]\n\n\nLuxembourg has three lower tribunals (*justices de paix*; in Esch-sur-Alzette, the city of Luxembourg, and Diekirch), two district tribunals (Luxembourg and Diekirch), and a Superior Court of Justice (Luxembourg), which includes the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation. There is also an Administrative Tribunal and an Administrative Court, as well as a Constitutional Court, all of which are located in the capital.\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cantons of Luxembourg and Communes of Luxembourg\n\nFurther information: Administrative divisions of Luxembourg\n\nLuxembourg is divided into 12 cantons, which are further divided into 102 communes.[99] Twelve of the communes have city status; the city of Luxembourg is the largest.[100]\n\n\n\nPartitions and Cantons of Luxembourg\n![](image)\nThere have been three partitions of Luxembourg between 1659 and 1839. Together, they reduced the territory of Luxembourg from 10,700\u00a0km2 (4,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) to the present-day area of 2,586\u00a0km2 (998\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The remainder forms parts of modern day Belgium, France, and Germany.\n![](image)\nCantons of Luxembourg:  \nCapellen (1) - Clervaux(2) - Diekirch(3) - Echternach(4) - Esch-sur-Alzette(5) - Grevenmacher(6) - Luxembourg(7) - Mersch(8) - Redange(9) - Remich(10) - Vianden(11) - Wiltz(12)\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Luxembourg\n\nLuxembourg has long been a prominent supporter of European political and economic integration. In 1921, Luxembourg and Belgium formed the Belgium\u2013Luxembourg Economic Union (BLEU) to create a regime of inter-exchangeable currency and a common customs.[74] Luxembourg is a member of the Benelux Economic Union and was one of the founding members of the European Economic Community (now the European Union). It also participates in the Schengen Group (named after the Luxembourg village of Schengen where the agreements were signed).[23] At the same time, the majority of Luxembourgers have consistently believed that European unity makes sense only in the context of a dynamic transatlantic relationship, and thus have traditionally pursued a pro-NATO, pro-US foreign policy.[101]\n\n\nLuxembourg is the site of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Court of Auditors, the Statistical Office of the European Union (Eurostat) and other vital EU organs. The Secretariat of the European Parliament is located in Luxembourg, but the Parliament usually meets in Brussels and sometimes in Strasbourg.[102] Luxembourg is also site of the EFTA Court, which is responsible for the three EFTA members who are part of the European Single Market through the EEA Agreement.[103]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Luxembourg Armed Forces\n\n![](image)Luxembourgish soldiers on parade during National Day, *Grand Duke Day*, 23 June\nThe Luxembourgish army is mostly based in its casern, the *Centre militaire Caserne Grand-Duc Jean* on the *H\u00e4rebierg* in Diekirch. The general staff is based in the capital, the *\u00c9tat-Major*.[104] The army is under civilian control, with the grand duke as Commander-in-Chief. The Minister for Defense, Fran\u00e7ois Bausch, oversees army operations. The professional head of the army is the Chief of Defense, who answers to the minister and holds the rank of general.\n\n\nBeing landlocked, Luxembourg has no navy. Seventeen NATO AWACS airplanes are registered as aircraft of Luxembourg.[105] In accordance with a joint agreement with Belgium, both countries have put forth funding for one A400M military cargo plane.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nLuxembourg has participated in the Eurocorps, has contributed troops to the UNPROFOR and IFOR missions in former Yugoslavia, and has participated with a small contingent in the NATO SFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Luxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support ISAF. The army has also participated in humanitarian relief missions such as setting up refugee camps for Kurds and providing emergency supplies to Albania.[106]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Luxembourg\n\nLuxembourg is one of Europe's smallest countries, ranking 168th in size of the 194 independent countries of the world; it is about 2,586 square kilometers (998\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in size, measuring 82\u00a0km (51\u00a0mi) long and 57\u00a0km (35\u00a0mi) wide. It lies between latitudes 49\u00b0 and 51\u00b0 N, and longitudes 5\u00b0 and 7\u00b0 E.[107]\n\n\n\n![](image)The largest towns are Luxembourg, Esch-sur-Alzette, Dudelange, and Differdange.\nTo the east, Luxembourg borders the German *Bundesl\u00e4nder* of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, and to the south, it borders the French *r\u00e9gion* of Grand Est (Lorraine). The Grand Duchy borders Belgium's Wallonia, in particular the Belgian provinces of Luxembourg and Li\u00e8ge, part of which comprises the German-speaking Community of Belgium, to the west and to the north, respectively.\n\n\nThe northern third of the country is known as the Oesling, and forms part of the Ardennes. It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the Kneiff near Wilwerdange,[108] which is the highest point, at 560 meters (1,840\u00a0ft). Other mountains are the Buurgplaatz at 559 meters (1,834\u00a0ft) near Huldange and the Napol\u00e9onsgaard at 554 meters (1,818\u00a0ft) near Rambrouch. The region is sparsely populated, with only one town (Wiltz) with a population of more than five thousand people.\n\n\nThe southern two-thirds of the country is called the Gutland, and is more densely populated than the Oesling. It is also more diverse and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\n\n\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Luxembourg is one of the world's best performers in environmental protection, ranking 4th out of 132 assessed countries.[109] In 2020, it ranked second out of 180 countries.[110] Luxembourg also ranks 6th among the top ten most livable cities in the world by Mercer's.[111] The country wants to cut GHG emissions by 55% in 10 years and reach zero emissions by 2050. Luxembourg wants to increase its organic farming fivefold.[112] It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.12/10, ranking it 164th globally out of 172 countries.[113]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nLuxembourg has an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: *Cfb*), marked by high precipitation, particularly in late summer. The summers are warm and winters cool.[114]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Luxembourg\n\n![](image)Luxembourg is part of the Schengen Area, the EU single market, and the eurozone (dark blue).\nLuxembourg's stable and high-income market economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and a high level of innovation.[115] Unemployment is traditionally low, though it reached 6.1% by May 2012, due largely to the 2008 global financial crisis.[116] In 2011, according to the IMF, Luxembourg was the world's second-richest country, with a per capita GDP on a purchasing-power parity (PPP) basis of $80,119.[117] Its GDP per capita in purchasing power standards was 261% of the EU average (100%) in 2019.[118] Luxembourg ranks 13th in The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom,[119] 26th in the United Nations Human Development Index, and 4th in the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality of life index.[120] It ranked 21st in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[121]\n\n\nThe industrial sector, dominated by steel until the 1960s, has since diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products. During recent decades, growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel production. Services, especially banking and finance, account for the majority of the economic output. Luxembourg is the world's second largest investment fund center (after the United States), the most important private banking center in the eurozone and Europe's leading center for reinsurance companies. Moreover, Luxembourg's government has aimed to attract Internet startups, with Skype and Amazon being two of the many Internet companies that have shifted their regional headquarters to Luxembourg. Other high-tech companies have established themselves in Luxembourg, including 3D scanner developer/manufacturer Artec 3D.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 2009, concern about Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws, as well as its reputation as a tax haven, led to its being added to a \"gray list\" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the G20. In response, the country soon adopted OECD standards on exchange of information and was subsequently added into the category of \"jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard\".[122][123] In March 2010, the *Sunday Telegraph* reported that most of Kim Jong-Il's $4 billion in secret accounts was in Luxembourg banks.[124] Amazon.co.uk also benefits from Luxembourg tax loopholes by channeling substantial U.K. revenues, as reported by *The Guardian* in April 2012.[125] Luxembourg ranked third on the Tax Justice Network's 2011 Financial Secrecy Index of the world's major tax havens, scoring only slightly behind the Cayman Islands.[126] In 2013, Luxembourg was ranked the 2nd safest tax haven in the world, behind Switzerland.\n\n\nIn early November 2014, just days after becoming head of the European Commission, Luxembourg's former Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker was hit by media disclosures\u2014derived from a document leak known as Luxembourg Leaks\u2014that Luxembourg had turned into a major European center of corporate tax avoidance under his premiership.[127]\n\n\nAgriculture employed about 2.1% of Luxembourg's active population in 2010, when there were 2200 agricultural holdings with an average area per holding of 60 hectares.[128]\n\n\nLuxembourg has especially close trade and financial ties to Belgium and the Netherlands (see Benelux), and as a member of the EU it enjoys the advantages of the open European market.[129]\n\n\nWith $171 billion in May 2015, the country ranked 11th in the world in holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.[130] However, securities owned by non-Luxembourg residents, but held in custodial accounts in Luxembourg, are included in this figure.[131]\n\n\nAs of 2019[update], Luxembourg's public debt totaled $15,687,000,000, or $25,554 per capita. The debt to GDP was 22.10%.[132]\n\n\nThe Luxembourg labor market represents 445,000 jobs occupied by 120,000 Luxembourgers, 120,000 foreign residents and 205,000 cross-border commuters. The latter pay their taxes in Luxembourg, but their education and social rights are the responsibility of their country of residence. The same applies to pensioners. Luxembourg's government has never shared its tax revenues with the local authorities on the French border. This system is seen as one of the keys to Luxembourg's economic growth, but at the expense of the border countries.[133]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Luxembourg\n\nSee also: History of rail transport in Luxembourg\n\n![](image)Luxembourg's international airline Luxair is based at Luxembourg Airport, the country's only international airport.\nLuxembourg has road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernized in recent years with 165\u00a0km (103\u00a0mi)[134] of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station and a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport was opened in 2008.[135] Luxembourg City reintroduced trams in December 2017 and there are plans to open light-rail lines in adjacent areas within the next few years.[136]\n\n\nThere are 681 cars per 1000 persons in Luxembourg\u2014higher than most of other states, and surpassed by the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, and other small states like Principality of Monaco, San Marino, Liechtenstein, the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, and Brunei.[137]\n\n\nOn 29 February 2020, Luxembourg became the first country to introduce no-charge public transportation, which will be almost completely funded by public expenditure.[138]\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in Luxembourg\n\nThe telecommunications industry in Luxembourg is liberalized and the electronic communications networks are significantly developed. Competition between the different operators is guaranteed by the legislative framework Paquet Telecom[139] of the Government of 2011 which transposes the European Telecom Directives into Luxembourgish law. This encourages the investment in networks and services. The regulator ILR \u2013 Institut Luxembourgeois de R\u00e9gulation[140] ensures the compliance to these legal rules.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nLuxembourg has modern and widely deployed optical fiber and cable networks throughout the country. In 2010, the Luxembourg Government launched its National strategy for very high-speed networks with the aim to become a global leader in terms of very high-speed broadband by achieving full 1 Gbit/s coverage of the country by 2020.[141] In 2011, Luxembourg had an NGA coverage of 75%.[142] In April 2013 Luxembourg featured the 6th highest download speed worldwide and the 2nd highest in Europe: 32,46 Mbit/s.[143] The country's location in Central Europe, stable economy and low taxes favour the telecommunication industry.[144][145][146]\n\n\nIt ranks 2nd in the world in the development of the Information and Communication Technologies in the ITU ICT Development Index and 8th in the Global Broadband Quality Study 2009 by the University of Oxford and the University of Oviedo.[147][148][149][150]\n\n\n\n![](image)Signs in front of the Centre Drosbach on the Cloche d'or, in the city of Luxembourg\nLuxembourg is connected to all major European Internet Exchanges (AMS-IX Amsterdam,[151] DE-CIX Frankfurt,[152] LINX London),[153] datacenters and POPs through redundant optical networks.[154][155][156][157][158] In addition, the country is connected to the virtual meetme room services (vmmr)[159] of the international data hub operator Ancotel.[160] This enables Luxembourg to interconnect with all major telecommunication operators[161] and data carriers worldwide. The interconnection points are in Frankfurt, London, New York and Hong Kong.[162] Luxembourg has established itself as one of the leading financial technology (FinTech) hubs in Europe, with the Luxembourg government supporting initiatives like the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology.[163]\n\n\nSome 20 data centers[164][165][166] are operating in Luxembourg. Six data centers are Tier IV Design certified: three of ebrc,[167] two of LuxConnect[168][169] and one of European Data Hub.[170] In a survey on nine international data centers carried out in December 2012 and January 2013 and measuring availability (up-time) and performance (delay by which the data from the requested website was received), the top three positions were held by Luxembourg data centers.[171][172]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Luxembourg\n\n### Largest towns[edit]\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in Luxembourg2023\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | Canton | Municipal pop.\n |  |\n| ![Luxembourg](image)Luxembourg![Esch-sur-Alzette](image)Esch-sur-Alzette | 1 | Luxembourg | Luxembourg Canton | 132,780\n | ![Differdange](image)Differdange![Dudelange](image)Dudelange |\n| 2 | Esch-sur-Alzette | Esch-sur-Alzette Canton | 36,625\n |\n| 3 | Differdange | Esch-sur-Alzette Canton | 29,536\n |\n| 4 | Dudelange | Esch-sur-Alzette Canton | 21,952\n |\n| 5 | P\u00e9tange | Esch-sur-Alzette Canton | 20,563\n |\n| 6 | Sanem | Esch-sur-Alzette Canton | 18,333\n |\n| 7 | Hesperange | Luxembourg Canton | 16,433\n |\n| 8 | Bettembourg | Esch-sur-Alzette Canton | 11,422\n |\n| 9 | Schifflange | Esch-sur-Alzette Canton | 11,363\n |\n| 10 | K\u00e4erjeng | Capellen Canton | 11,015\n |\n\n![](image)Population density in Luxembourg by communes.

In 2013 about 88,000 Luxembourg inhabitants possessed Portuguese nationality.[175] In 2013, there were 537,039 permanent residents, 44.5% of which were of foreign background or foreign nationals; the largest foreign ethnic groups were the Portuguese, comprising 16.4% of the total population, followed by the French (6.6%), Italians (3.4%), Belgians (3.3%) and Germans (2.3%). Another 6.4% were of other EU background, while the remaining 6.1% were of other non-EU, but largely other European, background.[176]\n\n\nSince the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, Luxembourg has seen many immigrants from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia. Annually, over 10,000 new immigrants arrive in Luxembourg, mostly from the EU states, as well as Eastern Europe. In 2000 there were 162,000 immigrants in Luxembourg, accounting for 37% of the total population. There were an estimated 5,000 illegal immigrants in Luxembourg in 1999.[177]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Languages of Luxembourg, Multilingualism in Luxembourg, and Luxembourg literature\n\nAs determined by law since 1984, Luxembourg has only one national language, Luxembourgish.[13] It is considered the mother tongue or \"language of the heart\" for Luxembourgers and the language they generally use to speak or write to each other. Luxembourgish as well as the dialects in adjacent Germany belong to the Moselle Franconian subgroup of the main West Central German dialect group, which are largely mutually intelligible across the border, but Luxembourgish also has more than 5,000 words of French origin.[178][179] Knowledge of Luxembourgish is a criterion for naturalisation.[180]\n\n\nIn addition to Luxembourgish, French and German are used in administrative and judicial matters, making all three administrative languages of Luxembourg.[13] Per article 4 of the law promulgated in 1984, if a citizen asks a question in Luxembourgish, German or French, the administration must reply, as far as possible, in the language in which the question was asked.[13]\n\n\nLuxembourg is largely multilingual: as of 2012[update], 52% of citizens claimed Luxembourgish as their native language, 16.4% Portuguese, 16% French, 2% German and 13.6% different languages (mostly English, Italian or Spanish).[181][182] Even though French was the mother tongue of only 16% of residents in Luxembourg (placing 3rd), 98% of its citizens were able to speak it to a high level.[183] The vast majority of Luxembourg residents are able to speak it as a second or third language.[184] As of 2018[update], much of the population was able to speak multiple other languages: 80% of citizens reported being able to hold a conversation in English, 78% in German and 77% in Luxembourgish, claiming these languages as their respective second, third or fourth language.[183]\n\n\nEach of the three official languages is used as a primary language in certain spheres of everyday life, without being exclusive. Luxembourgish is the language that Luxembourgers generally use to speak and write to each other, and there has been a recent increase in the production of novels and movies in the language; at the same time, the numerous expatriate workers (approximately 44% of the population) generally do not use it to speak to each other.[185]\n\n\nMost official business and written communication is carried out in French, which is also the language mostly used for public communication, with written official statements, advertising displays and road signs generally in French. Due to the historical influence of the Napoleonic Code on the legal system of the Grand Duchy, French is also the sole language of the legislation and generally the preferred language of the government, administration and justice. Parliamentary debates are mostly conducted in Luxembourgish, whereas written government communications and official documents (e.g. administrative or judicial decisions, passports, etc.) are drafted mostly in French and sometimes additionally in German.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAlthough professional life is largely multilingual, French is described by private sector business leaders as the main working language of their companies (56%), followed by Luxembourgish (20%), English (18%), and German (6%).[186]\n\n\nGerman is very often used in much of the media along with French and is considered by most Luxembourgers their second language. This is mostly due to the high similarity of German to Luxembourgish but also because it is the first language taught to children in primary school (language of literacy acquisition).[187]\n\n\nDue to the large community of Portuguese origin, the Portuguese language is fairly prevalent in Luxembourg, though it remains limited to the relationships inside this community. Portuguese has no official status, but the administration sometimes makes certain informative documents available in Portuguese.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nEven though Luxembourg is largely multilingual today, some people claim that Luxembourg is subject of intense francization and that Luxembourgish and German are in danger of disappearing in the country, making Luxembourg either a unilingual Francophone country, or at best a bilingual French- and English-speaking country sometime in the far future.[188][189][184]\n\n\n\nSee also: Luxembourgish \u00a7\u00a0Endangered status claims\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Luxembourg\n\n![](image)Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg City\nLuxembourg is a secular state, but the state recognizes certain religions as officially mandated religions. This gives the state a hand in religious administration and appointment of clergy, in exchange for which the state pays certain running costs and wages. Religions covered by such arrangements are Catholicism, Judaism, Greek Orthodoxy, Anglicanism, Russian Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, Calvinism, Mennonitism, and Islam.[190]\n\n\nSince 1980, it has been illegal for the government to collect statistics on religious beliefs or practices.[191] A 2000 estimate by the CIA Factbook is that 87% of Luxembourgers are Catholic, including the grand ducal family, with the remaining 13% being Protestants, Orthodox Christians, Jews, Muslims, and those of other or no religion.[192] According to a 2010 Pew Research Center study, 70.4% are Christian, 2.3% Muslim, 26.8% unaffiliated, and 0.5% other religions.[193]\n\n\nAccording to a 2005 Eurobarometer poll,[194] 44% of Luxembourg citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", whereas 28% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\", and 22% that \"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force\".\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The University of Luxembourg is the only university based in the country.\nSee also: List of secondary schools in Luxembourg\n\nLuxembourg's education system is trilingual: the first years of primary school are in Luxembourgish, before changing to German; while in secondary school, the language of instruction changes to French.[195] Proficiency in all three languages is required for graduation from secondary school, but half the students leave school without a certified qualification, with the children of immigrants being particularly disadvantaged.[196] In addition to the three national languages, English is taught in compulsory schooling and much of the population of Luxembourg can speak English. The past two decades have highlighted the growing importance of English in several sectors, in particular the financial sector. Portuguese, the language of the largest immigrant community, is also spoken by large segments of the population, but by relatively few from outside the Portuguese-speaking community.[197]\n\n\nThe University of Luxembourg is the only university based in Luxembourg. In 2014, Luxembourg School of Business, a graduate business school, was created through private initiative and received the accreditation from the Ministry of Higher Education and Research of Luxembourg in 2017.[198][199] Two American universities maintain satellite campuses in the country: Miami University (Dolibois European Center) and Sacred Heart University (Luxembourg Campus).[200]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Luxembourg and Healthcare in Luxembourg\n\nAccording to data from the World Health Organization, healthcare spending on behalf of the government of Luxembourg topped $4.1 Billion, amounting to about $8,182 for each citizen in the nation.[201][202] The nation of Luxembourg collectively spent nearly 7% of its Gross Domestic Product on health, placing it among the highest spending countries on health services and related programs in 2010 among other well-off nations in Europe with high average income among its population.[203]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of Luxembourg and National symbols of Luxembourg\n\n![](image)Edward Steichen, photographer and painter\nLuxembourg has been heavily influenced by the culture of its neighbors. It retains a number of folk traditions, having been for much of its history a profoundly rural country. There are several notable museums, located mostly in the capital. These include the National Museum of History and Art (NMHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, and the new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam). The National Museum of Military History (MNHM) in Diekirch is especially known for its representations of the Battle of the Bulge. The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on account of the historical importance of its fortifications.[204][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nThe country has produced some internationally known artists, including the painters Th\u00e9o Kerg, Joseph Kutter and Michel Majerus, and photographer Edward Steichen, whose *The Family of Man* exhibition has been placed on UNESCO's Memory of the World register, and is now permanently housed in Clervaux. Editor and author Hugo Gernsback, whose publications crystallized the concept of science fiction, was born in Luxembourg City. Movie star Loretta Young was of Luxembourgish descent.[205]\n\n\nLuxembourg was a founding participant of the Eurovision Song Contest, and participated every year between 1956 and 1993, with the exception of 1959 and returning to the competition in 2024.[206] It won the competition a total of five times, 1961, 1965, 1972, 1973 and 1983 and hosted the contest in 1962, 1966, 1973, and 1984, but only nine of its 38 entries were performed by Luxembourgish artists.[207]\n\n\nLuxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, the European Capital of Culture was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the Lorraine area in France.[208] The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders physically, psychologically, artistically and emotionally.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nLuxembourg was represented at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, China, from 1 May to 31 October 2010 with its own pavilion.[209][210] The pavilion, designed as a forest and fortress, was based on the transliteration of the word Luxembourg into Chinese, \"L\u00fas\u0113nb\u01ceo\", which when directly translated, means \"forest and fortress\". It represented Luxembourg as the \"Green Heart in Europe\".[211]\n\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Luxembourg\n\nFurther information: Luxembourgish Sportspeople of the Year\n\n![](image)Charly Gaul won three Grand Tours in his cycling career.\nUnlike most countries in Europe, sports in Luxembourg are not concentrated upon a particular national sport, but instead encompass a number of sports, both team and individual. Despite the lack of a central sporting focus, over 100,000 people in Luxembourg, out of a total population of 660,000, are licensed members of one sports federation or another.[212] The Stade de Luxembourg, situated in Gasperich, southern Luxembourg City, is the country's national stadium and largest sports venue in the country with a capacity of 9,386 for sporting events, including football and rugby union, and 15,000 for concerts.[213] The largest indoor venue in the country is d'Coque, Kirchberg, north-eastern Luxembourg City, which has a capacity of 8,300. The arena is used for basketball, handball, gymnastics, and volleyball, including the final of the 2007 Women's European Volleyball Championship.[214]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Luxembourg\n\n![](image)*Judd mat Gaardebounen*, served with boiled potatoes and Diekirch beer\nLuxembourg cuisine reflects its position on the border between the Latin and Germanic worlds, being heavily influenced by the cuisines of neighboring France and Germany. More recently,[*when?*] it has been enriched by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMost native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in the country's folk dishes, the same as in neighboring Germany.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nLuxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita.[215] However, the large proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighboring countries contributes to the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg population.[216]\n\n\nLuxembourg has the second highest number of Michelin-starred restaurants per capita with Japan ranked at number one and Switzerland following Luxembourg at number three.[217]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nThe main languages of media in Luxembourg are French and German. The newspaper with the largest circulation is the German-language daily *Luxemburger Wort*.[218] Because of the strong multilingualism in Luxembourg, newspapers often alternate articles in French and articles in German, without translation. In addition, there are both English and Portuguese radio and national print publications, but accurate audience figures are difficult to gauge since the national media survey by ILRES is conducted in French.[219]\n\n\nLuxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations (Radio Luxembourg and RTL Group). It is also the uplink home of SES, carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain.[220]\n\n\nDue to a 1988 law that established a special tax scheme for audiovisual investment, the film and co-production in Luxembourg has grown steadily.[221] There are some 30 registered production companies in Luxembourg.[222][223]\n\n\nLuxembourg won an Oscar in 2014 in the Animated Short Films category with *Mr Hublot*.[224]\n\n\n\n### Notable Luxembourgers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Luxembourgers\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Luxembourg portal\n\n\n* Outline of Luxembourg\n* Disability in Luxembourg\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Informational notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** European Union since 1993.\n2. **^** Luxembourgish: *Groussherzogtum L\u00ebtzebuerg* [\u02c8\u0261\u0280\u0259\u028a\u032fs\u02cch\u025b\u03c7tso\u02d0\u03c7tum \u02c8l\u0259ts\u0259bu\u0259\u0255]; French: *Grand-Duch\u00e9 de Luxembourg* [\u0261\u0281\u0251\u0303 dy\u0283e d\u0259 lyks\u0251\u0303bu\u0281] \u24d8; German: *Gro\u00dfherzogtum Luxemburg* [\u02c8\u0261\u0281o\u02d0s\u02cch\u025b\u0281tso\u02d0ktu\u02d0m \u02c8l\u028aksm\u0329b\u028a\u0281k] \u24d8.\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The World Factbook\".

It is located about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north. The country's territory comprises one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by approximately 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the second highest population density of any country in the world, although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of urban planning. With a multicultural population and in recognition of the cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. English is the lingua franca, with its exclusive use in numerous public services. Multi-racialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in education, housing, and politics.\n\n\nSingapore's history dates back at least eight hundred years, having been a maritime emporium known as *Temasek* and subsequently a major constituent part of several successive thalassocratic empires. Its contemporary era began in 1819, when Stamford Raffles established Singapore as an entrep\u00f4t trading post of the British Empire. In 1867, the colonies in Southeast Asia were reorganised, and Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the Straits Settlements. During World War II, Singapore was occupied by Japan in 1942 and returned to British control as a separate Crown colony following Japan's surrender in 1945. Singapore gained self-governance in 1959 and, in 1963, became part of the new federation of Malaysia, alongside Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak. Ideological differences, most notably the perceived encroachment of the egalitarian \"Malaysian Malaysia\" political ideology led by Lee Kuan Yew into the other constituent entities of Malaysia\u2014at the perceived expense of the *bumiputera* and the policies of *Ketuanan Melayu*\u2014eventually led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation two years later; Singapore became an independent sovereign country in 1965.\n\n\nAfter early years of turbulence and despite lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers. With its growth based on international trade and economic globalisation, it integrated itself with the world economy through free trade with minimal-to-no trade barriers or tariffs, export-oriented industrialisation, and the large accumulation of received foreign direct investments, foreign exchange reserves, and assets held by sovereign wealth funds. As a highly developed country, it has the highest GDP per capita (PPP) in the world. Identified as a tax haven, Singapore is the only country in Asia with a AAA sovereign credit rating from all major rating agencies. It is a major aviation, financial, and maritime shipping hub and has consistently been ranked as one of the most expensive cities to live in for expatriates and foreign workers. Singapore ranks highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety, infrastructure, and housing, with a home-ownership rate of 88 percent. Singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies, fastest Internet connection speeds, lowest infant mortality rates, and lowest levels of corruption in the world.\n\n\nSingapore is a unitary parliamentary republic with a Westminster system of unicameral parliamentary government, and its legal system is based on common law. While the country is a multi-party democracy with free elections, the government under the People's Action Party (PAP) wields significant control and dominance over politics and society. The PAP has governed the country continuously since full internal self-government was achieved in 1959, currently holding 79 out of 93 elected seats in Parliament. One of the five founding members of ASEAN, Singapore is also the headquarters of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Secretariat, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council Secretariat, and is the host city of many international conferences and events. Singapore is also a member of the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the East Asia Summit, the Non-Aligned Movement, and the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\n\n\n\n## Name and etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Singapore\n\nThe English name of \"Singapore\" is an anglicisation of the native Malay name for the country, *Singapura* (pronounced [si\u014bapura]), which was in turn derived from the Sanskrit word for 'lion city' (Sanskrit: \u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939\u092a\u0941\u0930; romanised: *Si\u1e43hapura*; Brahmi: \ud804\udc32\ud804\udc3a\ud804\udc01\ud804\udc33\ud804\udc27\ud804\udc3c\ud804\udc2d; literally \"lion city\"; *si\u1e43ha* means 'lion', *pura* means 'city' or 'fortress' ).[10] Pulau Ujong was one of the earliest references to Singapore Island, which corresponds to a Chinese account from the third century referred to a place as *P\u00fa Lu\u00f3 Zh\u014dng* (Chinese: \u84b2 \u7f85 \u4e2d), a transcription of the Malay name for 'island at the end of a peninsula'.[11] Early references to the name Temasek (or Tumasik) are found in the Nagarakretagama, a Javanese eulogy written in 1365, and a Vietnamese source from the same time period. The name possibly means *Sea Town*, being derived from the Malay *tasek*, meaning 'sea' or 'lake'.[12] The Chinese traveller Wang Dayuan visited a place around 1330 named *Danmaxi* (Chinese: \u6de1\u99ac\u932b; pinyin: *D\u00e0nm\u01cex\u00ed*; Wade\u2013Giles: *Tan Ma Hsi*) or *Tam ma siak*, depending on pronunciation; this may be a transcription of Temasek, alternatively, it may be a combination of the Malay *Tanah* meaning 'land' and Chinese *xi* meaning 'tin', which was traded on the island.[13][12]\n\n\nVariations of the name *Si\u1e43hapura* were used for a number of cities throughout the region prior to the establishment of the Kingdom of Singapura. In Hindu\u2013Buddhist culture, lions were associated with power and protection, which may explain the attraction of such a name.[14][15] The name *Singapura* supplanted Temasek sometime before the 15th century, after the establishment of the Kingdom of Singapura on the island by a fleeing Sumatran *Raja* (prince) from Palembang. However, the precise time and reason for the name change is unknown. The semi-historical Malay Annals state that Temasek was christened *Singapura* by Sang Nila Utama, a 13th-century Sumatran *Raja* from Palembang. The Annals state that Sang Nila Utama encountered a strange beast on the island that he took to be a lion. Seeing this as an omen, he established the town of *Singapura* where he encountered the beast.[16]:\u200a37,\u200a88\u201392[17]:\u200a30\u201331 The second hypothesis, drawn from Portuguese sources, postulates that this mythical story is based on the real life Parameswara of Palembang. Parameswara declared independence from Majapahit and mounted a Lion Throne. After then being driven into exile by the Javanese, he usurped control over Temasek. It is possible that he rechristened the area as *Singapura*, recalling the throne he had been driven from.[18]\n\n\nUnder Japanese occupation, Singapore was renamed *Syonan* (Japanese: \u662d \u5357, Hepburn: *Sh\u014dnan*), meaning 'light of the south'.[19][20] Singapore is sometimes referred to by the nickname the \"Garden City\", in reference to its parks and tree-lined streets.[21] Another informal name, the \"Little Red Dot\", was adopted after an article in the *Asian Wall Street Journal* of 4 August 1998 said that Indonesian President B. J. Habibie referred to Singapore as a red dot on a map.[22][23][24][25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Singapore\n\n### Ancient Singapore[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Early history of Singapore\n\nIn 1299, according to the Malay Annals, the Kingdom of Singapura was founded on the island by Sang Nila Utama.[26] Although the historicity of the accounts as given in the Malay Annals is the subject of academic debates,[27] it is nevertheless known from various documents that Singapore in the 14th century, then known as Temasek, was a trading port under the influence of both the Majapahit Empire and the Siamese kingdoms,[28] and was a part of the Indosphere.[29][30][31][32][33] These Indianised kingdoms were characterised by surprising resilience, political integrity and administrative stability.[34] Historical sources also indicate that around the end of the 14th century, its ruler Parameswara was attacked by either the Majapahit or the Siamese, forcing him to move to Malacca where he founded the Sultanate of Malacca.[35] Archaeological evidence suggests that the main settlement on Fort Canning was abandoned around this time, although a small trading settlement continued in Singapore for some time afterwards.[18] In 1613, Portuguese raiders burned down the settlement, and the island faded into obscurity for the next two centuries.[36] By then, Singapore was nominally part of the Johor Sultanate.[37] The wider maritime region and much trade was under Dutch control for the following period after the Dutch conquest of Malacca.[38]\n\n\n\n### British colonisation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Founding of modern Singapore and Singapore in the Straits Settlements\n\n![](image)Letter from William Farquhar to Sultan Muhammad Kanzul Alam, the 21st Sultan of Brunei, dated 28 November 1819. In the first line, Farquhar mentions that Sultan Hussein Shah and Temenggong Abdul Rahman allowed the British East India Company to establish a factory in Singapore on 6 February 1819.[39][40]\nThe British governor Stamford Raffles arrived in Singapore on 28 January 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port.[41] The island was then nominally ruled by Tengku Abdul Rahman, the Sultan of Johor, who was controlled by the Dutch and the Bugis.[42] However, the Sultanate was weakened by factional division: Abdul Rahman, the Temenggong of Johor to Tengku Abdul Rahman, as well as his officials, were loyal to the Sultan's elder brother Tengku Long, who was living in exile in Penyengat Island, Riau Islands. With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore. Raffles offered to recognise Tengku Long as the rightful Sultan of Johor, under the title of Sultan Hussein, as well as provide him with a yearly payment of $5000 and another $3000 to the Temenggong; in return, Sultan Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore.[43] The Treaty of Singapore was signed on 6 February 1819.[44][45]\n\n\n\n![](image)1825 survey map. Singapore's free port trade was at Singapore River for 150 years. Fort Canning hill (centre) was home to its ancient and early colonial rulers.\nIn 1824, a further treaty with the Sultan led to the entire island becoming a British possession.[46] In 1826, Singapore became part of the Straits Settlements, then under the jurisdiction of British India. Singapore became the regional capital in 1836.[47] Prior to Raffles' arrival, there were only about a thousand people living on the island, mostly indigenous Malays along with a handful of Chinese.[48] By 1860 the population had swelled to over 80,000, more than half being Chinese.[46] Many of these early immigrants came to work on the pepper and gambier plantations.[49] In 1867, the Straits Settlements were separated from British India, coming under the direct control of Britain.[50] Later, in the 1890s, when the rubber industry became established in Malaya and Singapore,[51] the island became a global centre for rubber sorting and export.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Panorama of Singapore at sunrise, 1865, lithograph by Vincent Brooks.\nSingapore was not greatly affected by the First World War (1914\u201318), as the conflict did not spread to Southeast Asia. The only significant event during the war was the 1915 Singapore Mutiny by Muslim sepoys from British India, who were garrisoned in Singapore.[52] After hearing rumours that they were to be sent to fight the Ottoman Empire, a Muslim state, the soldiers rebelled, killing their officers and several British civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by non-Muslim troops arriving from Johore and Burma.[53]\n\n\nAfter World War I, the British built the large Singapore Naval Base as part of the defensive Singapore strategy.[54] Originally announced in 1921, the construction of the base proceeded at a slow pace until the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Costing $60\u00a0million and not fully completed in 1938, it was nonetheless the largest dry dock in the world, the third-largest floating dock, and had enough fuel tanks to support the entire British navy for six months.[54][55][56] The base was defended by heavy 15-inch (380\u00a0mm) naval guns stationed at Fort Siloso, Fort Canning and Labrador, as well as a Royal Air Force airfield at Tengah Air Base. Winston Churchill touted it as the \"Gibraltar of the East\", and military discussions often referred to the base as simply \"East of Suez\". However, the British Home Fleet was stationed in Europe, and the British could not afford to build a second fleet to protect their interests in Asia. The plan was for the Home Fleet to sail quickly to Singapore in the event of an emergency. As a consequence, after World War II broke out in 1939, the fleet was fully occupied with defending Britain, leaving Singapore vulnerable to Japanese invasion.[57][58]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japanese occupation of Singapore\n\n![](image)British evacuation in 1945 after the Japanese surrender. Kallang Airport's control tower near the city has been conserved.\nDuring the Pacific War, the Japanese invasion of Malaya culminated in the Battle of Singapore. When the British force of 60,000 troops surrendered on 15 February 1942, British prime minister Winston Churchill called the defeat \"the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history\".[59] British and Empire losses during the fighting for Singapore were heavy, with a total of nearly 85,000 personnel captured.[60] About 5,000 were killed or wounded,[61] of which Australians made up the majority.[62][63][64] Japanese casualties during the fighting in Singapore amounted to 1,714 killed and 3,378 wounded.[60][e] The occupation was to become a major turning point in the histories of several nations, including those of Japan, Britain, and Singapore. Japanese newspapers triumphantly declared the victory as deciding the general situation of the war.[65][66] Between 5,000 and 25,000 ethnic Chinese people were killed in the subsequent Sook Ching massacre.[67] British forces had planned to liberate Singapore in 1945; however, the war ended before these operations could be carried out.[68][69]\n\n\n\n### Post-war period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colony of Singapore\n\nAfter the Japanese surrender to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British, Australian, and Indian troops led by Lord Louis Mountbatten returned to Singapore to receive the formal surrender of Japanese forces in the region from General Seishir\u014d Itagaki on behalf of General Hisaichi Terauchi on 12 September 1945.[68][69] Meanwhile, Tomoyuki Yamashita was tried by a US military commission for war crimes, but not for crimes committed by his troops in Malaya or Singapore. He was convicted and hanged in the Philippines on 23 February 1946.[70][71]\n\n\nMuch of Singapore's infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including those needed to supply utilities. A shortage of food led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. A series of strikes in 1947 caused massive stoppages in public transport and other services. However, by late 1947 the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing international demand for tin and rubber.[72] The failure of Britain to successfully defend its colony against the Japanese changed its image in the eyes of Singaporeans. British Military Administration ended on 1 April 1946, and Singapore became a separate Crown Colony.[72] In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative Council was scheduled for the following year.[73]\n\n\nDuring the 1950s, Chinese communists, with strong ties to the trade unions and Chinese schools, waged a guerrilla war against the government, leading to the Malayan Emergency. The 1954 National Service riots, Hock Lee bus riots, and Chinese middle schools riots in Singapore were all linked to these events.[74] David Marshall, pro-independence leader of the Labour Front, won Singapore's first general election in 1955.[75] He led a delegation to London, and Britain rejected his demand for complete self-rule. He resigned and was replaced by Lim Yew Hock in 1956, and after further negotiations Britain agreed to grant Singapore full internal self-government for all matters except defence and foreign affairs.[76] During the subsequent May 1959 elections, the People's Action Party (PAP) won a landslide victory.[77] Governor Sir William Allmond Codrington Goode served as the first Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State).[78]\n\n\n\n### Within Malaysia[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Singapore in Malaysia\n\n![](image)Singapore thrived as an entrep\u00f4t. In the 1960s, bumboats were used to transport cargoes and supplies between nearshore ships and Singapore River.\nPAP leaders believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya, due to strong ties between the two. It was thought that reuniting with Malaya would benefit the economy by creating a common market, alleviating ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizeable pro-communist wing of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence, and hence formed the Barisan Sosialis, splitting from the PAP.[79][80] The ruling party of Malaya, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), was staunchly anti-communist, and it was suspected UMNO would support the non-communist factions of PAP. UMNO, initially sceptical of the idea of a merger due to distrust of the PAP government and concern that the large ethnic Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance in Malaya on which their political power base depended, became supportive of the idea of the merger due to joint fear of a communist takeover.[81]\n\n\nOn 27 May 1961, Malaya's prime minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, made a surprise proposal for a new Federation called Malaysia, which would unite the current and former British possessions in the region: the Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei, North Borneo, and Sarawak.[81][82] UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Bornean territories would balance Singapore's Chinese population.[76] The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.[83] To obtain a mandate for a merger, the PAP held a referendum on the merger. This referendum included a choice of different terms for a merger with Malaysia and had no option for avoiding merger altogether.[84][85] On 16 September 1963, Singapore joined with Malaya, the North Borneo, and Sarawak to form the new Federation of Malaysia under the terms of the Malaysia Agreement.[86] Under this Agreement, Singapore had a relatively high level of autonomy compared to the other states of Malaysia.[87]\n\n\nIndonesia opposed the formation of Malaysia due to its own claims over Borneo and launched *Konfrontasi* (\"Confrontation\" in Indonesian) in response to the formation of Malaysia.[88] On 10 March 1965, a bomb planted by Indonesian saboteurs on a mezzanine floor of MacDonald House exploded, killing three people and injuring 33 others. It was the deadliest of at least 42 bomb incidents which occurred during the confrontation.[89] Two members of the Indonesian Marine Corps, Osman bin Haji Mohamed Ali and Harun bin Said, were eventually convicted and executed for the crime.[90] The explosion caused US$250,000 (equivalent to US$2,417,107 in 2023) in damages to MacDonald House.[91][92]\n\n\nEven after the merger, the Singaporean government and the Malaysian central government disagreed on many political and economic issues.[93] Despite an agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore did not extend to Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states. Talks soon broke down, and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides. This led to communal strife in Singapore, culminating in the 1964 race riots.[94] On 7 August 1965, Malaysian prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, seeing no alternative to avoid further bloodshed (and with the help of secret negotiations by PAP leaders, as revealed in 2015)[95] advised the Parliament of Malaysia that it should vote to expel Singapore from Malaysia.[93] On 9 August 1965, the Malaysian Parliament voted 126 to 0 to move a bill to amend the constitution, expelling Singapore from Malaysia, which left Singapore as a newly independent country.[76][96][97][98][99][95]\n\n\n\n### Republic of Singapore[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965\n\n![](image)Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister of Singapore.\nAfter being expelled from Malaysia, Singapore became independent as the Republic of Singapore on 9 August 1965,[100][101] with Lee Kuan Yew and Yusof bin Ishak as the first prime minister and president respectively.[102][103] In 1967, the country co-founded the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).[104] Race riots broke out once more in 1969.[105] Lee Kuan Yew's emphasis on rapid economic growth, support for business entrepreneurship, and limitations on internal democracy shaped Singapore's policies for the next half-century.[106][107] Economic growth continued throughout the 1980s, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999. During the 1980s, Singapore began to shift towards high-tech industries, such as the wafer fabrication sector, in order to remain competitive as neighbouring countries began manufacturing with cheaper labour. Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was formed.[108] The Port of Singapore became one of the world's busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period.[109][110]\n\n\nThe PAP has remained in power since independence. Some activists and opposition politicians see the government's strict regulation of political and media activities as an infringement on political rights.[111] In response, Singapore has seen several significant political changes, such as the introduction of the non-constituency members of parliament in 1984 to allow up to three losing candidates from opposition parties to be appointed as MPs. Group representation constituencies (GRCs) were introduced in 1988 to create multi-seat electoral divisions, intended to ensure minority representation in parliament.[112] Nominated members of parliament were introduced in 1990 to allow non-elected non-partisan MPs.[113] The constitution was amended in 1991 to provide for an elected president who has veto power in the use of past reserves and appointments to certain public offices.[114]\n\n\nIn 1990, Goh Chok Tong succeeded Lee and became Singapore's second prime minister.[115] During Goh's tenure, the country went through the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2003 SARS outbreak.[116][117] In 2004, Lee Hsien Loong, the eldest son of Lee Kuan Yew, became the country's third prime minister.[117] Lee Hsien Loong's tenure included the 2008 global financial crisis, the resolution of a dispute over land ownership at Tanjong Pagar railway station between Singapore and Malaysia, and the introduction of the two integrated resorts (IRs), located at the Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa.[118] The PAP suffered its worst ever electoral results in 2011, winning just 60% of votes, amidst debate over issues including the influx of foreign workers and the high cost of living.[119] On 23 March 2015, Lee Kuan Yew died, and a one-week period of public mourning was observed nationwide.[107] Subsequently, the PAP regained its dominance in Parliament through the September general election, receiving 69.9% of the popular vote,[120] although this remained lower than the 2001 tally of 75.3%[121] and the 1968 tally of 86.7%.[122] The 2020 election held in July saw the PAP drop to 61% of the vote, while the Workers' Party took 10 of the 93 seats, the highest number ever won by another party.[123]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Singapore, Politics of Singapore, and Administrative divisions of Singapore\n\n![](image)The Istana is the official residence and office of the president, as well as the working office of the prime minister.\n![](image)The Supreme Court (left) and the Parliament House (right) where the Singapore Parliament convenes\n![](image)The Speakers' Corner at Hong Lim Park provides a public demonstration area, which are often restricted in other parts of the country.\nSingapore is a parliamentary republic based on the Westminster system. The Constitution of Singapore is the supreme law of the country, establishing the structure and responsibility of governance. The President is the head of state.[124][125] The governance of Singapore is separated into three branches:\n\n\n\n* Executive: The executive consists of the cabinet, led by the prime minister, and the Attorney General's Chambers led by the Attorney-General.[126] The cabinet is collectively responsible for all government policies and the day-to-day administration of the affairs of state. It is typically composed of members of the Singapore Parliament. The prime minister is appointed by the President, and the ministers in the cabinet and the attorney-general are appointed by the president, acting on the advice and consent of the prime minister. The prime minister is the effective head of the executive branch of government.[127][124]\n\n\n* Legislature: The Singapore Parliament is unicameral and, together with the president, comprises the legislature.[128] Members of Parliament (MP) consist of elected, non-constituency, and nominated members. The majority of MPs are elected into parliament at a general election. The Singapore Parliament is collectively responsible for enacting the laws governing the state.[124] The president holds limited discretionary powers of oversight over the government. The president's veto powers are further subject to parliamentary overruling.[129][130]\n\n\n* Judiciary: The judiciary's function is to independently administer justice and is headed by the Chief Justice. The judges and judicial commissioners are appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister.[131] The Supreme Court and State Courts adjudicates in civil disputes between persons, convicts or acquits accused persons in criminal prosecutions, and interprets laws to decide on its constitutionality. Any law or provision of a law found to be unconstitutional can be struck down by the Supreme Court.[132]\n\n\nThe president is directly elected by popular vote for a renewable six-year term. Requirements for this position, which were enacted by the PAP government, are extremely stringent, such that only a handful of people qualify for the candidacy.[133][134] These qualifications include that a candidate needs to be a person at least 45 years of age who is no longer a member of a political party, to either have held public office for at least 3 years in a number of specific public service leadership roles, or to have 3 years experience as chief executive of a fully profitable private sector company with at least S$500 million in shareholders' equity, be a resident in Singapore for at least 10 years, not have a criminal record, and more.[135][134][136] Candidates must also \"satisfy\" the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC) that he or she is a person of integrity, good character and reputation.\n\n\nThe Constitution requires that presidential elections be \"reserved\" for a racial community if no one from that ethnic group has been elected to the presidency in the five most recent terms.[137] Only members of that community may qualify as candidates in a reserved presidential election.[138] In the 2017 presidential election, this combination of stringent requirements and a reserved election that required the candidate to be of the 13% Malay ethnic group led to the PEC approving a single candidate for the presidency;[139] Halimah Yacob, considered part of the Malay community, won in an uncontested election. She also became Singapore's first female president.\n\n\nMembers of Parliament (MPs) are elected at least every five years (or sooner with a snap election). The 14th and current Parliament has 103 members; 93 were directly elected from the 31 constituencies, nine are nonpartisan nominated members appointed by the president, and three are non-constituency members from opposition parties who were not elected in the last general election but appointed to the legislature to increase opposition party representation. In group representation constituencies (GRCs), political parties assemble teams of candidates to contest elections. At least one MP in a GRC must be of an ethnic minority background. All elections are held using first-past-the-post voting.[140] MPs host weekly political surgeries, called \"Meet-the-People Sessions\", where they help constituents resolve personal issues which can be related to housing, financial assistance, and immigration.[141]\n\n\nThe People's Action Party occupies a dominant position in Singaporean politics, having won large parliamentary majorities in every election since self-governance was granted in 1959. The PAP, self-described as pragmatic, have a syncretic ideology combining free-market principles, civil nationalism, and welfarism.[142][143][144] Despite promulgating restrictions on civil liberties, Singapore under the PAP has seen consistent economic growth and political stability.[145] The most represented and popular opposition party is the Workers' Party.[123]\n\n\nThe judicial system is based on English common law, continuing the legal tradition established during British rule and with substantial local differences. Criminal law is based on the Indian Penal Code originally intended for British India, and was at the time as a crown colony also adopted by the British colonial authorities in Singapore and remains the basis of the criminal code in the country with a few exceptions, amendments and repeals since it came into force.[146] Trial by jury was abolished in 1970.[147] Both corporal punishment (caning)[148][149] and capital punishment (by hanging) are legal penalties.[150]\n\n\nThe right to freedom of speech and association is guaranteed by Article 14(1) of the Constitution of Singapore, although there are provisions in the subsequent subsection that regulate them.[151] The government has restricted freedom of speech and freedom of the press as well as some civil and political rights.[152] In 2023, Singapore was ranked 129th out of 180 nations by Reporters Without Borders on the global Press Freedom Index.[153] Freedom House ranks Singapore as \"partly free\" in its *Freedom in the World* report,[154][145] and the Economist Intelligence Unit ranks Singapore as a \"flawed democracy\", the second freest rank of four, in its \"Democracy Index\".[155][156] All public gatherings of five or more people require police permits, and protests may legally be held only at the Speakers' Corner.[157]\n\n\nIn the Corruption Perceptions Index, which ranks countries by \"perceived levels of public sector corruption\", Singapore has consistently ranked as one of the least corrupt countries in the world.[158] Singapore's unique combination of a strong, almost authoritarian, government with an emphasis on meritocracy and good governance is known as the \"Singapore model\", and is regarded as a key factor behind Singapore's political stability, economic growth, and harmonious social order.[159][160][161][162] In 2021, the World Justice Project's Rule of Law Index ranked Singapore as 17th overall among the world's 193 countries for adherence to the rule of law. Singapore ranked high on the factors of order and security (#3), absence of corruption (#3), regulatory enforcement (#4), civil justice (#8), and criminal justice (#7), and ranked significantly lower on factors of open government (#34), constraints on government powers (#32), and fundamental rights (#38).[163]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Singapore\n\n![](image)Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the 2017 G20 meeting in Germany. Since 2010, Singapore has often been invited to participate in G20 processes.\nSingapore's stated foreign policy priority is maintaining security in Southeast Asia and surrounding territories. An underlying principle is political and economic stability in the region.[164] It has diplomatic relations with more than 180 sovereign states.[165]\n\n\nAs one of the five founding members of ASEAN,[166] Singapore is a strong supporter of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Investment Area (AIA); it is also the host of the APEC Secretariat.[167] Singapore maintains membership in other regional organisations, such as Asia\u2013Europe Meeting, the Forum for East Asia-Latin American Cooperation, the Indian Ocean Rim Association, and the East Asia Summit.[164] It is also a member of the Non-Aligned Movement,[168] the United Nations and the Commonwealth.[169][170] While Singapore is not a formal member of the G20, it has been invited to participate in G20 processes in most years since 2010.[171] Singapore is also the location of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) Secretariat.[172]\n\n\nIn general, bilateral relations with other ASEAN members are strong; however, disagreements have arisen,[173] and relations with neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia have sometimes been strained.[174] Malaysia and Singapore have clashed over the delivery of fresh water to Singapore,[175] and access by the Singapore Armed Forces to Malaysian airspace.[174] Border issues exist with Malaysia and Indonesia, and both have banned the sale of marine sand to Singapore over disputes about Singapore's land reclamation.[176] Some previous disputes, such as the Pedra Branca dispute, have been resolved by the International Court of Justice.[177] Piracy in the Strait of Malacca has been a cause of concern for all three countries.[175] Close economic ties exist with Brunei, and the two share a pegged currency value, through a Currency Interchangeability Agreement between the two countries which makes both Brunei dollar and Singapore dollar banknotes and coins legal tender in either country.[178][179]\n\n\nThe first diplomatic contact with China was made in the 1970s, with full diplomatic relations established in the 1990s. China has been Singapore's largest trading partner since 2013, after surpassing Malaysia.[180][181][182][183][184] Singapore and the United States share a long-standing close relationship, in particular in defence, the economy, health, and education. Singapore has also increased co-operation with ASEAN members and China to strengthen regional security and fight terrorism, and participated in ASEAN's first joint maritime exercise with China in 2018.[185] It has also given support to the US-led coalition to fight terrorism, with bilateral co-operation in counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation initiatives, and joint military exercises.[173]\n\n\nAs Singapore has diplomatic relations with both the United States and North Korea, and was one of the few countries that have relationships with both countries,[186] in June 2018, it hosted a historic summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the first-ever meeting between the sitting leaders of the two nations.[187][188] It also hosted the Ma\u2013Xi meeting in 2015, the first meeting between the political leaders of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1950.[189][190][191]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Singapore Armed Forces\n\n![](image)In 2007, military personnel from the Singapore Armed Forces were deployed in Afghanistan as part of a multinational coalition.\nThe Singaporean military, arguably the most technologically advanced in Southeast Asia,[192] consists of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Digital and Intelligence Service. It is seen as the guarantor of the country's independence,[193] translating into Singapore culture, involving all citizens in the country's defence.[194] The government spends 4.9% of the country's GDP on the military\u2014high by regional standards[192]\u2014and one out of every four dollars of government spending is spent on defence.[195]\n\n\nAfter its independence, Singapore had only two infantry regiments commanded by British officers. Considered too small to provide effective security for the new country, the development of its military forces became a priority.[196] In addition, in October 1971, Britain pulled its military out of Singapore, leaving behind only a small British, Australian and New Zealand force as a token military presence.[197] A great deal of initial support came from Israel,[196] a country unrecognised by Singapore's neighbouring Muslim-majority nations of Malaysia and Indonesia.[198][199][200] The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commanders were tasked by the Singapore Government to create the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) from scratch, and Israeli instructors were brought in to train Singaporean soldiers. Military courses were conducted according to the IDF's format, and Singapore adopted a system of conscription and reserve service based on the Israeli model.[196] Singapore still maintains strong security ties with Israel and is one of the biggest buyers of Israeli arms and weapons systems,[201] with one recent example being the MATADOR anti-tank weapon.[202]\n\n\nThe SAF is being developed to respond to a wide range of issues in both conventional and unconventional warfare. The Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) is responsible for procuring resources for the military.[203] The geographic restrictions of Singapore mean that the SAF must plan to fully repulse an attack, as they cannot fall back and re-group. The small size of the population has also affected the way the SAF has been designed, with a small active force and a large number of reserves.[194]\n\n\n\n![](image)Republic of Singapore Air Force Black Knights perform at the Singapore Air Show.\nSingapore has conscription for all able-bodied males at age 18, except those with a criminal record or who can prove that their loss would bring hardship to their families. Males who have yet to complete pre-university education, are awarded the Public Service Commission (PSC) scholarship, or are pursuing a local medical degree can opt to defer their draft.[204][205] Though not required to perform military service, the number of women in the SAF has been increasing: since 1989 they have been allowed to fill military vocations formerly reserved for men. Before induction into a specific branch of the armed forces, recruits undergo at least nine weeks of basic military training.[206]\n\n\nBecause of the scarcity of open land on the main island, training involving activities such as live firing and amphibious warfare are often carried out on smaller islands, typically barred to civilian access. However, large-scale drills, considered too dangerous to be performed in the country, have been performed in other countries such as Brunei, Indonesia, Thailand and the United States. In general, military exercises are held with foreign forces once or twice per week.[194] Due to airspace and land constraints, the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) maintains a number of overseas bases in Australia, the United States, and France. The RSAF's 130 Squadron is based in RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia,[207] and its 126 Squadron is based in the Oakey Army Aviation Centre, Queensland.[208] The RSAF has one squadron\u2014the 150 Squadron\u2014based in Cazaux Air Base in southern France.[209] The RSAF's overseas detachments in the United States are: Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, Marana in Arizona, Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, and Andersen Air Force Base in Guam.[210][211][212]\n\n\nThe SAF has sent forces to assist in operations outside the country, in areas such as Iraq,[213] and Afghanistan,[214][215] in both military and civilian roles. In the region, they have helped to stabilise East Timor and have provided aid to Aceh in Indonesia following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Since 2009, the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) has deployed ships to the Gulf of Aden to aid in countering piracy efforts as part of Task Force 151.[216] The SAF also helped in relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina,[217] and Typhoon Haiyan.[218] Singapore is part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), a military alliance with Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.[194] In 2023, Singapore was ranked the 6th most peaceful country on the Global Peace Index.[219]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human rights in Singapore\n\nSee also: Abortion in Singapore, Capital punishment in Singapore, and LGBT rights in Singapore\n\nCapital punishment is a legal and enforced penalty in Singapore. The country is one of four in the developed world to retain the death penalty, along with the United States, Japan and Taiwan. Particularly, its use against drug trafficking has been a source of contention with various non-governmental organisations[*who?*], regarded by some as a victimless crime.[*citation needed*] The government has responded that it has \"no doubts\" that it is the right policy and that there is \"clear evidence\" of serious deterrence, and that the law should be looked at upon in the wider context of \"saving lives\", particularly citizens.[220] In 2004, Amnesty International claimed that some legal provisions of the Singapore system for the death penalty conflict with \"the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty\".[221] The government has disputed Amnesty's claims, stating that their \"position on abolition of the death penalty is by no means uncontested internationally\" and that the report contains \"grave errors of facts and misrepresentations\".[222]\n\n\nFrom 1938 to 2022, sexual relations between men were technically illegal under Section 377A of the Penal Code, first introduced during British colonial rule.[223] During the last few decades, the law was unenforced and pressure to repeal this law increased as homosexuality became more understood.[224] Meanwhile, sexual relations between women had always been legal.[225] In 2022, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that Singapore would scrap 377A for good, effectively decriminalising homosexual behaviour. Nevertheless, he added that the repeal will not affect the recognition of \"traditional familial and societal norms\", including how marriage is defined\u2014putting the legalisation of same-sex marriage on the back-burner at least for now, although the possibility of civil unions was not officially ruled out.[226] He added this was a compromise between the conservative (and often religious) and progressive elements of Singaporean society to prevent fracturing it.[227]\n\n\nPink Dot SG, an event held in support of the LGBT community, has drawn thousands of people annually since 2009 with increasing attendance.[228] According to a survey conducted by the Institute of Policy Studies in 2019, Singaporean society has become more liberal on LGBT rights. In the survey, more than 20% of people said that sexual relations between adults of the same sex were not wrong at all or not wrong most of the time, up from 10% in 2013. The survey found that 27% felt the same way about same-sex marriage (an increase from 15% in 2013) and 30% did so about same-sex couples adopting a child (an increase from 24% in 2013).[229][230] In 2021, 6 Singaporeans protested for improved trans protections in the educational system outside the Ministry of Education headquarters at Buona Vista.[231]\n\n\nPimps often traffic women from neighbouring countries such as China, Malaysia and Vietnam at their brothels as well as rented apartments and hostels for higher profit margins when they get a cut from customers.[232][233] In response, amendments were made to the Women's Charter by the government in 2019 to legislate more serious punishments for traffickers, including imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine of S$100,000.[234]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Singapore\n\n![](image)Skyline of Singapore's Downtown Core\nSingapore has a highly developed market economy, based historically on extended entrep\u00f4t trade. Along with Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan, Singapore is one of the Four Asian Tigers, and has surpassed its peers in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. Between 1965 and 1995, growth rates averaged around 6 per cent per annum, transforming the living standards of the population.[235]\n\n\nThe Singaporean economy is regarded as free,[236] innovative,[237]\ndynamic[238] and business-friendly.[239] For several years, Singapore has been one of the few[240] countries with an AAA credit rating from the big three, and the only Asian country to achieve this rating.[241] Singapore attracts a large amount of foreign investment as a result of its location, skilled workforce, low tax rates, advanced infrastructure and zero-tolerance against corruption.[242] It was the world's 4th most competitive economy in 2023, according to the International Institute for Management Development's World Competitiveness Ranking of 64 countries,[243] with the highest GDP (PPP) per capita.[244][245][246] Roughly 44 percent of the Singaporean workforce is made up of non-Singaporeans.[247] Despite market freedom, Singapore's government operations have a significant stake in the economy, contributing 22% of the GDP.[248] The city is a popular location for conferences and events.[249]\n\n\n\n![Singapore Airlines celebrated the nation's Golden Jubilee with a flag livery on its Airbus A380](image)Singapore Airlines, the country's flag carrier, celebrated the nation's 2015 Golden Jubilee with a flag livery on its Airbus A380.\nThe currency of Singapore is the Singapore dollar (SGD or S$), issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).[250] It has been interchangeable with the Brunei dollar at par value since 1967.[251] MAS manages its monetary policy by allowing the Singapore dollar exchange rate to rise or fall within an undisclosed trading band. This is different from most central banks, which use interest rates to manage policy.[252] Singapore has the world's eleventh largest foreign reserves,[253] and one of the highest net international investment position per capita.[254][255]\n\n\nSingapore has been identified as a tax haven[256] for the wealthy due to its low tax rates on personal income and tax exemptions on foreign-based income and capital gains. Individuals such as Australian millionaire retailer Brett Blundy and multi-billionaire Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin are two examples of wealthy individuals who have settled in Singapore.[257] In 2009, Singapore was removed from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \"liste grise\" of tax havens,[258] and ranked fourth on the Tax Justice Network's 2015 Financial Secrecy Index of the world's off-shore financial service providers, banking one-eighth of the world's offshore capital, while \"providing numerous tax avoidance and evasion opportunities\".[259] In August 2016, *The Straits Times* reported that Indonesia had decided to create tax havens on two islands near Singapore to bring Indonesian capital back into the tax base.[260] In October 2016, the Monetary Authority of Singapore admonished and fined UBS and DBS and withdrew Falcon Private Bank's banking licence for their alleged role in the Malaysian Sovereign Fund scandal.[261][262]\n\n\nIn 2016, Singapore was rated the world's most expensive city for the third consecutive year by the Economist Intelligence Unit,[263][264] and this remained true in 2018.[265] The government provides numerous assistance programmes to the homeless and needy through the Ministry of Social and Family Development, so acute poverty is rare. Some of the programmes include providing financial assistance to needy households, providing free medical care at government hospitals, and paying for children's tuition.[266][267][268] Other benefits include compensation for gym fees to encourage citizens to exercise,[269] up to S$166,000 as a baby bonus for each citizen,[270] heavily subsidised healthcare, financial aid for the disabled, the provision of reduced-cost laptops for poor students,[271] rebates for costs such as public transport[272] and utility bills, and more.[273][274] As of 2018 Singapore's ranking in the Human Development Index is 9th in the world, with an HDI value of 0.935.[275]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Singapore\n\nSee also: Land reclamation in Singapore\n\n![Map showing Singapore island and the territories belonging to Singapore and its neighbours](image)An outline of Singapore and the surrounding islands and waterways\nSingapore consists of 63 islands, including the main island, Pulau Ujong.[276] There are two man-made connections to Johor, Malaysia: the Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway in the north and the Tuas Second Link in the west. Jurong Island, Pulau Tekong, Pulau Ubin and Sentosa are the largest of Singapore's smaller islands. The highest natural point is Bukit Timah Hill at 163.63\u00a0m (537\u00a0ft).[277] Under British rule, Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands were part of Singapore, and both were transferred to Australia in 1957.[278][279][280] Pedra Branca is the nation's easternmost point.[281]\n\n\nLand reclamation projects have increased Singapore's land area from 580\u00a0km2 (220\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the 1960s to 710\u00a0km2 (270\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) by 2015, an increase of some 22% (130\u00a0km2).[282] The country is projected to reclaim another 56\u00a0km2 (20\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[283] Some projects involve merging smaller islands through land reclamation to form larger, more functional and habitable islands, as has been done with Jurong Island.[284] The type of sand used in reclamation is found in rivers and beaches, rather than deserts, and is in great demand worldwide. In 2010 Singapore imported almost 15 million tons of sand for its projects, the demand being such that Indonesia, Malaysia, and Vietnam have all restricted or barred the export of sand to Singapore in recent years. As a result, in 2016 Singapore switched to using polders for reclamation, in which an area is enclosed and then pumped dry.[285]\n\n\n\n### Nature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Singapore\n\n![](image)Singapore Botanic Gardens is a UNESCO World Heritage Site \u2013 one of three gardens in the world, and the only tropical garden, to be recognised as such.\nSingapore's urbanisation means that it has lost 95% of its historical forests,[286] and now over half of the naturally occurring fauna and flora in Singapore is present in nature reserves, such as the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, which comprise only 0.25% of Singapore's land area.[286] In 1967, to combat this decline in natural space, the government introduced the vision of making Singapore a \"garden city\",[287] aiming to improve quality of life.[288] Since then, nearly 10% of Singapore's land has been set aside for parks and nature reserves.[289] The government has created plans to preserve the country's remaining wildlife.[290] Singapore's well known gardens include the Singapore Botanic Gardens, a 161-year-old tropical garden and Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site.[291]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSingapore has a tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen: *Af*) with no distinctive seasons, uniform temperature and pressure, high humidity, and abundant rainfall.[292][293] Temperatures usually range from 23 to 32\u00a0\u00b0C (73 to 90\u00a0\u00b0F). While temperature does not vary greatly throughout the year, there is a wetter monsoon season from November to February.[294]\n\n\nFrom July to October, there is often haze caused by bush fires in neighbouring Indonesia, usually from the island of Sumatra.[295] Singapore follows the GMT+8 time zone, one hour ahead of the typical zone for its geographical location.[296] This causes the sun to rise and set particularly late during February, where the sun rises at 7:15\u00a0am and sets around 7:20\u00a0pm. During July, the sun sets at around 7:15\u00a0pm. The earliest the sun rises and sets is in late October and early November when the sun rises at 6:46\u00a0am and sets at 6:50\u00a0pm.[297]\n\n\nSingapore recognises that climate change and rising sea levels in the decades ahead will have major implications for its low-lying coastline. It estimates that the nation will need to spend $100 billion over the course of the next century to address the issue. In its 2020 budget, the government set aside an initial $5 billion towards a Coastline and Flood Protection Fund.[298][299] Singapore is the first country in Southeast Asia to levy a carbon tax on its largest carbon-emitting corporations producing more than 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, at $5 per ton.[300]\n\n\nTo reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, it has ramped up deployment of solar panels on rooftops and vertical surfaces of buildings, and other initiatives like building one of the world's largest floating solar farms at Tengeh Reservoir in Tuas.[301]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Singapore (1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1929\u20131941 and 1948\u2013present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 36.5(97.7)\n | 35.0(95.0)\n | 34.0(93.2)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 33.8(92.8)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 31.5(88.7)\n | 32.2(90.0)\n | 32.4(90.3)\n | 32.3(90.1)\n | 31.9(89.4)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 31.2(88.2)\n | 30.5(86.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 27.9(82.2)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 24.6(76.3)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 24.6(76.3)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 221.6(8.72)\n | 105.1(4.14)\n | 151.7(5.97)\n | 164.3(6.47)\n | 164.3(6.47)\n | 135.3(5.33)\n | 146.6(5.77)\n | 146.9(5.78)\n | 124.9(4.92)\n | 168.3(6.63)\n | 252.3(9.93)\n | 331.9(13.07)\n | 2,113.2(83.20)\n |\n| Average rainy days (\u2265 0.2 mm) | 13\n | 9\n | 12\n | 15\n | 15\n | 13\n | 14\n | 14\n | 13\n | 15\n | 19\n | 19\n | 171\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 83.5\n | 81.2\n | 81.7\n | 82.6\n | 82.3\n | 80.9\n | 80.9\n | 80.7\n | 80.7\n | 81.5\n | 84.9\n | 85.5\n | 82.2\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 180.4\n | 198.6\n | 196.6\n | 182.4\n | 184.8\n | 175.4\n | 188.5\n | 184.6\n | 161.4\n | 155.0\n | 133.2\n | 133.1\n | 2,074\n |\n| Source 1: National Environment Agency[302][303] |\n| Source 2: NOAA (sun only, 1991\u20132020)[304] |\n\n### Water supply[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water supply and sanitation in Singapore\n\nSingapore considers water a national security issue and the government has sought to emphasise conservation.[305] Water access is universal and of high quality, though the country is projected to face significant water-stress by 2040.[306][307] To circumvent this, the Public Utilities Board has implemented the \"four national taps\" strategy \u2013 water imported from neighbouring Malaysia, urban rainwater catchments, reclaimed water (NEWater) and seawater desalination.[308] Singapore's approach does not rely only on physical infrastructure; it also emphasises proper legislation and enforcement, water pricing, public education as well as research and development.[309] Singapore has declared that it will be water self-sufficient by the time its 1961 long-term water supply agreement with Malaysia expires in 2061. However, according to official forecasts, water demand in Singapore is expected to double from 380 to 760 million US gallons (1.4 to 2.8 billion litres; 1.4 to 2.8 million cubic meters) per day between 2010 and 2060. The increase is expected to come primarily from non-domestic water use, which accounted for 55% of water demand in 2010 and is expected to account for 70% of demand in 2060. By that time, water demand is expected to be met by reclaimed water at the tune of 50% and by desalination accounting for 30%, compared to only 20% supplied by internal catchments.[310][311]\n\n\nSingapore is expanding its recycling system and intends to spend $7.4 billion (S$10 billion) in water treatment infrastructure upgrades.[312] The Ulu Pandan wastewater treatment was specially built to test advanced used-water treatment processes before full deployment and won the *Water/Wastewater Project of the Year Award* at the 2018 Global Water Awards in Paris, France.[313] Operation started in 2017 and was jointly developed by PUB and the Black & Veatch + AECOM Joint Venture.[314]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n### Land[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Singapore\n\n![](image)Entrance to Toa Payoh MRT station\n![](image)Double-deck bus operated by SBS Transit\nSingapore has a road system covering 3,356 kilometres (2,085\u00a0mi), which includes 161 kilometres (100\u00a0mi) of expressways.[315][316] The Singapore Area Licensing Scheme, implemented in 1975, became the world's first congestion pricing scheme, and included other complementary measures such as stringent car ownership quotas and improvements in mass transit.[317][318] Upgraded in 1998 and renamed Electronic Road Pricing (ERP), the system introduced electronic toll collection, electronic detection, and video surveillance technology.[319] A satellite-based system was due to replace the physical gantries by 2020, but has been delayed until 2026 due to global shortages in the supply of semiconductors.[320] As Singapore is a small island with a high population density, the number of private cars on the road is restricted with a pre-set car population quota, to curb pollution and congestion. Car buyers must pay for Additional Registration Fees (ARF) duties of either 100%, 140%, 180% or 220% of the vehicle's Open Market Value (OMV), and bid for a Singaporean Certificate of Entitlement (COE) (that varies twice a month in supply based on the number of car registrations and de-registrations), which allows the car to be driven on the road for maximum period of 10 years. Car prices are generally significantly higher in Singapore than in other English-speaking countries.[321] As with most Commonwealth countries, vehicles on the road and people walking on the streets keep to the left (left-hand traffic).[322]\n\n\nSingapore's public transport network is shaped up with trains (consisting of the MRT and LRT systems), buses and taxis. There are currently six MRT lines (North South MRT line, East West MRT line, North East MRT line, Circle MRT line, Downtown MRT line and Thomson-East Coast MRT line), three LRT lines serving the neighbourhoods of Bukit Panjang and Choa Chu Kang (Bukit Panjang LRT line), Sengkang (Sengkang LRT line) and Punggol (Punggol LRT line),[323] and more than 300 bus routes in operation.[324] Taxis are a popular form of transport as the fares are relatively affordable when compared to many other developed countries, whilst cars in Singapore are the most expensive to own worldwide.[325]\n\n\nThe Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway (connecting Singapore with Johor Bahru, Malaysia) is the busiest international land border crossing in the world, whereby approximately 350,000 travellers cross the border checkpoints of both Woodlands Checkpoint and Sultan Iskandar Building daily (with an annual total of 128 million travellers).[326]\n\n\nThe Land Transport Authority (LTA) is responsible for all land transport-related infrastructure and operations in Singapore.\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rain Vortex at Jewel Changi Airport\nSingapore is a major international transport hub in Asia, serving some of the busiest sea and air trade routes. Changi Airport is an aviation centre for Southeast Asia and a stopover on Qantas' Kangaroo Route between Sydney and London.[327] There are two civilian airports in Singapore, Singapore Changi Airport and Seletar Airport.[328][329] Singapore Changi Airport hosts a network of over 100 airlines connecting Singapore to some 300 cities in about 70 countries and territories worldwide.[330] It has been rated one of the best international airports by international travel magazines, including being rated as the world's best airport for the first time in 2006 by Skytrax.[331] Singapore Changi Airport also had the second- and third-busiest international air routes in the world; the Jakarta-Singapore airport pair had 4.8 million passengers carried in 2018, whilst the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur airport pair had 4.5 million passengers carried in 2018, both trailing only behind Hong Kong-Taipei (6.5 million).\n\n\nSingapore Airlines, which is the flag carrier of Singapore,[332] has been regarded as a 5-star airline by Skytrax[333] and been in the world top 10 list of airlines for multiple consecutive years.[334] Changi Airport had also been rated as the world's best airport from 2013 to 2020 before being superseded by Hamad International Airport in Doha;[335] it reclaimed this title in 2023.[336]\n\n\n\n### Sea[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of Singapore, managed by port operators PSA International and Jurong Port, was the world's second-busiest port in 2019 in terms of shipping tonnage handled, at 2.85\u00a0billion gross tons (GT), and in terms of containerised traffic, at 37.2\u00a0million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).[337] It is also the world's second-busiest, behind Shanghai, in terms of cargo tonnage with 626\u00a0million tons handled. In addition, the port is the world's busiest for transshipment traffic and the world's biggest ship refuelling centre.[338]\n\n\n\n## Industry sectors[edit]\n\n\nSingapore is the world's 3rd-largest foreign exchange centre, 6th-largest financial centre,[339] 2nd-largest casino gambling market,[340] 3rd-largest oil-refining and trading centre, largest oil-rig producer and hub for ship repair services,[341][342][343] and largest logistics hub.[344] The economy is diversified, with its top contributors being financial services, manufacturing, and oil-refining. Its main exports are refined petroleum, integrated circuits, and computers,[345] which constituted 27% of the country's GDP in 2010. Other significant sectors include electronics, chemicals, mechanical engineering, and biomedical sciences. Singapore was ranked 5th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023 and 7th in 2022.[346][347][348][349] In 2019, there were more than 60 semiconductor companies in Singapore, which together constituted 11% of the global market share. The semiconductor industry alone contributes around 7% of Singapore's GDP.[350]\n\n\nSingapore's largest companies are in the telecommunications, banking, transportation, and manufacturing sectors, many of which started as state-run statutory corporations and have since been publicly listed on the Singapore Exchange. Such companies include Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel), Singapore Technologies Engineering, Keppel Corporation, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), Development Bank of Singapore (DBS), and United Overseas Bank (UOB). In 2011, amidst the global financial crisis, OCBC, DBS and UOB were ranked by *Bloomberg Businessweek* as the world's 1st, 5th, and 6th strongest banks in the world, respectively.[351] It is home to the headquarters of 3 *Fortune* Global 500 companies, the highest in the region.[352]\n\n\nThe nation's best known global companies include Singapore Airlines, Changi Airport, and the Port of Singapore, all of which are among the most-awarded in their respective fields. Singapore Airlines was ranked as Asia's most-admired company, and the world's 19th most-admired company in 2015 by *Fortune*'s annual \"50 most admired companies in the world\" industry surveys. Other awards it has received include the US-based *Travel + Leisure*'s Best International Airline award, which it has won for 20 consecutive years.[353][354] Changi Airport connects over 100 airlines to more than 300 cities. The strategic international air hub has more than 480 World's Best Airport awards as of 2015[update], and is known as the most-awarded airport in the world.[355] Over ten free-trade agreements have been signed with other countries and regions.[173] Singapore is the second-largest foreign investor in India.[356] It is the 14th largest exporter and the 15th largest importer in the world.[357][358]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Singapore\n\n![](image)The Merlion, the official mascot of Singapore\nTourism is a major industry and contributor to the Singaporean economy, attracting 18.5 million international tourists in 2018, more than three times Singapore's total population.[359] Singapore is the 5th most visited city in the world, and 2nd in the Asia-Pacific.[360] In 2019 tourism contributed directly to about 4% of Singapore's GDP,[361] down from 2016, when tourism contributed, directly and indirectly, to around 9.9% of Singapore's GDP.[362] Altogether, the sector generated approximately 8.6% of Singapore's employment in 2016.[362]\n\n\nIn 2015, Lonely Planet and *The New York Times* listed Singapore as their top and 6th-best world destinations to visit, respectively.[363] Well-known landmarks include the Merlion,[364] the Esplanade,[365] Marina Bay Sands,[366] Gardens by the Bay,[367] Jewel Changi Airport,[368] CHIJMES,[365] National Gallery Singapore,[365] the Singapore Flyer,[365] the Orchard Road shopping belt,[369] the resort island of Sentosa,[370] and the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Singapore's first UNESCO World Heritage Site.[371]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Victoria Theatre\nThe Singapore Tourism Board (STB) is the statutory board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry which is tasked with the promotion of the country's tourism industry. In August 2017 the STB and the Economic Development Board (EDB) unveiled a unified brand, Singapore \u2013 Passion Made Possible, to market Singapore internationally for tourism and business purposes.[372] The Orchard Road district, which contains multi-storey shopping centres and hotels, can be considered the centre of shopping and tourism in Singapore.[369] Other popular tourist attractions include the Singapore Zoo, River Wonders, Bird Paradise and Night Safari. The Singapore Zoo has embraced the open zoo concept whereby animals are kept in enclosures, separated from visitors by hidden dry or wet moats, instead of caging the animals, and the River Wonders has 300 species of animals, including numerous endangered species.[373] Singapore promotes itself as a medical tourism hub, with about 200,000 foreigners seeking medical care there each year. Singapore medical services aim to serve at least one million foreign patients annually and generate US$3\u00a0billion in revenue.[374]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Singapore and Singaporeans\n\nSee also: Race in Singapore\n\n![](image)Chinese (East Asian), Malay (Southeast Asian), and Indian (South Asian) women in Singapore, c.\u20091890. To promote racial harmony among the three races, a unique Racial Harmony Day is celebrated on 21 July every year.\nAs of mid-2023, the estimated population of Singapore was 5,917,600 people, 3,610,700 (61.6%) of whom were citizens, while the remaining 2,306,900 (38.4%) were permanent residents (522,300) or international students, foreign workers, or dependants (1,644,500).[6] According to the country's 2010 census, nearly 23% of Singaporean residents (i.e. citizens and permanent residents) were foreign born; if non-residents were counted, nearly 43% of the total population were foreign born.[375][376]\n\n\nThe same census also reports that about 74.1% of residents were of Chinese descent, 13.4% of Malay descent, 9.2% of Indian descent, and 3.3% of other (including Eurasian) descent.[375] Prior to 2010, each person could register as a member of only one race, by default that of his or her father; therefore mixed-race persons were solely grouped under their father's race in government censuses. From 2010 onward, people may register using a multi-racial classification, in which they may choose one primary race and one secondary race, but no more than two.[377]\n\n\nThe median age of Singaporean residents was 40.5 in 2017,[378] and the total fertility rate is estimated to be 0.80 children per woman in 2014, the lowest in the world and well below the 2.1 needed to replace the population.[379] The government has attempted to increase fertility with limited success, as well as adjusting immigration policy to maintain its working-age population.[380][381]\n\n\n91% of resident households (i.e. households headed by a Singapore citizen or permanent resident) own the homes they live in, and the average household size is 3.43 persons (which include dependants who are neither citizens nor permanent residents).[382][383] However, due to scarcity of land, 78.7% of resident households live in subsidised, high-rise, public housing apartments developed by the Housing and Development Board (HDB). Also, 75.9% of resident households live in properties that are equal to, or larger than, a four-room (i.e. three bedrooms plus one living room) HDB flat or in private housing.[384][385] Live-in foreign domestic workers are quite common in Singapore, with about 224,500 foreign domestic workers there, as of December 2013.[386]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest towns and planning areas in SingaporeSingapore Department of Statistics population report for June 2023\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region |  Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Bedok](image)Bedok![Tampines](image)Tampines | 1 | Bedok | East | 279,510 | 11 | Ang Mo Kio | North-East | 161,180\n | ![Jurong West](image)Jurong West![Sengkang](image)Sengkang |\n| 2 | Tampines | East | 274,360 | 12 | Bukit Merah | Central | 149,530\n |\n| 3 | Jurong West | West | 259,740 | 13 | Pasir Ris | East | 146,930\n |\n| 4 | Sengkang | North-East | 257,190 | 14 | Bukit Panjang | West | 138,940\n |\n| 5 | Woodlands | North | 255,390 | 15 | Toa Payoh | Central | 134,610\n |\n| 6 | Hougang | North-East | 227,610 | 16 | Serangoon | North-East | 118,780\n |\n| 7 | Yishun | North | 228,910 | 17 | Geylang | Central | 114,750\n |\n| 8 | Choa Chu Kang | West | 191,480 | 18 | Sembawang | North | 109,120\n |\n| 9 | Punggol | North-East | 194,750 | 19 | Kallang | Central | 100,870\n |\n| 10 | Bukit Batok | West | 168,560 | 20 | Queenstown | Central | 99,690\n |\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Singapore\n\nMost major religious denominations are present in Singapore, with the Inter-Religious Organisation, Singapore (IRO) recognising 10 major religions in the city state.[387] A 2014 analysis by the Pew Research Center found Singapore to be the world's most religiously diverse nation.[388]\n\n| Religion in Singapore, 2020[4] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Buddhism |  | 31.1% |\n| No religion |  | 20.0% |\n| Christianity |  | 18.9% |\n| Islam |  | 15.6% |\n| Taoism and folk religion |  | 8.8% |\n| Hinduism |  | 5.0% |\n| Other religions |  | 0.6% |\n\nBuddhism is the most widely practised religion in Singapore: 31% of the resident population declared themselves adherents at the most recent census. The next-most practised religion is Christianity, followed by Islam, Taoism, and Hinduism. 20% of the population did not have a religious affiliation. The proportion of Christians, Taoists, and non-religious people increased between 2000 and 2010 by about 3 percentage points each, while the proportion of Buddhists decreased. Other faiths remained largely stable in their share of the population.[389]\n\n\nThere are monasteries and Dharma centres from all three major traditions of Buddhism in Singapore: Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. Most Buddhists in Singapore are Chinese and are of the Mahayana tradition,[390] missionaries having come into the country from China for several decades. However, Thailand's Theravada Buddhism has seen growing popularity among the populace (not only the Chinese) during the past decade. The religion of Soka Gakkai International, a Japanese Buddhist organisation, is practised by many people in Singapore, and mostly by those of Chinese descent. Tibetan Buddhism has also made slow inroads into the country in recent years.[391]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Singapore\n\nSingapore has four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil.[392]\n\n\n\n| Language used most frequently at home[4] |\n| --- |\n| Language |  | Percent |\n| English |  | 48.3% |\n| Mandarin |  | 29.9% |\n| Malay |  | 9.2% |\n| Other Sinitic languages |  | 8.7% |\n| Tamil |  | 2.5% |\n| Others |  | 1.4% |\n\nEnglish is the lingua franca[393][394][395][396] and the main language used in business, government, law and education.[397][398] The Constitution of Singapore and all government legislation is written in English, and interpreters are required if a language other than English is used in the Singaporean courts.[399][400] Statutory corporations conduct their businesses in English, while any official documents written in a non-English official language such as Malay, Mandarin, or Tamil are typically translated into English to be accepted for use.[401][394][402]\n\n\nMalay was designated as a national language by the Singaporean government after independence from Britain in the 1960s to avoid friction with Singapore's Malay-speaking neighbours of Malaysia and Indonesia.[161] It has a symbolic, rather than functional purpose.[392][403][404] It is used in the national anthem *Majulah Singapura*,[405] in citations of Singaporean orders and decorations and in military commands.[406][407] Singaporean Malay is officially written in the Latin-based Rumi script, though some Singaporean Malays also learn the Arabic-based Jawi script.[408] Jawi is considered an ethnic script for use on Singaporean identity cards.[409]\n\n\nSingaporeans are mostly bilingual, typically with English as their common language and their mother-tongue as a second language taught in schools, in order to preserve each individual's ethnic identity and values. According to the 2020 census, English was the language most spoken at home, used by 48.3% of the population; Mandarin was next, spoken at home by 29.9%.[407][410] Nearly half a million speak other ancestral Southern varieties of Chinese, mainly Hokkien, Teochew, and Cantonese, as their home language, although the use of these is declining in favour of Mandarin or just English.[411] Singapore Chinese characters are written using simplified Chinese characters.[412]\n\n\nSingaporean English is largely based on British English, owing to the country's status as a former crown colony.[413][414] However, forms of English spoken in Singapore range from Standard Singapore English to a colloquial form known as Singlish, which is discouraged by the government as it claims it to be a substandard English creole that handicaps Singaporeans, presenting an obstacle to learning standard English and rendering the speaker incomprehensible to everyone except to another Singlish speaker.[415] Standard Singapore English is fully understandable to all Standard English speakers, while most English-speaking people do not understand Singlish. Nevertheless, Singaporeans have a strong sense of identity and connection to Singlish, whereby the existence of Singlish is recognised as a distinctive cultural marker for many Singaporeans.[416] As such, in recent times, the government has tolerated the diglossia of both Singlish and Standard English (only for those who are fluent in both), whilst continuously reinforcing the importance of Standard English amongst those who speak only Singlish (which is not mutually intelligible with the Standard English of other English-speaking countries).[416]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Singapore\n\n![](image)National University of Singapore is one of six autonomous universities in the city-state.\nEducation for primary, secondary, and tertiary levels is mostly supported by the state. All institutions, public and private, must be registered with the Ministry of Education (MOE).[417] English is the language of instruction in all public schools,[418] and all subjects are taught and examined in English except for the \"mother tongue\" language paper.[419] While the term \"mother tongue\" in general refers to the first language internationally, in Singapore's education system, it is used to refer to the second language, as English is the first language.[420][421] Students who have been abroad for a while, or who struggle with their \"Mother Tongue\" language, are allowed to take a simpler syllabus or drop the subject.[422][423]\n\n\nEducation takes place in three stages: primary, secondary, and pre-university education, with the primary education being compulsory. Students begin with six years of primary school, which is made up of a four-year foundation course and a two-year orientation stage. The curriculum is focused on the development of English, the mother tongue, mathematics, and science.[424][425] Secondary school lasts from four to five years, and is divided between Express, Normal (Academic), and Normal (Technical) streams in each school, depending on a student's ability level.[426] The basic coursework breakdown is the same as in the primary level, although classes are much more specialised.[427] Pre-university education takes place at either the 21 Junior Colleges or the Millennia Institute, over a period of two and three years respectively.[428] As alternatives to pre-university education, however, courses are offered in other post-secondary education institutions, including the 5 polytechnics and 3 ITE colleges. Singapore has six public universities,[429] of which the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University are among the top 20 universities in the world.[430]\n\n\nNational examinations are standardised across all schools, with a test taken after each stage. After the first six years of education, students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE),[424] which determines their placement at secondary school. At the end of the secondary stage, O-Level or N-Level exams are taken;[431] at the end of the following pre-university stage, the GCE A-Level exams are taken.[432] Some schools have a degree of freedom in their curriculum and are known as autonomous schools, for secondary education level and above.[426]\n\n\nSingapore is also an education hub, with more than 80,000 international students in 2006.[433] 5,000 Malaysian students cross the Johor\u2013Singapore Causeway daily to attend schools in Singapore.[434] In 2009, 20% of all students in Singaporean universities were international students\u2014the maximum cap allowed, a majority from ASEAN, China and India.[435]\n\n\nSingapore students have excelled in many of the world education benchmarks in maths, science and reading. In 2015, both its primary and secondary students rank first in OECD's global school performance rankings across 76 countries\u2014described as the most comprehensive map of education standards.[436][437] In 2016, Singapore students topped both the Program International Student Assessment (PISA)[438][439][440][441] and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).[442][443][444] In the 2016 EF English Proficiency Index taken in 72 countries, Singapore place 6th and has been the only Asian country in the top ten.[445][446][447][448]\n\n\n\n## Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Singapore\n\n![](image)National University Hospital is the second largest hospital in the city, serving one million patients yearly.\nSingapore has a generally efficient healthcare system, even though health expenditures are relatively low for developed countries.[449] The World Health Organisation ranks Singapore's healthcare system as 6th overall in the world in its World Health Report.[450] Singapore has had the lowest infant mortality rates in the world for the past two decades.[451] In 2019, Singaporeans had the longest life expectancy of any country at 84.8 years. Women can expect to live an average of 87.6 years with 75.8 years in good health. The averages are lower for men.[452] Singapore is ranked 1st on the Global Food Security Index.[453]\n\n\nAs of December 2011 and January 2013, 8,800 foreigners and 5,400 Singaporeans were respectively diagnosed with HIV,[454] but there are fewer than 10 annual deaths from HIV per 100,000 people. Adult obesity is below 10%.[455]There is a high level of immunisation.[456] In 2013, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Singapore as having the best quality of life in Asia and sixth overall in the world.[457]\n\n\nThe government's healthcare system is based upon the \"3M\" framework. This has three components: Medifund, which provides a safety net for those not able to otherwise afford healthcare; Medisave, a compulsory national medical savings account system covering about 85% of the population; and Medishield, a government-funded health insurance program. Public hospitals in Singapore have a considerable autonomy in their management decisions, and notionally compete for patients, but remain in government ownership.[458] A subsidy scheme exists for those on low income.[459] In 2008, 32% of healthcare was funded by the government. Healthcare accounts for approximately 3.5% of Singapore's GDP.[460]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Singapore\n\n![](image)Ornate details on top of Sri Mariamman Temple in Chinatown district, Singapore's oldest Hindu temple since 1827.\nDespite its small size, Singapore has a diversity of languages, religions, and cultures.[461] Former prime ministers of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, have stated that Singapore does not fit the traditional description of a nation, calling it a society-in-transition, pointing out the fact that Singaporeans do not all speak the same language, share the same religion, or have the same customs.[461][462] Singaporeans who speak English as their native language would likely lean toward Western culture (along with either Christian culture or secularism),[463] while those who speak Chinese as their native language mostly lean toward Chinese culture, which has linkages with Chinese folk religion, Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. Malay-speaking Singaporeans mostly lean toward Malay culture, which itself is closely linked to Islamic culture.[464][465] Tamil-speaking Singaporeans mostly lean toward Tamil culture, which itself is mostly linked to Hindu culture. Racial and religious harmony is regarded as a crucial part of Singapore's success, and played a part in building a Singaporean identity.[466][467]\n\n\nWhen Singapore became independent from the United Kingdom in 1963, most Singaporean citizens were transient migrant labourers who had no intention of staying permanently.[468] There was also a sizeable minority of middle-class, locally born people\u2014known as Peranakans or Baba-Nyonya-descendants of 15th- and 16th-century Chinese immigrants. With the exception of the Peranakans who pledged their loyalties to Singapore, most of the labourers' loyalties lay with their respective homelands of Malaya, China and India. After independence, the government began a deliberate process of crafting a uniquely Singaporean identity and culture.[468] Singapore has a reputation as a nanny state.[469][470] The government also places a heavy emphasis on meritocracy, where one is judged based on one's ability.[471]\n\n\nThe national flower of Singapore is the hybrid orchid, Vanda 'Miss Joaquim', named in memory of a Singapore-born Armenian woman, who crossbred the flower in her garden at Tanjong Pagar in 1893.[472] Singapore is known as the *Lion City* and many national symbols such as the coat of arms and the lion head symbol make use of a lion. Major religious festivals are public holidays.[473]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Dance in Singapore, Singaporean literature, and Music of Singapore\n\n![The National Gallery Singapore oversees the world's largest public collection of Southeast Asian and Singapore art](image)The National Gallery Singapore oversees the world's largest public collection of Singapore and Southeast Asian art.\nDuring the 1990s the National Arts Council was created to spearhead the development of performing arts, along with visual and literary art forms.[474] The National Gallery Singapore is the nation's flagship museum with some 8,000 works from Singaporean and other Southeast Asian artists. The Singapore Art Museum focuses on contemporary art. The Red Dot Design Museum celebrates exceptional art and design of objects for everyday life, hosting more than 1,000 items from 50 countries. The lotus-shaped ArtScience Museum hosts touring exhibitions that combine art with the sciences. Other major museums include the Asian Civilisations Museum, the Peranakan Museum, and The Arts House.[475] The Esplanade is Singapore's largest performing arts centre. In 2016 alone, it was the site of 5,900 free art and culture events.[476][477]\n\n\nLiterature of Singapore, or \"SingLit\", consists of a collection of literary works by Singaporeans written chiefly in the country's four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. Singapore is increasingly regarded as having four sub-literatures instead of one. Many significant works have been translated and showcased in publications such as the literary journal *Singa*, published in the 1980s and 1990s with editors including Edwin Thumboo and Koh Buck Song, as well as in multilingual anthologies such as *Rhythms: A Singaporean Millennial Anthology Of Poetry* (2000), in which the poems were all translated three times each. A number of Singaporean writers such as Tan Swie Hian and Kuo Pao Kun have contributed work in more than one language.[478][479]\n\n\nSingapore has a diverse music culture that ranges from pop and rock, to folk and classical. Western classical music plays a significant role in the cultural life in Singapore, with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) instituted in 1979. Other notable western orchestras in Singapore include Singapore National Youth Orchestra[480] and the community-based Braddell Heights Symphony Orchestra.[481] Many orchestras and ensembles are also found in secondary schools and junior colleges. Various communities have their own distinct ethnic musical traditions: Chinese, Malays, Indians, and Eurasians. With their traditional forms of music and various modern musical styles, the fusion of different forms account for the musical diversity in the country.[482] The nation's lively urban musical scene has made it a centre for international performances and festivals in the region. Some of Singapore's best known pop singers include Stefanie Sun, JJ Lin, Liang Wern Fook, Taufik Batisah and Dick Lee, who is famous for composing National Day theme songs, including *Home*.[483][484]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Singaporean cuisine\n\n![Satay stalls along Boon Tat Street next to Telok Ayer Market, better known as Lau Pa Sat](image)Lau Pa Sat hawker centre in the financial district. Satay cart-stalls roll in after dusk, on a side street.\nSingapore's diversity of cuisine is touted as a reason to visit the country, due to its combination of convenience, variety, quality, and price.[485] Local food items generally relate to a particular ethnicity \u2013 Chinese, Malay and Indian; but the diversity of cuisine has increased further by the hybridisation of different styles (e.g., the Peranakan cuisine, a mix of Chinese and Malay cuisine). In hawker centres, cultural diffusion is exemplified by traditionally Malay hawker stalls also selling Tamil food. Hainanese chicken rice, based on the Hainanese dish Wenchang chicken, is considered Singapore's national dish.[486][487]\n\n\nThe city-state has a burgeoning food scene ranging from hawker centres (open-air), food courts (air-conditioned), coffee shops (open-air with up to a dozen hawker stalls), cafes, fast food, simple kitchens, casual, celebrity and high-end restaurants.[488] Cloud kitchens and food delivery are also on the rise, with 70% of residents ordering from delivery apps at least once a month.[489][490] Many international celebrity chef restaurants are located within the integrated resorts.[491] Religious dietary strictures exist (Muslims do not eat pork and Hindus do not eat beef), and there is also a significant group of vegetarians. The Singapore Food Festival which celebrates Singapore's cuisine is held annually in July.[492]\n\n\nPrior to the 1980s, street food was sold mainly by immigrants from China, India, and Malaysia to other immigrants seeking a familiar taste. In Singapore, street food has long been associated with hawker centres with communal seating areas. Typically, these centres have a few dozen to hundreds of food stalls, with each specialising in one or more related dishes.[493][488] While street food can be found in many countries, the variety and reach of centralised hawker centres that serve heritage street food in Singapore is unique.[494] In 2018, there were 114 hawker centres spread across the city centre and heartland housing estates. They are maintained by the National Environment Agency, which also grades each food stall for hygiene. The largest hawker centre is located on the second floor of Chinatown Complex, and contains over 200 stalls.[494] The complex is also home to the cheapest Michelin-starred meal in the world \u2013 a plate of soya-sauce chicken rice or noodles for S$2 (US$1.50). Two street food stalls in the city are the first in the world to be awarded a Michelin star, obtaining a single star each.[495]\n\n\n\n### Sport and recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Singapore\n\n![](image)Joseph Schooling is a gold medalist and Olympic record holder at the Rio 2016 Games \u2013 100\u00a0m butterfly.[496]\nThe development of private sports and recreation clubs began in the 19th century colonial Singapore, with clubs founded during this time including the Cricket Club, the Singapore Recreation Club, the Singapore Swimming Club, and the Hollandse Club.[497] Weightlifter Tan Howe Liang was Singapore's first Olympic medalist, winning a silver at the 1960 Rome Games.[498]\n\n\nIndoor and water sports are some of the most popular sports in Singapore. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Joseph Schooling won Singapore's first Olympic gold medal, claiming the 100-metre butterfly in a new Olympic record time of 50.39 seconds.[496] Singapore sailors have had success on the international stage, with their Optimist team being considered among the best in the world.[499][500] Despite its size, the country has dominated swim meets in the Southeast Asia Games. Its men's water polo team won the SEA Games gold medal for the 27th time in 2017, continuing Singapore sport's longest winning streak.[501] Singapore hosted the inaugural 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, in which 3,600 athletes from 204 nations competed in 26 sports.[502] The island is home to ONE Championship, the biggest Mixed Martial Arts promotion in Asia.[503] Singapore's women's table tennis team were silver medalists at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.[504][505] They became world champions in 2010 when they beat China at the World Team Table Tennis Championships in Russia, breaking China's 19-year winning streak.[506] In 2021, Singapore's Loh Kean Yew achieved a \"World Champion\" status when he won a badminton gold at the 2021 BWF World Championships men's singles, which is one of the most prestigious badminton tournaments alongside the Summer Olympics badminton tournaments.[507]\n\n\nSingapore's football league, the Singapore Premier League, was launched in 1996 as the S.League and comprises eight clubs, including one foreign team.[508][509] The Singapore Slingers is one of the inaugural teams in the ASEAN Basketball League, which was founded in October 2009.[510] Kranji Racecourse is run by the Singapore Turf Club and hosts several meetings per week, including international races\u2014notably the Singapore Airlines International Cup.[511]\n\n\nSingapore began hosting a round of the Formula One World Championship, the Singapore Grand Prix at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in 2008. It was the inaugural F1 night race,[512] and the first F1 street race in Asia.[513] It is considered a signature event on the F1 calendar.[514]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of Singapore\n\nSee also: Telecommunications in Singapore\n\n![](image)The Ministry of Communications and Information oversees the development of infocomm, media and the arts.\nCompanies linked to the government control much of the domestic media in Singapore.[515] MediaCorp operates most free-to-air television channels and free-to-air radio stations in Singapore. There are a total of six free-to-air TV channels offered by MediaCorp.[516] StarHub TV and Singtel TV also offer IPTV with channels from all around the world.[517][518] SPH Media Trust, a body with close links to the government, controls most of the newspaper industry in Singapore.[519]\n\n\nSingapore's media industry has sometimes been criticised for being overly regulated and lacking in freedom by human rights groups such as Freedom House.[515] Self-censorship among journalists is said to be common.[519] In 2023, Singapore was ranked 129 on the Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, up from 139 the previous year.[520] The Media Development Authority regulates Singaporean media, claiming to balance the demand for choice and protection against offensive and harmful material.[521] Private ownership of TV satellite dishes is banned.[519]\n\n\nInternet in Singapore is provided by state-owned Singtel, partially state-owned Starhub and M1 Limited as well as some other business internet service providers (ISPs) that offer residential service plans of speeds up to 2 Gbit/s as of spring 2015.[522] Equinix (332 participants) and the Singapore Internet Exchange (70 participants) are Internet exchange points where Internet service providers and Content delivery networks exchange Internet traffic between their networks (autonomous systems) in various locations in Singapore.[523][524] In the mid-1980s to 1990s, Singaporeans could also use the locally based videotext service Singapore Teleview to communicate with one another.[525] The phrase *Intelligent Island* arose in the 1990s in reference to the island nation's early adaptive relationship with the internet.[525][526]\n\n\nIn 2016, there were an estimated 4.7\u00a0million internet users in Singapore, representing 82.5% of the population.[527] The Singapore government does not engage in widespread censoring of the internet,[528] but it maintains a list of one hundred websites\u2014mostly pornographic\u2014that it blocks from home internet access as a \"symbolic statement of the Singaporean community's stand on harmful and undesirable content on the Internet\".[529][530] Singapore has the world's highest smartphone penetration rates, in surveys by Deloitte[531][532] and the Google Consumer Barometer\u2014at 89% and 85% of the population respectively in 2014.[533] The overall mobile phone penetration rate is at 148 mobile phone subscribers per 100 people.[534]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Singapore portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![icon](image)Islands portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n\n\n* Index of Singapore-related articles\n* Foreign relations of Singapore\n* Outline of Singapore\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In Singapore, the population is classified based on the Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others (CMIO) racial framework used by the Singaporean government, and does not necessarily reflect the ethnic identity of the individual.

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest in the world.[11]\n\n\nGeopolitically, the island of Ireland is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), an independent state covering five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7\u00a0million, with 5.1 million living in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.[8]\n\n\nThe geography of Ireland comprises relatively low-lying mountains surrounding a central plain, with several navigable rivers extending inland. Its lush vegetation is a product of its mild but changeable climate which is free of extremes in temperature. Much of Ireland was woodland until the end of the Middle Ages. Today, woodland makes up about 10% of the island, compared with a European average of over 33%,[12] with most of it being non-native conifer plantations.[13][14] The Irish climate is influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and thus very moderate,[15] and winters are milder than expected for such a northerly area, although summers are cooler than those in continental Europe. Rainfall and cloud cover are abundant.\n\n\nGaelic Ireland had emerged by the 1st century AD. The island was Christianised from the 5th century onwards. Following the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasion, England claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century Tudor conquest, which led to colonisation by settlers from Britain. In the 1690s, a system of Protestant English rule was designed to materially disadvantage the Catholic majority and Protestant dissenters, and was extended during the 18th century. With the Acts of Union in 1801, Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom. A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island, leading to the creation of the Irish Free State, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s. This subsided following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. In 1973, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, with Northern Ireland as part of it, joined the European Economic Community. Following a referendum vote in 2016, the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland included, left the European Union (EU) in 2020. Northern Ireland was granted a limited special status and allowed to operate within the EU single market for goods without being in the European Union;[16] the economy has subsequently grown faster than the rest of the UK.[17]\n\n\nIrish culture has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of literature. Alongside mainstream Western culture, a strong indigenous culture exists, as expressed through Gaelic games, Irish music, Irish language, and Irish dance. The island's culture shares many features with that of Great Britain, including the English language, and sports such as association football, rugby, horse racing, golf, and boxing.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe names *Ireland* and *\u00c9ire* derive from Old Irish *\u00c9riu*, a goddess in Irish mythology first recorded in the ninth century. The etymology of \u00c9riu is disputed but may derive from the Proto-Indo-European root \\**h2uer*, referring to flowing water.[18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Ireland\n\n### Prehistoric Ireland[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistoric Ireland\n\nDuring the last glacial period, and until about 16,000 BC, much of Ireland was periodically covered in ice.[19] The relative sea level was less than 50m lower resulting in an ice bridge (but not a land bridge) forming between Ireland and Great Britain.[20] By 14,000 BC this ice bridge existed only between Northern Ireland and Scotland and by 12,000 BC Ireland was completely separated from Great Britain.[21] Later, around 6100 BC, Great Britain became separated from continental Europe.[22] Until recently, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland was dated at 12,500 years ago, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone found in a cave in County Clare.[23] Since 2021, the earliest evidence of human activity in Ireland is dated to 33,000 years ago.[24]\n\n\nBy about 8000 BC, more sustained occupation of the island has been shown, with evidence for Mesolithic communities around the island.[25]\n\n\nSome time before 4000\u00a0BC, Neolithic settlers introduced cereal cultivars, domesticated animals such as cattle and sheep, built large timber buildings, and stone monuments.[26][19] The earliest evidence for farming in Ireland or Great Britain is from Ferriter's Cove, County Kerry, where a flint knife, cattle bones and a sheep's tooth were carbon-dated to c.\u00a04350\u00a0BC.[27] Field systems were developed in different parts of Ireland, including at the *C\u00e9ide Fields*, that has been preserved beneath a blanket of peat in present-day Tyrawley. An extensive field system, arguably the oldest in the world,[28] consisted of small divisions separated by dry-stone walls. The fields were farmed for several centuries between 3500 BC and 3000 BC. Wheat and barley were the principal crops.[19]\n\n\nThe Bronze Age\u00a0began around 2500 BC, with technology changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel; harnessing oxen; weaving textiles; brewing alcohol; and skillful metalworking,[19] which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as brooches and torcs.\n\n\n\n#### Emergence of Celtic Ireland[edit]\n\n\nHow and when the island became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. The most recent genetic research strongly associates the spread of Indo-European languages (including Celtic) through Western Europe with a people bringing a composite Beaker culture, with its arrival in Britain and Ireland dated to around the middle of the third millennium\u00a0BC.[29] According to John T. Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-network culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, and that this is where Celtic languages developed.[30][31][32][33] This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Uragh Stone Circle, a Neolithic stone circle in Tuosist, close to Gleninchaquin Park, County Kerry\nThe long-standing traditional view is that the Celtic language, Ogham script and culture were brought to Ireland by waves of invading or migrating Celts from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the *Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn*, a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland, along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artefacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The Priteni were said to be the first, followed by the Belgae from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the Milesians (Gaels) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul.[35] It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC. They were said to have given their name to the island.[36][37]\n\n\nThe theory was advanced in part because of the lack of archaeological evidence for large-scale Celtic immigration, though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Historical linguists are skeptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processual view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'.[38][39] Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in mitochondrial DNA between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern. When taking both into account, a study concluded that modern Celtic speakers in Ireland could be thought of as European \"Atlantic Celts\" showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.[40]\nIn 2012, research showed that the occurrence of genetic markers for the earliest farmers was almost eliminated by Beaker-culture immigrants: they carried what was then a new Y-chromosome R1b marker, believed to have originated in Iberia about 2500 BC. The prevalence amongst modern Irish men of this mutation is a remarkable 84%, the highest in the world, and closely matched in other populations along the Atlantic fringes down to Spain. A similar genetic replacement happened with lineages in mitochondrial DNA.[27][41] This conclusion is supported by recent research carried out by the geneticist David Reich, who says: \"British and Irish skeletons from the Bronze Age that followed the Beaker period had at most 10 per cent ancestry from the first farmers of these islands, with other 90 per cent from people like those associated with the Bell Beaker culture in the Netherlands.\" He suggests that it was Beaker users who introduced an Indo-European language, represented here by Celtic (i.e. a new language and culture introduced directly by migration and genetic replacement).[29]\n\n\n\n### Late antiquity and early medieval times[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Ireland (800\u20131169)\n\n![](image)The Scoti were Gaelic-speaking people from Ireland who settled in western Scotland in the 6th century or before.\nThe earliest written records of Ireland come from classical Greco-Roman geographers. Ptolemy in his *Almagest* refers to Ireland as *Mikra Brettania* (\"Little Britain\"), in contrast to the larger island, which he called *Megale Brettania* (\"Great Britain\").[42] In his later work, *Geography*, Ptolemy refers to Ireland as *Iouernia* and to Great Britain as *Albion*. These 'new' names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, in contrast, were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made.[43]\n\n\nThe Romans referred to Ireland by this name too in its Latinised form, *Hibernia*, or Scotia.[44][45] Ptolemy records sixteen nations inhabiting every part of Ireland in 100 AD.[46] The relationship between the Roman Empire and the kingdoms of ancient Ireland is unclear. However, a number of finds of Roman coins have been made, for example at the Iron Age settlement of Freestone Hill near Gowran and Newgrange.[47]\n\n\nIreland continued as a patchwork of rival kingdoms; however, beginning in the 7th century, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of high kings stretching back thousands of years, but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.[48]\n\n\nAll of the Irish kingdoms had their own kings but were nominally subject to the high king. The high king was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept did not become a political reality until the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one.[49] Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the *brehons*.[50]\n\n\n*The Chronicle of Ireland* records that in 431, Bishop Palladius arrived in Ireland on a mission from Pope Celestine I to minister to the Irish \"already believing in Christ\".[51] The same chronicle records that Saint Patrick, Ireland's best known patron saint, arrived the following year. There is continued debate over the missions of Palladius and Patrick, but the consensus is that they both took place[52] and that the older druid tradition collapsed in the face of the new religion.[53] Irish Christian scholars excelled in the study of Latin and Greek learning and Christian theology. In the monastic culture that followed the Christianisation of Ireland, Latin and Greek learning was preserved in Ireland during the Early Middle Ages in contrast to elsewhere in Western Europe, where the Dark Ages followed the Fall of the Western Roman Empire.[53][54][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)A folio of the Book of Kells showing Christ enthroned\nThe arts of manuscript illumination, metalworking and sculpture flourished and produced treasures such as the *Book of Kells*, ornate jewellery and the many carved stone crosses[55] that still dot the island today. A mission founded in 563 on Iona by the Irish monk Saint Columba began a tradition of Irish missionary work that spread Celtic Christianity and learning to Scotland, England and the Frankish Empire on continental Europe after the fall of Rome.[56] These missions continued until the late Middle Ages, establishing monasteries and centres of learning, producing scholars such as Sedulius Scottus and Johannes Eriugena and exerting much influence in Europe.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFrom the 9th century, waves of Viking raiders plundered Irish monasteries and towns.[57] These raids added to a pattern of raiding and endemic warfare that was already deep-seated in Ireland. The Vikings were involved in establishing most of the major coastal settlements in Ireland: Dublin, Limerick, Cork, Wexford, Waterford, as well as other smaller settlements.[58][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n\n### Norman and English invasions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Norman invasion of Ireland, History of Ireland (1169\u20131536), and Tudor conquest of Ireland\n\nSee also: Bruce campaign in Ireland\n\n![](image)Remains of the 12th-century Trim Castle in County Meath, the largest Norman castle in Ireland\nOn 1 May 1169, an expedition of Cambro-Norman knights, with an army of about 600 men, landed at Bannow Strand in present-day County Wexford. It was led by Richard de Clare, known as 'Strongbow' owing to his prowess as an archer.[59] The invasion, which coincided with a period of renewed Norman expansion, was at the invitation of Dermot Mac Murrough, King of Leinster.[60]\n\n\nIn 1166, Mac Murrough had fled to Anjou, France, following a war involving Tighearn\u00e1n Ua Ruairc, of Breifne, and sought the assistance of the Angevin King Henry II, in recapturing his kingdom. In 1171, Henry arrived in Ireland in order to review the general progress of the expedition. He wanted to re-exert royal authority over the invasion which was expanding beyond his control. Henry successfully re-imposed his authority over Strongbow and the Cambro-Norman warlords and persuaded many of the Irish kings to accept him as their overlord, an arrangement confirmed in the 1175 Treaty of Windsor.\n\n\nThe invasion was legitimised by reference to provisions of the alleged Papal Bull *Laudabiliter*, issued by an Englishman, Adrian IV, in 1155. The document apparently encouraged Henry to take control in Ireland in order to oversee the financial and administrative reorganisation of the Irish Church and its integration into the Roman Church system.[61] Some restructuring had already begun at the ecclesiastical level following the Synod of Kells in 1152.[62] There has been significant controversy regarding the authenticity of *Laudabiliter*,[63] and there is no general agreement as to whether the bull was genuine or a forgery.[64][65] Further, it had no standing in the Irish legal system.\n\n\n\n![](image)Political boundaries in Ireland in 1450, before the plantations\nIn 1172, Pope Alexander III further encouraged Henry to advance the integration of the Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per hearth as an annual contribution. This church levy called Peter's Pence, is extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry assumed the title of Lord of Ireland which Henry conferred on his younger son, John Lackland, in 1185. This defined the Anglo-Norman administration in Ireland as the Lordship of Ireland.[*citation needed*] When Henry's successor died unexpectedly in 1199, John inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland. Over the century that followed, Norman feudal law gradually replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law across large areas, so that by the late 13th century the Norman-Irish had established a feudal system throughout much of Ireland. Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of the Magna Carta (the Great Charter of Ireland), substituting *Dublin* for *London* and the *Irish Church* for, the English church at the time, the *Catholic Church*, was published in 1216 and the Parliament of Ireland was founded in 1297.\n\n\n\n### Gaelicisation[edit]\n\n\nFrom the mid-14th century, after the Black Death, Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent the assimilation of the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.[66]\n\n\nBy the end of the 15th century, central English authority in Ireland had all but disappeared, and a renewed Irish culture and language, albeit with Norman influences, was again dominant. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as The Pale, and under the provisions of Poynings' Law of 1494, Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Privy Council.[67]\n\n\n\n### The Kingdom of Ireland[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kingdom of Ireland\n\n![](image)A 16th-century perception of Irish women and girls, illustrated in the manuscript \"Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de tous les peuples et nations de la terre avec leurs habits et ornemens divers, tant anciens que modernes, diligemment depeints au naturel\". Painted by Lucas d'Heere in the 2nd half of the 16th century. Preserved in the Ghent University Library.[68]\nThe title of King of Ireland was re-created in 1542 by Henry VIII, the then King of England, of the Tudor dynasty. English rule was reinforced and expanded in Ireland during the latter part of the 16th century, leading to the Tudor conquest of Ireland. A near-complete conquest was achieved by the turn of the 17th century, following the Nine Years' War and the Flight of the Earls.\n\n\nThis control was consolidated during the wars and conflicts of the 17th century, including the English and Scottish colonisation in the Plantations of Ireland, the Wars of the Three Kingdoms and the Williamite War. Irish losses during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (which, in Ireland, included the Irish Confederacy and the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland) are estimated to include 20,000 battlefield casualties. 200,000 civilians are estimated to have died as a result of a combination of war-related famine, displacement, guerrilla activity and pestilence throughout the war. A further 50,000[Note 1] were sent into indentured servitude in the West Indies. Physician-general William Petty estimated that 504,000 Catholic Irish and 112,000 Protestant settlers died, and 100,000 people were transported, as a result of the war.[71] If a prewar population of 1.5 million is assumed, this would mean that the population was reduced by almost half.\n\n\nThe religious struggles of the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After the passing of the Test Act 1672, and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites, Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament. Under the emerging Penal Laws, Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various civil rights, even the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists.[72] The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the Protestant Ascendancy.\n\n\n\n![](image)Half-hanging of suspected United Irishmen\nThe \"Great Frost\" struck Ireland and the rest of Europe between December 1739 and September 1741, after a decade of relatively mild winters. The winters destroyed stored crops of potatoes and other staples, and the poor summers severely damaged harvests.[73][*page\u00a0needed*] This resulted in the famine of 1740. An estimated 250,000 people (about one in eight of the population) died from the ensuing pestilence and disease.[74] The Irish government halted export of corn and kept the army in quarters but did little more.[74][75] Local gentry and charitable organisations provided relief but could do little to prevent the ensuing mortality.[74][75]\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared in the latter part of this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland without the consent of the Irish parliament.\n\n\n\n### Union with Great Britain[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\n\nIn 1798, members of the Protestant Dissenter tradition (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, with the aim of creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.[76]\n\n\nThe passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799. According to contemporary documents and historical analysis, this was achieved through a considerable degree of bribery, with funding provided by the British Secret Service Office, and the awarding of peerages, places and honours to secure votes.[76] Thus, the parliament in Ireland was abolished and replaced by a united parliament at Westminster in London, though resistance remained, as evidenced by Robert Emmet's failed Irish Rebellion of 1803.\n\n\nAside from the development of the linen industry, Ireland was largely passed over by the industrial revolution, partly because it lacked coal and iron resources[77][78] and partly because of the impact of the sudden union with the structurally superior economy of England,[79] which saw Ireland as a source of agricultural produce and capital.[80][81]\n\n\n\n![](image)A depiction of the Great Famine from *Our Boys in Ireland* by Henry Willard French (1891)\nThe Great Famine of 1845\u20131851 devastated Ireland, as in those years Ireland's population fell by one-third. More than one million people died from starvation and disease, with an additional million people emigrating during the famine, mostly to the United States and Canada.[82] In the century that followed, an economic depression caused by the famine resulted in a further million people emigrating.[83] By the end of the decade, half of all immigration to the United States was from Ireland. The period of civil unrest that followed until the end of the 19th century is referred to as the Land War. Mass emigration became deeply entrenched and the population continued to decline until the mid-20th century. Immediately prior to the famine the population was recorded as 8.2 million by the 1841 census.[84] The population has never returned to this level since.[85] The population continued to fall until 1961; County Leitrim was the final Irish county to record a population increase post-famine, in 2006.\n\n\nThe 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of modern Irish nationalism, primarily among the Roman Catholic population. The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was Daniel O'Connell. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Ennis in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat as a Roman Catholic. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the Duke of Wellington. Steering the Catholic Relief Bill through Parliament, aided by future prime minister Robert Peel, Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant George IV to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. George's father had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, Pitt the Younger, to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing Catholic Emancipation to be in conflict with the Act of Settlement 1701.\n\n\nDaniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, Charles Stewart Parnell and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or \"Home Rule\". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.[86] After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914. To prevent this from happening, the Ulster Volunteers were formed in 1913 under the leadership of Edward Carson.[87]\n\n\nTheir formation was followed in 1914 by the establishment of the Irish Volunteers, whose aim was to ensure that the Home Rule Bill was passed. The Act was passed but with the \"temporary\" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster, which later became Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the First World War. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under John Redmond, took the name National Volunteers and supported Irish involvement in the war. A minority, approximately 13,000, retained the Irish Volunteers' name and opposed Ireland's involvement in the war.[87]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sackville Street (now O'Connell Street), Dublin, after the 1916 Easter Rising\nThe Easter Rising of 1916 was carried out by the latter group together with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due to the ongoing war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.[88]\n\n\nThe pro-independence republican party, Sinn F\u00e9in, received overwhelming endorsement in the general election of 1918, and in 1919 proclaimed an Irish Republic, setting up its own parliament (*D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann*) and government. Simultaneously the Volunteers, which became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA), launched a three-year guerrilla war, which ended in a truce in July 1921 (although violence continued until June 1922, mostly in Northern Ireland).[88]\n\n\n\n### Partition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Partition of Ireland\n\nIn December 1921, the Anglo-Irish Treaty was concluded between the British government and representatives of the Second D\u00e1il. It gave Ireland complete independence in its home affairs and practical independence for foreign policy, but an opt-out clause allowed Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom, which it immediately exercised. Additionally, Members of the Free State Parliament were required to swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution of the Irish Free State and make a statement of faithfulness to the king.[89] Disagreements over these provisions led to a split in the nationalist movement and a subsequent Irish Civil War between the new government of the Irish Free State and those opposed to the treaty, led by \u00c9amon de Valera. The civil war officially ended in May 1923 when de Valera issued a cease-fire order.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Independence[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the Republic of Ireland and Economy of the Republic of Ireland\n\n![](image)Annotated page from the Anglo-Irish Treaty that established the Irish Free State and independence for 26 out of 32 Irish counties\nDuring its first decade, the newly formed Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera achieved power, he took advantage of the Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 a new constitution was adopted.[88] This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\nThe state was neutral during World War II, but offered clandestine assistance to the Allies, particularly in the potential defence of Northern Ireland. Despite their country's neutrality, approximately 50,000[91] volunteers from independent Ireland joined the British forces during the war, four being awarded Victoria Crosses.\n\n\nThe German intelligence was also active in Ireland.[92] Its operations ended in September 1941 when police made arrests based on surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin. To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men at the start of the war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.[92][93]\n\n\nLarge-scale emigration marked most of the post-WWII period (particularly during the 1950s and 1980s), but beginning in 1987 the economy improved, and the 1990s saw the beginning of substantial economic growth. This period of growth became known as the Celtic Tiger.[94] The Republic's real GDP grew by an average of 9.6% per annum between 1995 and 1999,[95] in which year the Republic joined the euro. In 2000, it was the sixth-richest country in the world in terms of GDP per capita.[96] Historian R. F. Foster argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of American corporations. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals, the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the Industrial Development Authority. In addition European Union membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.[97]\n\n\nModernisation brought secularisation in its wake. The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: First, Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion and divorce, undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the paedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.[98]\n\n\nThe financial crisis that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP fell by 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow).[99] The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.[100]\n\n\n\n#### Northern Ireland[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Northern Ireland and Economy of Northern Ireland\n\nNorthern Ireland resulted from the division of the United Kingdom by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and until 1972 was a self-governing jurisdiction within the United Kingdom with its own parliament and prime minister. Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom, was not neutral during the Second World War, and Belfast suffered four bombing raids in 1941. Conscription was not extended to Northern Ireland, and roughly an equal number volunteered from Northern Ireland as volunteered from the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\n\n![](image)Edward Carson signing the Solemn League and Covenant in 1912, declaring opposition to Home Rule \"using all means which may be found necessary\"\nAlthough Northern Ireland was largely spared the strife of the civil war, in the decades that followed partition there were sporadic episodes of inter-communal violence. Nationalists, mainly Roman Catholic, wanted to unite Ireland as an independent republic, whereas unionists, mainly Protestant, wanted Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom. The Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland voted largely along sectarian lines, meaning that the government of Northern Ireland (elected by \"first-past-the-post\" from 1929) was controlled by the Ulster Unionist Party. Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as gerrymandering and discrimination in housing and employment.[101][102][103]\n\n\nIn the late 1960s, nationalist grievances were aired publicly in mass civil rights protests, which were often confronted by loyalist counter-protests.[104] The government's reaction to confrontations was seen to be one-sided and heavy-handed in favour of unionists. Law and order broke down as unrest and inter-communal violence increased.[105] The Northern Ireland government requested the British Army to aid the police and protect the Irish Nationalist population. In 1969, the paramilitary Provisional IRA, which favoured the creation of a united Ireland, emerged from a split in the Irish Republican Army and began a campaign against what it called the \"British occupation of the six counties\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOther groups, both the unionist and nationalist participated in violence, and a period known as \"the Troubles\" began. Over 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict.[106] Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed direct rule. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the Good Friday Agreement was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.\n\n\nThe substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.[107]\n\n\nThe Assembly and power-sharing Executive were suspended several times but were restored again in 2007. In that year the British government officially ended its military support of the police in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) and began withdrawing troops. On 27 June 2012, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister and former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness, shook hands with Queen Elizabeth II in Belfast, symbolising reconciliation between the two sides.[108]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Political entities on the island of Ireland\nThe island is divided between the Republic of Ireland, an independent state, and Northern Ireland, a constituent country of the United Kingdom. They share an open border and both are part of the Common Travel Area and as a consequence, there is free movement of people, goods, services and capital[*disambiguation needed*] across the border.\n\n\nThe Republic of Ireland is a member state of the European Union while the United Kingdom is a former member state, having both acceded to its precursor entity, the European Economic Community (EEC), in 1973 but the UK left the European Union in 2020 after a referendum on EU membership was held in 2016 which resulted in 51.9% of UK voters choosing to leave the bloc.\n\n\n\n### Republic of Ireland[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Republic of Ireland\n\n![](image)*\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in*, the official residence of the President of Ireland\nThe Republic of Ireland is a parliamentary democracy based on the Westminster system, with a written constitution and a popularly elected president whose role is mostly ceremonial. The Oireachtas is a bicameral parliament, composed of D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (the D\u00e1il), a house of representatives, and Seanad \u00c9ireann (the Seanad), an upper house. The government is headed by a prime minister, the Taoiseach, who is appointed by the president on the nomination of the D\u00e1il. Its capital is Dublin.\n\n\nThe Republic of Ireland today ranks among the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of GDP per capita[109] and in 2015 was ranked the sixth most developed nation in the world by the United Nations' Human Development Index.[110] A period of rapid economic expansion from 1995 onwards became known as the Celtic Tiger period, was brought to an end in 2008 with an unprecedented financial crisis and an economic depression in 2009.\n\n\n\n### Northern Ireland[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Northern Ireland\n\n![](image)Parliament Buildings, in Stormont Estate, seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly\nNorthern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom with a local executive and assembly which exercise devolved powers. The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion to each party's representation in the assembly. Its capital is Belfast.\n\n\nUltimately political power is held by the UK government, from which Northern Ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended. Northern Ireland elects 18 of the UK House of Commons' 650 MPs. The Northern Ireland Secretary is a cabinet-level post in the British government.\n\n\nAlong with England and Wales and with Scotland, Northern Ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the UK, all of which share the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom as their court of final appeal.\n\n\n\n### All-island institutions[edit]\n\n\nAs part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation. The North/South Ministerial Council is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive agree all-island policies. At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island \"implementation body,\" and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction. The implementation bodies are: Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board, InterTradeIreland, the Special European Union Programmes Body, the North/South Language Body and the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.\n\n\nThe British\u2013Irish Intergovernmental Conference provides for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on all matters of mutual interest, especially Northern Ireland. In light of the Republic's particular interest in the governance of Northern Ireland, \"regular and frequent\" meetings co-chaired by the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, dealing with non-devolved matters to do with Northern Ireland and non-devolved all-Ireland issues, are required to take place under the establishing treaty.\n\n\nThe North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland. It has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Ireland\n\n![](image)Physical features of Ireland\nIreland is located in the north-west of Europe, between latitudes 51\u00b0 and 56\u00b0 N, and longitudes 11\u00b0 and 5\u00b0 W. It is separated from Great Britain by the Irish Sea and the North Channel, which has a width of 23 kilometres (14\u00a0mi)[111] at its narrowest point. To the west is the northern Atlantic Ocean and to the south is the Celtic Sea, which lies between Ireland and Brittany, in France. Ireland has a total area of 84,421\u00a0km2 (32,595\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[1][2][112] of which the Republic of Ireland occupies 83 percent.[113] Ireland and Great Britain, together with many nearby smaller islands, are known collectively as the British Isles. As the term *British Isles* can be controversial in relation to Ireland, the alternate term *Britain and Ireland* is sometimes used as a neutral term for the islands.[114]\n\n\nA ring of coastal mountains surrounds low plains at the centre of the island. The highest of these is Carrauntoohil (Irish: *Corr\u00e1n Tuathail*) in County Kerry, which rises to 1,039\u00a0m (3,409\u00a0ft) above sea level.[115] The most arable land lies in the province of Leinster.[116] Western areas are mainly mountainous and rocky with green panoramic vistas. River Shannon, the island's longest river at 360.5\u00a0km (224\u00a0mi) long, rises in County Cavan in the north-west and flows through Limerick in the midwest.[115][117]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Ireland\n\n![](image)Topography of Ireland\nThe island consists of varied geological provinces. In the west, around County Galway and County Donegal, is a medium to high grade metamorphic and igneous complex of Caledonide affinity, similar to the Scottish Highlands. Across southeast Ulster and extending southwest to Longford and south to Navan is a province of Ordovician and Silurian rocks, with similarities to the Southern Uplands province of Scotland. Further south, along the County Wexford coastline, is an area of granite intrusives into more Ordovician and Silurian rocks, like that found in Wales.[118][119]\n\n\nIn the southwest, around Bantry Bay and the mountains of MacGillycuddy's Reeks, is an area of substantially deformed, lightly metamorphosed Devonian-aged rocks.[120] This partial ring of \"hard rock\" geology is covered by a blanket of Carboniferous limestone over the centre of the country, giving rise to a comparatively fertile and lush landscape. The west-coast district of the Burren around Lisdoonvarna has well-developed karst features.[121] Significant stratiform lead-zinc mineralisation is found in the limestones around Silvermines and Tynagh.\n\n\nHydrocarbon exploration is ongoing following the first major find at the Kinsale Head gas field off Cork in the mid-1970s.[122][123] In 1999, economically significant finds of natural gas were made in the Corrib Gas Field off the County Mayo coast. This has increased activity off the west coast in parallel with the \"West of Shetland\" step-out development from the North Sea hydrocarbon province. In 2000, the Helvick oil field was discovered, which was estimated to contain over 28 million barrels (4,500,000\u00a0m3) of oil.[124]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Ireland\n\nThe island's lush vegetation, a product of its mild climate and frequent rainfall, earns it the sobriquet *the Emerald Isle*. Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable oceanic climate with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and temperate, avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.[125] This is a result of the moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.\n\n\nPrecipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.[126] Munster, in the south, records the least snow whereas Ulster, in the north, records the most.\n\n\nInland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter. Usually around 40 days of the year are below freezing 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) at inland weather stations, compared to 10 days at coastal stations. Ireland is sometimes affected by heat waves, most recently in 1995, 2003, 2006, 2013 and 2018. In common with the rest of Europe, Ireland experienced unusually cold weather during the winter of 2010\u201311. Temperatures fell as low as \u221217.2\u00a0\u00b0C (1\u00a0\u00b0F) in County Mayo on 20 December[127] and up to a metre (3\u00a0ft) of snow fell in mountainous areas.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Ireland\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u221219.1(\u22122.4)\n | \u221217.8(0.0)\n | \u221217.2(1.0)\n | \u22127.7(18.1)\n | \u22125.6(21.9)\n | \u22123.3(26.1)\n | \u22120.3(31.5)\n | \u22122.7(27.1)\n | \u22123(27)\n | \u22128.3(17.1)\n | \u221211.5(11.3)\n | \u221217.5(0.5)\n | \u221219.1(\u22122.4)\n |\n| Source 1: *Met \u00c9ireann*[128] |\n| Source 2: The Irish Times (November record high)[129] |\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of Ireland, Flora of Ireland, and Trees of Britain and Ireland\n\n![The red fox is common in Ireland.](image)Two red foxes (*Vulpes vulpes*) in Gubbeen, County Cork\nUnlike Great Britain which had a land bridge with mainland Europe, Ireland only had an ice bridge ending around 14,000 years ago at the end of the last ice age and as a result, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain or mainland Europe.[20][21] There are 55 mammal species in Ireland, and of them, only 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland.[130] Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.\n\n\n\n![](image)Red deer (*Cervus elaphus*) in Killarney National Park\nSeveral different habitat types are found in Ireland, including farmland, open woodland, temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, conifer plantations, peat bogs and a variety of coastal habitats. However, agriculture drives current land use patterns in Ireland, limiting natural habitat preserves,[131] particularly for larger wild mammals with greater territorial needs. With no large apex predators in Ireland other than humans and dogs, such populations of animals as semi-wild deer that cannot be controlled by smaller predators, such as the fox, are controlled by annual culling.\n\n\nThere are no snakes in Ireland, and only one species of reptile (the common lizard) is native to the island. Extinct species include the Irish elk, the great auk, brown bear and the wolf. Some previously extinct birds, such as the golden eagle, have been reintroduced after decades of extirpation.[132]\n\n\nIreland is now one of the least forested countries in Europe.[133][134] Until the end of the Middle Ages, Ireland was heavily forested. Native species include deciduous trees such as oak, ash, hazel, birch, alder, willow, aspen, rowan and hawthorn, as well as evergreen trees such Scots pine, yew, holly and strawberry trees.[135] Only about 10% of Ireland today is woodland;[12] most of this is non-native conifer plantations, and only 2% is native woodland.[13][14] The average woodland cover of European countries is over 33%.[12] In the Republic, about 389,356 hectares (3,893.56\u00a0km2) is owned by the state, mainly by the forestry service Coillte.[12] Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park.\n\n\n\n![](image)Furze (*Ulex europaeus*)\nMuch of the land is now covered with pasture and there are many species of wild-flower. Gorse (*Ulex europaeus*), a wild furze, is commonly found growing in the uplands and ferns are plentiful in the more moist regions, especially in the western parts. It is home to hundreds of plant species, some of them unique to the island, and has been \"invaded\" by some grasses, such as *Spartina anglica*.[136]\n\n\nThe algal and seaweed flora is that of the cold-temperate variety. The total number of species is 574[137] The island has been invaded by some algae, some of which are now well established.[138]\n\n\nBecause of its mild climate, many species, including sub-tropical species such as palm trees, are grown in Ireland. Phytogeographically, Ireland belongs to the Atlantic European province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island can be subdivided into two ecoregions: the Celtic broadleaf forests and North Atlantic moist mixed forests.\n\n\n\n### Impact of agriculture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Silage harvesting in Clonard, County Meath\nThe long history of agricultural production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, rivers and lakes, has placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland.[139][140] A land of green fields for crop cultivation and cattle rearing limits the space available for the establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.[141] 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture.[142] Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas. Grazing in this manner is one of the main factors preventing the natural regeneration of forests across many regions of the country.[143]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Irish people, Demographics of the Republic of Ireland, and Demography of Northern Ireland\n\n![](image)Proportion of respondents to the Ireland census 2011 or the Northern Ireland census 2011 who stated they were Catholic. Areas in which Catholics are in the majority are blue. Areas in which Catholics are in a minority are red.\nThe population of Ireland is just over 7 million, of which approximately 5.1 million reside in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million reside in Northern Ireland.[8]\n\n\nPeople have lived in Ireland for over 9,000 years. Early historical and genealogical records note the existence of major groups such as the *Cruthin*, *Corcu Lo\u00edgde*, *D\u00e1l Riata*, *D\u00e1irine*, *Deirgtine*, *Delbhna*, *\u00c9rainn*, *Laigin*, *Ulaid*. Later major groups included the *Connachta*, *Ciannachta*, *E\u00f3ganachta*. Smaller groups included the *aithechth\u00faatha* (see *Attacotti*), *C\u00e1lraighe*, *C\u00edarraige*, *Conmaicne*, *Dartraighe*, *D\u00e9isi*, *\u00c9ile*, *Fir Bolg*, *Fortuatha*, *Gailenga*, *Gamanraige*, *Mairtine*, *M\u00fascraige*, *Partraige*, *Soghain*, *Uaithni*, *U\u00ed Maine*, *U\u00ed Liath\u00e1in*. Many survived into late medieval times, others vanished as they became politically unimportant. Over the past 1,200 years, Vikings, Normans, Welsh, Flemings, Scots, English, Africans and Eastern Europeans have all added to the population and have had significant influences on Irish culture.\n\n\nThe population of Ireland rose rapidly from the 16th century until the mid-19th century, interrupted briefly by the Famine of 1740\u201341, which killed roughly two-fifths of the island's population. The population rebounded and multiplied over the next century, but the Great Famine of the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century, the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.\n\n\nIreland's largest religious group is Christianity. The largest denomination is Roman Catholicism, representing over 73% of the island (and about 87% of the Republic of Ireland). Most of the rest of the population adhere to one of the various Protestant denominations (about 48% of Northern Ireland).[144] The largest is the Anglican Church of Ireland. The Muslim community is growing in Ireland, mostly through increased immigration, with a 50% increase in the republic between the 2006 and 2011 census.[145] The island has a small Jewish community. About 4% of the Republic's population and about 14% of the Northern Ireland population[144] describe themselves as of no religion. In a 2010 survey conducted on behalf of the Irish Times, 32% of respondents said they went to a religious service more than once per week.\n\n\n\n### Divisions and settlements[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Provinces of Ireland, Counties of Ireland, and City status in Ireland\n\n![Ireland is located in island of Ireland](image)![Leinster](image)\nLeinster\n![Connacht](image)\nConnacht\n![Ulster](image)\nUlster\n![Munster](image)\nMunster\nclass=notpageimage|\nProvinces of Ireland\n\nTraditionally, Ireland is subdivided into four provinces: Connacht (west), Leinster (east), Munster (south), and Ulster (north). In a system that developed between the 13th and 17th centuries,[146] Ireland has 32 traditional counties. Twenty-six of these counties are in the Republic of Ireland, and six are in Northern Ireland. The six counties that constitute Northern Ireland are all in the province of Ulster (which has nine counties in total). As such, *Ulster* is often used as a synonym for Northern Ireland, although the two are not coterminous. In the Republic of Ireland, counties form the basis of the system of local government. Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example, postal addresses and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes,[147] but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.[148]\n\n\nCity status in Ireland is decided by legislative or royal charter. Dublin, with over one million residents in the Greater Dublin Area, is the largest city on the island. Belfast, with 579,726 residents, is the largest city in Northern Ireland. City status does not directly equate with population size. For example, Armagh, with 14,590 is the seat of the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Primate of All Ireland and was re-granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1994 (having lost that status in local government reforms of 1840). In the Republic of Ireland, Kilkenny, the seat of the Butler dynasty, while no longer a city for administrative purposes (since the 2001 Local Government Act), is entitled by law to continue to use the description.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Cities and towns by population[149][150] |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Dublin![](image)Belfast | #\n | Settlement\n | CityPopu\u00adlation\n | Urbanpopu\u00adlation\n | Metropopu\u00adlation\n | ![](image)Cork![](image)Limerick |\n| 1 | **Dublin** | 592,713 | 1,263,219 | 1,458,154\n |\n| 2 | **Belfast** | 293,298 |  | 639,000\n |\n| 3 | **Cork** | 222,333 |  | 305,222\n |\n| 4 | **Limerick** | 102,287 |  |  |\n| 5 | **Galway** | 85,910 |  |  |\n| 6 | **Derry** | 85,279 |  |  |\n| 7 | **Greater Craigavon** | 72,301 |  |  |\n| 8 | **Newtownabbey**[a] | 67,599\n |  |  |\n| 9 | **Bangor**[a] | 64,596 |  |  |\n| 10 | **Waterford** | 60,079 |  |  |\n\n\nFurther information: List of metropolitan areas in Ireland\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\nThe population of Ireland collapsed dramatically during the second half of the 19th century. A population of over eight million in 1841 was reduced to slightly over four million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was caused by death from the Great Famine of 1845 to 1852, which took roughly one million lives. The remaining decline of around three million was due to the entrenched culture of emigration caused by the dire economic state of the country, lasting until the late 20th century.\n\n\nEmigration from Ireland in the 19th century contributed to the populations of England, the United States, Canada and Australia, in all of which a large Irish diaspora lives. As of 2006[update], 4.3 million Canadians, or 14% of the population, were of Irish descent,[151] while around one-third of the Australian population had an element of Irish descent.[152] As of 2013[update], there were 40 million Irish-Americans[153] and 33 million Americans who claimed Irish ancestry.[154]\n\n\nWith growing prosperity since the last decade of the 20th century, Ireland became a destination for immigrants. Since the European Union expanded to include Poland in 2004, Polish people have comprised the largest number of immigrants (over 150,000)[155] from Central Europe. There has also been significant immigration from Lithuania, Czech Republic and Latvia.[156]\n\n\nThe Republic of Ireland in particular has seen large-scale immigration, with 420,000 foreign nationals as of 2006, about 10% of the population.[157] Nearly a quarter of births (24 percent) in 2009 were to mothers born outside of Ireland.[158] Up to 50,000 eastern and central European migrant workers left Ireland in response to the Irish financial crisis.[159]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Ireland\n\n![](image)Proportion of respondents who said they could speak Irish in the Ireland census in 2011 or the Northern Ireland census in 2011\nThe two official languages of the Republic of Ireland are Irish and English. Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the Iron Age. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the Scottish Gaelic and Manx languages respectively.\n\n\nThe Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into Old Irish from the 6th to 10th century, Middle Irish from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from Latin, Old Norse, French and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.\n\n\nThe Gaelic Revival of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with most students showing little evidence of fluency even after fourteen years of instruction.[160]\n\n\nThere is now a growing population of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin[161][162] and Belfast,[163] with the children of such Irish speakers sometimes attending Irish-medium schools (*Gaelscoil*). It has been argued that they tend to be more highly educated than monolingual English speakers.[164] Recent research suggests that urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own, both in pronunciation and grammar.[165]\n\n\nTraditional rural Irish-speaking areas, known collectively as the *Gaeltacht*, are in linguistic decline. The main *Gaeltacht* areas are in the west, south-west and north-west, in Galway, Mayo, Donegal, western Cork and Kerry with smaller *Gaeltacht* areas near Dungarvan in Waterford and in Meath.[166]\n\n\nEnglish in Ireland was first introduced during the Norman invasion. It was spoken by a few peasants and merchants brought over from England and was largely replaced by Irish before the Tudor conquest of Ireland. It was introduced as the official language during the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced Irish with English as the first language for a vast majority of the population.[167]\n\n\nFewer than 2% of the population of the Republic of Ireland today speak Irish on a daily basis, and under 10% regularly, outside of the education system[168] and 38% of those over 15 years are classified as \"Irish speakers\". In Northern Ireland, English is the de facto official language, but official recognition is afforded to Irish, including specific protective measures under Part III of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. A lesser status (including recognition under Part II of the Charter) is given to Ulster Scots dialects, which are spoken by roughly 2% of Northern Ireland residents, and also spoken by some in the Republic of Ireland.[169] Since the 1960s with the increase in immigration, many more languages have been introduced, particularly deriving from Asia and Eastern Europe.\n\n\nAlso native to Ireland are Shelta, the language of the nomadic Irish Travellers,[170] Irish Sign Language, and Northern Ireland Sign Language.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of Ireland and Culture of Northern Ireland\n\n![Tall stone cross, with intricate carved patterns, protected by metal railings surrounded by short cut grass. Trees are to either side, cows in open countryside are in the middle distance.](image)Ardboe High Cross, County Tyrone\nIreland's culture comprises elements of the culture of ancient peoples, later immigrant and broadcast cultural influences (chiefly Gaelic culture, Anglicisation, Americanisation and aspects of broader European culture). In broad terms, Ireland is regarded as one of the Celtic nations of Europe, alongside Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Isle of Man and Brittany. This combination of cultural influences is visible in the intricate designs termed *Irish interlace* or *Celtic knotwork.* These can be seen in the ornamentation of medieval religious and secular works. The style is still popular today in jewellery and graphic art,[171] as is the distinctive style of traditional Irish music and dance, and has become indicative of modern \"Celtic\" culture in general.\n\n\nReligion has played a significant role in the cultural life of the island since ancient times (and since the 17th century plantations, has been the focus of political identity and divisions on the island). Ireland's pre-Christian heritage fused with the Celtic Church following the missions of Saint Patrick in the fifth century. The Hiberno-Scottish missions, begun by the Irish monk Saint Columba, spread the Irish vision of Christianity to pagan England and the Frankish Empire. These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the Dark Ages that followed the fall of Rome, earning Ireland the sobriquet, \"the island of saints and scholars\".\n\n\nSince the 20th century Irish pubs worldwide have become outposts of Irish culture, especially those with a full range of cultural and gastronomic offerings.\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Illuminated page from Book of Kells\n#### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Literature of Ireland\n\nIreland has made a substantial contribution to world literature in all its branches, both in Irish and English. Poetry in Irish is among the oldest vernacular poetry in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.[*citation needed*]\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include Gofraidh Fionn \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh (fourteenth century), D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair (seventeenth century) and Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille (eighteenth century). Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill (c.\u20091743\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20091800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. [*citation needed*] By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the Gaelic revival, which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain, M\u00e1ire Mhac an tSaoi and others. Irish-language publishers such as Coisc\u00e9im and Cl\u00f3 Iar-Chonnacht continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\n\nIn English, Jonathan Swift, often called the foremost satirist in the English language, gained fame for works such as *Gulliver's Travels* and *A Modest Proposal*. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo-Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as Charles Kickham, William Carleton, and (in collaboration) Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin. The playwright and poet Oscar Wilde, noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the Nobel Prize for Literature: George Bernard Shaw, William Butler Yeats, Samuel Beckett and Seamus Heaney. Although not a Nobel Prize winner, James Joyce is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel *Ulysses* is considered one of the most important works of Modernist literature and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as \"Bloomsday\".[172] A comparable writer in Irish is M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain, whose 1949 novel *Cr\u00e9 na Cille* is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.\n\n\nModern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage[173] through English-language writers such as John McGahern and Seamus Heaney and Irish-language writers such as M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in and others from the Gaeltacht.\n\n\n\n![](image)James Joyce, one of the most significant writers of the 20th century\n#### Music and dance[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of Ireland and Irish dance\n\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.[174] Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\",[175] there was a considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as Gregorian chant. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (*goltraige*), laughing music (*geantraige*) and sleeping music (*suantraige*).[176] Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various string instruments) was transmitted orally, but the Irish harp, in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as Dublin Castle, St Patrick's Cathedral and Christ Church as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of Handel's *Messiah* (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known Irish composers of this time belong to emigrants.\n\n\nIrish traditional music and dance have seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas.[177] However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as the Dubliners, the Chieftains, the Wolfe Tones, the Clancy Brothers, Sweeney's Men and individuals like Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada and Christy Moore. Groups and musicians including Horslips, Van Morrison and Thin Lizzy incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary rock music and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like Enya, the Saw Doctors, the Corrs, Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, Clannad, the Cranberries and the Pogues among others.\n\n\n\n#### Art[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Art of Ireland and Architecture of Ireland\n\n  \n\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as Newgrange[178] and is traced through Bronze Age artefacts and the religious carvings and illuminated manuscripts of the medieval period. During the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, a strong tradition of painting emerged, including such figures as John Butler Yeats, William Orpen, Jack Yeats and Louis le Brocquy. Contemporary Irish visual artists of note include Sean Scully, Kevin Abosch, and Alice Maher.\n\n\n\n#### Drama and theatre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Irish theatre\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's national theatre is the Abbey Theatre, which was founded in 1904, and the national Irish-language theatre is *An Taibhdhearc*, which was established in 1928 in Galway.[179][180] Playwrights such as Se\u00e1n O'Casey, Brian Friel, Sebastian Barry, Conor McPherson and Billy Roche are internationally renowned.[181]\n\n\n\n### Science[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert Boyle formulated Boyle's Law.\nThe Irish philosopher and theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena was considered one of the leading intellectuals of the early Middle Ages. Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton, an Irish explorer, was one of the principal figures of Antarctic exploration. He, along with his expedition, made the first ascent of Mount Erebus and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole. Robert Boyle was a 17th-century natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, inventor and early gentleman scientist. He is largely regarded as one of the founders of modern chemistry and is best known for the formulation of Boyle's law.[182]\n\n\n19th-century physicist, John Tyndall, discovered the Tyndall effect. Father Nicholas Joseph Callan, professor of natural philosophy in Maynooth College, is best known for his invention of the induction coil, transformer and he discovered an early method of galvanisation in the 19th century.\n\n\nOther notable Irish physicists include Ernest Walton, winner of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics. With Sir John Douglas Cockcroft, he was the first to split the nucleus of the atom by artificial means and made contributions to the development of a new theory of wave equation.[183] William Thomson, or Lord Kelvin, is the person whom the absolute temperature unit, the kelvin, is named after. Sir Joseph Larmor, a physicist and mathematician, made innovations in the understanding of electricity, dynamics, thermodynamics and the electron theory of matter. His most influential work was Aether and Matter, a book on theoretical physics published in 1900.[184]\n\n\nGeorge Johnstone Stoney introduced the term *electron* in 1891. John Stewart Bell was the originator of Bell's Theorem and a paper concerning the discovery of the Bell-Jackiw-Adler anomaly and was nominated for a Nobel prize.[185] The astronomer Jocelyn Bell Burnell, from Lurgan, County Armagh, discovered pulsars in 1967. Notable mathematicians include Sir William Rowan Hamilton, famous for work in classical mechanics and the invention of quaternions. Francis Ysidro Edgeworth's contribution, the Edgeworth Box. remains influential in neo-classical microeconomic theory to this day; while Richard Cantillon inspired Adam Smith, among others. John B. Cosgrave was a specialist in number theory and discovered a 2000-digit prime number in 1999 and a record composite Fermat number in 2003. John Lighton Synge made progress in different fields of science, including mechanics and geometrical methods in general relativity. He had mathematician John Nash as one of his students. Kathleen Lonsdale, born in Ireland and most known for her work with crystallography, became the first female president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.[186]\n\n\nIreland has nine universities, seven in the Republic of Ireland and two in Northern Ireland, including Trinity College Dublin and the University College Dublin, as well as numerous third-level colleges and institutes and a branch of the Open University, the Open University in Ireland. Ireland was ranked 22nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, down from 12th in 2019.[187][188]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Ireland\n\nSee also: List of Irish sports people\n\nGaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance and community involvement, with about 2,600 clubs on the island. In 2003 it represented 34% of total sports attendances at events in Ireland and abroad, followed by hurling at 23%, soccer at 16% and rugby at 8%.[189] The All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event in the sporting calendar.[190] Soccer is the most widely played team game on the island and the most popular in Northern Ireland.[189][191]\n\n\nOther sporting activities with the highest levels of playing participation include swimming, golf, aerobics, cycling, and billiards/snooker.[192] Many other sports are also played and followed, including boxing, cricket, fishing, greyhound racing, handball, hockey, horse racing, motor sport, show jumping and tennis.\n\n\nThe island fields a single international team in most sports. One notable exception to this is association football, although both associations continued to field international teams under the name \"Ireland\" until the 1950s. The sport is also the most notable exception where the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland field separate international teams. Northern Ireland has produced two World Snooker Champions.\n\n\n\n#### Field sports[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Gaelic games, Rugby in Ireland, and Football in Ireland\n\n![](image)Tyrone v Kerry in the 2005 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final\nGaelic football, hurling and Gaelic handball are the best-known Irish traditional sports, collectively known as Gaelic games. Gaelic games are governed by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), with the exception of women's Gaelic football and camogie (women's variant of hurling), which are governed by separate organisations. The headquarters of the GAA (and the main stadium) is located at [193] Croke Park in north Dublin and has a capacity of 82,500. Many major GAA games are played there, including the semi-finals and finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship. During the redevelopment of the Lansdowne Road stadium in 2007\u20132010, international rugby and soccer were played there.[194] All GAA players, even at the highest level, are amateurs, receiving no wages, although they are permitted to receive a limited amount of sport-related income from commercial sponsorship.\n\n\nThe Irish Football Association (IFA) was originally the governing body for soccer across the island. The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with Cliftonville F.C. in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an Irish Cup semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast,[195] Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the Home Nations' associations, the FAI was recognised by FIFA in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against Italy). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as *Ireland*.\n\n\n\n![](image)Paul O'Connell reaching for the ball during a line out against Argentina in 2007\nIn 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI's team be known only as \"Republic of Ireland\" and that the IFA's team be known as \"Northern Ireland\" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the World Cup finals in 1958 (reaching the quarter-finals), 1982 and 1986 and the European Championship in 2016. The Republic qualified for the World Cup finals in 1990 (reaching the quarter-finals), 1994, 2002 and the European Championship in 1988, 2012 and 2016. Across Ireland, there is significant interest in the English and, to a lesser extent, Scottish soccer leagues.\n\n\nIreland fields a single national rugby team and a single association, the Irish Rugby Football Union, governs the sport across the island. The Irish rugby team have played in every Rugby World Cup, making the quarter-finals in six of them. Ireland also hosted games during the 1991 and the 1999 Rugby World Cups (including a quarter-final). There are four professional Irish teams; all four play in the Pro14 and at least three compete for the Heineken Cup. Irish rugby has become increasingly competitive at both the international and provincial levels since the sport went professional in 1994. During that time, Ulster (1999),[196] Munster (2006[197] and 2008)[196] and Leinster (2009, 2011 and 2012)[196] have won the Heineken Cup. In addition to this, the Irish International side has had increased success in the Six Nations Championship against the other European elite sides. This success, including Triple Crowns in 2004, 2006 and 2007, culminated with a clean sweep of victories, known as a Grand Slam, in 2009 and 2018.[198]\n\n\n\n#### Boxing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boxing in Ireland\n\nAmateur boxing on the island of Ireland is governed by the Irish Athletic Boxing Association. Ireland has won more medals in boxing than in any other Olympic sport. Michael Carruth won a gold medal and Wayne McCullough won a silver medal in the Barcelona Olympic Games. In 2008 Kenneth Egan won a silver medal in the Beijing Games.[199] Paddy Barnes secured bronze in those games and gold in the 2010 European Amateur Boxing Championships (where Ireland came 2nd in the overall medal table) and 2010 Commonwealth Games. Katie Taylor has won gold in every European and World championship since 2005. In August 2012 at the Olympic Games in London, Taylor created history by becoming the first Irish woman to win a gold medal in boxing in the 60\u00a0kg lightweight.[200] More recently, Kellie Harrington won a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.[201]\n\n\n\n#### Other sports[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Horse racing in Ireland, Athletics in Ireland, and Golf in Ireland\n\n![](image)Horse racing in Sligo\nHorse racing and greyhound racing are both popular in Ireland. There are frequent horse race meetings and greyhound stadiums are well-attended. The island is noted for the breeding and training of race horses and is also a large exporter of racing dogs.[202] The horse racing sector is largely concentrated in the County Kildare.[203]\n\n\nIrish athletics is an all-Ireland sport governed by Athletics Ireland. Sonia O'Sullivan won two medals at 5,000 metres on the track; gold at the 1995 World Championships and silver at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Gillian O'Sullivan won silver in the 20k walk at the 2003 World Championships, while sprint hurdler Derval O'Rourke won gold at the 2006 World Indoor Championship in Moscow. Olive Loughnane won a silver medal in the 20k walk at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin in 2009.[204]\n\n\nGolf is very popular, and golf tourism is a major industry attracting more than 240,000 golfing visitors annually.[205] The 2006 Ryder Cup was held at The K Club in County Kildare.[206] P\u00e1draig Harrington became the first Irishman since Fred Daly in 1947 to win the British Open at Carnoustie in July 2007.[207] He successfully defended his title in July 2008[208] before going on to win the PGA Championship in August.[209] Harrington became the first European to win the PGA Championship in 78 years and was the first winner from Ireland. Three golfers from Northern Ireland have been particularly successful. In 2010, Graeme McDowell became the first Irish golfer to win the U.S. Open, and the first European to win that tournament since 1970. Rory McIlroy, at the age of 22, won the 2011 U.S. Open, while Darren Clarke's latest victory was the 2011 Open Championship at Royal St. George's. In August 2012, McIlroy won his 2nd major championship by winning the USPGA Championship by a record margin of 8 shots.\n\n\n\n#### Recreation[edit]\n\n\nThe west coast of Ireland, Lahinch and Donegal Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing. Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks along the coast of Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast.[210]\n\n\nWith thousands of lakes, over 14,000 kilometres (8,700\u00a0mi) of fish-bearing rivers and over 7,500 kilometres (4,660\u00a0mi) of coastline, Ireland is a popular angling destination. The temperate Irish climate is suited to sport angling. While salmon and trout fishing remain popular with anglers, salmon fishing, in particular, received a boost in 2006 with the closing of the salmon driftnet fishery. Coarse fishing continues to increase its profile. Sea angling is developed with many beaches mapped and signposted,[211] and the range of sea angling species is around 80.[212]\n\n\n\n### Food and drink[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Irish cuisine\n\n![](image)Gubbeen cheese, an example of the resurgence in Irish cheese making\nFood and cuisine in Ireland take their influence from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate and from the social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing.[213] Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.[213]\n\n\nFor this reason, pork and white meat were more common than beef, and thick fatty strips of salted bacon (known as rashers) and the eating of salted butter (i.e. a dairy product rather than beef itself) have been a central feature of the diet in Ireland since the Middle Ages.[213] The practice of bleeding cattle and mixing the blood with milk and butter (not unlike the practice of the Maasai) was common[214] and black pudding, made from blood, grain (usually barley) and seasoning, remains a breakfast staple in Ireland. All of these influences can be seen today in the phenomenon of the \"breakfast roll\".\n\n\nThe introduction of the potato in the second half of the 16th century heavily influenced cuisine thereafter. Great poverty encouraged a subsistence approach to food, and by the mid-19th century, the vast majority of the population sufficed with a diet of potatoes and milk.[215] A typical family, consisting of a man, a woman and four children, would eat 18 stone (110\u00a0kg) of potatoes per week.[213] Consequently, dishes that are considered as national dishes represent a fundamental simplicity to cooking, such as the Irish stew, bacon and cabbage, boxty, a type of potato pancake, or colcannon, a dish of mashed potatoes and kale or cabbage.[213]\n\n\nSince the last quarter of the 20th century, with a re-emergence of wealth in Ireland, a \"New Irish Cuisine\" based on traditional ingredients incorporating international influences[216] has emerged.[217] This cuisine is based on fresh vegetables, fish (especially salmon, trout, oysters, mussels and other shellfish), as well as traditional soda breads and the wide range of hand-made cheeses that are now being produced across the country. An example of this new cuisine is \"Dublin Lawyer\": lobster cooked in whiskey and cream.[218] The potato remains however a fundamental feature of this cuisine and the Irish remain the highest per capita[213] consumers of potatoes in Europe. Traditional regional foods can be found throughout the country, for example coddle in Dublin or drisheen in Cork, both a type of sausage, or blaa, a doughy white bread particular to Waterford.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Old Bushmills Distillery in County Antrim\nIreland once dominated the world's market for whiskey, producing 90% of the world's whiskey at the start of the 20th century. However, as a consequence of bootleggers during the prohibition in the United States (who sold poor-quality whiskey bearing Irish-sounding names thus eroding the pre-prohibition popularity for Irish brands)[219] and tariffs on Irish whiskey across the British Empire during the Anglo-Irish Trade War of the 1930s,[220] sales of Irish whiskey worldwide fell to a mere 2% by the mid-20th century.[221] In 1953, an Irish government survey, found that 50% of whiskey drinkers in the United States had never heard of Irish whiskey.[222]\n\n\nIrish whiskey, as researched in 2009 by the CNBC American broadcaster, remains popular domestically and has grown in international sales steadily over a few decades.[223] Typically CNBC states Irish whiskey is not as smoky as a Scotch whisky, but not as sweet as American or Canadian whiskies.[223] Whiskey forms the basis of cream liqueurs, such as Baileys, and the \"Irish coffee\" (a cocktail of coffee and whiskey reputedly invented at Foynes flying-boat station) is probably the best-known Irish cocktail.\n\n\nStout, a kind of porter beer, particularly Guinness, is typically associated with Ireland, although historically it was more closely associated with London. Porter remains very popular, although it has lost sales since the mid-20th century to lager. Cider, particularly *Magners* (marketed in the Republic of Ireland as *Bulmers*), is also a popular drink. Red lemonade, a soft-drink, is consumed on its own and as a mixer, particularly with whiskey.[224]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of the Republic of Ireland and Economy of Northern Ireland\n\nSee also: International Financial Services Centre, Dublin\n\n![](image)A proportional representation of Ireland exports, 2019\n### Overview and GDP[edit]\n\n\nThe GDP of the Republic of Ireland as of 2021[update] was \u20ac423.5 billion (nominal),[225] and in Northern Ireland in 2021, it was \u00a352 billion (GVA Balanced).[226] The GDP per capita in the Republic of Ireland was \u20ac84,049.9 (nominal) as of 2021[update],[225] and in Northern Ireland 2021 was \u00a327,154 (GVA Balanced).[226] The Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom measure these numbers differently.\n\n\nDespite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the euro and pound sterling), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-Ireland basis. This has been facilitated by the two jurisdictions' former shared membership of the European Union, and there have been calls from members of the business community and policymakers for the creation of an \"all-Ireland economy\" to take advantage of economies of scale and boost competitiveness.[227]\n\n\n\n#### Regional economics[edit]\n\n\nBelow is a comparison of the regional GDP on the island of Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Republic of Ireland: Northern and Western | Republic of Ireland: Eastern and Midland | Republic of Ireland: Southern | United Kingdom: Northern Ireland\n |\n| GDP (2018[update]): \u20ac22 bn[228] | GDP (2018[update]): \u20ac175 bn[228] | GDP (2018[update]): \u20ac127 bn[228] | GDP (2021[update]): \u00a352 bn[226] |\n| \u20ac24,926 per person[229] | \u20ac74,824 per person[229] | \u20ac77,794 per person[229] | \u00a327,154 per person[226] |\n\n\n#### Northern Ireland trade comparison[edit]\n\n\nBelow is a comparison of the goods being sold and purchased between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, compared with the goods being exported and imported between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland:\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland Sales/Exports[230]\n|  | United Kingdom\n | Republic of Ireland\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2020\n | \u00a311.3 billion | \u00a34.2 billion\n |\n| 2021\n | \u00a312.8 billion\n | \u00a35.2 billion\n |\n\nNorthern Ireland Purchases/Imports[230]\n|  | United Kingdom\n | Republic of Ireland\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2020\n | \u00a313.4 billion | \u00a32.5 billion\n |\n| 2021\n | \u00a314.4 billion\n | \u00a33.1 billion\n |\n\n#### Cost of living comparison[edit]\n\n\nBelow is a comparison of the monthly cost of living and average wage after tax in Northern Ireland versus those in the Republic of Ireland in 2023:\n\n\n\nMonthly Cost of Living Comparison[231][232]\n|  | Northern Ireland\n | Republic of Ireland\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cost of living (1 person)\n | $1459 | $2198\n |\n| Average wage after tax\n | $2393\n | $3010\n |\n\n### Economic history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economic history of Ireland\n\nPrior to partition in 1921, Ireland had a long history as an economic colony \u2013 first, partially, of the Norse, via their cities (9th to 10th centuries CE), and later, to varying extents, of polities related to England. Though the climate and soil favoured certain forms of agriculture,[233] trade barriers frequently hobbled its development. Repeated invasions and plantations disrupted land-ownership, and multiple failed uprisings also contributed to repeated phases of deportation and of emigration.\n\n\nSalient events in the economic history of Ireland include:\n\n\n\n* 16th and 17th centuries: confiscation and redistribution of land in the Plantations of Ireland\n* 1845\u20131849: The Great Famine occasioned depopulation and mass emigration\n* 1846: Westminster's repeal of the Corn Laws disrupted Irish agriculture[234]\n\n\n### Major industries[edit]\n\n\n#### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourist destinations in Ireland\n\n![](image)Inisheer (*Inis O\u00edrr*), Aran Islands\nThere are three World Heritage Sites on the island: the *Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne* complex, Skellig Michael and the Giant's Causeway.[235] Several other places are on the tentative list, for example the Burren, the Ceide Fields[236] and Mount Stewart.[237]\n\n\nSome of the most visited sites in Ireland include Bunratty Castle, the Rock of Cashel, the Cliffs of Moher, Holy Cross Abbey and Blarney Castle.[238] Historically important monastic sites include Glendalough and Clonmacnoise, which are maintained as national monuments in the Republic of Ireland.[239]\n\n\nThe Dublin region receives the most tourists[238] and is home to several of the most popular attractions such as the Guinness Storehouse and Book of Kells.[238] The west and south west, which includes the Lakes of Killarney and the Dingle peninsula in County Kerry and Connemara and the Aran Islands in County Galway, are also popular tourist destinations.[238]\n\n\nAchill Island lies off the coast of County Mayo and is Ireland's largest island. It is a popular tourist destination for surfing and contains 5 Blue Flag beaches and Croaghaun one of the world's highest sea cliffs. Stately homes, built during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries in Palladian, Neoclassical and neo-Gothic styles, such as Castle Ward, Castletown House, Bantry House, Strokestown Park and Glenveagh Castle are also of interest to tourists. Some have been converted into hotels, such as Ashford Castle,[240] Castle Leslie[241] and Dromoland Castle.[242]\n\n\n\n#### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Ireland\n\nAlthough for most of their existence electricity networks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate, the island has operated for some time as a single market for electricity.[243] Both networks were designed and constructed independently post-partition but they are now connected with three interlinks[244] and are also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations, and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. EirGrid has started building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW,[245] about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.\n\n\nAs with electricity, the natural gas distribution network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim.[246] Most of Ireland's gas comes through interconnectors between Twynholm in Scotland and Ballylumford, County Antrim and Loughshinny, County Dublin. Supplies come from the Corrib Gas Field, off the coast of County Mayo, with a supply previously also coming from the Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast.[247][248] The County Mayo field faces some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore.\n\n\n\n![](image)Turf-cutting near Maam Cross by the road to Leenane, County Galway\nIreland has an ancient industry based on peat (known locally as \"turf\") as a source of energy for home fires. A form of biomass energy, this source of heat is still widely used in rural areas. However, because of the ecological importance of peatlands in storing carbon and their rarity, the EU is attempting to protect this habitat by fining Ireland for digging up peat. In cities, heat is generally supplied by natural gas or heating oil, although some urban suppliers distribute sods of turf as \"smokeless fuel\" for domestic use.\n\n\nThe Republic has a strong commitment to renewable energy and ranks as one of the top 10 markets for clean-technology investment in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index.[249] Research and development in renewable energy (such as wind power) has increased since 2004. Large wind farms have been constructed in Cork, Donegal, Mayo and Antrim. The construction of wind farms has in some cases been delayed by opposition from local communities, some of whom regard the wind turbines as unsightly. The Republic is hindered by an ageing network that was not designed to handle the varying availability of power that comes from wind farms. The ESB's Turlough Hill facility is the only power-storage facility in the state.[250]\n\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Numbers vary, from a low of 12,000.[69] Giovanni Battista Rinuccini wrote 50,000,[70] T.

It occupies the Qatar Peninsula on the northeastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula in the Middle East; it shares its sole land border with Saudi Arabia to the south, with the rest of its territory surrounded by the Persian Gulf. The Gulf of Bahrain, an inlet of the Persian Gulf, separates Qatar from nearby Bahrain. The capital is Doha, home to over 80% of the country's inhabitants, and the land area is mostly made up of flat, low-lying desert.\n\n\nQatar has been ruled as a hereditary monarchy by the House of Thani since Mohammed bin Thani signed \"an agreement, not a formal treaty\"[18] with Britain in 1868 that recognised its separate status. Following Ottoman rule, Qatar became a British protectorate in 1916, and gained independence in 1971. The current emir is Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who holds nearly all executive and legislative authority under the Constitution of Qatar, as well as controlling the judiciary.[19] He appoints the prime minister and cabinet. The partially-elected Consultative Assembly can block legislation and has a limited ability to dismiss ministers.\n\n\nIn early 2017, the total population of Qatar was 2.6 million, with 313,000 of them Qatari citizens and 2.3 million expatriates.[20] Its official religion is Islam.[21] In terms of income, the country has the fourth-highest GDP (PPP) per capita in the world,[22] and the eleventh-highest GNI per capita (Atlas method).[23] Qatar ranks 42nd in the Human Development Index, the third-highest HDI in the Arab world.[24] It is a high-income economy, backed by the world's third-largest natural gas reserves and oil reserves.[25] Qatar is one of the world's largest exporters of liquefied natural gas,[26] and the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide per capita.[27]\n\n\nIn the 21st century, Qatar emerged as a middle power in the Arab world through its resource-wealth,[28][29] as well as its globally expanding media group, Al Jazeera Media Network, and reportedly supporting several rebel groups financially during the Arab Spring.[30][31][32] Qatar forms part of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Qatar is a Dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Qatar's human rights record has been regarded by academics and non-governmental organisations as being generally poor, with restrictions on civil liberties such as the freedoms of association, expression and the press, as well as its treatment of thousands of migrant workers amounting to forced labour for projects in the country.[33][34]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nPliny the Elder, a Roman writer, documented the earliest account pertaining to the inhabitants of the peninsula around the mid-first century AD, referring to them as the *Catharrei*, a designation that may have derived from the name of a prominent local settlement.[35][36] A century later, Ptolemy produced the first known map to depict the peninsula, referring to it as *Catara*.[36][37] The map also referenced a town named \"Cadara\" to the east of the peninsula.[38] The term \"Catara\" (inhabitants, *Cataraei*)[39] was exclusively used until the 18th century, after which \"Katara\" emerged as the most commonly recognised spelling.[38] Eventually, after several variations \u2014 \"Katr\", \"Kattar\" and \"Guttur\" \u2014 the modern derivative *Qatar* was adopted as the country's name.[40]\n\n\nIn Modern Standard Arabic, the name is pronounced [\u02c8q\u0251t\u02e4\u0251r], while in the local dialect it is [\u02c8\u0261\u026at\u02e4\u0251r].[17]\n\n\nEnglish speakers use different approximate pronunciations of the name as the Arabic pronunciations use sounds not often used in English.[41]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Qatar\n\n### Antiquity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Excavation of a Kassite dye site on Al Khor Island\nHuman habitation in Qatar dates back to 50,000 years ago.[42] Settlements and tools dating back to the Stone Age have been unearthed in the peninsula.[42] Mesopotamian artifacts originating from the Ubaid period (c. 6500\u20133800 BC) have been discovered in abandoned coastal settlements.[43] Al Da'asa, a settlement located on the western coast of Qatar, is the most important Ubaid site in the country and is believed to have accommodated a small seasonal encampment.[44][45]\n\n\nKassite Babylonian material dating back to the second millennium BC found in Al Khor Islands attests to trade relations between the inhabitants of Qatar and the Kassites in modern-day Bahrain.[46] Among the findings were 3,000,000 crushed snail shells and Kassite potsherds.[44] It has been suggested that Qatar is the earliest known site of shellfish dye production, owing to a Kassite purple dye industry which existed on the coast.[43][47]\n\n\nIn 224 AD, the Sasanian Empire gained control over the territories surrounding the Persian Gulf.[48] Qatar played a role in the commercial activity of the Sasanids, contributing at least two commodities: precious pearls and purple dye.[*citation needed*] Under the Sasanid reign, many of the inhabitants in Eastern Arabia were introduced to Christianity following the eastward dispersal of the religion by Mesopotamian Christians.[49] Monasteries were constructed and further settlements were founded during this era.[50][51] During the latter part of the Christian era, Qatar comprised a region known as 'Beth Qatraye' (Syriac for \"house of the Qataris\").[52] The region was not limited to Qatar; it also included Bahrain, Tarout Island, Al-Khatt, and Al-Hasa.[53]\n\n\nIn 628, the Islamic prophet Muhammad sent a Muslim envoy to a ruler in Eastern Arabia named Munzir ibn Sawa Al-Tamimi and requested that he and his subjects accept Islam. Munzir obliged his request, and accordingly, most of the Arab tribes in the region converted to Islam.[54] In the middle of the century, the Muslim conquest of Persia would result in the fall of the Sasanian Empire.[55]\n\n\n\n### Early and late Islamic period (661\u20131783)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Abbasid Caliphate at its greatest extent, c. 850\nQatar was described as a famous horse and camel breeding centre during the Umayyad period.[56] In the 8th century, it started benefiting from its commercially strategic position in the Persian Gulf and went on to become a centre of pearl trading.[57][58]\n\n\nSubstantial development in the pearling industry around the Qatari Peninsula occurred during the Abbasid era.[56] Ships voyaging from Basra to India and China would make stops in Qatar's ports during this period. Chinese porcelain, West African coins, and artefacts from Thailand have been discovered in Qatar.[55] Archaeological remains from the 9th century suggest that Qatar's inhabitants used greater wealth to construct higher quality homes and public buildings. Over 100 stone-built houses, two mosques, and an Abbasid fort were constructed in Murwab during this period.[59][60] When the caliphate's prosperity declined in Iraq, so too did it in Qatar.[61]\nQatar is mentioned in 13th-century Muslim scholar Yaqut al-Hamawi's book, *Mu'jam Al-Buldan*, which alludes to the Qataris' fine striped woven cloaks and their skills in improvement and finishing of spears.[62]\n\n\nMuch of Eastern Arabia was controlled by the Usfurids in 1253, but control of the region was seized by the prince of Ormus in 1320.[63] Qatar's pearls provided the kingdom with one of its main sources of income.[64] In 1515, Manuel I of Portugal vassalised the Kingdom of Ormus. Portugal went on to seize a significant portion of Eastern Arabia in 1521.[64][65] In 1550, the inhabitants of Al-Hasa voluntarily submitted to the rule of the Ottomans, preferring them to the Portuguese.[66] Having retained a negligible military presence in the area, the Ottomans were expelled by the Bani Khalid tribe and their emirate in 1670.[67]\n\n\n\n### Bahraini and Saudi rule (1783\u20131868)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1794 map by Samuel Dunn depicting *Catura* (at centre) in the Historical region of Bahrain.\nIn 1766, members of the Al Khalifa family of the Utub tribal confederation migrated from Kuwait to Zubarah in Qatar.[68][69] By the time of their arrival, the Bani Khalid exercised weak authority over the peninsula, notwithstanding the fact that the largest village was ruled by their distant kin.[70] In 1783, Qatar-based Bani Utbah clans and allied Arab tribes invaded and annexed Bahrain from the Persians. The Al Khalifa imposed their authority over Bahrain and retained their jurisdiction over Zubarah.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)A partially restored section of the ruined town of Zubarah.\nFollowing his swearing-in as crown prince of the Wahhabi in 1788, Saud ibn Abd al-Aziz moved to expand Wahhabi territory eastward towards the Persian Gulf and Qatar. After defeating the Bani Khalid in 1795, the Wahhabi were attacked on two fronts. The Ottomans and Egyptians assaulted the western front, while the Al Khalifa in Bahrain and the Omanis launched an attack against the eastern front.[71][72] Upon being made aware of the Egyptian advance on the western frontier in 1811, the Wahhabi amir reduced his garrisons in Bahrain and Zubarah in order to redeploy his troops. Said bin Sultan, ruler of Muscat, capitalised on this opportunity and raided the Wahhabi garrisons on the eastern coast, setting fire to the fort in Zubarah. The Al Khalifa was effectively returned to power thereafter.[72]\n\n\nAs punishment for piracy, an East India Company vessel bombarded Doha in 1821, destroying the town and forcing hundreds of residents to flee. In 1825, the House of Thani was established with Sheikh Mohammed bin Thani as the first leader.[73]\n\n\nAlthough Qatar was considered a dependency of Bahrain, the Al Khalifa faced opposition from the local tribes. In 1867, the Al Khalifa, along with the ruler of Abu Dhabi, sent a massive naval force to Al Wakrah in an effort to crush the Qatari rebels. This resulted in the maritime Qatari\u2013Bahraini War of 1867\u20131868, in which Bahraini and Abu Dhabi forces sacked and looted Doha and Al Wakrah.[74] The Bahraini hostilities were in violation of the Perpetual Truce of Peace and Friendship of 1861. The joint incursion, in addition to the Qatari counter-attack, prompted British Political Resident, Colonel Lewis Pelly to impose a settlement in 1868. His mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the resulting peace treaty were milestones because they implicitly recognised the distinctness of Qatar from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani. In addition to censuring Bahrain for its breach of agreement, Pelly negotiated with Qatari sheikhs, who were represented by Mohammed bin Thani.[75] The negotiations were the first stage in the development of Qatar as a sheikhdom.[76] However, Qatar was not officially recognised as a British protectorate until 1916.[77]\n\n\n\n### The Ottoman period (1871\u20131915)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Qatar in an 1891 map by Adolf Stieler, with Al Bidda as the major settlement\n![](image)Old city of Doha, January 1904\n![](image)Barzan Towers are watchtowers that were built in the late 19th century and renovated in 1910 by Sheikh Mohammed bin Jassim Al Thani\nUnder military and political pressure from the governor of the Ottoman Vilayet of Baghdad, Midhat Pasha, the ruling Al Thani tribe submitted to Ottoman rule in 1871.[78] The Ottoman government imposed reformist (Tanzimat) measures concerning taxation and land registration to fully integrate these areas into the empire.[78] Despite the disapproval of local tribes, Al Thani continued supporting the Ottoman rule. Qatari-Ottoman relations, however, soon stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of Abu Dhabi-occupied Khawr al Udayd. In addition, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as kaymakam of Qatar in 1888.[79] This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, whom he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.[80]\n\n\nIn February 1893, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha arrived in Qatar in the interests of seeking unpaid taxes and accosting Jassim bin Mohammed's opposition to proposed Ottoman administrative reforms. Fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, Jassim retreated to Al Wajbah (16\u00a0km or 10\u00a0mi west of Doha), accompanied by several tribe members. Mehmed's demand that Jassim disbands his troops and pledge his loyalty to the Ottomans was met with refusal. In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim's brother and 13 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman corvette *Merrikh* as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 liras, he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim's Al Wajbah Fort under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the Battle of Al Wajbah.[55]\n\n\nEffendi's troops came under heavy gunfire by a sizable troop of Qatari infantry and cavalry shortly after arriving at Al Wajbah. They retreated to Shebaka fortress, where they were again forced to draw back from a Qatari incursion. After they withdrew to Al Bidda fortress, Jassim's advancing column besieged the fortress, resulting in the Ottomans' concession of defeat and agreement to relinquish their captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to Hofuf by land.[81] Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the Ottoman Empire, the result of the battle forced a treaty that would later form the basis of Qatar's emerging as an autonomous country within the empire.[82]\n\n\n\n### British period (1916\u20131971)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zubarah Fort built in 1938.\nBy the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, the Ottomans agreed to renounce their claim to Qatar and withdraw their garrison from Doha. However, with the outbreak of World War I, nothing was done to carry this out and the garrison remained in the fort at Doha, although its numbers dwindled as men deserted. In 1915, with the presence of British gunboats in the harbour, Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani (who was pro-British) persuaded the remainder to abandon the fort and, when British troops approached the following morning, they found it deserted.[83][84]\n\n\nQatar became a British protectorate on 3 November 1916, when the United Kingdom signed a treaty with Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani to bring Qatar under its Trucial System of Administration. While Abdullah agreed not to enter into any relations with any other power without the prior consent of the British government, the latter guaranteed the protection of Qatar from aggression by sea and provide its 'good offices' in the event of an attack by land \u2013 this latter undertaking was left deliberately vague.[83][85] On 5 May 1935, while agreeing an oil concession with the British oil company, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Abdullah signed another treaty with the British government which granted Qatar protection against internal and external threats.[83] Oil reserves were first discovered in 1939. Exploitation and development were, however, delayed by World War II.[86]\n\n\n\n![](image)A British Wilding series stamp, issued 1 April 1957, and overprinted for use in Qatar.\nThe focus of British interests in Qatar changed after the Second World War with the independence of India, the creation of Pakistan in 1947, and the development of oil in Qatar. In 1949, the appointment of the first British political officer in Doha, John Wilton, signified a strengthening of Anglo-Qatari relations.[87] Oil exports began in 1949, and oil revenues became the country's main source of revenue, the pearl trade has gone into decline. These revenues were used to fund the expansion and modernisation of Qatar's infrastructure. When Britain officially announced in 1968 that it would withdraw from the Persian Gulf in three years' time, Qatar joined talks with Bahrain and seven other Trucial States to create a federation. Regional disputes, however, persuaded Qatar and Bahrain to withdraw from the talks and become independent states separate from the Trucial States, which went on to become the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\n\n### Independence and later (1971\u20132000)[edit]\n\n\nOn 3 November 1916, the sheikh of Qatar entered into treaty relations with the United Kingdom.[88] The treaty reserved foreign affairs and defence to the United Kingdom but allowed internal autonomy. On 3 September 1971, those \"special treaty arrangements\" that were \"inconsistent with full international responsibility as a sovereign and independent state\" were terminated.[89] This was done under an agreement reached between the Ruler of Qatar and the Government of the United Kingdom.[90][89]\n\n\n\n![](image)Traditional dhows in front of the West Bay skyline as seen from the Doha Corniche.\nIn 1991, Qatar played a significant role in the Gulf War, particularly during the Battle of Khafji in which Qatari tanks rolled through the streets of the town and provided fire support for Saudi Arabian National Guard units that were engaging Iraqi Army troops. Qatar allowed coalition troops from Canada to use the country as an airbase to launch aircraft on CAP duty and also permitted air forces from the United States and France to operate in its territories.[42]\n\n\nIn 1995, Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani seized control of the country from his father Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, with the support of the armed forces and cabinet, as well as neighbouring states[91] and France.[92] Under Emir Hamad, Qatar experienced a moderate degree of liberalisation, including the launch of the Al Jazeera television station (1996), the endorsement of women's suffrage or right to vote in municipal elections (1999), drafting its first written constitution (2005) and inauguration of a Roman Catholic church (2008).\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nQatar's economy and status as a regional power rapidly grew in the 2000s. According to the UN, the nation's economic growth, measured by GDP, was the fastest in the world during this decade.[93][94] The basis of this growth lay in the exploitation of natural gas in the North Field during the 1990s. At the same time, the population of Qatar tripled between 2001 and 2011, mostly due to an influx of foreigners.[95]\n\n\nIn 2003, Qatar served as the US Central Command headquarters and one of the main launching sites of the invasion of Iraq.[96] In March 2005, a suicide bombing killed a British teacher from Dorset called Jonathan Adams[97] at the Doha Players Theatre, shocking the country, which had not previously experienced acts of terrorism. The bombing was carried out by Omar Ahmed Abdullah Ali, an Egyptian resident in Qatar who had suspected ties to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.[98][99]\n\n\nIn 2010, Qatar won the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, making it the first country in the Middle East to be selected to host the tournament. The awarding increased further investment and developments within the nation during the 2010s.[100]\n\n\nIn June 2013, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani became the Emir of Qatar after his father handed over power in a televised speech.[101] Sheikh Tamim has prioritised improving the domestic welfare of citizens, which includes establishing advanced healthcare and education systems, and expanding the country's infrastructure in preparation for the hosting of the 2022 World Cup.[102]\n\n\nThe Emir announced Qatar's plans to hold its first national legislative elections in 2013. They were scheduled to be held in the second half of 2013 but were postponed until October 2021. The legislative council hosted the 140th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly for the first time in April 2019.[103]\n\n\nThe increased influence of Qatar and its role during the Arab Spring, especially during the Bahraini uprising in 2011, worsened longstanding tensions with Saudi Arabia, the neighboring United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Bahrain.[*citation needed*] In June 2017, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain cut off diplomatic relations with Qatar, citing the country's alleged support of groups they considered to be extremist.[104] This has resulted in increased Qatari economic and military ties with Turkey and Iran.\n\n\nQatar hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup from 21 November to 18 December, becoming the first Arab and Muslim-majority country to do so, and the third Asian country to host it following the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea.[105]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Qatar\n\n![](image)\nTamim bin Hamad Al Thani  \nEmir since 2013\n![](image)\nMohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani  \nPrime Minister since 2023\n\nQatar is officially a semi-constitutional monarchy,[106][107] but the wide powers retained by the monarchy have it still bordering an absolute monarchy[108][109] ruled by the Al Thani family.[110][111] The Al Thani dynasty has been ruling Qatar since the family house was established in 1825.[3] In 2003, Qatar adopted a constitution that provided for the direct election of 30 of the 45 members of a legislature.[3][112][113] The constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum, with almost 98% in favour.[114][115] Despite this, the government remains authoritarian.[116][6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Amiri Diwan of the State of Qatar, administrative office of the Emir.\nThe eighth Emir of Qatar is Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, whose father Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani handed power to him on 25 June 2013.[117] The Emir has the exclusive power to appoint the prime minister and cabinet ministers who, together, constitute the Council of Ministers, which is the supreme executive authority in the country.[118] The Council of Ministers also initiates legislation.[118]\n\n\nThe Consultative Assembly is made up of 30 popularly-elected members and 15 appointed by the emir. It can block legislation with a simple majority and can dismiss ministers, including the prime minister, with a two-thirds vote. The assembly had its first elections in October 2021 after several postponements.[119][120][121]\n\n\nQatari law does not permit the establishment of political bodies or trade unions.[122]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Qatar's Constitution, Sharia law is the main source of Qatari legislation,[123][124] although, in practice, Qatar's legal system is a mixture of civil law and Sharia law.[125][126] Sharia law is applied to family law, inheritance, and several criminal acts (including adultery, robbery, and murder). In some cases, Sharia-based family courts treat a female's testimony as being worth half that of a man.[127] Codified family law was introduced in 2006. Islamic polygyny is permitted.[92]\n\n\nJudicial corporal punishment is a punishment in Qatar. Only Muslims considered medically fit are liable to have such sentences carried out. Flogging is employed as a punishment for alcohol consumption or illicit sexual relations.[128] Article 88 of Qatar's criminal code declares that the penalty for adultery is 100 lashes,[129] and in 2006, a Filipino woman was sentenced that punishment.[129] In 2010, at least 18 people (mostly foreign nationals) were sentenced to receive between 40 and 100 lashes for offences involving \"illicit sexual relations\" or alcohol consumption.[130] In 2011, at least 21 people (mostly foreign nationals) were sentenced to between 30 and 100 lashes for the same reasons,[131] and in 2012, six expatriates were sentenced to either 40 or 100 lashes.[128] In April 2013, a Muslim expatriate was sentenced to 40 lashes for alcohol consumption,[132][133][134] and in June 2014, a Muslim expatriate was sentenced to 40 lashes for consuming alcohol and driving under the influence.[135]\n\n\nStoning is a legal punishment in Qatar,[136] and apostasy and homosexuality are crimes punishable by the death penalty; however, the penalty has not been carried out for either crime.[137][138] Blasphemy can result in up to seven years in prison, while proselytising can incur a 10-year sentence.[137][139]\n\n\nAlcohol consumption is partially legal in Qatar; some five-star luxury hotels are allowed to sell alcohol to their non-Muslim customers.[140][141] Muslims are not allowed to consume alcohol, and those caught consuming it are liable to flogging or deportation. Non-Muslim expatriates can obtain a permit to purchase alcohol for personal consumption. The Qatar Distribution Company (a subsidiary of Qatar Airways) is permitted to import alcohol and pork; it operates the one and only liquor store in the country, which also sells pork to holders of liquor licences.[142][143] Qatari officials had indicated a willingness to allow alcohol in \"fan zones\" at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[144] However, on 18 November, two days before the start of the games, Qatari officials announced alcoholic beverages would no longer be permitted within the stadiums.[145]\n\n\nUntil 2011, restaurants on the Pearl-Qatar (a man-made island near Doha) were allowed to serve alcoholic drinks.[140][141] In December 2011, Pearl restaurants were told to stop selling alcohol.[140][146] No explanation was given for the ban,[140][141] though speculation included encouraging a more pious image before a significant election and rumours of a financial dispute between the government and resort developers.[146] The alcohol ban was later lifted.[147]\n\n\nIn 2014, a modesty campaign was launched to remind tourists of the country's restrictive dress code.[148] Female tourists were advised not to wear leggings, miniskirts, sleeveless dresses, or short or tight clothing in public. Men were warned against wearing only shorts and singlets.[149]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Qatar\n\n![](image)Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani with U.S. president Joe Biden in January 2022.\nQatar's international profile and active role in international affairs have led some analysts to identify it as a middle power. Qatar was an early member of OPEC and a founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). It is a member of the Arab League.[3] Diplomatic missions to Qatar are based in its capital, Doha.\n\n\nQatar's regional relations and foreign policies are characterized by the strategy of balancing and alliance building among regional and great powers. It maintains independent foreign policy and engages in regional balancing to secure its strategic priorities and to have recognition on the regional and international level.[150][151][152] As a comparatively small state in the gulf, Qatar established an \"open-door\" foreign policy where Qatar maintains ties to all parties and regional players in the region.[153] The history of Qatar's alliances provides insight into the basis of its foreign relations. Between 1760 and 1971, Qatar sought formal protection from the high transitory powers of the Ottomans, the British, the Al-Khalifas from Bahrain, and from Saudi Arabia.[154][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nQatar has particularly strong ties with France,[155] China,[156] Iran,[157] Turkey,[158] and the United States[159] as well as a number of Islamist movements in the Middle East such as the Muslim Brotherhood.[160][150][161] In 2011, Qatar joined NATO operations in Libya and reportedly armed Libyan opposition groups.[162] It was also a major funder of weapons for rebel groups in the Syrian civil war.[163] Qatar participated in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh.[164]\n\n\nSince the 2000s, Qatar increasingly emerged on a wider foreign policy stage especially as a mediator, such as for Middle Eastern conflicts;[165] for example, Qatar mediated between the rival Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas in 2006[166] and helped unite Lebanese leaders into forming a political agreement during the 2008 crisis.[167] Qatar has also emerged as mediators in African and Asian affairs, notably holding a peace process for Sudan amid the Darfur conflict[168] and facilitating peace talks for Afghanistan, setting up a political \"office\" for the Afghan Taliban to facilitate talks. Ahmed Rashid, writing in the *Financial Times*, stated that through the office Qatar has \"facilitated meetings between the Taliban and many countries and organisations, including the US state department, the UN, Japan, several European governments and non-governmental organisations, all of whom have been trying to push forward the idea of peace talks.\"[169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani with president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro in October 2019.\nIn June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt and Yemen broke diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.[170] The crisis escalated a dispute over Qatar's support of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is considered a terrorist organization by some Arab nations.[171] The diplomatic crisis ended in January 2021 with the signing of AlUla declaration.[172]\n\n\nOn 2 October 2020, Qatari authorities strip-searched 13 Australian women on a plane at Hamad International Airport (HIA) over a premature baby found in a bathroom at the terminal. This caused an international incident with Australia.[173][174]\nIn July 2023, Qatar's Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al Khulaifi visited Iran to meet with Iranian officials, including Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian and discuss joint work on infrastructure projects.[175] Besides that, Qatar announced to provide Ukraine to $100 million in humanitarian aid to support health, education and demining on 28 July.[176]\n\n\nIn September 2023, Qatar mediated the US- Iran prisoners swap deal. Iran freed five Americans in exchange for five Iranians held in the US and transfer $6 billion in frozen Iranian money from South Korea to Qatar. [177] In October 2023, United States President Joe Biden thanked to the Qatar\u2019s Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani for his help in mediating a landmark prisoner swap deal with Iran. [178] Furthermore, Iran and the US have a history of prisoner swaps dating back to the 1979 US Embassy takeover and hostage crisis following the Islamic Revolution. Their most recent major exchange happened in 2016.[179]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Qatar Armed Forces\n\n![](image)Two Qatari Mirage 2000s fly in formation during Air Defense Exercise.\nThe Qatar Armed Forces are the military forces of Qatar. The country maintains a modest military force of approximately 11,800 men, including an army (8,500), navy (1,800) and air force (1,500). Qatar's defense expenditures accounted for approximately 4.2% of gross national product in 1993, and 1.5% of gross domestic product in 2010, the most recent year available in the SIPRI statistical database.[180] Qatar has recently signed defense pacts with the United States and United Kingdom, as well as with France earlier in 1994. Qatar plays an active role in the collective defense efforts of the Gulf Cooperation Council; the other five members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE, and Oman. The presence of the large Al Udeid Air Base, operated by the United States and several other UN nations, provides a guaranteed source of defense and national security. In 2008 Qatar spent US$2.3 billion on military expenditures, 2.3% of the gross domestic product.[181] Qatari special forces have been trained by France and other Western countries, and are believed to possess considerable skill.[182] They also helped the Libyan rebels during the 2011 Battle of Tripoli.[182]\n\n\nThe Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) found that in 2010\u201314 Qatar was the 46th-largest arms importer in the world. SIPRI writes that Qatar's plans to transform and significantly enlarge its armed forces have accelerated. Orders in 2013 for 62 tanks and 24 self-propelled guns from Germany were followed in 2014 by a number of other contracts, including 24 combat helicopters and 3 early-warning-and-control aircraft from the US, and 2 tanker aircraft from Spain.[183] In 2015, Qatar was the 16th largest arms importer in the world, and in 2016, it was the 11th largest, according to SIPRI.[184]\n\n\nQatar's military participated in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis. In 2015, *Al Jazeera America* reported: \"Numerous reports suggest that the Saudi-led coalition against opposition groups in Yemen has indiscriminately attacked civilians and used cluster bombs in civilian-populated areas, in violation of international law.\"[185] Many civilians have been killed and the large parts of the infrastructure in this region is now destroyed.[186] Hospitals have also been bombed by the Saudis and those operating with them.[187][188] Qatar was suspended from the coalition in Yemen due to the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis.\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Human rights in Qatar\n\nFurther information: Treatment of South Asian labourers in the Gulf Cooperation Council region\n\n![](image)Migrant workers in Doha.\nAs of 2014[update], certain provisions of the Qatari Criminal Code allow punishments such as flogging and stoning to be imposed as criminal sanctions. The UN Committee Against Torture found that these practices constituted a breach of the obligations imposed by the UN Convention Against Torture.[189][190] Qatar retains the death penalty, mainly for threats against national security such as terrorism. The use of the death penalty is rare and no state executions have taken place in Qatar since 2003.[191] In Qatar, homosexual acts are illegal and can be punished by death.[192]\n\n\nA 2011 report by the U.S. State Department concluded that some expatriate workers from nations throughout Asia and parts of Africa who voluntarily migrated to Qatar as low-skilled labourers or domestic servants subsequently faced conditions indicative of involuntary servitude. Some of the more common labour rights violations include beatings, withholding of payment, charging workers for benefits for which the employer is responsible, restrictions on freedom of movement (such as the confiscation of passports, travel documents, or exit permits), arbitrary detention, threats of legal action, and sexual assault.[193] Many migrant workers arriving for work in Qatar have paid exorbitant fees to recruiters in their home countries.[193]\n\n\nUnder the provisions of Qatar's sponsorship law, sponsors had the unilateral power to cancel workers' residency permits, deny workers' ability to change employers, report a worker as \"absconded\" to police authorities, and deny permission to leave the country.[193] As a result, sponsors may restrict workers' movements and workers may be afraid to report abuses or claim their rights.[193] According to the ITUC, the visa sponsorship system allows the exaction of forced labour by making it difficult for a migrant worker to leave an abusive employer or travel overseas without permission.[194] Qatar also did not maintain wage standards for its immigrant labourers. In May 2012, Qatari officials declared their intention to allow the establishment of an independent trade union.[195] In 2014, Qatar commissioned international law firm DLA Piper to produce a report investigating the immigrant labour system. In May 2014, DLA Piper released more than 60 recommendations for reforming the kafala system including the abolition of exit visas and the introduction of a minimum wage, which Qatar has pledged to implement.[196] Qatar also announced it would scrap its sponsor system for foreign labour, which requires that all foreign workers be sponsored by local employers.[195] Additional changes to labour laws include a provision guaranteeing that all workers' salaries are paid directly into their bank accounts and new restrictions on working outdoors in the hottest hours during the summer.[197] New draft legislation announced in early 2015 mandated that companies that fail to pay workers' wages on time could temporarily lose their ability to hire more employees.[198] The reforms to the country's sponsorship system were signed into law by Qatar's Emir in October 2015, with the new law taking effect within one year.[199] Human Rights Watch claimed that the changes might fail to address some labour rights issues.[200][201] According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), a minimum wage entered into force for any worker of all nationalities and in all sectors in Qatar on 20 March 2021.[202]\n\n\nThe country enfranchised women at the same time as men in connection with the 1999 elections for a Central Municipal Council.[112][203] These elections\u2014the first-ever in Qatar\u2014were intentionally held on 8 March 1999, International Women's Day.[112]\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Municipalities of Qatar\n\n![](image)Ad Dawhah (Doha), the most populous municipality in Qatar.\nSince 2014, Qatar has been divided into eight municipalities (Arabic: baladiyah).[204]\n\n\n\n![](image)Municipalities of Qatar as of 2014\n\n\n| Key | Municipality(Baladiyah) (\u0628\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0629) | Population(2015)[205] | Area(km2) | Area(mi2)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Al Shamal ( \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644) | 8,794 | 859.8 | 331.9\n |\n| 2 | Al Khor (\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0631) | 202,031 | 1,613.3 | 622.8\n |\n| 3 | Al-Shahaniya (\u0627\u0644\u0634\u062d\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629) | 187,571 | 3,309.0 | 1,277.6\n |\n| 4 | Umm Salal (\u0623\u0645 \u0635\u0644\u0627\u0644) | 90,835 | 318.4 | 122.9\n |\n| 5 | Al Daayen (\u0627\u0644\u0636\u0639\u0627\u064a\u0646) | 54,339 | 290.2 | 112.0\n |\n| 6 | Ad Dawhah (Doha) (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u062d\u0629) | 956,457 | 202.7 | 78.3\n |\n| 7 | Al Rayyan (\u0627\u0644\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646) | 605,712 | 2,450 | 946.0\n |\n| 8 | Al Wakrah (\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0643\u0631\u0629) | 299,037 | 2,577.7 | 995.2\n |\n|  | **Dawlat Qatar** (\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0642\u0637\u0631) | 2,404,776 | 11,621.1 | 4,486.7\n |\n\n\nFor statistical purposes, the municipalities are further subdivided into 98 zones (as of 2015[update]),[205] which are in turn subdivided into blocks.[206]\n\n\n\n### Former municipalities[edit]\n\n\n* Al Jemailiya (until 2004)[207]\n* Al Ghuwariyah (until 2004)[207]\n* Jariyan al Batnah (until 2004)[207]\n* Mesaieed (Umm Sa'id) (until 2006)[208]\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Qatar\n\n![](image)\nDesert coast\n![](image)\nRock formations in Qatar\n\nThe Qatari peninsula protrudes 160 kilometres (100\u00a0mi) into the Persian Gulf, north of Saudi Arabia. It lies between latitudes 24\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 N, and longitudes 50\u00b0 and 52\u00b0 E. Most of the country consists of a low, barren plain, covered with sand. To the southeast lies the Khor al\u00a0Adaid (\"Inland Sea\"), an area of rolling sand dunes surrounding an inlet of the Persian Gulf. There are mild winters and very hot, humid summers.\n\n\nThe highest point in Qatar is Qurayn Abu al Bawl at 103 metres (338\u00a0ft)[3] in the Jebel Dukhan to the west, a range of low limestone outcroppings running north-south from Zikrit through Umm Bab to the southern border. The Jebel Dukhan area also contains Qatar's main onshore oil deposits, while the natural gas fields lie offshore, to the northwest of the peninsula.\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Wildlife of Qatar and Natural areas of Qatar\n\n![](image)\nArabian oryx, the national animal of Qatar\n![](image)\nOstriches in Qatar\n\nQatar signed the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 11 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 21 August 1996.[209] It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 18 May 2005.[210] A total of 142 fungal species have been recorded from Qatar.[211] A book recently produced by the Ministry of Environment documents the lizards known or believed to occur in Qatar, based on surveys conducted by an international team of scientists and other collaborators.[212]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n| Climate data for Qatar\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 22(72)\n | 23(73)\n | 27(81)\n | 33(91)\n | 39(102)\n | 42(108)\n | 42(108)\n | 42(108)\n | 39(102)\n | 35(95)\n | 30(86)\n | 25(77)\n | 33(92)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 14(57)\n | 15(59)\n | 17(63)\n | 21(70)\n | 27(81)\n | 29(84)\n | 31(88)\n | 31(88)\n | 29(84)\n | 25(77)\n | 21(70)\n | 16(61)\n | 23(74)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 12.7(0.50)\n | 17.8(0.70)\n | 15.2(0.60)\n | 7.6(0.30)\n | 2.5(0.10)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 2.5(0.10)\n | 12.7(0.50)\n | 71(2.8)\n |\n| Source: \"Doha Annual Weather Averages\". *World Weather Online*.

A report prepared by local governors of Ottoman Empire in 1892 states that total income from pearl hunting in 1892 is 2,450,000 kran.[74] After the introduction of the Japanese cultured pearl onto the world market in the 1920s and 1930s, Qatar's pearling industry crashed. Oil was discovered in Qatar in 1940, in Dukhan Field.[214] The discovery transformed the state's economy. Now, the country has a high standard of living for its legal citizens. With no income tax, Qatar (along with Bahrain) is one of the countries with the lowest tax rates in the world. The unemployment rate in June 2013 was 0.1%.[215] Corporate law mandates that Qatari nationals must hold 51% of any venture in the emirate.[92] Trade and industry in the emirate is overseen by the Ministry of Business and Trade.[216]\n\n\nAs of 2016[update], Qatar has the fourth highest GDP per capita in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund.[217] It relies heavily on foreign labor to grow its economy, to the extent that migrant workers compose 86% of the population and 94% of the workforce.[218][219] Qatar has been criticized by the International Trade Union Confederation.[220] The economic growth of Qatar has been almost exclusively based on its petroleum and natural gas industries, which began in 1940.[221] Qatar is the leading exporter of liquefied natural gas.[182] In 2012, it was estimated that Qatar would invest over $120\u00a0billion in the energy sector in the next 10 years.[222] The country was a member state of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), having joined in 1961, and having left in January 2019.[223]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mesaieed Industrial Area\nIn 2012, Qatar retained its title of richest country in the world (according to per capita income) for the third time in a row, having first overtaken Luxembourg in 2010. According to the study published by the Washington-based Institute of International Finance, Qatar's per capita GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) was $106,000 (QR387,000) in 2012, helping the country retain its ranking as the world's wealthiest nation. Luxembourg came a distant second with nearly $80,000 and Singapore third with per capita income of about $61,000. The research put Qatar's GDP at $182bn in 2012 and said it had climbed to an all-time high due to soaring gas exports and high oil prices. Its population stood at 1.8 million in 2012. The same study published that Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), with assets of $115bn, was ranked 12th among the richest sovereign wealth funds in the world.[224]\n\n\n\n![](image)Qatar Central Bank's office in Doha.\nEstablished in 2005, Qatar Investment Authority is the country's sovereign wealth fund, specializing in foreign investment.[225] Due to billions of dollars in surpluses from the oil and gas industry, the Qatari government has directed investments into United States, Europe, and Asia Pacific. As of 2013[update], the holdings were valued at $100 billion in assets. Qatar Holding is the international investment arm of QIA. Since 2009, Qatar Holding has received $30\u201340bn a year from the state. As of 2014[update], it has investments around the world in Valentino, Siemens, Printemps, Harrods, The Shard, Barclays Bank, Heathrow Airport, Paris Saint-Germain F.C., Volkswagen Group, Royal Dutch Shell, Bank of America, Tiffany, Agricultural Bank of China, Sainsbury's, BlackBerry,[226] and Santander Brasil.[227][228]\n\n\nThe country has no taxes on non-companies,[229] but authorities have announced plans to levy taxes on junk food and luxury items. The taxes would be implemented on goods that harm the human body \u2013 for example, fast food, tobacco products, and soft drinks. The rollout of these initial taxes is believed to be due to the fall in oil prices and a deficit that the country faced in 2016. Additionally, the country saw job cuts in 2016 from its petroleum companies and other sectors in the government.[230][231]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of tourist attractions in Qatar\n\n![](image)\nTourist resort at Banana Island in Qatar\nFile:Doha Qatar - Katara Towers Lusail.jpg\nKatara Towers Part of the new hospitality at Lusail Qatar\n\nQatar is one of the fastest growing countries in the field of tourism. According to the World Tourism rankings, more than 2.3 million international tourists visited Qatar in 2017. Qatar has become one of the most open countries in the Middle East due to its recent visa facilitation improvements, including allowing nationals of 88 countries to enter visa-free and free-of charge.[232] Qatar was recently put in the top eight in market climate in the Middle East by the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Survey 2019 of the World Economic Forum.[233][234]\nDoha is a city with one of the fastest-growing hotel and hospitality markets in the world. The $220 billion spent on infrastructure since the successful World Cup bid of 2010 has helped boost the industry. Hotels have also been helped by the country\u2019s geographic location. Qatar tourism sector continues to witness a strong recovery with more than 729,000 international visitors in the first half of 2022, marking a 19% increase compared to the full year of 2021. And their aim is to raise tourism to 12% of GDP by 2030.[235][236] The nation is also on course to experience a major jump in athletic and corporate tourism with hosting world-class tournaments such as the 2030 Asian Games and the awaited 2022 FIFA World Cup.[237] Qatar National Airlines, as well as Hamad International Airport, provide travelers with one of the best transportation services in the world, and this has increased tourism in Qatar. Gulf News, a research center in Qatar, by examining the statistics of recent years and upcoming events, has predicted that this country will earn 11 billion and 900 million dollars from attracting foreign travelers by 2020, This is achieved with the reason for this upward trend is the increase in hospitality and attention to the country's culture in Qatar.[238]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Qatar\n\nAs of 2012[update], Qatar has proven oil reserves of 15 billion barrels and gas fields that account for more than 13% of the global resource. As a result, it is the richest state per-capita in the world. None of its 2 million residents live below the poverty line and less than 1% are unemployed.[239]\n\n\nQatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC quotas on crude oil production, the lower price for oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from Egypt and South Asia, have grown again.\n\n\nOil production will not remain at the peak level of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m3) per day for long as the national oil fields are projected to be largely depleted by 2023. Large natural gas reserves have, however, been located off Qatar's northeast coast. Qatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 250 trillion cubic feet (7,000\u00a0km3). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.\n\n\nQatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in Umm Said, include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m3) per day capacity, a fertiliser plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned QatarEnergy. The US is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and US companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.[239]\n\n\nAccording to the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, carbon dioxide emissions per person average over 30 tonnes, one of the highest in the world.[240]\n\n\nIn 2008 Qatar launched its National Vision 2030 which highlights environmental development as one of the four main goals for Qatar over the next two decades. The National Vision pledges to develop sustainable alternatives to oil-based energy to preserve the local and global environment.[241]\n\n\nQatar's National Vision 2030 has made investment in renewable resources a major goal for the country over the next two decades.[241] Qatar pursues a vigorous programme of \"Qatarisation\", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the US, are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. To control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programmes over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.[239]\n\n\nHarnessing solar power has become an important objective for Qatar in recent years. By 2030, Qatar has set the goal of attaining 20% of its energy from solar power.[242] The country is well-positioned to capitalize on photovoltaic systems, as it has a global horizontal irradiance value of approximately 2,140 kWh per square meter annually. Furthermore, the direct irradiance parameter is roughly 2,008 kWh per square meter annually, implying that it would be able to benefit from concentrated solar power as well.[243]\n\n\nQatar Foundation has been active in helping Qatar achieve its solar power goals. It established Qatar Solar, which, together with Qatar Development Bank and German company SolarWorld, embarked on a joint venture resulting in the creation of Qatar Solar Technologies (QSTec). In 2017, QSTec commissioned its polysillicon plant in Ras Laffan. This plant has a total capacity of 1.1 MW of solar power.[242]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Qatar\n\nMain article: Geography of Qatar\n\n![](image)\nHamad International Airport Hall\n![](image)\nHamad International Airport Tropical Garden\n\nWith a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with the demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the Public Works Authority (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.\n\n\nAs driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the Qatar Bahrain Causeway, which would connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\n![](image)Qatar Airways Airbus A380, Qatar Airways, one of the world's largest airlines, links over 150 international destinations from its base in Doha.\nMass-transit options, such as a Doha metro, light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all the Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The airport, too, is expanding capacity to keep up with rising visitor numbers.\n\n\nHamad International Airport is the international airport of Doha. In 2014, it replaced the former Doha International Airport as Qatar's principal airport. In 2016, the airport was named the 50th busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic, serving 37,283,987 passengers, a 20.2% increase from 2015.\n\n\n\n![](image)Doha Metro\nQatar is increasingly activating its logistics and ports in order to participate in trade between Europe and China or Africa. For this purpose, ports such as Hamad Port are rapidly expanded and investments are made in their technology. The country is historically and currently part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the south via the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the North Sea.[244][245][246] Hamad Port is Qatar's main seaport, located south of Doha in the Umm Al Houl area. Construction of the port began in 2010; it became operational in December 2016. It was officially opened in September 2017, and is expected to become fully operational by 2020.[247] Capable of handling up to 7.8 million tonnes of products annually, the bulk of trade which passes through the port consists of food and building materials.[248] On the northern coast, Ras Laffan Port serves as the most extensive LNG exporting facility in the world.[249]\n\n\nQatar Airways is one of the largest airlines in the world that serves in six continents connecting more than 160 destinations every day. It has won Airline of the Year in 2011, 2012, 2015, 2017 and 2019 and employs more than 46,000 people.[250][251]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Qatar\n\n![](image)\nSkyline of Doha, capital and largest city of Qatar\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1950 | 25,000 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1960 | 47,000 | +88.0% |\n| 1970 | 110,000 | +134.0% |\n| 1980 | 224,000 | +103.6% |\n| 1990 | 476,000 | +112.5% |\n| 2000 | 592,000 | +24.4% |\n| 2010 | 1,856,000 | +213.5% |\n| 2019 | 2,832,000 | +52.6% |\n| source:[252][253] |\n\nThe number of people in Qatar fluctuates considerably depending on the season, since the country relies heavily on migrant labour. In early 2017, Qatar's total population was 2.6 million, with foreigners making up a vast majority of Qatar's population. Only 313,000 of the population (12%) were Qatari citizens, while the remaining 2.3 million (88%) were expatriates.[20]\n\n\nThe combined number of South Asians (from the countries of the Indian subcontinent including Sri Lanka) by themselves represent over 1.5 million people (60%) of Qatar's population. Among these, Indians are the largest community, numbering 650,000 in 2017,[20] followed by 350,000 Nepalese, 280,000 Bangladeshis, 145,000 Sri Lankans, and 125,000 Pakistanis. The contingent of expatriates which are not of South Asian origin represent around 28% of Qatar's population, of which the largest group is 260,000 Filipinos and 200,000 Egyptians, plus many other nationalities (including nationals of other Arab countries, Europeans, etc.).[20]\n\n\n\n![](image)Residential buildings at the Pearl\nQatar's first demographic records date back to 1892, and were conducted by Ottoman governors in the region. Based on this census, which includes only the residents in cities, the total population in 1892 was 9,830.[74]\nThe 2010 census recorded the total population at 1,699,435.[8] In January 2013, the Qatar Statistics Authority estimated the country's population at 1,903,447, of which 1,405,164 were males and 498,283 females.[254] At the time of the first census, held in 1970, the population was 111,133.[255] The population has tripled in the decade to 2011, up from just over 600,000 people in 2001, leaving Qatari nationals as less than 15% of the total population.[256] The influx of male labourers has skewed the gender balance, and women are now just one-quarter of the population.\n\n\nProjections released by the Qatar Statistical Authority indicate that the total population of Qatar could reach 2.8 million by 2020. Qatar's National Development Strategy (2011\u201316) had estimated that the country's population would reach 1.78m in 2013, 1.81m in 2014, 1.84m in 2015 and 1.86m in 2016 \u2013 the yearly growth rate being merely 2.1%. But the country's population has soared to 1.83 million by the end of 2012, showing 7.5% growth over the previous year.[257] Qatar's total population hit a record high of 2.46 million in November 2015, an increase of 8.5% from the previous year, far exceeding official projections.[258]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Qatar\n\n![](image)Mosque in Qatar\nIslam is Qatar's predominant religion and is the state religion although not the only religion practiced in the country[259] and the constitution guarantees freedom to practise any faith within \"moral\" bounds.[260] Most Qatari citizens belong to the Salafi Muslim movement of Wahhabism,[261][262][263] and 5\u201315% of Muslims in Qatar follow Shia Islam with other Islamic sects being very small in number.[264] In 2010, Qatar's population was 67.7% Muslim, 13.8% Christian, 13.8% Hindu, and 3.1% Buddhist; other religions and religiously unaffiliated people accounted for the remaining 1.6%.[265]\n\n\n\n![](image)Education City Mosque a structure with modern and traditional architecture in Qatar\nSharia law is the main source of Qatari legislation according to Qatar's Constitution.[123][124] Qatar's interpretation of Sharia law is said to be not as \"strict\" as neighboring Saudi Arabia[266] but neither as \"liberal\" as Dubai.[267] The vision of the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs (Qatar) is \"to build a contemporary Islamic society along with fostering the Sharee\u2019ah and cultural heritage\".[268]\n\n\nThe non-Muslim population is composed almost entirely of foreigners. Since 2008, Christians have been allowed to build churches on ground donated by the government,[269][270] Active churches include the Mar Thoma Church, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Rosary and the Anglican Church of the Epiphany.[271][272][273] There are also two Mormon wards[271][272][273] and a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community.[274]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nArabic is the official language of Qatar, with Qatari Arabic the local dialect. Qatari Sign Language is the language of the deaf community. English is commonly used as a second language,[275] and a rising lingua franca, especially in commerce, to the extent that steps are being taken to try to preserve Arabic from English's encroachment.[276] English is particularly useful for communication with Qatar's large expatriate community. In the medical community, and in situations such as the training of nurses to work in Qatar, English acts as a lingua franca.[277] Reflecting the multicultural make-up of the country, many other languages are also spoken, including Persian, Baluchi, Brahui, Hindi, Malayalam, Urdu, Pashto, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Nepali, Sinhalese, Bengali, Tagalog, Tulu and Indonesian.[278]\n\n\nIn 2012, Qatar joined the international French-speaking organisation of La Francophonie (OIF) as a new associate member, but in December 2013, the French daily *Le Monde* revealed that Qatar, which has very few native French speakers, had not yet paid any contribution to the OIF,[279] while the outgoing Administrator of the OIF complained in 2015 that Qatar had not kept any of the promises it made when it joined the organisation and had never paid its annual membership fees.[280]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Qatar\n\nHealthcare standards in Qatar are generally high. Qatari citizens are covered by a national health-insurance plan, while expatriates must either receive health insurance from their employers, or in the case of the self-employed, purchase insurance.[281] Qatar's healthcare spending is among the highest in the Middle East, with $4.7 billion being invested in healthcare in 2014.[282] This was a $2.1 billion increase from 2010.[283] The premier healthcare provider in the country is the Hamad Medical Corporation, established by the government as a non-profit healthcare provider, which runs a network of hospitals, an ambulance services, and a home healthcare service, all of which are accredited by the Joint Commission.\n\n\nIn 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 2.2% of the country's GDP; the highest in the Middle East.[284] In 2006, there were 23.12 physicians and 61.81 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants.[285] The life expectancy at birth was 82.08 years in 2014, or 83.27 years for males and 77.95 years for females, rendering it the highest life expectancy in the Middle East.[286] Qatar has a low infant mortality rate of 7 in 100,000.[287]\n\n\nIn 2006, there were a total of 25 beds per 10,000 people, and 27.6 doctors and 73.8 nurses per 10,000 people.[288] In 2011, the number of beds decreased to 12 per 10,000 people, whereas the number of doctors increased to 28 per 10,000 people. While the country has one of the lowest proportions of hospital beds in the region, the availability of physicians is the highest in the GCC.[289]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Qatar\n See also: List of festivals in Qatar\n\n![](image)National Museum of Qatar in Doha\nQatar's culture is similar to other countries in Eastern Arabia, being significantly influenced by Islam. Qatar National Day, hosted annually on 18 December, has had an important role in developing a sense of national identity.[290] It is observed in remembrance of Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani's succession to the throne and his subsequent unification of the country's various tribes.[291][292]\n\n\n\n### Doha Cultural Festival[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Doha Cultural Festival\n\nThe Doha Cultural Festival is one of the cultural activities carried out annually by the Qatari Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage, which began in 2002 with the aim of spreading Qatari culture inside and outside Qatar.\n\n\n\n### Arts and museums[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Collecting practices of the Al-Thani Family, Qatari art, and Public art in Qatar\n\n![](image)Msheireb Downtown Doha The World's first sustainable Downtown regeneration project\nQatari officials, especially the Al Thani family and the sister of the Emir of Qatar, Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, pay special attention to art.[293][294] Through her public work and support of the Qatar Vision 2030, she is building an exciting creative future for the country that will connect artistic communities in all areas of culture.\n\n\nSeveral senior members of Qatar's ruling Al Thani family are noted collectors of Islamic and contemporary art.\n\n\nThe Museum of Islamic Art, opened in 2008, is regarded as one of the best museums in the region.[295] This, and several other Qatari museums, like the Arab Museum of Modern Art, falls under the Qatar Museums Authority (*QMA*) which is led by Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the sister of the ruling Emir of the State of Qatar, and the prominent collector and art patron Sheikh Hassan bin Mohammed Al Thani.[296] The QMA also sponsors artistic events abroad, such as major exhibitions by Takahashi Murakami in Versailles (2010) and Damien Hirst in London (2012).\n\n\n\n![](image)Museum of Islamic Art in Doha\nQatar is the world's biggest buyer in the art market by value.[297] The Qatari cultural sector is being developed to enable the country to reach world recognition to contribute to the development of a country that comes mainly from its resources from the gas industry.[298]\n\n\nThe National Museum of Qatar was opened to the public on 28 March 2019.[299]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Qatari literature\n\nQatari literature traces its origins back to the 19th century. Originally, written poetry was the most common form of expression. Abdul Jalil Al-Tabatabai and Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Uthaymeen, two poets dating back to the early 19th century, formed the corpus of Qatar's earliest written poetry. Poetry later fell out of favor after Qatar began reaping the profits from oil exports in the mid-20th century and many Qataris abandoned their Bedouin traditions in favor of more urban lifestyles.[300]\n\n\nDue to the increasing number of Qataris who began receiving formal education during the 1950s and other significant societal changes, 1970 witnessed the introduction of the first short story anthology, and in 1993 the first locally authored novels were published. Poetry, particularly the predominant nabati form, retained some importance but would soon be overshadowed by other literary types.[300] Unlike most other forms of art in Qatari society, females have been involved in the modern literature movement on a similar magnitude to males.[301]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Qatari art\n\nSee also: Collecting practices of the Al-Thani Family\n\nBecause of Islam's stance on figurative art, paintings and plastic arts played a relatively insignificant role in Qatari culture until the discovery of oil in the mid-20th century.[302] Other visual arts such as calligraphy and architecture were the most historically dominant forms of Islamic visual expression. Calligraphy was most prized in society because of its close connection with Islam.[303] Calligraphy is often used in the design of official state logos, for example, the Qatar National Vision 2030 logo.[304]\n\n\nArt exhibitions were held under the auspices of the Ministry of Education until 1972, whereupon the state began providing its full support to the art scene. The Qatari Fine Arts Society was established in 1980 with the objective of promoting the works of Qatari artists.[305] Yousef Ahmad is a leading figure of Qatar's art industry and regularly represents the country at international biennials and events. His art work has been displayed internationally.[306]\n\n\n\n![](image)Qatari men in traditional clothes in Souq Waqif market\n![](image)Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art interior in 2011\nFor the last twenty years, several members of the Al Thani family have led Qatar's interest and involvement into the field of arts and continue to shape the cultural policy of the country.[307] Qatar was revealed to be the world's biggest art buyer in 2011 by *The Art Newspaper*.[308]\n\n\nQatar Museums was established in the early 2000s to build and connect all museums and collections in Qatar.[309] Two major museums lead the institution: the Museum of Islamic Art opened in 2008,[310] and the Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art, opened in Education City by Qatar Foundation in 2010.[311] The National Museum of Qatar has recently joined the Qatar Museums institution when it first opened on 27 March 2019.[312]\n\n\nWhen a quartet comprising Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed all ties with and imposed a blockade of Qatar on 5 June 2017, Qatari artist Ahmed Al-Maadheed created an illustration known as \"Tamim Almajd\", which translates to \"Tamim the Glorious\". The illustration, a simple black and white sketch of Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani containing the text \"Tamim Almajd\" in the style of Arabic calligraphy, has become symbolic of Qatari nationalism. The image is now displayed prominently on buildings, in media and in art in Qatar.[313]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Doha Forum, Qatar Museum's Chairperson, Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, revealed plans for a further three museums:[314] The first, the Art Mill, located on the site of a historic flour mill, a centre designed by Alejandro Aravena of Elemental,[315] will accommodate presentation facilities for artistic media and for present day art, as well as spaces for educational activities and internship programs, workrooms, a centre for the cultural industries of Qatar, the Dhow Centre, as well as gardens. The second, the Lusail Museum, designed by architect Jacques Herzog of Herzog & de Meuron,[316] a museum of more than 52,000 square meters will comprise different cultural spaces and accommodate the world's most extensive exhibition of orientalist art. The third newly proposed museum, the Qatar Auto Museum, will feature permanent galleries centered around the automobile and its development in Qatar.[317]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media of Qatar\n\n![](image)The news desk of Al Jazeera English, a Qatari news channel\nQatar's media was classified as \"not free\" in the 2014 Freedom of the Press report by Freedom House.[318] TV broadcasting in Qatar was started in 1970.[319] Al Jazeera is a main television network headquartered in Doha, Qatar. Al Jazeera initially launched in 1996 as an Arabic news and current affairs satellite TV channel of the same name, but has since expanded into a global network of several speciality TV\u00a0channels known collectively as the Al Jazeera Media Network.\n\n\nIt has been reported that journalists practice self-censorship, particularly in regards to the government and ruling family of Qatar.[320] Criticism of the government, Emir and ruling family in the media is illegal. According to article 46 of the press law \"The Emir of the state of Qatar shall not be criticised and no statement can be attributed to him unless under a written permission from the manager of his office.\"[321] Journalists are also subject to prosecution for insulting Islam.[318]\n\n\nIn 2014, a Cybercrime Prevention Law was passed. The law is said to restrict press freedom and carries prison sentences and fines for broad reasons such as jeopardising local peace or publishing false news.[322] The Gulf Center for Human Rights has stated that the law is a threat to freedom of speech and has called for certain articles of the law to be revoked.[323]\n\n\nPress media has undergone expansion in recent years. There are currently seven newspapers in circulation in Qatar, with four being published in Arabic and three being published in English.[324] There are also newspapers from India, Nepal and Sri Lanka with editions printed from Qatar.\n\n\nIn regards to telecommunication infrastructure, Qatar is the highest-ranked Middle Eastern country in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) \u2013 an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. Qatar ranked number 23 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, unchanged from 2013.[325]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Qatar\n\nThe music of Qatar is based on Bedouin poetry, song and dance. Traditional dances in Doha are performed on Friday afternoons; one such dance is the Ardah, a stylised martial dance performed by two rows of dancers who are accompanied by an array of percussion instruments, including al-ras (a large drum whose leather is heated by an open fire), tambourines and cymbals with small drums.[326] Other percussion instruments used in folk music include *galahs* (a tall clay jar) and tin drinking cups known as *tus* or *tasat*, usually used in conjunction with a *tabl*, a longitudinal drum beaten with a stick.[327] String instruments, such as the oud and rebaba, are also commonly used.[326]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Qatar\n\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Qatar, both in terms of players and spectators.[328] Shortly after the Qatar Football Association became affiliated with FIFA in 1970, one of the country's earliest international accolades came in 1981 when the Qatar national under-20 team's emerged as runners-up to West Germany in that year's edition of the FIFA World Youth Championship after being defeated 4\u20130 in the final. At the senior level, Qatar has played host to two editions of the AFC Asian Cup; the first coming being the 9th edition in 1988 and the second being the 15th edition held in 2011.[329] For the first time in the country's history, the Qatar national football team won the AFC Asian Cup in the 2019 edition hosted in the UAE, beating Japan 3\u20131 in the final. They won all seven of their matches, conceding only a single goal throughout the tournament.[330]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fireworks in opening ceremony Asian Games 2006\n![](image)Lusail Stadium\nOn 2 December 2010, Qatar won their bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, despite never previously qualifying for the FIFA World Cup Finals.[331] Local organisers built 7 new stadiums and expanded 1 existing stadium for this event.[332][333] Qatar's winning bid for the 2022 World Cup was greeted enthusiastically in the Persian Gulf region as it was the first time a country in the Middle East had been selected to host the tournament. At the same time, the bid has been embroiled in much controversy, including allegations of bribery and interference in the investigation of the alleged bribery. European football associations have also objected to the 2022 World Cup being held in Qatar for a variety of reasons, from the impact of warm temperatures on players' fitness, to the disruption it might cause in European domestic league calendars should the event be rescheduled to take place during winter.[334][335] In May 2014, Qatari football official Mohammed bin Hammam was accused of making payments totalling \u00a33m to officials in return for their support for the Qatar bid.[336][337] A FIFA inquiry into the bidding process in November 2014 cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing.[338][339]\n\n\n*The Guardian*, a British national daily newspaper, produced a short documentary named \"Abuse and exploitation of migrant workers preparing emirate for 2022\".[340] A 2014 investigation by *The Guardian* reports that migrant workers who have been constructing luxurious offices for the organisers of the 2022 World Cup have not been paid in over a year, and are now \"working illegally from cockroach-infested lodgings.\"[341] For 2014, Nepalese migrants involved in constructing infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup died at a rate of one every two days.[342] The Qatar 2022 organising committee have responded to various allegations by claiming that hosting the World Cup in Qatar would act as a \"catalyst for change\" in the region.[343] According to a February 2021 article in *The Guardian*, some 6,500 migrant construction workers have died.[344] The figures used by The Guardian did not include occupation or place of work so deaths could not be definitively associated with the World Cup construction programme. Commenting on the investigation, Construction News recalled.[345]\n\n\nHowever, the World Cup in Qatar has been the most expensive World Cup in history and has many modern technologies, and people have expressed their satisfaction with hosting Qatar.[346]\n\n\n\n![](image)Argentina vs Mexico national team match at 2022 FIFA World Cup\nQatar was estimated to host a football fanbase of 1.6 million for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. However, the construction work in country was expected to only take the available 37,000 hotel rooms to 70,000 by the end of 2021. In December 2019, the Qatari World Cup officials approached the organizers of the Glastonbury Festival in England and the Coachella Festival in the US, to plan huge desert campsites for thousands of football fans. The World Cup campsites on the outskirts were reported to have licensed bars, restaurants, entertainment and washing facilities. Moreover, two cruise ships were also reserved as temporary floating accommodations for nearly 40,000 people during the tournament.[347]\n\n\nThough football is the most popular sport, other team sports have experienced considerable success at senior level. In 2015, the national handball team emerged as runners-up to France in the World Men's Handball Championship as hosts, however the tournament was marred by numerous controversies regarding the host nation and its team.[348] Further, in 2014, Qatar won the world championship in men's 3x3 basketball.[349]\n\n\nCricket is popular amongst the South Asian diaspora in Qatar. Casual street cricket is the most popular format of the game, but the Qatar Cricket Association has been a member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1999 and the men's and women's national teams both play regularly in ICC competitions. The primary cricket ground in Qatar is the West End Park International Cricket Stadium.[350]\n\n\nBasketball is a developed sport amongst Asian people in Qatar. Qatar hosted the 2005 FIBA Asia Championship, 2013 FIBA Asia 3x3 Championship, 2014 FIBA Asia Under-18 Championship and 2022 FIBA Under-16 Asian Championship. Qatar will host the 2027 FIBA Basketball World Cup making this become the first Arab country to host the FIBA Basketball World Cup.[351]\n\n\nKhalifa International Tennis and Squash Complex in Doha hosted the WTA Tour Championships in women's tennis between 2008 and 2010. Doha holds the WTA Premier tournament Qatar Ladies Open annually. Since 2002, Qatar has hosted the annual Tour of Qatar, a cycling race in six stages. Every February, riders are racing on the roads across Qatar's flat land for six days. Each stage covers a distance of more than 100\u00a0km, though the time trial usually is a shorter distance. Tour of Qatar is organised by the Qatar Cycling Federation for professional riders in the category of Elite Men.[352]\n\n\nThe Qatar Army Skydiving Team has several different skydiving disciplines placing among the top nations in the world. The Qatar National Parachute team performs annually during Qatar's National Day and at other large events, such as the 2015 World Handball Championship.[353]\nDoha four times was the host of the official FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship and three times host FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship. Doha one time Host Asian Volleyball Championship.[354]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Qatar\n\n![](image)Student Center in Education City. Education City houses various educational facilities, including satellite campuses of eight international universities.\nQatar hired the RAND Corporation to reform its K\u201312 education system.[182] Through Qatar Foundation, the country has built Education City, a campus that hosts local branches of the Weill Cornell Medical College, Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science, Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism, Texas A&M's School of Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts and other Western institutions.[182][355]\n\n\n\n![](image)Northwestern University in Qatar\nThe illiteracy rate in Qatar was 3.1% for males and 4.2% for females in 2012, the lowest in the Arab-speaking world, but 86th in the world.[356] Citizens are required to attend government-provided education from kindergarten through high school.[357] Qatar University, founded in 1973, is the country's oldest and largest institution of higher education.[358][359]\n\n\nIn November 2002, emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani created The Supreme Education Council.[360] The Council directs and controls education for all ages from the pre-school level through the university level, including the \"Education for a New Era\" initiative which was established to try to position Qatar as a leader in education reform.[361][362] According to the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities, the top-ranking universities in the country are Qatar University (1,881st worldwide), Texas A&M University at Qatar (3,905th) and Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar (6,855th).[363]\n\n\n\n![](image)Qatar University\nIn 2009, Qatar established the Qatar Science & Technology Park in Education City to link those universities with industry. Education City is also home to a fully accredited international Baccalaureate school, Qatar Academy. In addition, two Canadian institutions, the College of the North Atlantic (headquarters in Newfoundland and Labrador) and the University of Calgary, have inaugurated campuses in Doha. Other for-profit universities have also established campuses in the city.[364]\n\n\nIn 2012, Qatar was ranked third from the bottom of the 65 OECD countries participating in the PISA test of maths, reading and skills for 15- and 16-year-olds, comparable to Colombia or Albania, despite having the highest per capita income in the world.[365][366] Qatar was ranked 50th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, up from 65th in 2019.[367][368][369]\n\n\nAs part of its national development strategy, Qatar has outlined a 10-year strategic plan to improve the level of education.[370] The government has launched educational outreach programs, such as Al-Bairaq. Al-Bairaq was launched in 2010 aims to provide high school students with an opportunity to experience a research environment in the Center for Advanced Materials in Qatar University. The program encompasses the STEM fields and languages.[371]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nLaunched in 2006 as part of an initiative of the quasi-governmental Qatar Foundation, the Qatar National Research Fund was created with the intent of securing public funds for scientific research within the country. The fund functions as a means for Qatar to diversify its economy from a primarily oil and gas-based one to a knowledge-based economy.[372]\n\n\nThe Qatar Science & Technology Park (QSTP) was established by Qatar Foundation in March 2009 as an attempt to assist the country's transition towards a knowledge economy.[373][374] With a seed capital of $800 million and initially hosting 21 organizations,[374] the QSTP became Qatar's first free-trade zone.[375]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Qatar-related topics\n* Outline of Qatar\n* Qatar Airways\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The possible English pronunciations include /\u02c8k\u028ct\u0251\u02d0r, \u02c8k\u00e6t\u0251\u02d0r, \u02c8k\u0251\u02d0t\u0251\u02d0r, -\u0259r, k\u0259\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0r, k\u00e6\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0r, k\u0251\u02d0\u02c8t\u0251\u02d0r/; respetively: *KUT-ar, KAT-, KAHT-, -\u2060\u0259r, k\u0259-TAR, kat-AR, kah-TAR*.[13]\n2. **^** (Arabic: \u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0642\u0637\u0631, romanized: *Dawlat Qa\u1e6dar*\n\n1. **^** \"The Constitution\" (PDF). *Government Communications Office*.

With a population of about 680,000[11] and an area of 32.9\u00a0km2 (12.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), it is the most densely populated region in the world.\n\n\nFormerly a Portuguese colony, the territory of Portuguese Macau was first leased to Portugal as a trading post by the Ming dynasty in 1557. Portugal paid an annual rent and administered the territory under Chinese sovereignty until 1887. Portugal later gained perpetual colonial rights in the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking. The colony remained under Portuguese rule until 1999, when it was transferred to China. Macau is a special administrative region of China, which maintains separate governing and economic systems from those of mainland China under the principle of \"one country, two systems\".[12] The unique blend of Portuguese and Chinese architecture in the city's historic centre led to its inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005.[13]\n\n\nOriginally a sparsely populated collection of coastal islands,[14] Macau, often referred to as the \"Las Vegas of the East\", has become a major resort city and a top destination for gambling tourism, with a gambling industry seven times larger than that of Las Vegas.[15] The city has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, US$43,770 in 2021,[16] and its GDP per capita by purchasing power parity is one of the highest in the world.[17][18] It has a very high Human Development Index, as calculated by the Macau government,[10] and the fourth-highest life expectancy in the world.[19] The territory is highly urbanised; two-thirds of the total land area is built on land reclaimed from the sea.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Names of Macau\n\n\n\n| Macau |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Chinese name |\n| Traditional\u00a0Chinese | \u6fb3\u9580 |\n| Simplified\u00a0Chinese | \u6fb3\u95e8 |\n| Literal meaning | Bay Gate |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | \u00c0om\u00e9n |\n| Bopomofo | \u3120\u02cb \u3107\u3123\u02ca |\n| Wade\u2013Giles | Ao-men |\n| IPA | [\u0251\u0302\u028a\u032fm\u0259\u030cn] |\n| other Mandarin |\n| Xiao'erjing | \u0627\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0645\u064d |\n| Wu |\n| Romanization | au\u53bbmen\u5e73 |\n| Hakka |\n| Romanization | Au4 mun2 |\n| Yue: Cantonese |\n| Yale Romanization | Oum\u00fan |\n| Jyutping | Ou3mun2 |\n| Canton Romanization | ou3mun4\\*2 |\n| IPA | [\u0254w\u02e7.mun\u02e7\u02e5] |\n| Southern Min |\n| Hokkien POJ | \u00d2-mn\u0302g |\n| Eastern Min |\n| Fuzhou BUC | \u00d3\u0324-mu\u00f2ng |\n\n |\n| Macau Special Administrative Region |\n| Traditional\u00a0Chinese | \u6fb3\u9580\u7279\u5225\u884c\u653f\u5340 (or \u6fb3\u9580\u7279\u5340) |\n| Simplified\u00a0Chinese | \u6fb3\u95e8\u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a (or \u6fb3\u95e8\u7279\u533a) |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | \u00c0om\u00e9n T\u00e8bi\u00e9 X\u00edngzh\u00e8ngq\u016b (\u00c0om\u00e9n T\u00e8q\u016b) |\n| Wade\u2013Giles | Ao-men T'e-pieh Hsing-cheng-ch'\u00fc (Ao-men T'e Ch'\u00fc) |\n| Wu |\n| Romanization | au\u53bbmen\u5e73 deh\u5165bih\u5165 ghan\u5e73tsen\u53bbchiu\u5e73 |\n| Hakka |\n| Romanization | Au4mun2 Tet6piet6 hang2zin4ki1 (Au4mun2 Tet6ki1) |\n| Yue: Cantonese |\n| Yale Romanization | Oum\u00fan Dahkbiht H\u00e0hngjing Ke\u016bi |\n| Jyutping | Ou3mun2 Dak6bit6 Hang4zing3 Keoi1 |\n| Canton Romanization | Ou3mun4\\*2 Deg6bid6 Heng4jing3 K\u00eau1 |\n| IPA | [\u0254w\u02e7.mun\u02e7\u02e5\u00a0t\u0250k\u031a\u02e8.pit\u031a\u00a0h\u0250\u014b\u02e9.ts\u026a\u014b\u02e7\u00a0k\u02b0\u0275\u0265\u02e5] |\n| Southern Min |\n| Hokkien POJ | \u00d2-mn\u0302g Te\u030dk-pia\u030dt H\u00eang-ch\u00e8ng-khu |\n\n |\n| Portuguese name |\n| Portuguese | *Regi\u00e3o Administrativa Especial de Macau[\u0281\u0268\u0292i\u02c8\u0250\u0303w \u0250\u00f0mini\u0283t\u027e\u0250\u02c8tiv\u0250 \u0268\u0283p\u0268si\u02c8al d\u0268 m\u0250\u02c8kaw]* |\n|  |\n\n\nThe first known written record of the name \"Macau\", rendered as \"A Ma Gang\" (\u4e9e/\u963f-\u5abd/\u99ac-\u6e2f), is found in a letter dated 20 November 1555. The local inhabitants believed that the sea goddess Matsu (alternatively called A-Ma) had blessed and protected the harbour and called the waters around A-Ma Temple using her name.[21] When Portuguese explorers first arrived in the area and asked for the place name, the locals thought they were asking about the temple and told them it was \"Ma Kok\" (\u5abd\u95a3).[22] The earliest Portuguese spelling for this was *Amaqu\u00e3o*. Multiple variations were used until *Amac\u00e3o / Amacao* and *Mac\u00e3o / Macao* became common during the 17th century.[21] The 1911 reform of Portuguese orthography standardised the spelling *Macau*; however, the use of *Macao* persisted in English and other European languages.[23]\n\n\nThe Macau Peninsula had many names in Chinese, including *Jing'ao* (\u4e95\u6fb3/\u93e1\u6fb3), *Haojing* (\u6fe0\u93e1), and *Haojing'ao* (\u6fe0\u93e1\u6fb3).[21][24] The islands Taipa, Coloane, and Hengqin were collectively called *Shizimen* (\u5341\u5b57\u9580). These names would later become *Ou m\u00fan* (\u6fb3\u9580), *Aomen* in Mandarin and translating as \"bay gate\" or \"port gate\", to refer to the whole territory.[24]\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: History of Macau and History of China\n\nDuring the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC), the region was under the jurisdiction of Panyu County, Nanhai Prefecture of the province of Guangdong.[25][26] The region is first known to have been settled during the Han dynasty.[27] It was administratively part of Dongguan Prefecture in the Jin dynasty (266\u2013420\u00a0AD), and alternated under the control of Nanhai and Dongguan in later dynasties. In 1152, during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279 AD), it was under the jurisdiction of the new Xiangshan County.[25] In 1277, approximately 50,000 refugees fleeing the Mongol conquest of China settled in the coastal area.[26][28]\n\n\nMacau did not develop as a major settlement until the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century. The first European visitor to reach China by sea was the explorer Jorge \u00c1lvares, who arrived in 1513.[29] Merchants first established a trading post in Hong Kong waters at Tam\u00e3o (present-day Tuen Mun), beginning regular trade with nearby settlements in southern China.[29] Military clashes between the Ming and Portuguese navies followed the expulsion of the Tam\u00e3o traders in 1521.[30] Despite the trade ban, Portuguese merchants continued to attempt to settle on other parts of the Pearl River estuary, finally settling on Macau.[30] In their first attempts at obtaining trading posts by force, the Portuguese were defeated by the Ming Chinese at the Battle of Tunmen in Tam\u00e3o (or Tuen Mun) in 1521, where the Portuguese lost two ships; the Battle of Sincouwaan in Lantau Island where the Portuguese also lost two ships; in Shuangyu in 1548, where several Portuguese were captured; and near the Dongshan Peninsula in 1549, where two Portuguese junks and Galeote Pereira were captured. During these battles the Ming Chinese captured weapons from the defeated Portuguese which they then reverse engineered and mass-produced in China such as matchlock musket arquebuses which they named bird guns and breech-loading swivel guns which they named as Folangji (Frankish) cannon because the Portuguese were known to the Chinese under the name of Franks at this time. The Portuguese later returned to China peacefully and presented themselves under the name Portuguese instead of Franks in the Luso-Chinese agreement (1554) and rented Macau as a trading post from China by paying annual lease of hundreds of silver taels to Ming China.[31] Luso-Canton trade relations were formally reestablished in 1554 and Portugal soon after acquired a permanent lease for Macau in 1557,[32] agreeing to pay 500 taels of silver as annual land rent.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macau, early 19th century\nThe initially small population of Portuguese merchants rapidly became a growing city.[34] The Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau was created in 1576, and by 1583, the Senate had been established to handle municipal affairs for the growing settlement.[34] Macau was at the peak of its prosperity as a major entrep\u00f4t during the late 16th century, providing a crucial connection in exporting Chinese silk to Japan during the *Nanban* trade period.[35] Although the Portuguese were initially prohibited from fortifying Macau or stockpiling weapons, the Fortaleza do Monte was constructed in response to frequent Dutch naval incursions. The Dutch attempted to take the city in the 1622 Battle of Macau, but were repelled successfully by the Portuguese.[36] Macau entered a period of decline in the 1640s following a series of catastrophic events for the burgeoning colony: Portuguese access to trade routes was irreparably severed when Japan halted trade in 1639,[37] Portugal revolted against Spain in 1640,[38] and Malacca fell to the Dutch in 1641.[39][40]\n\n\nMaritime trade with China was banned in 1644 following the Qing conquest under the *Haijin* policies and limited only to Macau on a lesser scale while the new dynasty focused on eliminating surviving Ming loyalists.[41] While the Kangxi Emperor lifted the prohibition in 1684, China again restricted trade under the Canton System in 1757.[42] Foreign ships were required to first stop at Macau before further proceeding to Canton.[43] Qing authorities exercised a much greater role in governing the territory during this period; Chinese residents were subject to Qing courts and new construction had to be approved by the resident mandarin beginning in the 1740s.[44] As the opium trade became more lucrative during the 18th century, Macau again became an important stopping point en route to China.[45]\n\n\nFollowing the First Opium War and the establishment of Hong Kong, Macau lost its role as a major port.[46] Firecracker and incense production, as well as tea and tobacco processing, were vital industries in the colony during this time.[47][48] Portugal was able to capitalise on China's postwar weakness and assert its sovereignty; the Governor of Macau began refusing to pay China annual land rent for the colony in the 1840s,[49] and annexed Taipa and Coloane, in 1851 and 1864 respectively.[50] Portugal also occupied nearby Lapa and Montanha,[49] but these would be returned to China by 1887, when perpetual occupation rights over Macau were formalised in the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of Peking. This agreement also prohibited Portugal from ceding Macau without Chinese approval.[51] Despite occasional conflict between Cantonese authorities and the colonial government, Macau's status remained unchanged through the republican revolutions of both Portugal in 1910 and China in 1911.[52] The Kuomintang further affirmed Portuguese jurisdiction in Macau when the Treaty of Peking was renegotiated in 1928.[52]\n\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Empire of Japan did not occupy the colony and generally respected Portuguese neutrality in Macau. However, after Japanese troops captured a British cargo ship in Macau waters in 1943, Japan installed a group of government \"advisors\" as an alternative to military occupation. The territory largely avoided military action during the war except in 1945, when the United States ordered air raids on Macau after learning that the colonial government was preparing to sell aviation fuel to Japan. Portugal was later given over US$20\u00a0million in compensation for the damage in 1950.[53]\n\n\nRefugees from mainland China swelled the population as they fled from the Chinese Civil War. Access to a large workforce enabled Macau's economy to grow as the colony expanded its clothing and textiles manufacturing industry, developed its tourism industry, and legalised casino gaming.[54] However, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, residents dissatisfied with the colonial administration rioted in the 1966 12-3 incident, in which 8 people were killed and over 200 were injured. Portugal lost full control over the colony afterwards, and agreed to cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party in exchange for continued administration of Macau.[55]\n\n\nFollowing the 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal formally relinquished Macau as an overseas province and acknowledged it as a \"Chinese territory under Portuguese administration\".[56] After China first concluded arrangements on Hong Kong's future with the United Kingdom, it entered negotiations with Portugal over Macau in 1986. They were concluded with the signing of the 1987 Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau, in which Portugal agreed to transfer the colony in 1999 and China would guarantee Macau's political and economic systems for 50 years after the transfer.[57] In the waning years of colonial rule, Macau rapidly urbanised and constructed large-scale infrastructure projects, including the Macau International Airport and a new container port.[58] Macau was transferred to China on 20 December 1999, after 442 years of Portuguese rule.[12]\n\n\nFollowing the transfer, Macau liberalised its casino industry (which previously operated under a government-licensed monopoly) to allow foreign investors, starting a new period of economic development. The regional economy grew by a double-digit annual growth rate from 2002 to 2014, making Macau one of the richest economies in the world on a per capita basis.[59] Political debates have centred on the region's jurisdictional independence and the central government's adherence of \"one country, two systems\". While issues such as national security legislation have been controversial, Macanese residents generally have high levels of trust in the government.[60]\nKwong and Wong[61] explain this by comparing Macau to Hong Kong: \"The case of Macau shows that the very small size of a 'microstate' helps central authorities to exercise political control, stifle political pluralism, and monopolize opinions, all of which strengthen regime persistence.\"\n\n\n\n## Government and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Government of Macau, Politics of Macau, and Elections in Macau\n\n![](image)The legislature meets in the Legislative Assembly Building in S\u00e9.\nMacau is a special administrative region of China, with executive, legislative, and judicial powers devolved from the national government.[62] The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration provided for economic and administrative continuity through the transfer of sovereignty, resulting in an executive-led governing system largely inherited from the territory's history as a Portuguese colony.[63] Under these terms and the \"one country, two systems\" principle, the Basic Law of Macao is the regional constitution.[64] Because negotiations for the Joint Declaration and Basic Law began after transitional arrangements for Hong Kong were made, Macau's structure of government is very similar to Hong Kong's.[65]\n\n\nThe regional government is composed of three branches:\n\n\n\n* *Executive:* The Chief Executive is responsible for enforcing regional law,[66] can force reconsideration of legislation,[67] and appoints Executive Council members, a portion of the legislature, and principal officials.[66] Acting with the Executive Council, the Chief Executive can propose new bills, issue subordinate legislation,[68] and has authority to dissolve the legislature.[69]\n* *Legislature:* The unicameral Legislative Assembly enacts regional law, approves budgets, and has the power to impeach a sitting Chief Executive.[70]\n* *Judiciary:* The Court of Final Appeal and lower courts, whose judges are appointed by the Chief Executive on the advice of a recommendation commission,[71] interpret laws and overturn those inconsistent with the Basic Law.[72]\n\n\nThe Chief Executive is the head of government, and serves for a maximum of two five-year terms.[73] The State Council (led by the Premier of China) appoints the Chief Executive after nomination by the Election Committee, which is composed of 400 business, community, and government leaders.[74][75]\n\n\nThe Legislative Assembly has 33 members, each serving a four-year term: 14 are directly elected, 12 indirectly elected, and 7 appointed by the Chief Executive.[76] Indirectly elected assemblymen are selected from limited electorates representing sectors of the economy or special interest groups.[77] All directly elected members are chosen with proportional representation.[78]\n\n\nTwelve political parties had representatives elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2017 election.[79] These parties have aligned themselves into two ideological groups: the pro-establishment (the current government) and pro-democracy camps.[80] Macau is represented in the National People's Congress by 12 deputies chosen through an electoral college, and 29 delegates in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference appointed by the central government.[7]\n\n\nMacau has generally congenial relations with China's central government.[81]:\u200a182\n\n\n\n![](image)The Macau Government Headquarters is the official office of the Chief Executive.\nChinese national law does not generally apply in the region, and Macau is treated as a separate jurisdiction.[62] Its judicial system is based on Portuguese civil law, continuing the legal tradition established during colonial rule. Interpretative and amending power over the Basic Law and jurisdiction over acts of state lie with the central authority, however, making regional courts ultimately subordinate to the mainland's socialist civil law system. Decisions made by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress can also override territorial judicial processes.[82] In 2021, after similar actions were taken in Hong Kong following the protests associated with the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement, 21 candidates running for office in the territorial elections were disqualified as a result of allegedly failing to support the Basic Law, although no specific violations were noted by the territory's electoral commission.[83]\n\n\nThe territory's jurisdictional independence is most apparent in its immigration and taxation policies. The Identification Department issues passports for permanent residents which differ from those issued by the mainland or Hong Kong, and the region maintains a regulated border with the rest of the country.[84] All travellers between Macau and China and Hong Kong must pass border controls, regardless of nationality.[85] Chinese citizens resident in mainland China do not have the right of abode in Macau and are subject to immigration controls.[86] Public finances are handled separately from the national government, and taxes levied in Macau do not fund the central authority.[87]\n\n\nThe Macao Garrison is responsible for the region's defence. Although the Chairman of the Central Military Commission is supreme commander of the armed forces,[88] the regional government may request assistance from the garrison.[89] Macau residents are not required to perform military service and the law also has no provision for local enlistment, so its defence force is composed entirely of nonresidents.[90]\n\n\nThe State Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs handle diplomatic matters, but Macau retains the ability to maintain separate economic and cultural relations with foreign nations.[91] The territory negotiates its own trade agreements and actively participates in supranational organisations, including agencies of the World Trade Organization and United Nations.[92][93][94] The regional government maintains trade offices in Greater China and other nations.[95]\n\n\nPublic political demonstrations in Macau are generally rare.[81]:\u200a182\n\n\n\n### Lusophonia membership\n\n[edit]\n\nMacau is not a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, despite Portuguese being one of its official languages. This is due to it not being a sovereign nation, but a subnational division of China. In 2006, during the II Ministerial meeting between China and Portuguese Speaking Countries, the CPLP Executive Secretary and Deputy ambassador Tadeu Soares invited the Chief Executive of the Government of the Macau Special Administrative Region, Edmund Ho, to request the Associate Observer status for Macau. The Government of Macau has yet to make this request. In 2016, Murade Murargy, then executive secretary of CPLP said in an interview that Macau's membership is a complicated question, since like the Galicia region in Spain, it is not an independent country, but only a part of China.[96] However, the *Instituto Internacional de Macau* (\u6fb3\u9580\u570b\u969b\u7814\u7a76\u6240) and the University of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 are Consultative Observers of the CPLP.[97][98]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Municipalities and parishes of Macau\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of Macau\nThe territory is divided into seven parishes. Cotai, a major area developed on reclaimed land between Taipa and Coloane, and areas of the Macau New Urban Zone do not have defined parishes.[99] Historically, the parishes belonged to one of two municipalities (the Municipality of Macau or the Municipality of Ilhas) that were responsible for administering municipal services. The municipalities were abolished in 2001 and superseded by the Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau in providing local services.[100]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Parish/Area\n | Chinese\n | Area(km2)[99] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Parishes\n |\n| Nossa Senhora de F\u00e1tima | \u82b1\u5730\u746a\u5802\u5340 | 3.2\n |\n| Santo Ant\u00f3nio | \u82b1\u738b\u5802\u5340 | 1.1\n |\n| S\u00e3o L\u00e1zaro | \u671b\u5fb7\u5802\u5340 | 0.6\n |\n| S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o | \u98a8\u9806\u5802\u5340 | 1.0\n |\n| S\u00e9 *(including New District Zone B)* | \u5927\u5802\u5340 (\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u57ceB\u5340) | 3.4\n |\n| Nossa Senhora do Carmo *(including New District Zone E)* | \u5609\u6a21\u5802\u5340 (\u5305\u62ec\u65b0\u57ceE\u5340) | 7.9\n |\n| S\u00e3o Francisco Xavier | \u8056\u65b9\u6fdf\u5404\u5802\u5340 | 7.6\n |\n| Other areas\n |\n| Cotai | \u8def\u6c39\u586b\u6d77\u5340 | 6.0\n |\n| New District Zone A | \u65b0\u57ceA\u5340 | 1.4\n |\n| HZMB Zhuhai-Macau Port | \u6e2f\u73e0\u6fb3\u5927\u6a4b\u73e0\u6fb3\u53e3\u5cb8 | 0.7\n |\n| University of Macau (Hengqin campus)\n | \u6fb3\u9580\u5927\u5b78 (\u6a6b\u7434\u6821\u5340) | 1.0\n |\n\n\n## Geography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Geography of Macau\n\nMap of the Pearl River Delta\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![Macau is located in Guangdong](image)![Guangzhou](image)\n**Guangzhou**\n![Shenzhen](image)\n**Shenzhen**\n![Hong Kong](image)\n**Hong Kong**\n![Dongguan](image)\n**Dongguan**\n![Foshan](image)\n**Foshan**\n![Jiangmen](image)\n**Jiangmen**\n![Huizhou](image)\n**Huizhou**\n![Zhongshan](image)\n**Zhongshan**\n![Zhuhai](image)\n**Zhuhai**\n![Macau](image)\n**Macau**\n![Zhaoqing](image)\n**Zhaoqing**\n![Enping](image)\nEnping\n![Heshan](image)\nHeshan\n![Kaiping](image)\nKaiping\n![Sihui](image)\nSihui\nMacau (Guangdong)\n |\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Macau Peninsula\n![](image)A 1954 map of the Zhongshan region. Macau is located at the bottom-right of the region.\n![](image)Map of Macau\nMacau is located on China's southern coast, 60\u00a0km (37\u00a0mi) west of Hong Kong, on the western side of the Pearl River estuary. It is surrounded by the South China Sea in the east and south, and neighbours the Guangdong city of Zhuhai to the west and north.[101] The territory consists of Macau Peninsula, Taipa, and Coloane.[102] A 1\u00a0km2 (0.39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) parcel of land in neighbouring Hengqin island that hosts the University of Macau also falls under the regional government's jurisdiction.[103] The territory's highest point is Coloane Alto, 170.6 metres (560\u00a0ft) above sea level.[99]\n\n\nUrban development is concentrated on peninsular Macau, where most of the population lives.[104] The peninsula was originally a separate island with hilly terrain, which gradually became a tombolo as a connecting sandbar formed over time. Both natural sedimentation and land reclamation expanded the area enough to support urban growth.[105] Macau has tripled its land area in the last century, increasing from 10.28\u00a0km2 (3.97\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in the late 19th century[20] to 32.9\u00a0km2 (12.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in 2018.[99]\n\n\nCotai, the area of reclaimed land connecting Taipa and Coloane, contains many of the newer casinos and resorts established after 1999.[18] The region's jurisdiction over the surrounding sea was greatly expanded in 2015, when it was granted an additional 85\u00a0km2 (33\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of maritime territory by the State Council.[106] Further reclamation is currently underway to develop parts of the Macau New Urban Zone.[107] The territory also has control over part of an artificial island to maintain a border checkpoint for the Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge.[99][108]\n\n\n\n### Climate\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite being located south of the Tropic of Cancer, Macau has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen *Cwa*), characteristic of southern China. The territory is dual season dominant \u2013 summer (May to September) and winter (November to February) are the longest seasons, while spring (March and April) and autumn (October) are relatively brief periods.[101] The summer monsoon brings warm and humid air from the sea, with the most frequent rainfall occurring during the season. Typhoons also occur most often then, bringing significant spikes in rainfall. During the winter, northern winds from the continent bring dry air and much less rainfall.[109] The highest and lowest temperatures recorded at the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau are 38.9\u00a0\u00b0C (102.0\u00a0\u00b0F) on both 2 July 1930 and 6 July 1930 and \u22121.8\u00a0\u00b0C (28.8\u00a0\u00b0F) on 26 January 1948.[110]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Macau (1991\u20132020, extremes 1901\u2013present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 31.5(88.7)\n | 35.3(95.5)\n | 37.5(99.5)\n | 36.9(98.4)\n | 38.9(102.0)\n | 38.5(101.3)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 34.2(93.6)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 38.9(102.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 18.6(65.5)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 30.5(86.9)\n | 31.4(88.5)\n | 31.5(88.7)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 25.9(78.6)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 18.6(65.5)\n | 22.3(72.1)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 12.7(54.9)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 25.9(78.6)\n | 25.1(77.2)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22121.8(28.8)\n | 0.4(32.7)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 19.0(66.2)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 9.5(49.1)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | \u22121.8(28.8)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 34.2(1.35)\n | 43.9(1.73)\n | 80.0(3.15)\n | 153.5(6.04)\n | 286.0(11.26)\n | 373.7(14.71)\n | 290.7(11.44)\n | 331.4(13.05)\n | 227.8(8.97)\n | 75.1(2.96)\n | 39.0(1.54)\n | 31.3(1.23)\n | 1,966.6(77.43)\n |\n| Average precipitation days\n | 5.8\n | 8.9\n | 11.4\n | 11.6\n | 14.1\n | 17.7\n | 16.6\n | 16.2\n | 12.3\n | 6.2\n | 4.9\n | 5.0\n | 130.9\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74.9\n | 80.5\n | 85.0\n | 86.3\n | 84.9\n | 84.6\n | 82.7\n | 82.1\n | 78.3\n | 72.5\n | 72.6\n | 70.8\n | 79.6\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 126.5\n | 85.7\n | 74.8\n | 94.6\n | 135.5\n | 159.0\n | 211.3\n | 188.2\n | 178.3\n | 192.2\n | 158.1\n | 145.1\n | 1,749.3\n |\n| Source: Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau[111][110] |\n\n![](image)\nThe Macau Peninsula skyline, viewed from Taipa\n\n![](image)\nView of the Macau Old City\n\n## Demographics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Macau, Macau people, and Religion in Macau\n\n![Population graph](image)2020 population pyramid\nThe Statistics and Census Service estimated Macau's population at 667,400 at the end of 2018.[112] With a population density of 21,340 people per square kilometre,[113] Macau is the most densely populated region in the world. The overwhelming majority (88.7 per cent) are Chinese, many of whom originate from Guangdong (31.9 per cent) or Fujian (5.9 per cent).[114] The remaining 11.6 per cent are non ethnic Chinese minorities, primarily Filipinos (4.6 per cent), Vietnamese (2.4 per cent), and Portuguese (1.8 per cent).[3] Several thousand residents are of Macanese heritage, native-born multiracial people with mixed Portuguese ancestry.[115] Of the total population (excluding migrants), 49.4 per cent were born in Macau, followed by 43.1 per cent in Mainland China.[116] A large portion of the population are Portuguese citizens, a legacy of colonial rule; at the time of the transfer of sovereignty in 1999, 107,000 residents held Portuguese passports.[117]\n\n\nThe predominant language is Cantonese, a variety of Chinese originating in Guangdong. It is spoken by 87.5 per cent of the population, 80.1 per cent as a first language and 7.5 per cent as a second language. Only 2.3 per cent can speak Portuguese, the other official language;[2] 0.7 per cent are native speakers, and 1.6 per cent use it as a second language. Increased immigration from mainland China in recent years has added to the number of Mandarin speakers, making up about half of the population (50.4 per cent); 5.5 per cent are native speakers and 44.9 per cent are second language speakers.[118] Traditional Chinese characters are used in writing, rather than the simplified characters used on the mainland. English is considered an additional working language[119] and is spoken by over a quarter of the population (27.5 per cent); 2.8 per cent are native speakers, and 24.7 per cent speak English as a second language.[118] Macanese Patois, a local creole generally known as *Patu\u00e1*, is now spoken only by a few in the older Macanese community.[120]\n\n\n\nReligion in Macau (2012)[121]\n\n\n\nBuddhism (incl. Chinese folk religion) (80%)\nChristianity (6.7%)\nOther (13.7%)\n\nAccording to the Government Information Bureau, 80 per cent of the population practices Buddhism, 6.7 per cent follow Christianity and 13.7 per cent follow other religion.[122] Folk practices are also common among the citizens. According to Pew Research Center, Chinese folk religions have the most adherents (58.9 per cent) and are followed by Buddhism (17.3 per cent) and Christianity (7.2 per cent), while 15.4 per cent of the population profess no religious affiliation at all. Small minorities adhering to other religions (less than 1 per cent), including Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam, are also resident in Macau.[123]\n\n\nLife expectancy in Macau was 81.6 years for males and 87.7 years for females in 2018,[19] the fourth highest in the world.[124] Cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disease are the territory's three leading causes of death. Most government-provided healthcare services are free of charge, though alternative treatment is also heavily subsidised.[125]\n\n\nMigrant workers living in Macau account for over 25 per cent of the entire workforce.[126] They largely work in lower wage sectors of the economy, including construction, hotels, and restaurants. As a growing proportion of local residents take up employment in the gaming industry, the disparity in income between local and migrant workers has been increasing.[103] Rising living costs have also pushed a large portion of nonresident workers to live in Zhuhai.[126]\n\n\n\n## Economy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Economy of Macau, Tourism in Macau, and Gambling in Macau\n\n![](image)The Ruins of Saint Paul's, a religious complex built in the 17th century, are now a popular tourist attraction.\n![](image)Guia Lighthouse at Guia Fortress landmark, 19th century\n![](image)\nCasinos on the Macanese skyline\n![](image)\nMarina at Macau Fisherman's Wharf\n![](image)\nTourism plays an important role in the economy of Macau, the people from Mainland China being the region's most prolific tourists.\n\nMacau has a capitalist service economy largely based on casino gaming and tourism. It is the world's 83rd-largest economy, with a nominal GDP of approximately MOP433\u00a0billion (US$53.9\u00a0billion).[8] Although Macau has one of the highest per capita GDPs, the territory also has a high level of wealth disparity.[18] Macau's gaming industry is the largest in the world, generating over MOP195\u00a0billion (US$24\u00a0billion) in revenue and about seven times larger than that of Las Vegas.[15] Macau's gambling revenue was $37\u00a0billion in 2018.[127] Taxes from gambling revenues fund a robust welfare system and an annual cash payment to Macau's citizens.[81]:\u200a204\n\n\nThe regional economy is heavily reliant on casino gaming.[15] The vast majority of government funding (79.6 per cent of total tax revenue) comes from gaming.[128] Local taxes on personal income, residential property, and retail sales range from non-existent to negligible.[81]:\u200a16 Gambling as a share of GDP peaked in 2013 at over 60 per cent,[15] and continues to account for 49.1 per cent of total economic output. The vast majority of casino patrons are tourists from mainland China, making up 68 per cent of all visitors.[129] Casino gaming is illegal in both the mainland and Hong Kong, giving Macau a legal monopoly on the industry in China.[15] Revenue from Chinese high rollers has been falling and was forecast to fall as much as 10% more in 2019. Economic uncertainty may account for some of the drop, but alternate Asian gambling venues do as well. For example, Chinese visitors to the Philippines more than doubled between 2015 and 2018, since the City of Dreams casino opened in Manila.[127]\n\n\nCasino gambling was legalised in 1962 and the gaming industry initially operated under a government-licensed monopoly granted to the Sociedade de Turismo e Divers\u00f5es de Macau. This licence was renegotiated and renewed several times before ending in 2002 after 40 years.[130] The government then allowed open bidding for casino licences to attract foreign investors.[131] Along with an easing of travel restrictions on mainland Chinese visitors, this triggered a period of rapid economic growth; from 1999 to 2016, Macau's gross domestic product multiplied by 7[15] and the unemployment rate dropped from 6.3 to 1.9 per cent.[103] The Sands Macao, Wynn Macau, MGM Macau, and Venetian Macau were all opened during the first decade after liberalisation of casino concessions.[131] Casinos employ about 24 per cent of the total workforce in the region.[103] \"Increased competition from casinos popping up across Asia to lure away Chinese high rollers and tourists\" in Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, Australia, Vietnam and the Russian Far East led in 2019 to the lowest revenues in three years.[127]\n\n\nExport-oriented manufacturing previously contributed to a much larger share of economic output, peaking at 36.9 per cent of GDP in 1985[132] and falling to less than 1 per cent in 2017.[133] The bulk of these exports were cotton textiles and apparel, but also included toys and electronics.[134] At the transfer of sovereignty in 1999, manufacturing, financial services, construction and real estate, and gaming were the four largest sectors of the economy.[15] Macau's shift to an economic model entirely dependent on gaming caused concern over its overexposure to a single sector, prompting the regional government to attempt re-diversifying its economy.[135]\n\n\nThe government traditionally had a non-interventionist role in the economy and taxes corporations at very low rates.[136] Post-handover administrations have generally been more involved in enhancing social welfare to counter the cyclical nature of the gaming industry.[137] Economic growth has been attributed in large part to the high number of mainlander visits to Macau, and the central government exercises a role in guiding casino business growth through its control of the flow of tourists.[138][139] The Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement formalised a policy of free trade between Macau and mainland China, with each jurisdiction pledging to remove remaining obstacles to trade and cross-boundary investment.[140]\n\n\nDue to a lack of available land for farming, agriculture is not significant in the economy. Food is exclusively imported to Macau and almost all foreign goods are transshipped through Hong Kong.[141]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n[edit]\n\n### Transport\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Transport in Macau\n\n![](image)Air Macau Airbus A321 taxiing at Macau International Airport\nMacau has a highly developed road system, with over 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) of roads. Automobiles drive on the left (unlike in both mainland China and Portugal), due to historical influence of the Portuguese Empire.[142] Vehicle traffic is extremely congested, especially in the oldest part of the city, where streets are the narrowest.[143] Public bus services operate over 80 routes, supplemented by free hotel shuttle buses that also run routes to popular tourist attractions and downtown locations.[144] About 1,500 black taxicabs are licensed in the territory.[145] The Hong Kong\u2013Zhuhai\u2013Macau Bridge, opened in 2018, provides a direct link with the eastern side of the Pearl River estuary.[146] Cross-boundary traffic to mainland China may also pass through border checkpoints at the Portas do Cerco, L\u00f3tus Bridge, and Qingmao Port.[147]\n\n\nMacau International Airport serves over 8 million passengers each year and is the primary hub for local flag carrier Air Macau.[148] Ferry services to Hong Kong and mainland China operate out of ferry terminals such as Taipa Ferry Terminal. Daily helicopter service is also available to Hong Kong and Shenzhen.[149] Phase 1 of the territory's first rail network, the Macau Light Rapid Transit, began operations in December 2019. The Taipa line connects 11 metro stations throughout Taipa and Cotai.[150]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Healthcare in Macau and List of hospitals in Macau\n\n![](image)Macau University of Science and Technology Hospital\nMacau is served by one major public hospital, the Hospital Conde S. Janu\u00e1rio, and one major private hospital, the Kiang Wu Hospital, both located in Macau Peninsula, as well as a university associated hospital called Macau University of Science and Technology Hospital in Cotai. In addition to hospitals, Macau also has numerous health centres providing free basic medical care to residents. Consultation in traditional Chinese medicine is also available.[151]\n\n\nNone of the Macau hospitals are independently assessed through international healthcare accreditation. A Western-style medical school was opened in Macau in 2019 by the Macau University of Science and Technology, with an annual intake of 50 students.[152] Local nurses are trained at the Macao Polytechnic University and the Kiang Wu Nursing College of Macau.[153][154] Currently there are no training courses in midwifery in Macau.[*citation needed*] A study by the University of Macau, commissioned by the Macau SAR government, concluded that Macau is too small to have its own medical specialist training centre.[155]\n\n\nThe Fire Services Bureau is responsible for ambulance service (Ambul\u00e2ncia de Macau). The Macau Red Cross also operates ambulances (Toyota HiAce vans) for emergency and non-emergencies to local hospitals with volunteer staff. The organisation has a total of 739 uniformed firefighters and paramedics serving from 7 stations in Macau.[156]\n\n\nThe Health Bureau in Macau is mainly responsible for coordinating the activities between the public and private organisations in the area of public health, and assure the health of citizens through specialised and primary health care services, as well as disease prevention and health promotion.[157] The Macau Centre for Disease Control and Prevention was established in 2001, which monitors the operation of hospitals, health centres, and the blood transfusion centre in Macau. It also handles the organisation of care and prevention of diseases affecting the population, sets guidelines for hospitals and private healthcare providers, and issues licenses.[158]\n\n\nAs of 2016[update] Macau healthcare authorities send patients to Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong in instances where the local Macau hospitals are not equipped to deal with their scenarios, and many Macau residents intentionally seek healthcare in Hong Kong because they place more trust in Hong Kong doctors than in Mainland-trained doctors operating in Macau.[155]\n\n\n\n## Education\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Education in Macau\n\n![](image)The main campus of the University of Macau is located in neighbouring Hengqin.\nEducation in Macau does not have a single centralised set of standards or curriculum. Individual schools follow different educational models, including Chinese, Portuguese, Hong Kong, and British systems.[159] Children are required to attend school from the age of five until completion of lower secondary school, or at age 15. Of residents aged 3 and older, 69 per cent completed lower secondary education, 49 per cent graduated from an upper secondary school, 21 per cent earned a bachelor's degree or higher.[160] Mandatory education has contributed to an adult literacy rate of 96.5 per cent. While lower than that of other developed economies, the rate is due to the influx of refugees from mainland China during the post-war colonial era. Much of the elderly population were not formally educated due to war and poverty.[161]\n\n\nMost schools in the territory are private institutions. Out of the 77 non-tertiary schools, 10 are public and the other 67 are privately run.[162] The Roman Catholic Diocese of Macau maintains an important position in territorial education, managing 27 primary and secondary schools.[163] The government provides 15 years of free education for all residents enrolled in publicly run schools,[162] and subsidises tuition for students in private schools. Students at the secondary school level studying in neighbouring areas of Guangdong are also eligible for tuition subsidies.[164]\n\n\nThe vast majority of schools use Cantonese as the medium of instruction, with written education in Chinese and compulsory classes in Mandarin. A minority of private schools use English or Portuguese as the primary teaching language. Portuguese-Chinese schools mainly use Chinese, but additionally require mandatory Portuguese-language classes as part of their curriculum.[159]\n\n\nMacau has ten universities and tertiary education institutes. The University of Macau, founded in 1981, is the territory's only public comprehensive university. The Kiang Wu Nursing College of Macau is the oldest higher institute, specialising in educating future nursing staff for the college's parent hospital. The University of Saint Joseph, Macau University of Science and Technology, and the City University of Macau were all established in subsequent years. Five other institutes specialise in specific vocations or provide continuing education.[165]\n\n\n\n## Culture\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Culture of Macau\n\n![](image)\nSenado Square\n![](image)\nNa Tcha Temple\n\nThe mixing of Chinese and Portuguese culture and religious traditions for more than four centuries has left Macau with an inimitable collection of holidays, festivals and events. The biggest event of the year is the Macau Grand Prix each November,[166] when the main streets of the Macau Peninsula are converted to a racetrack bearing similarities with the Monaco Grand Prix. Other annual events include Macau Arts festival in March, the International Fireworks Display Contest in September, the International Music festival in October and/or November, and the Macau International Marathon in December.\n\n\nThe Lunar Chinese New Year is the most important traditional festival, and celebration normally takes place in late January or early February.[167] The Pou Tai Un Temple in Taipa is the place for the Feast of Tou Tei, the Earth god, in February. The Procession of the Passion of Our Lord is a well-known Roman Catholic rite and journey, which travels from Saint Austin's Church to the cathedral, also taking place in February.[168]\n\n\nThe A-Ma Temple, which honours the Goddess Matsu, is in full swing in April with many worshipers celebrating the A-Ma festival. In May, it is common to see dancing dragons at the Feast of the Drunken Dragon and twinkling-clean Buddhas at the Feast of the Bathing of Lord Buddha. In Coloane Village, the Taoist god Tam Kong is also honoured on the same day.[168] Dragon Boat Festival is brought into play on Nam Van Lake in June and Hungry Ghosts' festival, in late August and/or early September every year. All events and festivities of the year end with Winter Solstice in December.\n\n\nMacau preserves many historical properties in the urban area. Its historic centre, which includes some twenty-five historic locations, was officially listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO on 15 July 2005 during the 29th session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Durban, South Africa.[169]\nHowever, the Macao government is criticised for ignoring the conservation of heritage in urban planning.[170] In 2007, local residents of Macao wrote a letter to UNESCO complaining about construction projects around world heritage Guia Lighthouse (Focal height 108 metres (354\u00a0ft)), including the headquarter of the Liaison Office (91 metres (299\u00a0ft)). UNESCO then issued a warning to the Macau government, which led former Chief Executive Edmund Ho to sign a notice regulating height restrictions on buildings around the site.[171] In 2015, the New Macau Association submitted a report to UNESCO claiming that the government had failed to protect Macao's cultural heritage against threats by urban development projects. One of the main examples of the report is that the headquarter of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government, which is located on the Guia foothill and obstructs the view of the Guia Fortress (one of the world heritages symbols of Macao). One year later, Roni Amelan, a spokesman from UNESCO Press service, said that the UNESCO has asked China for information and is still waiting for a reply.[172][171] In 2016, the Macau government approved an 81-metre (266\u00a0ft)-tall construction limit for the residential project, which reportedly goes against the city's regulations on the height of buildings around world heritage site Guia Lighthouse.[171]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Macanese cuisine\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n*(Left)*: Macanese-style *pastel de nata*. *(Right)*: Pork chop buns are popular street snacks.\n\nFood in Macau is mainly based on both Cantonese and Portuguese cuisine, drawing influences from Indian and Malay dishes as well, reflecting a unique cultural and culinary blend after centuries of colonial rule.[173] Portuguese recipes were adapted to use local ingredients, such as fresh seafood, turmeric, coconut milk, and adzuki beans. These adaptations produced Macanese variations of traditional Portuguese dishes including *caldo verde*, minchee, and *cozido \u00e0 portuguesa*. While many restaurants claim to serve traditional Portuguese or Macanese dishes, most serve a mix of Cantonese-Portuguese fusion cuisine. *Galinha \u00e0 portuguesa* is an example of a Chinese dish that draws from Macanese influences, but is not part of Macanese cuisine.[174] *Cha chaan teng*, a type of fast casual diner originating in Hong Kong that serves that region's interpretation of Western food, are also prevalent in Macau.[175] *Pastel de nata*, pork chop buns, and almond biscuits are popular street food items.[174]\n\n\n\n### Sports\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Sport in Macau\n\n![](image)Formula Three racers in the 2008 Macau Grand Prix\nDespite its small area, Macau is home to a variety of sports and recreational facilities that have hosted a number of major international sporting events, including the 2005 East Asian Games, the 2006 Lusophony Games, and the 2007 Asian Indoor Games.\n\n\nThe territory regularly hosts the Macau Grand Prix, one of the most significant annual motorsport competitions that uses city streets as the racetrack. It is the only street circuit that hosts Formula Three, touring car, and motorcycle races in the same event. The Guia Circuit, with narrow corner clearance and a winding path, is considered an extremely challenging course and a serious milestone for prospective Formula One racers.[176]\n\n\nMacau represents itself separately from mainland China with its own sports teams in international competitions. The territory maintains its own National Olympic Committee, but does not compete in the Olympic Games. International Olympic Committee rules specify that new NOCs can only be admitted if they represent sovereign states (Hong Kong has participated in the Olympics since before the regulation change in 1996).[177]\n\n\n\n## Twin towns and sister cities\n\n[edit]\n\nMacau has six sister cities, listed chronologically by year joined:[178]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Lisbon, Portugal (1982)\n* ![](image) Uwajima, Ehime, Japan (1987)\n* ![](image) Monte Carlo, Monaco (1992)\n* ![](image) Porto, Portugal (1997)\n* ![](image) Link\u00f6ping, Sweden (1997)\n* ![](image) Coimbra, Portugal (1998)\n* ![](image) S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil (2000)\n* ![](image) Praia, Cape Verde (2007)\n\nAdditionally, Macau has other cultural agreements with the following cities:[178]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Brussels, Belgium (1991)\n* ![](image) San Francisco, United States (2001)\n* ![](image) Da Nang, Vietnam (2006)\n* ![](image) Phuket, Thailand (2018)[179]\n\n\n### Union of Luso-Afro-Americo-Asiatic Capital Cities\n\n[edit]\n\nMacau is part of the Union of Luso-Afro-Americo-Asiatic Capital Cities[180][178] from 28 June 1985, establishing brotherly relations with the following cities:\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Bissau, Guinea-Bissau\n* ![](image) Dili, East Timor\n* ![](image) Lisbon, Portugal\n* ![](image) Luanda, Angola\n* ![](image) Maputo, Mozambique\n* ![](image) Panaji (Panjim), India\n* ![](image) Praia, Cape Verde\n* ![](image) Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n* ![](image) S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Foreign relations of Macau\n* Outline of Macau\n* Index of Macau-related articles\n* Cuiheng New Area\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** No specific variety of Chinese is official in the territory.

Ireland: 84,421 km\u00b2\n4. Qatar: 11,581 km\u00b2\n5. Macau: 115.3 km\u00b2\n\nThese figures show the total land area of each territory. As we can see, there is quite a range in sizes, from Singapore and Macau being relatively small city-states to Ireland having a much larger territory. Despite their different sizes, all of these places have managed to achieve very high GDP per capita through various economic strengths like financial services, technology, and in some cases natural resources.",
