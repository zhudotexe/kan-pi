The park straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The park contains some of the highest mountains in eastern North America, including Clingmans Dome, Mount Guyot, and Mount Le Conte. The border between the two states runs northeast to southwest through the center of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Georgia to Maine. With 14.1 million visitors in 2021, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United States.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nMap Highlighting the Park's Boundaries\n\nThe park encompasses 522,419 acres (816.28 sq mi; 211,415.47 ha; 2,114.15 km2), making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States.[3] The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) in the towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Cherokee, North Carolina, and also in Townsend, Tennessee. The park is internationally recognized for its mountains, waterfalls, biodiversity, and forests.[7] In addition, the park preserves multiple historical structures that were part of communities occupied by early European-American settlers of the area.[8]\n\n\nThe park was chartered by the United States Congress in 1934, and officially dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The Great Smoky Mountains was the first national park having land and other costs paid in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds.[9] The park was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and an International Biosphere Reserve in 1988.[10]\n\n\nAs the most visited national park in the United States, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park anchors a large tourism industry based in Sevier County, Tennessee adjacent to the park. Major attractions include Dollywood, the second-most visited tourist attraction in Tennessee, Ober Gatlinburg, and Ripley's Aquarium of the Smokies. Tourism to the park contributes an estimated $2.5 billion annually into the local economy.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor thousands of years, this region was occupied by successive cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Cherokee had their homeland here, and occupied numerous towns in the river valleys on both sides of the Appalachian Mountains. Their first encounters with Europeans were as traders, mostly coming from the colonial Carolinas and Virginia.\n\n\nEuropean Americans did not begin to settle here until the late 18th and early 19th centuries.[12] Particularly because of their pressure to acquire land in the Deep South, in 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, beginning the process that eventually resulted in the forced removal of all Indian tribes east of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).\n\n\nMost of the Cherokee were also removed. For a period some, led by such warriors as Tsali, evaded removal by staying in the area now part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A band on the Oconaluftee River acquired land and also remained. Their descendants make up most of the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, based in Cherokee, North Carolina, and their Qualla Boundary reserve to the south of the park.\n\n\n\n![](image)Clearcut logging in the Blue Ridge Mountains in Tennessee, 1936\nJohn Mingus, who built the Mingus Mill, and Ralph Hughes settled on the Oconaluftee in 1795. Other settlers soon followed and began clearing land and farming. In 1818, John Oliver and his family were the first white settlers to move into Cades Cove. After 1821, more families settled in Cades Cove including the Jobes, Gregorys, Sparkes, and Cables. As the community began to grow, the Cades Cove Baptist Church was established in 1827.[13]\n\n\nAs white settlers arrived, entrepreneurs developed logging as a major industry in the mountains. The Little River Railroad was constructed by Colonel W. B. Townsend[13] in the late-19th century to haul timber out of the remote regions of the area. Colonel Townsend had purchased 86,000 acres of land on the Little River. The construction of the Little River Railroad set an example for larger companies like the Ritter Lumber Company, Montvale Timber Company, and Norwood Lumber to also purchase acres of land for logging. The logging company Champion purchased 92,000 acres (37,000 ha) of land which included the Greenbrier Cove area and areas from Clingman's Dome to Mount Kephart. By 1909 logging was at its peak and by 1920 about two-thirds of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park area had been logged or burned by fires from logging operations.[13]\n\n\nBecause cut-and-run-style clearcutting was destroying the natural beauty of the area, by the 20th century visitors and locals banded together to raise money for preservation of the land. The U.S. National Park Service wanted a park in the eastern United States, but did not have much money to establish one. David C. Chapman; a Knoxville, Tennessee, business leader; was appointed in 1925 to head a commission to establish a national park here. Congress authorized the park in 1926, but there was no nucleus of federally owned land around which to develop it. John D. Rockefeller Jr. contributed $5 million, the U.S. government added $2 million, and private citizens from Tennessee and North Carolina pitched in to assemble the land for the park, piece by piece.\n\n\nSlowly, mountain homesteaders, miners, and loggers were evicted from the land. Farms and timbering operations were abolished to establish the protected areas of the park. Travel writer Horace Kephart, for whom Mount Kephart was named, and photographers Jim Thompson and George Masa were instrumental in fostering the development of the park.[9][14] Ben W. Hooper, a former governor of Tennessee, was the principal land purchasing agent for the park,[15] which was officially established on June 15, 1934. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, and other federal organizations hired workers to build trails, fire watchtowers, and other infrastructure improvements to the park and Smoky Mountains.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe majority of rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are Late Precambrian rocks that are part of the Ocoee Supergroup. This group consists of metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate. Early Precambrian rocks are not only the oldest rocks in the park but also the dominant rock type in sites such as the Raven Fork Valley and upper Tuckasegee River between Cherokee and Bryson City. They primarily consist of metamorphic gneiss, granite, and schist. Cambrian sedimentary rocks can be found among the bottom of the Foothills to the northwest, and in limestone coves such as Cades Cove.[16] One of the most visited attractions in the mountains is Cades Cove, which is a window or an area where older rocks made out of sandstone surround the valley floor of younger rocks made out of limestone.\n\n\nThe oldest rocks in the Smokies are the Precambrian gneiss and schists which were formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock. In the Late Precambrian, the primordial ocean expanded and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from the accumulation of eroding land mass onto the continental shelf. In the Paleozoic Era, the ocean deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rock. During the Ordovician Period, the collision of the North American and African tectonic plates initiated the Alleghenian orogeny that created the Appalachian range. During the Mesozoic Era rapid erosion of softer sedimentary rocks re-exposed the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.[17]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The observation tower at Clingmans Dome, the highest point in the national park\nElevations in the park range from about 875 feet (267 m) to 6,643 feet (2,025 m) at the summit of Clingmans Dome. Within the park a total of sixteen mountains reach higher than 5,000 feet (1,520 m).[18]\n\n\nThe wide range of elevations mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern United States. Ascending the mountains is comparable to a trip from Tennessee to Canada. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Great Smoky Mountains National Park has two climate types: humid subtropical (Cfa), and temperate oceanic (Cfb).[*citation needed*] The plant hardiness zone at Clingmans Dome Visitor Center is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of −14.3 °F (−25.7 °C).[19]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Clingmans Dome Visitor Center, North Carolina (1981–2010 averages).

Annual precipitation amounts range from 50–80 in (1,300–2,000 mm),[22] with heavy winter snowfall in the higher elevations.[23] Flash flooding often occurs after heavy rain.[22]\n\n\nThe average temperature difference between the mountains, such as Newfound Gap at 5,048 ft (1,539 m) above MSL, and the valleys at about 1,600 ft (488 m), is between 10–13 °F (5.6–7.2 °C) for highs, and between 3–6 °F (1.7–3.3 °C) for lows. The difference between high temperatures is similar to the moist adiabatic lapse rate of 3.3 °F (1.8 °C) per 1,000 ft (300 m), while the smaller difference between low temperatures is the result of frequent temperature inversions developing in the morning, most often in autumn.[24]\n\n\nStrong damaging winds of 80–100 mph (130–160 km/h) or higher occur a few times each year around the Smoky Mountains, mainly during the cool season from October to April, as a result of a phenomenon known as mountain waves.[25] Mountain waves are strongest in a narrow area along the foothills, and can create extensive areas of fallen trees and roof damage, especially around Cades Cove and Cove Mountain.[26] Strong winds created by mountain waves were a contributing factor in the devastating Gatlinburg fire on November 28, 2016, during the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.[27] Damaging winds can also be generated by strong thunderstorms, with tornadoes and strong thunderstorm complexes (also known as mesoscale convective systems) occasionally affecting the Smoky Mountains.[28]\n\n\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nThe park is affected by air pollution because of increased development. In a 2004 report by the National Parks Conservation Association, Great Smoky Mountains National Park was considered the most polluted national park. From 1999 to 2003, the park recorded approximately 150 unhealthy air days, the equivalent of about one month of unhealthy air days per year.[29][30] In 2013, Colorado State University reported that, due to the passing of the United States Clean Air Act in 1970, and the subsequent implementation of the Acid Rain Program, there had been a \"significant improvement\" to the air quality in the Great Smoky Mountains from 1990 to 2010.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Biology and ecology[edit]\n\n\nThe park is almost 95 percent forested, and almost 36 percent of it, 187,000 acres (76,000 ha), is estimated by the Park Service to be old growth forest with many trees that predate European settlement of the area.[33] It is one of the largest blocks of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America.\n\n\n\n![](image)Colorful autumn leaves in October 2008\nThe variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of biota. About 19,000 species of organisms are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 100,000 undocumented species may also be present.\n\n\nPark officials count more than 200 species of birds, 50 species of fish, 39 species of reptiles, and 43 species of amphibians, including many lungless salamanders. The park is an important site for salamanders.[34] The park has a noteworthy black bear population, numbering about 1,500.[35] An attempt to reintroduce red wolves into the park in 1991 failed drastically, forcing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services to remove the wolves from the area in 1998. Elk (wapiti) were reintroduced to the park in 2001, three years after the FWS removed the red wolves from the area. Elk are most abundant in the Cataloochee area in the southeastern section of the park.[36]\n\n\nIt is also home to species of mammals such as the raccoon, bobcat, two species of fox, river otter, woodchuck, beaver, two species of squirrel, opossum, coyote, white-tailed deer, chipmunk, two species of skunk, and various species of bats.\n\n\nOver 100 species of trees grow in the park. The lower region forests are dominated by deciduous leafy trees. At higher altitudes, deciduous forests give way to coniferous trees like Fraser fir. In addition, the park has over 1,400 flowering plant species and over 4,000 species of non-flowering plants.\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\nThere have been hundreds of known species of fish living in the area.\n\n\n\n#### List of fish[edit]\n\n\nSource:[37]\n\n\n\n* American gizzard shad\n* Lamoetra appendix\n* Longnose gar\n* Mountain brook lamprey\n* Brook trout\n\n\n## Attractions and activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Alum Cave Trail to the summit of Mount LeConte provides numerous views of the Great Smoky Mountains.\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a major tourist attraction in the region. It has been the most visited national park for many years, with over 14.1 million recreational visitors (tourists) in 2021.[38] The recreational figure represents nearly twice as many tourists as the Grand Canyon, which received nearly 6 million visitors the same year. Surrounding towns, notably Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Townsend, Tennessee, and Cherokee, Sylva, Maggie Valley, and Bryson City, North Carolina, receive a significant portion of their income from tourism associated with the park.\n\n\nThe two main visitor centers inside the park are Sugarlands Visitors' Center near the Gatlinburg entrance to the park and Oconaluftee Visitor Center near Cherokee, North Carolina, at the eastern entrance to the park. These ranger stations provide exhibits on wildlife, geology, and the history of the park. They also sell books, maps, and souvenirs. Entrance into the park is free.[39]\n\n\nU.S. Highway 441 (known in the park as Newfound Gap Road) bisects the park, providing automobile access to many trailheads and overlooks, most notably that of Newfound Gap. At an elevation of 5,048 feet (1,539 m), it is the lowest gap in the mountains and is situated near the center of the park, on the Tennessee/North Carolina state line, halfway between the border towns of Gatlinburg and Cherokee. It was here that in 1940, from the Rockefeller Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the national park. On clear days Newfound Gap offers arguably the most spectacular scenes accessible via highway in the park.\n\n\nLakeview Drive, located along the north shore of Fontana Lake, is a scenic road that was never completed. Split in two segments, it is accessible via either Fontana Dam or Bryson City. It features an unused road tunnel and connects to various hiking and horse-back riding trails in the area.\n\n\nThe park has a number of historical attractions. The most well-preserved of these (and most popular) is Cades Cove, a valley with a number of preserved historic buildings including log cabins, barns, and churches. Cades Cove is the single most frequented destination in the national park. Self-guided automobile and bicycle tours offer the many sightseers a glimpse into the way of life of old-time southern Appalachia. Other historical areas within the park include Roaring Fork, Cataloochee, Elkmont, and the Mountain Farm Museum and Mingus Mill on the Oconaluftee River.\n\n\n\n### Hiking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\nThere are 850 miles (1,370 km) of trails and unpaved roads in the park for hiking, including 70 miles (110 km) of the Appalachian Trail.[40] Mount Le Conte is one of the most frequented destinations in the park. Its elevation is 6,593 feet (2,010 m), the third highest summit in the park and, measured from its base to its highest peak, the tallest mountain east of the Mississippi River. Alum Cave Trail is the most heavily used of the five paths en route to the summit. It provides many scenic overlooks and unique natural attractions such as Alum Cave Bluffs and Arch Rock. Hikers may spend a night at the LeConte Lodge, located near the summit, which provides cabins and rooms for rent (except during the winter season). Accessible solely by trail, it is the only private lodging available inside the park.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Chimney Tops was a popular destination for hikers until access was closed due to damage from the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.\nAnother popular hiking trail led to the pinnacle of the Chimney Tops, so named because of its unique dual-humped peaktops. This short but strenuous trek rewarded nature enthusiasts with a spectacular panorama of the surrounding mountain peaks. It was the flashpoint for the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, and therefore sustained extensive damage, evident still today in clearly visible burn scars. The peak has been closed to tourists ever since.\n\n\nBoth the Laurel Falls and Clingmans Dome trails offer relatively easy, short, paved paths to their respective destinations. The Laurel Falls Trail leads to a powerful 80-foot (24 m) waterfall, and the Clingmans Dome Trail takes visitors on an uphill climb to a 50 feet (15 m) tall observation deck, which on a clear day offers views for many miles over the Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia mountains.\n\n\nIn addition to day hiking, the national park offers opportunities for backpacking and camping. Camping is allowed only in designated camping areas and shelters. Most of the park's trail shelters are located along the Appalachian Trail or a short distance away on side trails. In addition to the Appalachian Trail shelters used mostly for extended backpacking trips there are three shelters in the park that are not located on the Appalachian Trail. The Mt. LeConte Shelter is located a short distance east of LeConte Lodge on The Boulevard Trail. It can accommodate 12 people per night, and is the only backcountry site in the entire park that has a permanent ban on campfires. The Kephart Shelter is located at the terminus of the Kephart Prong Trail which begins upstream of the Collins Creek Picnic Area. The shelter, situated along a tributary of the Oconaluftee River can accommodate 14 people. Laurel Gap Shelter is one of the more remote shelters in the park. Situated in a Beech forest swag between Balsam High Top and Big Cataloochee Mountain, the Laurel Gap Shelter can accommodate up to 14 people per night. This shelter is a popular base camp for peakbaggers exploring the heart of the Smokies wilderness.\n\n\nDesignated backcountry campsites are scattered throughout the park. A permit, available at ranger stations and via the park website, is required for all backcountry camping. Additionally, reservations are required for all of the shelters and backcountry campsites. A maximum stay of one night, in the case of shelters, or three nights, in the case of campsites, may limit the traveler's itinerary.\n\n\n\n### Other activities[edit]\n\n\nAfter hiking and simple sightseeing, fishing (especially fly fishing) is the most popular activity in the national park. The park's waters have long had a reputation for healthy trout activity as well as challenging fishing terrain. Brook trout are native to the waters, while both brown and rainbow were introduced to the area. Partially due to the fact of recent droughts killing off the native fish, there are strict regulations regarding how fishing may be conducted. Horseback riding (offered by the national park and on limited trails), bicycling (available for rent in Cades Cove) and water tubing are all also practiced within the park.\n\n\nFrom late May to early June, the Elkmont area of the park hosts the peak display period for synchronous fireflies (*Photinus carolinus*), one of at least 19 species of fireflies that live in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[41] They are the only species in America whose individuals can synchronize their flashing light patterns.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cades Cove panorama\n## Historic areas within the national park[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of historical structures maintained by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\n![](image)The Becky Cable house in the Cades Cove Historic District was built in 1879.\nThe park service maintains four historic districts and one archaeological district within park boundaries, as well as nine individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places. Notable structures not listed include the Mountain Farm Museum buildings at Oconaluftee and buildings in the Cataloochee area. The Mingus Mill (in Oconaluftee) and Smoky Mountain Hiking Club cabin in Greenbrier have been deemed eligible for listing.\n\n\n\n### Historic districts[edit]\n\n\n* Cades Cove Historic District\n* Elkmont Historic District\n* Oconaluftee Archaeological District\n* Noah Ogle Place\n* Roaring Fork Historic District\n\n\n### Individual listings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The John Ownby Cabin in The Sugarlands valley was built in 1860.\n* Alex Cole Cabin\n* Clingmans Dome Observation Tower\n* Hall Cabin (in Hazel Creek area)\n* John Messer Barn\n* John Ownby Cabin\n* Oconaluftee Baptist Church (also called Smokemont Baptist Church)\n* Tyson McCarter Place\n* Mayna Treanor Avent Studio\n* Little Greenbrier School\n* Walker Sisters Place\n\n\n## Cultural importance[edit]\n\n\nThe park was used for filming scenes of Disney's hit 1950s TV series *Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier*.\n\n\nThis park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, was certified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and became a part of the Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve in 1988.[43]\n\n\nA 75th anniversary re-dedication ceremony was held on 2 September 2009. Among those in attendance were the four U.S. senators from Tennessee and North Carolina, the three US Representatives whose districts include the park, the governors of both states, and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Dolly Parton, Tennessee native, singer, and actress also attended and performed.[44]\n\n\nIn late November and early December 2016, a series of wildfires engulfed a total of 17,900 acres (72 km2) in the park and surrounding areas. The wildfires killed at least 14, injured 190, and forced the evacuation of more than 14,000 people.[45] The fires also damaged or destroyed at least 2,000 structures. The fires, which were initially suspected to have been caused by arson, occurred during a period of unusual drought, which accelerated the fires. The wildfires were the deadliest in the Eastern United States since the Great Fires of 1947, and comprised one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Tennessee.[46][47][48][49]\n\n\nIn 2015 Cassius Cash was appointed as the first African-American superintendent of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He is the 16th superintendent of the park.[50]\n\n\nIn 2023, the national park will be featured on a USPS Priority Mail Express stamp depicting a scene near the Newfound Gap. The stamp was designed by USPS art director Greg Breeding, with art from Dan Cosgrove.[51]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Great Smoky Mountains Association\n* Great Smoky Mountains Heritage Center\n* Wildflowers of the Great Smoky Mountains\n* List of birds of Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Great Smoky Mountains in United States of America Archived 24 July 2019 at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

The park straddles the ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are a division of the larger Appalachian Mountain chain. The park contains some of the highest mountains in eastern North America, including Clingmans Dome, Mount Guyot, and Mount Le Conte. The border between the two states runs northeast to southwest through the center of the park. The Appalachian Trail passes through the center of the park on its route from Georgia to Maine. With 14.1 million visitors in 2021, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the most visited national park in the United States.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nMap Highlighting the Park's Boundaries\n\nThe park encompasses 522,419 acres (816.28 sq mi; 211,415.47 ha; 2,114.15 km2), making it one of the largest protected areas in the eastern United States.[3] The main park entrances are located along U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road) in the towns of Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Cherokee, North Carolina, and also in Townsend, Tennessee. The park is internationally recognized for its mountains, waterfalls, biodiversity, and forests.[7] In addition, the park preserves multiple historical structures that were part of communities occupied by early European-American settlers of the area.[8]\n\n\nThe park was chartered by the United States Congress in 1934, and officially dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940. The Great Smoky Mountains was the first national park having land and other costs paid in part with federal funds; previous parks were funded wholly with state money or private funds.[9] The park was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and an International Biosphere Reserve in 1988.[10]\n\n\nAs the most visited national park in the United States, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park anchors a large tourism industry based in Sevier County, Tennessee adjacent to the park. Major attractions include Dollywood, the second-most visited tourist attraction in Tennessee, Ober Gatlinburg, and Ripley's Aquarium of the Smokies. Tourism to the park contributes an estimated $2.5 billion annually into the local economy.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor thousands of years, this region was occupied by successive cultures of indigenous peoples. The historic Cherokee had their homeland here, and occupied numerous towns in the river valleys on both sides of the Appalachian Mountains. Their first encounters with Europeans were as traders, mostly coming from the colonial Carolinas and Virginia.\n\n\nEuropean Americans did not begin to settle here until the late 18th and early 19th centuries.[12] Particularly because of their pressure to acquire land in the Deep South, in 1830 President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act, beginning the process that eventually resulted in the forced removal of all Indian tribes east of the Mississippi River to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).\n\n\nMost of the Cherokee were also removed. For a period some, led by such warriors as Tsali, evaded removal by staying in the area now part of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. A band on the Oconaluftee River acquired land and also remained. Their descendants make up most of the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, based in Cherokee, North Carolina, and their Qualla Boundary reserve to the south of the park.\n\n\n\n![](image)Clearcut logging in the Blue Ridge Mountains in Tennessee, 1936\nJohn Mingus, who built the Mingus Mill, and Ralph Hughes settled on the Oconaluftee in 1795. Other settlers soon followed and began clearing land and farming. In 1818, John Oliver and his family were the first white settlers to move into Cades Cove. After 1821, more families settled in Cades Cove including the Jobes, Gregorys, Sparkes, and Cables. As the community began to grow, the Cades Cove Baptist Church was established in 1827.[13]\n\n\nAs white settlers arrived, entrepreneurs developed logging as a major industry in the mountains. The Little River Railroad was constructed by Colonel W. B. Townsend[13] in the late-19th century to haul timber out of the remote regions of the area. Colonel Townsend had purchased 86,000 acres of land on the Little River. The construction of the Little River Railroad set an example for larger companies like the Ritter Lumber Company, Montvale Timber Company, and Norwood Lumber to also purchase acres of land for logging. The logging company Champion purchased 92,000 acres (37,000 ha) of land which included the Greenbrier Cove area and areas from Clingman's Dome to Mount Kephart. By 1909 logging was at its peak and by 1920 about two-thirds of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park area had been logged or burned by fires from logging operations.[13]\n\n\nBecause cut-and-run-style clearcutting was destroying the natural beauty of the area, by the 20th century visitors and locals banded together to raise money for preservation of the land. The U.S. National Park Service wanted a park in the eastern United States, but did not have much money to establish one. David C. Chapman; a Knoxville, Tennessee, business leader; was appointed in 1925 to head a commission to establish a national park here. Congress authorized the park in 1926, but there was no nucleus of federally owned land around which to develop it. John D. Rockefeller Jr. contributed $5 million, the U.S. government added $2 million, and private citizens from Tennessee and North Carolina pitched in to assemble the land for the park, piece by piece.\n\n\nSlowly, mountain homesteaders, miners, and loggers were evicted from the land. Farms and timbering operations were abolished to establish the protected areas of the park. Travel writer Horace Kephart, for whom Mount Kephart was named, and photographers Jim Thompson and George Masa were instrumental in fostering the development of the park.[9][14] Ben W. Hooper, a former governor of Tennessee, was the principal land purchasing agent for the park,[15] which was officially established on June 15, 1934. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Works Progress Administration, and other federal organizations hired workers to build trails, fire watchtowers, and other infrastructure improvements to the park and Smoky Mountains.\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe majority of rocks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park are Late Precambrian rocks that are part of the Ocoee Supergroup. This group consists of metamorphosed sandstones, phyllites, schists, and slate. Early Precambrian rocks are not only the oldest rocks in the park but also the dominant rock type in sites such as the Raven Fork Valley and upper Tuckasegee River between Cherokee and Bryson City. They primarily consist of metamorphic gneiss, granite, and schist. Cambrian sedimentary rocks can be found among the bottom of the Foothills to the northwest, and in limestone coves such as Cades Cove.[16] One of the most visited attractions in the mountains is Cades Cove, which is a window or an area where older rocks made out of sandstone surround the valley floor of younger rocks made out of limestone.\n\n\nThe oldest rocks in the Smokies are the Precambrian gneiss and schists which were formed over a billion years ago from the accumulation of marine sediments and igneous rock. In the Late Precambrian, the primordial ocean expanded and the more recent Ocoee Supergroup rocks formed from the accumulation of eroding land mass onto the continental shelf. In the Paleozoic Era, the ocean deposited a thick layer of marine sediments which left behind sedimentary rock. During the Ordovician Period, the collision of the North American and African tectonic plates initiated the Alleghenian orogeny that created the Appalachian range. During the Mesozoic Era rapid erosion of softer sedimentary rocks re-exposed the older Ocoee Supergroup formations.[17]\n\n\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The observation tower at Clingmans Dome, the highest point in the national park\nElevations in the park range from about 875 feet (267 m) to 6,643 feet (2,025 m) at the summit of Clingmans Dome. Within the park a total of sixteen mountains reach higher than 5,000 feet (1,520 m).[18]\n\n\nThe wide range of elevations mimics the latitudinal changes found throughout the entire eastern United States. Ascending the mountains is comparable to a trip from Tennessee to Canada. Plants and animals common in the country's Northeast have found suitable ecological niches in the park's higher elevations, while southern species find homes in the balmier lower reaches.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification system, Great Smoky Mountains National Park has two climate types: humid subtropical (Cfa), and temperate oceanic (Cfb).[*citation needed*] The plant hardiness zone at Clingmans Dome Visitor Center is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of −14.3 °F (−25.7 °C).[19]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Clingmans Dome Visitor Center, North Carolina (1981–2010 averages).

Annual precipitation amounts range from 50–80 in (1,300–2,000 mm),[22] with heavy winter snowfall in the higher elevations.[23] Flash flooding often occurs after heavy rain.[22]\n\n\nThe average temperature difference between the mountains, such as Newfound Gap at 5,048 ft (1,539 m) above MSL, and the valleys at about 1,600 ft (488 m), is between 10–13 °F (5.6–7.2 °C) for highs, and between 3–6 °F (1.7–3.3 °C) for lows. The difference between high temperatures is similar to the moist adiabatic lapse rate of 3.3 °F (1.8 °C) per 1,000 ft (300 m), while the smaller difference between low temperatures is the result of frequent temperature inversions developing in the morning, most often in autumn.[24]\n\n\nStrong damaging winds of 80–100 mph (130–160 km/h) or higher occur a few times each year around the Smoky Mountains, mainly during the cool season from October to April, as a result of a phenomenon known as mountain waves.[25] Mountain waves are strongest in a narrow area along the foothills, and can create extensive areas of fallen trees and roof damage, especially around Cades Cove and Cove Mountain.[26] Strong winds created by mountain waves were a contributing factor in the devastating Gatlinburg fire on November 28, 2016, during the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.[27] Damaging winds can also be generated by strong thunderstorms, with tornadoes and strong thunderstorm complexes (also known as mesoscale convective systems) occasionally affecting the Smoky Mountains.[28]\n\n\n\n### Air pollution[edit]\n\n\nThe park is affected by air pollution because of increased development. In a 2004 report by the National Parks Conservation Association, Great Smoky Mountains National Park was considered the most polluted national park. From 1999 to 2003, the park recorded approximately 150 unhealthy air days, the equivalent of about one month of unhealthy air days per year.[29][30] In 2013, Colorado State University reported that, due to the passing of the United States Clean Air Act in 1970, and the subsequent implementation of the Acid Rain Program, there had been a \"significant improvement\" to the air quality in the Great Smoky Mountains from 1990 to 2010.[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Biology and ecology[edit]\n\n\nThe park is almost 95 percent forested, and almost 36 percent of it, 187,000 acres (76,000 ha), is estimated by the Park Service to be old growth forest with many trees that predate European settlement of the area.[33] It is one of the largest blocks of deciduous, temperate, old growth forest in North America.\n\n\n\n![](image)Colorful autumn leaves in October 2008\nThe variety of elevations, the abundant rainfall, and the presence of old growth forests give the park an unusual richness of biota. About 19,000 species of organisms are known to live in the park, and estimates as high as an additional 100,000 undocumented species may also be present.\n\n\nPark officials count more than 200 species of birds, 50 species of fish, 39 species of reptiles, and 43 species of amphibians, including many lungless salamanders. The park is an important site for salamanders.[34] The park has a noteworthy black bear population, numbering about 1,500.[35] An attempt to reintroduce red wolves into the park in 1991 failed drastically, forcing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services to remove the wolves from the area in 1998. Elk (wapiti) were reintroduced to the park in 2001, three years after the FWS removed the red wolves from the area. Elk are most abundant in the Cataloochee area in the southeastern section of the park.[36]\n\n\nIt is also home to species of mammals such as the raccoon, bobcat, two species of fox, river otter, woodchuck, beaver, two species of squirrel, opossum, coyote, white-tailed deer, chipmunk, two species of skunk, and various species of bats.\n\n\nOver 100 species of trees grow in the park. The lower region forests are dominated by deciduous leafy trees. At higher altitudes, deciduous forests give way to coniferous trees like Fraser fir. In addition, the park has over 1,400 flowering plant species and over 4,000 species of non-flowering plants.\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\nThere have been hundreds of known species of fish living in the area.\n\n\n\n#### List of fish[edit]\n\n\nSource:[37]\n\n\n\n* American gizzard shad\n* Lamoetra appendix\n* Longnose gar\n* Mountain brook lamprey\n* Brook trout\n\n\n## Attractions and activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Alum Cave Trail to the summit of Mount LeConte provides numerous views of the Great Smoky Mountains.\nThe Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a major tourist attraction in the region. It has been the most visited national park for many years, with over 14.1 million recreational visitors (tourists) in 2021.[38] The recreational figure represents nearly twice as many tourists as the Grand Canyon, which received nearly 6 million visitors the same year. Surrounding towns, notably Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Sevierville, and Townsend, Tennessee, and Cherokee, Sylva, Maggie Valley, and Bryson City, North Carolina, receive a significant portion of their income from tourism associated with the park.\n\n\nThe two main visitor centers inside the park are Sugarlands Visitors' Center near the Gatlinburg entrance to the park and Oconaluftee Visitor Center near Cherokee, North Carolina, at the eastern entrance to the park. These ranger stations provide exhibits on wildlife, geology, and the history of the park. They also sell books, maps, and souvenirs. Entrance into the park is free.[39]\n\n\nU.S. Highway 441 (known in the park as Newfound Gap Road) bisects the park, providing automobile access to many trailheads and overlooks, most notably that of Newfound Gap. At an elevation of 5,048 feet (1,539 m), it is the lowest gap in the mountains and is situated near the center of the park, on the Tennessee/North Carolina state line, halfway between the border towns of Gatlinburg and Cherokee. It was here that in 1940, from the Rockefeller Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt dedicated the national park. On clear days Newfound Gap offers arguably the most spectacular scenes accessible via highway in the park.\n\n\nLakeview Drive, located along the north shore of Fontana Lake, is a scenic road that was never completed. Split in two segments, it is accessible via either Fontana Dam or Bryson City. It features an unused road tunnel and connects to various hiking and horse-back riding trails in the area.\n\n\nThe park has a number of historical attractions. The most well-preserved of these (and most popular) is Cades Cove, a valley with a number of preserved historic buildings including log cabins, barns, and churches. Cades Cove is the single most frequented destination in the national park. Self-guided automobile and bicycle tours offer the many sightseers a glimpse into the way of life of old-time southern Appalachia. Other historical areas within the park include Roaring Fork, Cataloochee, Elkmont, and the Mountain Farm Museum and Mingus Mill on the Oconaluftee River.\n\n\n\n### Hiking[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hiking in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\nThere are 850 miles (1,370 km) of trails and unpaved roads in the park for hiking, including 70 miles (110 km) of the Appalachian Trail.[40] Mount Le Conte is one of the most frequented destinations in the park. Its elevation is 6,593 feet (2,010 m), the third highest summit in the park and, measured from its base to its highest peak, the tallest mountain east of the Mississippi River. Alum Cave Trail is the most heavily used of the five paths en route to the summit. It provides many scenic overlooks and unique natural attractions such as Alum Cave Bluffs and Arch Rock. Hikers may spend a night at the LeConte Lodge, located near the summit, which provides cabins and rooms for rent (except during the winter season). Accessible solely by trail, it is the only private lodging available inside the park.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Chimney Tops was a popular destination for hikers until access was closed due to damage from the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires.\nAnother popular hiking trail led to the pinnacle of the Chimney Tops, so named because of its unique dual-humped peaktops. This short but strenuous trek rewarded nature enthusiasts with a spectacular panorama of the surrounding mountain peaks. It was the flashpoint for the 2016 Great Smoky Mountains wildfires, and therefore sustained extensive damage, evident still today in clearly visible burn scars. The peak has been closed to tourists ever since.\n\n\nBoth the Laurel Falls and Clingmans Dome trails offer relatively easy, short, paved paths to their respective destinations. The Laurel Falls Trail leads to a powerful 80-foot (24 m) waterfall, and the Clingmans Dome Trail takes visitors on an uphill climb to a 50 feet (15 m) tall observation deck, which on a clear day offers views for many miles over the Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia mountains.\n\n\nIn addition to day hiking, the national park offers opportunities for backpacking and camping. Camping is allowed only in designated camping areas and shelters. Most of the park's trail shelters are located along the Appalachian Trail or a short distance away on side trails. In addition to the Appalachian Trail shelters used mostly for extended backpacking trips there are three shelters in the park that are not located on the Appalachian Trail. The Mt. LeConte Shelter is located a short distance east of LeConte Lodge on The Boulevard Trail. It can accommodate 12 people per night, and is the only backcountry site in the entire park that has a permanent ban on campfires. The Kephart Shelter is located at the terminus of the Kephart Prong Trail which begins upstream of the Collins Creek Picnic Area. The shelter, situated along a tributary of the Oconaluftee River can accommodate 14 people. Laurel Gap Shelter is one of the more remote shelters in the park. Situated in a Beech forest swag between Balsam High Top and Big Cataloochee Mountain, the Laurel Gap Shelter can accommodate up to 14 people per night. This shelter is a popular base camp for peakbaggers exploring the heart of the Smokies wilderness.\n\n\nDesignated backcountry campsites are scattered throughout the park. A permit, available at ranger stations and via the park website, is required for all backcountry camping. Additionally, reservations are required for all of the shelters and backcountry campsites. A maximum stay of one night, in the case of shelters, or three nights, in the case of campsites, may limit the traveler's itinerary.\n\n\n\n### Other activities[edit]\n\n\nAfter hiking and simple sightseeing, fishing (especially fly fishing) is the most popular activity in the national park. The park's waters have long had a reputation for healthy trout activity as well as challenging fishing terrain. Brook trout are native to the waters, while both brown and rainbow were introduced to the area. Partially due to the fact of recent droughts killing off the native fish, there are strict regulations regarding how fishing may be conducted. Horseback riding (offered by the national park and on limited trails), bicycling (available for rent in Cades Cove) and water tubing are all also practiced within the park.\n\n\nFrom late May to early June, the Elkmont area of the park hosts the peak display period for synchronous fireflies (*Photinus carolinus*), one of at least 19 species of fireflies that live in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[41] They are the only species in America whose individuals can synchronize their flashing light patterns.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cades Cove panorama\n## Historic areas within the national park[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of historical structures maintained by the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\n![](image)The Becky Cable house in the Cades Cove Historic District was built in 1879.\nThe park service maintains four historic districts and one archaeological district within park boundaries, as well as nine individual listings on the National Register of Historic Places. Notable structures not listed include the Mountain Farm Museum buildings at Oconaluftee and buildings in the Cataloochee area. The Mingus Mill (in Oconaluftee) and Smoky Mountain Hiking Club cabin in Greenbrier have been deemed eligible for listing.\n\n\n\n### Historic districts[edit]\n\n\n* Cades Cove Historic District\n* Elkmont Historic District\n* Oconaluftee Archaeological District\n* Noah Ogle Place\n* Roaring Fork Historic District\n\n\n### Individual listings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The John Ownby Cabin in The Sugarlands valley was built in 1860.\n* Alex Cole Cabin\n* Clingmans Dome Observation Tower\n* Hall Cabin (in Hazel Creek area)\n* John Messer Barn\n* John Ownby Cabin\n* Oconaluftee Baptist Church (also called Smokemont Baptist Church)\n* Tyson McCarter Place\n* Mayna Treanor Avent Studio\n* Little Greenbrier School\n* Walker Sisters Place\n\n\n## Cultural importance[edit]\n\n\nThe park was used for filming scenes of Disney's hit 1950s TV series *Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier*.\n\n\nThis park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1976, was certified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983, and became a part of the Southern Appalachian Biosphere Reserve in 1988.[43]\n\n\nA 75th anniversary re-dedication ceremony was held on 2 September 2009. Among those in attendance were the four U.S. senators from Tennessee and North Carolina, the three US Representatives whose districts include the park, the governors of both states, and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar. Dolly Parton, Tennessee native, singer, and actress also attended and performed.[44]\n\n\nIn late November and early December 2016, a series of wildfires engulfed a total of 17,900 acres (72 km2) in the park and surrounding areas. The wildfires killed at least 14, injured 190, and forced the evacuation of more than 14,000 people.[45] The fires also damaged or destroyed at least 2,000 structures. The fires, which were initially suspected to have been caused by arson, occurred during a period of unusual drought, which accelerated the fires. The wildfires were the deadliest in the Eastern United States since the Great Fires of 1947, and comprised one of the worst natural disasters in the history of Tennessee.[46][47][48][49]\n\n\nIn 2015 Cassius Cash was appointed as the first African-American superintendent of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He is the 16th superintendent of the park.[50]\n\n\nIn 2023, the national park will be featured on a USPS Priority Mail Express stamp depicting a scene near the Newfound Gap. The stamp was designed by USPS art director Greg Breeding, with art from Dan Cosgrove.[51]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Great Smoky Mountains Association\n* Great Smoky Mountains Heritage Center\n* Wildflowers of the Great Smoky Mountains\n* List of birds of Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n* List of national parks of the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Great Smoky Mountains in United States of America Archived 24 July 2019 at the Wayback Machine. *protectedplanet.net*.

Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River.\n\n\nHuman habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Ancestral Puebloans (who used to be called Anasazi by early non-indigenous archeologists[4])(c. 300 CE). Subsequently, what has been called the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities.[5] Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. \n\n\n\n\n## Name change[edit]\n\n\nIn 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area **Mukuntuweap National Monument** in order to protect the canyon.[6] In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to **Zion National Monument**, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.[6] According to historian Hal Rothman: \"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time. Many believed that Spanish and Indian names would deter visitors who, if they could not pronounce the name of a place, might not bother to visit it.[7] The new name, Zion, had greater appeal to an ethnocentric audience.\"[8] On November 19, 1919, Congress redesignated the monument as **Zion National Park**, and the act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson.[9] The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate Zion National Monument in 1937, but was incorporated into the national park in 1956.[10] Congress designated 85% of the park a wilderness area in 2009.\n\n\nThe geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area includes nine formations that together represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation. At various periods in that time warm, shallow seas, streams, ponds and lakes, vast deserts, and dry near-shore environments covered the area. Uplift associated with the creation of the Colorado Plateau lifted the region 10,000 feet (3,000 m) starting 13 million years ago.[11]\n\n\n\n## Park purpose[edit]\n\n\nAs stated in the foundation document:[12]\n\n\n\n\n> The purpose of Zion National Park is to preserve the dramatic geology including Zion Canyon and a labyrinth of deep and brilliantly colored Navajo sandstone canyons formed by extraordinary processes of erosion at the margin of the Colorado Plateau; to safeguard the park's wilderness character and its wild and scenic river values; to protect evidence of human history; and to provide for scientific research and the enjoyment and enlightenment of the public.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nThe park is located in southwestern Utah in Washington, Iron and Kane counties. Geomorphically, it is located on the Markagunt and Kolob plateaus, at the intersection of three North American geographic provinces: the Colorado Plateau, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert. The northern part of the park is known as the **Kolob Canyons** section and is accessible from Interstate 15, exit 40.[13]\n\n\nThe 8,726-foot (2,660 m) summit of Horse Ranch Mountain is the highest point in the park; the lowest point is the 3,666-foot (1,117 m) elevation of Coal Pits Wash, creating a relief of about 5,100 feet (1,600 m).[14]\n\n\nStreams in the area take rectangular paths because they follow jointing planes in the rocks.[15] The stream gradient of the Virgin River, whose North Fork flows through Zion Canyon in the park, ranges from 50 to 80 feet per mile (9.5 to 15.2 m/km) (0.9–1.5%)—one of the steepest stream gradients in North America.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Towers of the Virgin: The Sundial (left), The Witch Head, Broken Tooth, Rotten Tooth, Altar of Sacrifice\nThe road into Zion Canyon is 6 miles (9.7 km) long, ending at the Temple of Sinawava, which is named for the coyote god of the Paiute Indians.[17] The canyon becomes more narrow near the Temple and a hiking trail continues to the mouth of The Narrows, a gorge only 20 feet (6 m) wide and up to 2,000 feet (610 m) tall.[18] The Zion Canyon road is served by a free shuttle bus from early April to late October and by private vehicles the other months of the year. Other roads in Zion are open to private vehicles year-round.\n\n\nThe east side of the park is served by Zion-Mount Carmel Highway (SR-9), which passes through the Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel and ends at US 89 at Mount Carmel Junction. Park features on the east side of the park include Checkerboard Mesa and The East Temple.\n\n\nThe Kolob Terrace area, northwest of Zion Canyon, features a slot canyon called The Subway, and a panoramic view of the entire area from Lava Point. The Kolob Canyons section, further to the northwest near Cedar City, features Tucupit Point and one of the world's longest natural arches, Kolob Arch.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Court of the Patriarchs, by Ansel Adams (1933)\nOther notable geographic features of Zion Canyon include Angels Landing, The Great White Throne, the Court of the Patriarchs, The Sentinel, The West Temple, Towers of the Virgin, the Altar of Sacrifice, The Watchman, Weeping Rock, and the Emerald Pools.[20]\n\n\nSpring weather is unpredictable, with stormy, wet days being common, mixed with occasional warm, sunny weather. Precipitation is normally heaviest in March.[21] Spring wildflowers bloom from April through June, peaking in May. Fall days are usually clear and mild; nights are often cool. Summer days are hot (95 to 110 °F; 35 to 43 °C), but overnight lows are usually comfortable (65 to 70 °F; 18 to 21 °C).[21] Afternoon thunderstorms are common from mid-July through mid-September.[21] Storms may produce waterfalls as well as flash floods. Autumn tree-color displays begin in September in the high country; in Zion Canyon, autumn colors usually peak in late October. Winter in Zion Canyon is fairly mild. Winter storms bring rain or light snow to Zion Canyon and heavier snow to the higher elevations. Clear days may become quite warm, reaching 60 °F (16 °C); nights are often 20 to 40 °F (−7 to 4 °C).[21] Winter storms can last several days and make roads icy. Zion roads are plowed, except the Kolob Terrace Road which is closed when covered with snow.[21] Winter driving conditions last from November through March.[21]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nZion National Park has a *BSk* (Köppen climate classification) cold semi-arid climate consisting of very hot summers and mild winters with a limited amount of precipitation throughout the year.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Zion National Park, Utah, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1904–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 74(23)\n | 97(36)\n | 91(33)\n | 97(36)\n | 106(41)\n | 114(46)\n | 115(46)\n | 112(44)\n | 110(43)\n | 99(37)\n | 90(32)\n | 81(27)\n | 115(46)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 66.3(19.1)\n | 70.3(21.3)\n | 79.8(26.6)\n | 87.8(31.0)\n | 97.0(36.1)\n | 105.6(40.9)\n | 109.4(43.0)\n | 106.5(41.4)\n | 101.5(38.6)\n | 91.6(33.1)\n | 78.7(25.9)\n | 65.6(18.7)\n | 110.1(43.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 57.6(14.2)\n | 66.1(18.9)\n | 73.1(22.8)\n | 83.5(28.6)\n | 95.3(35.2)\n | 100.3(37.9)\n | 98.0(36.7)\n | 90.7(32.6)\n | 78.1(25.6)\n | 63.9(17.7)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 42.1(5.6)\n | 45.6(7.6)\n | 52.4(11.3)\n | 58.4(14.7)\n | 68.0(20.0)\n | 78.8(26.0)\n | 84.9(29.4)\n | 83.3(28.5)\n | 76.0(24.4)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 40.9(4.9)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 30.4(−0.9)\n | 33.6(0.9)\n | 38.7(3.7)\n | 43.8(6.6)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 62.2(16.8)\n | 69.5(20.8)\n | 68.7(20.4)\n | 61.3(16.3)\n | 48.8(9.3)\n | 37.3(2.9)\n | 29.3(−1.5)\n | 48.0(8.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 14.9(−9.5)\n | 18.9(−7.3)\n | 24.9(−3.9)\n | 29.1(−1.6)\n | 37.1(2.8)\n | 46.6(8.1)\n | 59.8(15.4)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 47.8(8.8)\n | 31.4(−0.3)\n | 19.7(−6.8)\n | 13.5(−10.3)\n | 10.7(−11.8)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −15(−26)\n | 0(−18)\n | 10(−12)\n | 21(−6)\n | 22(−6)\n | 35(2)\n | 41(5)\n | 37(3)\n | 33(1)\n | 13(−11)\n | 0(−18)\n | −5(−21)\n | −15(−26)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 1.99(51)\n | 2.06(52)\n | 2.01(51)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 0.77(20)\n | 0.23(5.8)\n | 1.15(29)\n | 1.63(41)\n | 1.17(30)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 1.18(30)\n | 1.64(42)\n | 16.27(413)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.8(2.0)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 1.7(4.3)\n | 4.0(10)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 7.1\n | 7.9\n | 7.4\n | 5.7\n | 4.5\n | 2.0\n | 4.8\n | 6.0\n | 4.4\n | 4.8\n | 4.4\n | 6.5\n | 65.5\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 0.5\n | 0.5\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.6\n | 2.0\n |\n| Source: NOAA[22][23] |\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nArchaeologists have divided the long span of Zion's human history into three cultural periods: the Archaic, Protohistoric and Historic periods. Each period is characterized by distinctive technological and social adaptations.\n\n\n\n### Archaic period[edit]\n\n\nThe first human presence in the region dates to 8,000 years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds.[24] About 2,000 years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle.[25] Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until c. 500.[26] Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.[26]\n\n\nBy c. 300, some of the archaic groups developed into an early branch of seminomadic Anasazi, the Basketmakers.[26] Basketmaker sites have grass- or stone-lined storage cists and shallow, partially underground dwellings called pithouses. They were hunters and gatherers who supplemented their diet with limited agriculture. Locally collected pine nuts were important for food and trade.\n\n\n\n### Protohistoric period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kaun huts were used by Southern Paiute\nBoth the Virgin Anasazi and the Parowan Fremont disappeared from the archaeological record of southwestern Utah by c. 1300.[26] Extended droughts in the 11th and 12th centuries, interspersed with catastrophic flooding, may have made horticulture impossible in this arid region.[26]\n\n\nTradition and archaeological evidence hold that their replacements were Numic-speaking cousins of the Virgin Anasazi, such as the Southern Paiute and Ute.[26] The newcomers migrated on a seasonal basis up and down valleys in search of wild seeds and game animals.[27] Some, particularly the Southern Paiute, also planted fields of corn, sunflowers, and squash to supplement their diet.[27] These more sedentary groups made brownware vessels that were used for storage and cooking.[26]\n\n\n\n### Exploration and settlement[edit]\n\n\nThe Historic period begins in the late 18th century[26] with the exploration of southern Utah by padre Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and padre Francisco Atanasio Domínguez. The padres passed near what is now the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center on October 13, 1776, becoming the first people of European descent known to visit the area.[28] In 1825, trapper and trader Jedediah Smith explored some of the downstream areas while under contract with the American Fur Company.[28]\n\n\nIn 1847, Mormon farmers from the Salt Lake area became the first people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region.[16] In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses.[29] They prospected for mineral deposits, and diverted Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area *Kolob* which in Mormon scripture is the heavenly place nearest the residence of God.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)A ranch near the mouth of Zion Canyon (c. 1910s)\nSettlements had expanded 30 miles (48 km) south to the lower Virgin River by 1858.[16] That year, a Southern Paiute guide led young Mormon missionary and interpreter Nephi Johnson into the upper Virgin River area and Zion Canyon.[28] Johnson wrote a favorable report about the agricultural potential of the upper Virgin River basin, and returned later that year to found the town of Virgin. In 1861 or 1862, Joseph Black made the arduous journey to Zion Canyon and was very impressed by its beauty.[5]\n\n\nThe floor of Zion Canyon was settled in 1863 by Isaac Behunin, who farmed corn, tobacco, and fruit trees.[5] The Behunin family lived in Zion Canyon near the site of today's Zion Lodge during the summer, and wintered in Springdale. Behunin is credited with naming Zion, a reference to the place of peace mentioned in the Bible.[5] Two more families settled Zion Canyon in the next couple of years, bringing with them cattle and other domesticated animals. The canyon floor was farmed until Zion became a Monument in 1909.[16]\n\n\nThe Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869 entered the area after their first trip through the Grand Canyon.[16] John Wesley Powell visited Zion Canyon in 1872 and named it *Mukuntuweap*, under the impression that that was the Paiute name.[31] Powell Survey photographers John K. Hillers and James Fennemore first visited the Zion Canyon and Kolob Plateau region in the spring of 1872.[16] Hillers returned in April 1873 to add more photographs to the \"Virgin River Series\" of photographs and stereographs.[32] Hillers described wading the canyon for four days and nearly freezing to death to take his photographs.[32]\n\n\n\n### Protection and tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Painting of Zion Canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh (1903)\nPaintings of the canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh were exhibited at the Saint Louis World's Fair in 1904,[16] followed by a favorable article in *Scribner's Magazine* the next year. The article and paintings, along with previously created photographs, paintings, and reports, led to President William Howard Taft's proclamation on July 31, 1909, that created Mukuntuweap National Monument.[28] In 1917, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular Mukuntuweap to Zion, a name used by the local Mormon community.[33] The United States Congress added more land and established Zion National Park on November 19, 1919.[5] A separate Zion National Monument, the Kolob Canyons area, was proclaimed on January 22, 1937, and was incorporated into the park on July 11, 1956.[34]\n\n\nTravel to the area before it was a national park was rare due to its remote location, lack of accommodations, and the absence of real roads in southern Utah. Old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about 1910, and the road into Zion Canyon was built in 1917 leading to the Grotto, short of the present road that now ends at the Temple of Sinawava.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)1938 poster of Zion National Park\nTouring cars could reach Zion Canyon by the summer of 1917.[26] The first visitor lodging in Zion Canyon, called Wylie Camp, was established that same year as a tent camp.[26] The Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, acquired Wylie Camp in 1923, and offered ten-day rail/bus tours to Zion, nearby Bryce Canyon, the Kaibab Plateau, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.[35] The Zion Lodge complex was built in 1925 at the site of the Wylie tent camp.[26] Architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed the Zion Lodge in a rustic architectural style, while the Utah Parks Company funded the construction.[26]\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure improvements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Historical buildings and structures of Zion National Park\n\nWork on the Zion Mount Carmel Highway started in 1927 to enable reliable access between Springdale and the east side of the park.[5] The road opened in 1930 and park visit and travel in the area greatly increased.[36] The most famous feature of the Zion – Mount Carmel Highway is its 1.1-mile (1.8 km) tunnel, which has six large windows cut through the massive sandstone cliff.[16]\n\n\nIn 1896, local rancher John Winder improved the Native American footpath up Echo Canyon, which later became the East Rim Trail.[37] Entrepreneur David Flanigan used this trail in 1900 to build cableworks that lowered lumber into Zion Canyon from Cable Mountain. More than 200,000 board feet (470 m3) of lumber were lowered by 1906.[37] The auto road was extended to the Temple of Sinawava, and a trail built from there 1 mile (1.6 km) to the start of the Narrows.[38] Angel's Landing Trail was constructed in 1926 and two suspension bridges were built over the Virgin River.[31] Other trails were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s.[31]\n\n\n\n### More recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Altar of Sacrifice (center) with reddish, blood-like streaks\nZion National Park has been featured in numerous films, including *The Deadwood Coach* (1924), *Arizona Bound* (1927), *Nevada* (1927), *Ramrod* (1947) and *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* (1969).[39]\n\n\nZion Canyon Scenic Drive provides access to Zion Canyon. Traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as a major problem in the 1990s and a public transportation system using propane-powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year 2000.[40] As part of its shuttle fleet, Zion has two electric trams each holding up to 36 passengers.[41] Usually from early April through late October, the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses.[40] The National Park Service has contracted the management of the shuttle bus system to transit operator RATP Dev.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Zion shuttle bus stops are marked with numbers\nOn April 12, 1995, heavy rains triggered a landslide that blocked the Virgin River in Zion Canyon.[43] Over a period of two hours, the river carved away part of the only exit road from the canyon, trapping 450 guests and employees at the Zion Lodge.[43] A one-lane, temporary road was constructed within 24 hours to allow evacuation of the Lodge.[43] A more stable albeit temporary road was completed on May 25, 1995, to allow summer visitors to access the canyon.[43] This road was replaced with a permanent road during the first half of 1996.[43]\n\n\nThe Zion–Mount Carmel Highway can be travelled year-round. Access for oversized vehicles requires a special permit, and is limited to daytime hours, as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles. The 5-mile (8.0 km)-long Kolob Canyons Road was built to provide access to the Kolob Canyons section of the park.[44] This road often closes in the winter.\n\n\nIn March 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which designated and further protected 124,406 acres (50,345 ha) of park land, about 85% of the park, as the Zion Wilderness.[45]\n\n\nIn September 2015, flooding trapped a party of seven in Keyhole Canyon, a slot canyon in the park. The flash flood killed all seven members of the group, whose remains were located after a search lasting several days.[46]\n\n\nIn 2017, some scenes from the TV series *Extinct* were shot in the park.[47]\n\n\nOn March 25, 2020, the park campgrounds were closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.[48]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area\n\n![](image)The Three Patriarchs in Zion Canyon are made of Navajo Sandstone\nThe nine known exposed geologic formations in Zion National Park are part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase. Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation in that part of North America. The formations exposed in the Zion area were deposited as sediment in very different environments:\n\n\n\n* The warm, shallow (sometimes advancing or retreating) sea of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations\n* Streams, ponds, and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations\n* The vast desert of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations\n* The dry near-shore environment of the Carmel Formation\n\n\n![](image)The Kolob Canyons are a set of finger canyons cut into the Kolob Plateau. Timber Top Mountain to right.\nUplift affected the entire region, known as the Colorado Plateaus, by slowly raising these formations more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) higher than where they were deposited.[49] This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral Virgin and other rivers on the plateau.\n\n\nThe faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.[50]\n\n\nHigh water volume in wet seasons does most of the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are responsible for transporting most of the 3 million short tons (2.7 million metric tons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly.[16] The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin.[16] The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n**Table of formations exposed in Zion National Park**[51]\n| **Rock layer** | **Appearance** | **Location** | **Deposition** | **Rock type** | **Photo** |\n| Dakota Formation | Cliffs | Top of Horse Ranch Mountain | Streams | Conglomerate and sandstone | **![Dakota Sandstone](image)** |\n| Carmel Formation | Cliffs | Mount Carmel Junction | Shallow sea and coastal desert | Limestone, sandstone and gypsum | **![Carmel Formation](image)** |\n| Temple Cap Formation | Cliffs | Top of The West Temple | Desert | Sandstone | **![Temple Cap Formation atop Navajo Sandstone](image)** |\n| Navajo Sandstone | Steep cliffs 1,600 to 2,200 ft (490 to 670 m) thick; red lower layers are colored by iron oxides | Tall cliffs of Zion Canyon; highest exposure is West Temple; cross-bedding shows well at Checkerboard Mesa (photo) | Sand dunes covered 150,000 sq mi (390,000 km2); shifting winds during deposition created cross-bedding | Sandstone | **![Navajo Sandstone](image)** |\n| Kayenta Formation | Rocky slopes | Throughout canyon | Streams | Siltstone and sandstone | **![Kayenta Formation](image)** |\n| Moenave Formation | Slopes and ledges | Lower red cliffs seen from Zion Human History Museum | Streams and ponds | Siltstone and sandstone | **![Moenave Formation](image)** |\n| Chinle Formation | Purplish slopes | Above Rockville | Streams | Shale, loose clay and conglomerate | **![Chinle Formation](image)** |\n| Moenkopi Formation | Chocolate cliffs with white bands | Rocky slopes from Virgin to Rockville | Shallow sea | Shale, siltstone, sandstone, mudstone, and limestone | **![Moenkopi Formation](image)** |\n| Kaibab Limestone | Cliffs | Hurricane Cliffs along I-15 near Kolob Canyons | Shallow sea | Limestone | **![Hurricane Cliffs/Kaibab Limestone](image)** |\n\n\n## Biology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Taylor Creek with Horse Ranch Mountain in background. Desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest habitats are all visible.\nThe Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau converge at Zion and the Kolob canyons.[52] This, along with the varied topography of canyon–mesa country, differing soil types, and uneven water availability, provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix of plants and animals that live in the area. The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species.[53] These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.[54]\n\n\nDesert conditions persist on canyon bottoms and rocky ledges away from perennial streams. Sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian paintbrush, are common.[55] Utah penstemon and golden aster can also be found.[56] Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.[54]\n\n\nCommon daytime animals include mule deer, rock squirrels, pinyon jays, and whiptail and collared lizards. Desert cottontails,[57] jackrabbits, and Merriam's kangaroo rats come out at night. Cougars, bobcats, coyotes, badgers, gray foxes, and ring-tail cats are the top predators.[57]\n\n\nCooler conditions persist at mid-elevation slopes, from 3,900 to 5,500 feet (1,200 to 1,700 m).[54] Stunted forests of pinyon pine and juniper coexist here with manzanita shrubs, cliffrose, serviceberry, scrub oak, and yucca.[54] Stands of ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, manzanita and aspen populate the mesas and cliffs above 6,000 feet (1,800 m).[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)Desert bighorn sheep are often visible near the roadway in the park.\nGolden eagles, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons, and white-throated swifts can be seen in the area.[58] Desert bighorn sheep were reintroduced in the park in 1973.[59] California condors were reintroduced in the Arizona Strip and in 2014 the first successful breeding of condors in the park was confirmed.[60][61] Nineteen species of bat also live in the area.[62]\n\n\nBoxelder, Fremont cottonwood, maple, and willow dominate riparian plant communities.[54] Animals such as bank beavers, flannel-mouth suckers, gnatcatchers, dippers, canyon wrens, the virgin spinedace, and water striders all make their homes in the riparian zones.[63]\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\nRangers at the visitor centers in Zion Canyon and Kolob Canyons can help visitors plan their stay. Guided horseback riding trips, nature walks, and evening programs are available from late March to early November.[64] The Junior Ranger Program for children ages 4 and up is active year-round at the Nature Center, Human History Museum, and the visitor centers.[65] A bookstore attached to the Zion Canyon visitor center offers books, maps, and souvenirs.[66] The Grotto in Zion Canyon, the visitor center, and the viewpoint at the end of Kolob Canyons Road have the only designated picnic sites.[14]\n\n\n\nTrails\n![](image)The Subway, a slot canyon within the Kolob Terrace section\nSeven trails with round-trip times of half an hour (Weeping Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon.[67] Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours round trip) and Kolob Arch (8 hours round trip), are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, near Cedar City.[67] Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer, but hiking beyond Big Springs requires a permit. The entire Narrows from Chamberlain's Ranch is a 16-mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking.[68] A shorter alternative is to enter the Narrows via Orderville Canyon. Both Orderville and the full Narrows require a back country permit. Entrance to the Parunuweap Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited. Other often-used backcountry trails include the West Rim and LaVerkin Creek.[69] The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.[14] A network of trails totaling 50 miles in distance connect Zion's northwest corner of the park (Lee Pass Trailhead) to its southeast section (East Rim Trailhead). Popularly known as the Zion Traverse, the route offers backpackers a diverse experience of the park.\n\n\nZion is a center for rock climbing, with short walls like Spaceshot, Moonlight Buttress, Prodigal Son, Ashtar Command, and Touchstone being the most popular, highly rated routes.[70][71]\n\n\n\nCamping and lodging\n![](image)Zion Lodge accommodations\nLodging in the park is available at Zion Lodge, located halfway through Zion Canyon. Just outside the park more lodging is available in Springdale.[72]\n\n\nZion has three campgrounds: South and Watchman at the far southern side of the park, and a primitive site at Lava Point in the middle of the park off Kolob Terrace Road.[73] Overnight camping in the backcountry requires permits.[74]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of national parks of the United States\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Zion National Park\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Iron County, Kane County and Washington County, Utah\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Listing of acreage – December 31, 2012\" (XLSX).

Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River.\n\n\nHuman habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Ancestral Puebloans (who used to be called Anasazi by early non-indigenous archeologists[4])(c. 300 CE). Subsequently, what has been called the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities.[5] Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. \n\n\n\n\n## Name change[edit]\n\n\nIn 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area **Mukuntuweap National Monument** in order to protect the canyon.[6] In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to **Zion National Monument**, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.[6] According to historian Hal Rothman: \"The name change played to a prevalent bias of the time. Many believed that Spanish and Indian names would deter visitors who, if they could not pronounce the name of a place, might not bother to visit it.[7] The new name, Zion, had greater appeal to an ethnocentric audience.\"[8] On November 19, 1919, Congress redesignated the monument as **Zion National Park**, and the act was signed by President Woodrow Wilson.[9] The Kolob section was proclaimed a separate Zion National Monument in 1937, but was incorporated into the national park in 1956.[10] Congress designated 85% of the park a wilderness area in 2009.\n\n\nThe geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area includes nine formations that together represent 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation. At various periods in that time warm, shallow seas, streams, ponds and lakes, vast deserts, and dry near-shore environments covered the area. Uplift associated with the creation of the Colorado Plateau lifted the region 10,000 feet (3,000 m) starting 13 million years ago.[11]\n\n\n\n## Park purpose[edit]\n\n\nAs stated in the foundation document:[12]\n\n\n\n\n> The purpose of Zion National Park is to preserve the dramatic geology including Zion Canyon and a labyrinth of deep and brilliantly colored Navajo sandstone canyons formed by extraordinary processes of erosion at the margin of the Colorado Plateau; to safeguard the park's wilderness character and its wild and scenic river values; to protect evidence of human history; and to provide for scientific research and the enjoyment and enlightenment of the public.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nThe park is located in southwestern Utah in Washington, Iron and Kane counties. Geomorphically, it is located on the Markagunt and Kolob plateaus, at the intersection of three North American geographic provinces: the Colorado Plateau, the Great Basin, and the Mojave Desert. The northern part of the park is known as the **Kolob Canyons** section and is accessible from Interstate 15, exit 40.[13]\n\n\nThe 8,726-foot (2,660 m) summit of Horse Ranch Mountain is the highest point in the park; the lowest point is the 3,666-foot (1,117 m) elevation of Coal Pits Wash, creating a relief of about 5,100 feet (1,600 m).[14]\n\n\nStreams in the area take rectangular paths because they follow jointing planes in the rocks.[15] The stream gradient of the Virgin River, whose North Fork flows through Zion Canyon in the park, ranges from 50 to 80 feet per mile (9.5 to 15.2 m/km) (0.9–1.5%)—one of the steepest stream gradients in North America.[16]\n\n\n\n![](image)Towers of the Virgin: The Sundial (left), The Witch Head, Broken Tooth, Rotten Tooth, Altar of Sacrifice\nThe road into Zion Canyon is 6 miles (9.7 km) long, ending at the Temple of Sinawava, which is named for the coyote god of the Paiute Indians.[17] The canyon becomes more narrow near the Temple and a hiking trail continues to the mouth of The Narrows, a gorge only 20 feet (6 m) wide and up to 2,000 feet (610 m) tall.[18] The Zion Canyon road is served by a free shuttle bus from early April to late October and by private vehicles the other months of the year. Other roads in Zion are open to private vehicles year-round.\n\n\nThe east side of the park is served by Zion-Mount Carmel Highway (SR-9), which passes through the Zion–Mount Carmel Tunnel and ends at US 89 at Mount Carmel Junction. Park features on the east side of the park include Checkerboard Mesa and The East Temple.\n\n\nThe Kolob Terrace area, northwest of Zion Canyon, features a slot canyon called The Subway, and a panoramic view of the entire area from Lava Point. The Kolob Canyons section, further to the northwest near Cedar City, features Tucupit Point and one of the world's longest natural arches, Kolob Arch.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Court of the Patriarchs, by Ansel Adams (1933)\nOther notable geographic features of Zion Canyon include Angels Landing, The Great White Throne, the Court of the Patriarchs, The Sentinel, The West Temple, Towers of the Virgin, the Altar of Sacrifice, The Watchman, Weeping Rock, and the Emerald Pools.[20]\n\n\nSpring weather is unpredictable, with stormy, wet days being common, mixed with occasional warm, sunny weather. Precipitation is normally heaviest in March.[21] Spring wildflowers bloom from April through June, peaking in May. Fall days are usually clear and mild; nights are often cool. Summer days are hot (95 to 110 °F; 35 to 43 °C), but overnight lows are usually comfortable (65 to 70 °F; 18 to 21 °C).[21] Afternoon thunderstorms are common from mid-July through mid-September.[21] Storms may produce waterfalls as well as flash floods. Autumn tree-color displays begin in September in the high country; in Zion Canyon, autumn colors usually peak in late October. Winter in Zion Canyon is fairly mild. Winter storms bring rain or light snow to Zion Canyon and heavier snow to the higher elevations. Clear days may become quite warm, reaching 60 °F (16 °C); nights are often 20 to 40 °F (−7 to 4 °C).[21] Winter storms can last several days and make roads icy. Zion roads are plowed, except the Kolob Terrace Road which is closed when covered with snow.[21] Winter driving conditions last from November through March.[21]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nZion National Park has a *BSk* (Köppen climate classification) cold semi-arid climate consisting of very hot summers and mild winters with a limited amount of precipitation throughout the year.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Zion National Park, Utah, 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1904–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 74(23)\n | 97(36)\n | 91(33)\n | 97(36)\n | 106(41)\n | 114(46)\n | 115(46)\n | 112(44)\n | 110(43)\n | 99(37)\n | 90(32)\n | 81(27)\n | 115(46)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 66.3(19.1)\n | 70.3(21.3)\n | 79.8(26.6)\n | 87.8(31.0)\n | 97.0(36.1)\n | 105.6(40.9)\n | 109.4(43.0)\n | 106.5(41.4)\n | 101.5(38.6)\n | 91.6(33.1)\n | 78.7(25.9)\n | 65.6(18.7)\n | 110.1(43.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 57.6(14.2)\n | 66.1(18.9)\n | 73.1(22.8)\n | 83.5(28.6)\n | 95.3(35.2)\n | 100.3(37.9)\n | 98.0(36.7)\n | 90.7(32.6)\n | 78.1(25.6)\n | 63.9(17.7)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 42.1(5.6)\n | 45.6(7.6)\n | 52.4(11.3)\n | 58.4(14.7)\n | 68.0(20.0)\n | 78.8(26.0)\n | 84.9(29.4)\n | 83.3(28.5)\n | 76.0(24.4)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 40.9(4.9)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 30.4(−0.9)\n | 33.6(0.9)\n | 38.7(3.7)\n | 43.8(6.6)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 62.2(16.8)\n | 69.5(20.8)\n | 68.7(20.4)\n | 61.3(16.3)\n | 48.8(9.3)\n | 37.3(2.9)\n | 29.3(−1.5)\n | 48.0(8.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 14.9(−9.5)\n | 18.9(−7.3)\n | 24.9(−3.9)\n | 29.1(−1.6)\n | 37.1(2.8)\n | 46.6(8.1)\n | 59.8(15.4)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 47.8(8.8)\n | 31.4(−0.3)\n | 19.7(−6.8)\n | 13.5(−10.3)\n | 10.7(−11.8)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −15(−26)\n | 0(−18)\n | 10(−12)\n | 21(−6)\n | 22(−6)\n | 35(2)\n | 41(5)\n | 37(3)\n | 33(1)\n | 13(−11)\n | 0(−18)\n | −5(−21)\n | −15(−26)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 1.99(51)\n | 2.06(52)\n | 2.01(51)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 0.77(20)\n | 0.23(5.8)\n | 1.15(29)\n | 1.63(41)\n | 1.17(30)\n | 1.22(31)\n | 1.18(30)\n | 1.64(42)\n | 16.27(413)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.8(2.0)\n | 0.7(1.8)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 1.7(4.3)\n | 4.0(10)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 7.1\n | 7.9\n | 7.4\n | 5.7\n | 4.5\n | 2.0\n | 4.8\n | 6.0\n | 4.4\n | 4.8\n | 4.4\n | 6.5\n | 65.5\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 0.5\n | 0.5\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 0.6\n | 2.0\n |\n| Source: NOAA[22][23] |\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nArchaeologists have divided the long span of Zion's human history into three cultural periods: the Archaic, Protohistoric and Historic periods. Each period is characterized by distinctive technological and social adaptations.\n\n\n\n### Archaic period[edit]\n\n\nThe first human presence in the region dates to 8,000 years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds.[24] About 2,000 years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle.[25] Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until c. 500.[26] Baskets, cordage nets, and yucca fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.[26]\n\n\nBy c. 300, some of the archaic groups developed into an early branch of seminomadic Anasazi, the Basketmakers.[26] Basketmaker sites have grass- or stone-lined storage cists and shallow, partially underground dwellings called pithouses. They were hunters and gatherers who supplemented their diet with limited agriculture. Locally collected pine nuts were important for food and trade.\n\n\n\n### Protohistoric period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kaun huts were used by Southern Paiute\nBoth the Virgin Anasazi and the Parowan Fremont disappeared from the archaeological record of southwestern Utah by c. 1300.[26] Extended droughts in the 11th and 12th centuries, interspersed with catastrophic flooding, may have made horticulture impossible in this arid region.[26]\n\n\nTradition and archaeological evidence hold that their replacements were Numic-speaking cousins of the Virgin Anasazi, such as the Southern Paiute and Ute.[26] The newcomers migrated on a seasonal basis up and down valleys in search of wild seeds and game animals.[27] Some, particularly the Southern Paiute, also planted fields of corn, sunflowers, and squash to supplement their diet.[27] These more sedentary groups made brownware vessels that were used for storage and cooking.[26]\n\n\n\n### Exploration and settlement[edit]\n\n\nThe Historic period begins in the late 18th century[26] with the exploration of southern Utah by padre Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and padre Francisco Atanasio Domínguez. The padres passed near what is now the Kolob Canyons Visitor Center on October 13, 1776, becoming the first people of European descent known to visit the area.[28] In 1825, trapper and trader Jedediah Smith explored some of the downstream areas while under contract with the American Fur Company.[28]\n\n\nIn 1847, Mormon farmers from the Salt Lake area became the first people of European descent to settle the Virgin River region.[16] In 1851, the Parowan and Cedar City areas were settled by Mormons who used the Kolob Canyons area for timber, and for grazing cattle, sheep, and horses.[29] They prospected for mineral deposits, and diverted Kolob water to irrigate crops in the valley below. Mormon settlers named the area *Kolob* which in Mormon scripture is the heavenly place nearest the residence of God.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)A ranch near the mouth of Zion Canyon (c. 1910s)\nSettlements had expanded 30 miles (48 km) south to the lower Virgin River by 1858.[16] That year, a Southern Paiute guide led young Mormon missionary and interpreter Nephi Johnson into the upper Virgin River area and Zion Canyon.[28] Johnson wrote a favorable report about the agricultural potential of the upper Virgin River basin, and returned later that year to found the town of Virgin. In 1861 or 1862, Joseph Black made the arduous journey to Zion Canyon and was very impressed by its beauty.[5]\n\n\nThe floor of Zion Canyon was settled in 1863 by Isaac Behunin, who farmed corn, tobacco, and fruit trees.[5] The Behunin family lived in Zion Canyon near the site of today's Zion Lodge during the summer, and wintered in Springdale. Behunin is credited with naming Zion, a reference to the place of peace mentioned in the Bible.[5] Two more families settled Zion Canyon in the next couple of years, bringing with them cattle and other domesticated animals. The canyon floor was farmed until Zion became a Monument in 1909.[16]\n\n\nThe Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869 entered the area after their first trip through the Grand Canyon.[16] John Wesley Powell visited Zion Canyon in 1872 and named it *Mukuntuweap*, under the impression that that was the Paiute name.[31] Powell Survey photographers John K. Hillers and James Fennemore first visited the Zion Canyon and Kolob Plateau region in the spring of 1872.[16] Hillers returned in April 1873 to add more photographs to the \"Virgin River Series\" of photographs and stereographs.[32] Hillers described wading the canyon for four days and nearly freezing to death to take his photographs.[32]\n\n\n\n### Protection and tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Painting of Zion Canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh (1903)\nPaintings of the canyon by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh were exhibited at the Saint Louis World's Fair in 1904,[16] followed by a favorable article in *Scribner's Magazine* the next year. The article and paintings, along with previously created photographs, paintings, and reports, led to President William Howard Taft's proclamation on July 31, 1909, that created Mukuntuweap National Monument.[28] In 1917, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular Mukuntuweap to Zion, a name used by the local Mormon community.[33] The United States Congress added more land and established Zion National Park on November 19, 1919.[5] A separate Zion National Monument, the Kolob Canyons area, was proclaimed on January 22, 1937, and was incorporated into the park on July 11, 1956.[34]\n\n\nTravel to the area before it was a national park was rare due to its remote location, lack of accommodations, and the absence of real roads in southern Utah. Old wagon roads were upgraded to the first automobile roads starting about 1910, and the road into Zion Canyon was built in 1917 leading to the Grotto, short of the present road that now ends at the Temple of Sinawava.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)1938 poster of Zion National Park\nTouring cars could reach Zion Canyon by the summer of 1917.[26] The first visitor lodging in Zion Canyon, called Wylie Camp, was established that same year as a tent camp.[26] The Utah Parks Company, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad, acquired Wylie Camp in 1923, and offered ten-day rail/bus tours to Zion, nearby Bryce Canyon, the Kaibab Plateau, and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.[35] The Zion Lodge complex was built in 1925 at the site of the Wylie tent camp.[26] Architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood designed the Zion Lodge in a rustic architectural style, while the Utah Parks Company funded the construction.[26]\n\n\n\n### Infrastructure improvements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Historical buildings and structures of Zion National Park\n\nWork on the Zion Mount Carmel Highway started in 1927 to enable reliable access between Springdale and the east side of the park.[5] The road opened in 1930 and park visit and travel in the area greatly increased.[36] The most famous feature of the Zion – Mount Carmel Highway is its 1.1-mile (1.8 km) tunnel, which has six large windows cut through the massive sandstone cliff.[16]\n\n\nIn 1896, local rancher John Winder improved the Native American footpath up Echo Canyon, which later became the East Rim Trail.[37] Entrepreneur David Flanigan used this trail in 1900 to build cableworks that lowered lumber into Zion Canyon from Cable Mountain. More than 200,000 board feet (470 m3) of lumber were lowered by 1906.[37] The auto road was extended to the Temple of Sinawava, and a trail built from there 1 mile (1.6 km) to the start of the Narrows.[38] Angel's Landing Trail was constructed in 1926 and two suspension bridges were built over the Virgin River.[31] Other trails were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the 1930s.[31]\n\n\n\n### More recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Altar of Sacrifice (center) with reddish, blood-like streaks\nZion National Park has been featured in numerous films, including *The Deadwood Coach* (1924), *Arizona Bound* (1927), *Nevada* (1927), *Ramrod* (1947) and *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* (1969).[39]\n\n\nZion Canyon Scenic Drive provides access to Zion Canyon. Traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as a major problem in the 1990s and a public transportation system using propane-powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year 2000.[40] As part of its shuttle fleet, Zion has two electric trams each holding up to 36 passengers.[41] Usually from early April through late October, the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses.[40] The National Park Service has contracted the management of the shuttle bus system to transit operator RATP Dev.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Zion shuttle bus stops are marked with numbers\nOn April 12, 1995, heavy rains triggered a landslide that blocked the Virgin River in Zion Canyon.[43] Over a period of two hours, the river carved away part of the only exit road from the canyon, trapping 450 guests and employees at the Zion Lodge.[43] A one-lane, temporary road was constructed within 24 hours to allow evacuation of the Lodge.[43] A more stable albeit temporary road was completed on May 25, 1995, to allow summer visitors to access the canyon.[43] This road was replaced with a permanent road during the first half of 1996.[43]\n\n\nThe Zion–Mount Carmel Highway can be travelled year-round. Access for oversized vehicles requires a special permit, and is limited to daytime hours, as traffic through the tunnel must be one way to accommodate large vehicles. The 5-mile (8.0 km)-long Kolob Canyons Road was built to provide access to the Kolob Canyons section of the park.[44] This road often closes in the winter.\n\n\nIn March 2009, President Barack Obama signed into law the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which designated and further protected 124,406 acres (50,345 ha) of park land, about 85% of the park, as the Zion Wilderness.[45]\n\n\nIn September 2015, flooding trapped a party of seven in Keyhole Canyon, a slot canyon in the park. The flash flood killed all seven members of the group, whose remains were located after a search lasting several days.[46]\n\n\nIn 2017, some scenes from the TV series *Extinct* were shot in the park.[47]\n\n\nOn March 25, 2020, the park campgrounds were closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.[48]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area\n\n![](image)The Three Patriarchs in Zion Canyon are made of Navajo Sandstone\nThe nine known exposed geologic formations in Zion National Park are part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase. Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation in that part of North America. The formations exposed in the Zion area were deposited as sediment in very different environments:\n\n\n\n* The warm, shallow (sometimes advancing or retreating) sea of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations\n* Streams, ponds, and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations\n* The vast desert of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations\n* The dry near-shore environment of the Carmel Formation\n\n\n![](image)The Kolob Canyons are a set of finger canyons cut into the Kolob Plateau. Timber Top Mountain to right.\nUplift affected the entire region, known as the Colorado Plateaus, by slowly raising these formations more than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) higher than where they were deposited.[49] This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral Virgin and other rivers on the plateau.\n\n\nThe faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks. Eventually, all Cenozoic-aged formations were removed and gorges were cut into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. During the later part of this process, lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area.[50]\n\n\nHigh water volume in wet seasons does most of the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are responsible for transporting most of the 3 million short tons (2.7 million metric tons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly.[16] The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin.[16] The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n**Table of formations exposed in Zion National Park**[51]\n| **Rock layer** | **Appearance** | **Location** | **Deposition** | **Rock type** | **Photo** |\n| Dakota Formation | Cliffs | Top of Horse Ranch Mountain | Streams | Conglomerate and sandstone | **![Dakota Sandstone](image)** |\n| Carmel Formation | Cliffs | Mount Carmel Junction | Shallow sea and coastal desert | Limestone, sandstone and gypsum | **![Carmel Formation](image)** |\n| Temple Cap Formation | Cliffs | Top of The West Temple | Desert | Sandstone | **![Temple Cap Formation atop Navajo Sandstone](image)** |\n| Navajo Sandstone | Steep cliffs 1,600 to 2,200 ft (490 to 670 m) thick; red lower layers are colored by iron oxides | Tall cliffs of Zion Canyon; highest exposure is West Temple; cross-bedding shows well at Checkerboard Mesa (photo) | Sand dunes covered 150,000 sq mi (390,000 km2); shifting winds during deposition created cross-bedding | Sandstone | **![Navajo Sandstone](image)** |\n| Kayenta Formation | Rocky slopes | Throughout canyon | Streams | Siltstone and sandstone | **![Kayenta Formation](image)** |\n| Moenave Formation | Slopes and ledges | Lower red cliffs seen from Zion Human History Museum | Streams and ponds | Siltstone and sandstone | **![Moenave Formation](image)** |\n| Chinle Formation | Purplish slopes | Above Rockville | Streams | Shale, loose clay and conglomerate | **![Chinle Formation](image)** |\n| Moenkopi Formation | Chocolate cliffs with white bands | Rocky slopes from Virgin to Rockville | Shallow sea | Shale, siltstone, sandstone, mudstone, and limestone | **![Moenkopi Formation](image)** |\n| Kaibab Limestone | Cliffs | Hurricane Cliffs along I-15 near Kolob Canyons | Shallow sea | Limestone | **![Hurricane Cliffs/Kaibab Limestone](image)** |\n\n\n## Biology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Taylor Creek with Horse Ranch Mountain in background. Desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest habitats are all visible.\nThe Great Basin, Mojave Desert, and Colorado Plateau converge at Zion and the Kolob canyons.[52] This, along with the varied topography of canyon–mesa country, differing soil types, and uneven water availability, provides diverse habitat for the equally diverse mix of plants and animals that live in the area. The park is home to 289 bird, 79 mammals, 28 reptiles, 7 fish, and 6 amphibian species.[53] These organisms make their homes in one or more of four life zones found in the park: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest.[54]\n\n\nDesert conditions persist on canyon bottoms and rocky ledges away from perennial streams. Sagebrush, prickly pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian paintbrush, are common.[55] Utah penstemon and golden aster can also be found.[56] Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.[54]\n\n\nCommon daytime animals include mule deer, rock squirrels, pinyon jays, and whiptail and collared lizards. Desert cottontails,[57] jackrabbits, and Merriam's kangaroo rats come out at night. Cougars, bobcats, coyotes, badgers, gray foxes, and ring-tail cats are the top predators.[57]\n\n\nCooler conditions persist at mid-elevation slopes, from 3,900 to 5,500 feet (1,200 to 1,700 m).[54] Stunted forests of pinyon pine and juniper coexist here with manzanita shrubs, cliffrose, serviceberry, scrub oak, and yucca.[54] Stands of ponderosa pine, Gambel oak, manzanita and aspen populate the mesas and cliffs above 6,000 feet (1,800 m).[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)Desert bighorn sheep are often visible near the roadway in the park.\nGolden eagles, red-tailed hawks, peregrine falcons, and white-throated swifts can be seen in the area.[58] Desert bighorn sheep were reintroduced in the park in 1973.[59] California condors were reintroduced in the Arizona Strip and in 2014 the first successful breeding of condors in the park was confirmed.[60][61] Nineteen species of bat also live in the area.[62]\n\n\nBoxelder, Fremont cottonwood, maple, and willow dominate riparian plant communities.[54] Animals such as bank beavers, flannel-mouth suckers, gnatcatchers, dippers, canyon wrens, the virgin spinedace, and water striders all make their homes in the riparian zones.[63]\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\nRangers at the visitor centers in Zion Canyon and Kolob Canyons can help visitors plan their stay. Guided horseback riding trips, nature walks, and evening programs are available from late March to early November.[64] The Junior Ranger Program for children ages 4 and up is active year-round at the Nature Center, Human History Museum, and the visitor centers.[65] A bookstore attached to the Zion Canyon visitor center offers books, maps, and souvenirs.[66] The Grotto in Zion Canyon, the visitor center, and the viewpoint at the end of Kolob Canyons Road have the only designated picnic sites.[14]\n\n\n\nTrails\n![](image)The Subway, a slot canyon within the Kolob Terrace section\nSeven trails with round-trip times of half an hour (Weeping Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon.[67] Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours round trip) and Kolob Arch (8 hours round trip), are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, near Cedar City.[67] Hiking up into The Narrows from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer, but hiking beyond Big Springs requires a permit. The entire Narrows from Chamberlain's Ranch is a 16-mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking.[68] A shorter alternative is to enter the Narrows via Orderville Canyon. Both Orderville and the full Narrows require a back country permit. Entrance to the Parunuweap Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited. Other often-used backcountry trails include the West Rim and LaVerkin Creek.[69] The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.[14] A network of trails totaling 50 miles in distance connect Zion's northwest corner of the park (Lee Pass Trailhead) to its southeast section (East Rim Trailhead). Popularly known as the Zion Traverse, the route offers backpackers a diverse experience of the park.\n\n\nZion is a center for rock climbing, with short walls like Spaceshot, Moonlight Buttress, Prodigal Son, Ashtar Command, and Touchstone being the most popular, highly rated routes.[70][71]\n\n\n\nCamping and lodging\n![](image)Zion Lodge accommodations\nLodging in the park is available at Zion Lodge, located halfway through Zion Canyon. Just outside the park more lodging is available in Springdale.[72]\n\n\nZion has three campgrounds: South and Watchman at the far southern side of the park, and a primitive site at Lava Point in the middle of the park off Kolob Terrace Road.[73] Overnight camping in the backcountry requires permits.[74]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of national parks of the United States\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Zion National Park\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Iron County, Kane County and Washington County, Utah\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Listing of acreage – December 31, 2012\" (XLSX).
