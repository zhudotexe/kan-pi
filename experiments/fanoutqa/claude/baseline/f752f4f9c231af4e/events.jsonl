It is one of the most historically significant cities in the United States and served as the nation's capital until 1800.[13] Philadelphia is the nation's sixth-most populous city with a population of 1,603,797 as of the 2020 census. Since 1854, the city has been coextensive with Philadelphia County, the most populous county in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia serves as the urban core of the larger Delaware Valley (or Philadelphia metropolitan area), the nation's seventh-largest and one of the world's largest metropolitan regions consisting of 6.245 million residents in the metropolitan statistical area and 7.366 million residents in its combined statistical area.[14] Philadelphia is known for its extensive contributions to American history, especially the American Revolution, and for its contemporary influence in business and industry, culture, sports, and music.[15][16]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was founded in 1682 by William Penn, an English Quaker and advocate of religious freedom. The city served as the capital of the Pennsylvania Colony during the British colonial era[5][17] and went on to play a historic and vital role as the central meeting place for the nation's founding fathers whose plans and actions in Philadelphia ultimately inspired the American Revolution and the nation's independence following the Revolutionary War. Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774, preserved the Liberty Bell, and hosted the Second Continental Congress during which the founders signed the Declaration of Independence, which historian Joseph Ellis has described as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history\".[18] Once the Revolutionary War commenced, the Battle of Germantown and the siege of Fort Mifflin were fought within Philadelphia's city limits. The U.S. Constitution was later ratified in Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until 1790, when it was surpassed by New York City, and it served as the nation's first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions during and following the American Revolution, including from 1790 to 1800 during the construction of the new national capital of Washington, D.C.\n\n\nWith 18 four-year universities and colleges, Philadelphia is one of the nation's leading centers for higher education and academic research.[19][20] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area was the state's largest and nation's ninth-largest metropolitan economy with a gross metropolitan product of US$444.1 billion. The city is home to five Fortune 500 corporate headquarters as of 2022.[21] As of 2023, metropolitan Philadelphia ranks among the top five U.S. venture capital centers, facilitated by its proximity to New York City's entrepreneurial and financial ecosystems.[22] The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, owned by Nasdaq since 2008, is the nation's oldest stock exchange and a global leader in options trading.[23] 30th Street Station, the city's primary rail station, is the third-busiest Amtrak hub in the nation, and the city's multimodal transport and logistics infrastructure, includes Philadelphia International Airport, and the rapidly-growing PhilaPort seaport.[24] A migration pattern has been established from New York City to Philadelphia by residents opting for a large city with relative proximity and a lower cost of living.[25][26]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a national cultural center, hosting more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other city in the nation.[27][28] Fairmount Park, when combined with adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the same watershed, is 2,052 acres (830 ha), representing one of the nation's largest and the world's 45th-largest urban park.[29] The city is known for its arts, culture, cuisine, and colonial and Revolution-era history; in 2016, it attracted 42 million domestic tourists who spent $6.8 billion, representing $11 billion in economic impact to the city and its surrounding Pennsylvania counties.[30]\n\n\nWith five professional sports teams and one of the nation's most loyal fan bases, Philadelphia is often ranked as the nation's best city for professional sports fans.[31][32][33][34] The city has a culturally and philanthropically active LGBTQ+ community. Philadelphia also has played an immensely influential historic and ongoing role in the development and evolution of American music, especially R&B, soul, and rock.[35][36]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a city of many firsts, including the nation's first library (1731),[37] hospital (1751),[37] medical school (1765),[38] national capital (1774),[39] university (by some accounts) (1779),[40] stock exchange (1790),[37] zoo (1874),[41] and business school (1881).[42] Philadelphia contains 67 National Historic Landmarks, including Independence Hall.[43][44][20] From the city's 17th century founding through the present, Philadelphia has been the birthplace or home to an extensive number of prominent and influential Americans. In 2021, *Time* magazine named Philadelphia one of the world's greatest 100 places.[45]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Philadelphia\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Philadelphia.\n\nSee also: List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia and National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n\n### Native peoples[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 17th century, the Philadelphia area was home to the Lenape (Delaware) Indians in the village of Shackamaxon. They were also called the Delaware Indians,[46] and their historical territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley.[a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts.[46] Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and conflict with Europeans. The Iroquois occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and the United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory to present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territories under the Indian removal policy.\n\n\n\n### Colonial[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Penn (holding paper) and King Charles II depicted in *The Birth of Pennsylvania*, an 1680 portrait by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris\n![A Portraiture of the City of Philadelphia, by Thomas Holme](image)A 1683 portrait of Philadelphia by Thomas Holme that is believed to be the city's first map\n![](image)William Penn's 1682 Treaty of Shackamaxon with the Lenape tribe depicted in *Penn's Treaty with the Indians*, a 1772 portrait by Benjamin West\nEuropeans came to the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century. The first settlements were founded by Dutch colonists, who built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River in 1623 in what is now Brooklawn, New Jersey. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New Netherland colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina, located in present-day Wilmington, Delaware, and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks in their war against Maryland colonists.[47] In 1648, the Dutch built Fort Beversreede on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill River near the present-day Eastwick section of Philadelphia, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building Fort Nya Korsholm, or New Korsholm, named after a town in Finland with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. An English fleet captured the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682, when the area was included in William Penn's charter for Pennsylvania.[48]\n\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape in an effort to establish good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for the colony.[49] Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown neighborhood.[5] Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for \"brotherly love\", derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος *phílos* (beloved, dear) and ἀδελφός *adelphós* (brother, brotherly). There were a number of cities named *Philadelphia* in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Greek and Roman periods, including modern Alaşehir, mentioned as the site of an early Christian congregation in the Book of Revelation. As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, which exceeded that of other colonies, led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city.[50]\n\n\nPenn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart with areas for gardens and orchards.\n\n\nThe city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, and instead crowded the present-day Port of Philadelphia on the Delaware River and subdivided and resold their lots.[51] Before Penn left Philadelphia for the final time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. Though poor at first, Philadelphia became an important trading center with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. Benjamin Franklin, a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones that were among the first in the nation, including a fire company, library, and hospital.\n\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life, including the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the Academy of Natural Sciences (1812), and the Franklin Institute (1824).[52] These societies developed and financed new industries that attracted skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n\n\n### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution and Philadelphia campaign\n\n![](image)The Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration of Independence in Independence Hall on June 28, 1776, depicted in an 1818 painting by John Trumbull; historian Joseph Ellis called the Declaration \"the most potent and consequential words in American history.\"[53]\n![](image)President's House on Market Street served as the presidential mansion for the nation's first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams, from 1790 to 1800 prior to the completion of the White House and the development of Washington, D.C. as the nation's new capital\n![](image)Independence Hall on Chestnut Street between 5th and 6th Streets, where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Constitution was ratified, on July 4, 1776, and June 21, 1788, respectively\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America's revolutionaries. By the 1750s, Philadelphia surpassed Boston as the largest city and busiest port in British America, and the second-largest city in the entire British Empire after London.[54][55] In 1774, as resentment of British colonial practices and support for independence was burgeoning in the colonies, Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress.\n\n\nFrom 1775 to 1781, Philadelphia hosted the Second Continental Congress,[56] which adopted the Declaration of Independence in what was then called the Pennsylvania State House and was later renamed Independence Hall. Historian Joseph Ellis, in 2007, described the Declaration of Independence, written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson, as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history,\"[18] and its adoption represented a declaration of war against the British Army, which was then the world's most powerful military force. Since the Declaration's July 4, 1776, adoption, its signing has been cited globally and repeatedly by various peoples of the world seeking independence and liberty. It also has been, since its adoption, the basis for annual celebration by Americans; in 1938, this celebration of the Declaration was formalized as Independence Day, one of only ten designated U.S. federal holidays.\n\n\nAfter George Washington's defeat at the Battle of Brandywine in Chadds Ford Township, on September 11, 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless and the city prepared for what was perceived to be an inevitable British attack. Because bells could easily be recast into munitions, the Liberty Bell, then known as the Pennsylvania State Bell, and bells from two Philadelphia churches, Christ Church and St. Peter's Church, were hastily taken down and transported by heavily guarded wagon train out of the city. The Liberty Bell was taken to Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, which is present-day Allentown, where it was hidden under the church's floor boards for nine months from September 1777 until the British Army's departure from Philadelphia in June 1778.[57] Two Revolutionary War battles, the Siege of Fort Mifflin, fought between September 26 and November 16, 1777, and the Battle of Germantown, fought on October 4, 1777, took place within Philadelphia's city limits.\n\n\nIn Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation on November 15, 1777, and the city later served as the meeting place for the Constitutional Convention, which ratified the Constitution in Independence Hall in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787.\n\n\nPhiladelphia served as capital of the United States for much of the colonial and early post-colonial periods, including for a decade, from 1790 to 1800, while Washington, D.C., was being constructed and prepared to serve as the new national capital.[58] In 1793, the largest yellow fever epidemic in U.S. history killed approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people in Philadelphia, or about ten percent of the city's population at the time.[59][60] The capital of the United States was moved to Washington, D.C. in 1800 upon completion of the White House and U.S. Capitol buildings.\n\n\nThe state capital was moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster in 1799, then ultimately to Harrisburg in 1812 Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until the late 18th century. It also was the nation's financial and cultural center until ultimately being eclipsed in total population by New York City in 1790. In 1816, the city's free Black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent Black denomination in the country, and the first Black Episcopal Church. The free Black community also established many schools for its children with the help of Quakers. Large-scale construction projects for new roads, canals, and railroads made Philadelphia the first major industrial city in the United States.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)Loan of the City of Philadelphia, issued March 7, 1866\n![](image)Opening day ceremonies at the Centennial Exposition at Memorial Hall in Fairmount Park in 1876, the first world fair held in the U.S. on the centennial anniversary of the nation's founding\nThroughout the 19th century, Philadelphia hosted a variety of industries and businesses; the largest was the textile industry. Major corporations in the 19th and early 20th centuries included the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad.[61] Established in 1870, the Philadelphia Conveyancers' Association was chartered by the state in 1871. Along with the U.S. Centennial in 1876, the city's industry was celebrated in the Centennial Exposition, the first official World's fair in the U.S.\n\n\nImmigrants, mostly from Ireland and Germany, settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. These immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street and later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic nativist riots erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the Act of Consolidation of 1854, which extended the city limits from the 2 square miles (5.2 km2) of Center City to the roughly 134 square miles (350 km2) of Philadelphia County.[62][63]\nIn the latter half of the 19th century and leading into the 20th century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy, and African Americans from the southern U.S. settled in the city.[64]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was represented by the Washington Grays in the American Civil War. The African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559 between 1880 and 1930.[65][66] Black newcomers in the 20th century were part of the Great Migration out of the rural south and into northern and midwestern industrial cities.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chestnut Street in Center City at night in February 2016\nBy the 20th century, Philadelphia had an entrenched Republican political machine and a complacent population.[67] In 1910, a general strike shut down the entire city.[68]\n\n\nIn 1917, following outrage over the election-year murder of a Philadelphia police officer, led to the shrinking of the City Council from two houses to just one.[69] In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot during Red Summer in post-World War I unrest as recent immigrants competed with Blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of Prohibition laws, organized crime, mob violence, and corrupt police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of Brig. Gen. Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as the city's director of public safety, but political pressure still prevented long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.[70]\n\n\nIn 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population.[71] In 1950, the population peaked at more than two million residents, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry that led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization enticed many affluent residents to depart the city for its outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The resulting reduction in Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government caused the city to struggle through a long period of adjustment, and it approached bankruptcy by the late 1980s.[72][73]\n\n\nIn 1985, the MOVE Bombing of the Cobbs Creek neighborhood by city helicopters occurred, killing 11 and destroying 61 homes.[74]\n\n\nRevitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century with much of the development occurring in the Center City and University City neighborhoods. But this expanded a shortage of affordable housing in the city. After many manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to market itself more aggressively as a tourist destination. Contemporary glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the 1980s. Historic areas such as Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s, making both areas among the most desirable Center City neighborhoods. Immigrants from around the world began to enter the U.S. through Philadelphia as their gateway, leading to a reversal of the city's population decline between 1950 and 2000, during which it lost about 25 percent of its residents.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia eventually began experiencing a growth in its population in 2007, which continued with gradual yearly increases through the present.[77][78]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's geographic center is about 40° 0′ 34″ north latitude and 75° 8′ 0″ west longitude. The 40th parallel north passes through neighborhoods in Northeast Philadelphia, North Philadelphia, and West Philadelphia including Fairmount Park. The city encompasses 142.71 square miles (369.62 km2), of which 134.18 square miles (347.52 km2) is land and 8.53 square miles (22.09 km2), or 6%, is water.[79] Natural bodies of water include the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, lakes in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park, and Cobbs, Wissahickon, and Pennypack creeks. The largest artificial body of water is East Park Reservoir in Fairmount Park.\n\n\nThe lowest point is sea level and the highest point is in Chestnut Hill about 446 feet (136 m) above sea level on Summit Street near the intersection of Germantown Avenue and Bethlehem Pike at: 40.07815 N, 75.20747 W.[80][81] Philadelphia is located on the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line that separates the Atlantic Plain from the Piedmont.[82] The Schuylkill River's rapids at East Falls were inundated by completion of the dam at Fairmount Water Works.[83]\n\n\nThe city is the seat of its own county. The city is bordered by six adjacent counties: Montgomery to the northwest; Bucks to the north and northeast; Burlington County, New Jersey to the east; Camden County, New Jersey to the southeast; Gloucester County, New Jersey to the south; and Delaware County to the southwest.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)\nThe skyline of Philadelphia seen from the northwest on the Spring Garden Street Bridge over the Schuylkill River in April 2018 (annotated version)\n\n![](image)\nPhiladelphia's skyline at twilight from the southwest on the South Street Bridge with the Schuylkill River on the left in July 2016 (annotated version)\n\n#### City planning[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia neighborhoods\n\nPhiladelphia was created in the 17th century following the plan by William Penn's surveyor Thomas Holme. Center City is structured with long, straight streets running nearly due east–west and north–south, forming a grid pattern between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers that is aligned with their courses. The original city plan was designed to allow for easy travel and to keep residences separated by open space that would help prevent the spread of fire.[84] In keeping with the idea of a \"Greene Countrie Towne\", and inspired by the many types of trees that grew in the region, Penn named many of the east–west streets for local trees.[85] Penn planned the creation of five public parks in the city which were renamed in 1824.[84] Centre Square was renamed Penn Square;[86] Northeast Square was renamed Franklin Square; Southeast Square was renamed Washington Square; Southwest Square was renamed Rittenhouse Square; and Northwest Square was renamed Logan Circle/Square.[87] Center City had an estimated 183,240 residents as of 2015[update], making it the second-most populated downtown area in the United States after Midtown Manhattan in New York City.[88]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's neighborhoods are divided into six large sections that surround Center City: North Philadelphia, Northeast Philadelphia, South Philadelphia, Southwest Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, and Northwest Philadelphia. The city's geographic boundaries have been largely unchanged since these neighborhoods were consolidated in 1854. However, each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that constituted Pennsylvania County before their inclusion within the city.[89]\n\n\nThe City Planning Commission, tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the *Philadelphia2035* physical development plan.[90][91] Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007 to 2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors John F. Street and Michael Nutter. The zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning maps to facilitate future community development, as the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs will be added by 2035.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, the PHA is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, serving about 81,000 people with affordable housing, while employing 1,400 on a budget of $371 million.[92] The Philadelphia Parking Authority is responsible for ensuring adequate parking for city residents, businesses, and visitors.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia City Hall at night in December 2012\n![](image)Two of Center City Philadelphia's most prominent high-rise buildings, One Liberty Place, built between 1985 and 1987 (in background), and Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901 (in foreground)\nPhiladelphia's architectural history dates back to colonial times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest structures were constructed with logs, but brick structures were common by 1700. During the 18th century, the cityscape was dominated by Georgian architecture, including Independence Hall and Christ Church.\n\n\nIn the first decades of the 19th century, Federal and Greek Revival architecture were the dominant styles produced by Philadelphia architects such as Benjamin Latrobe, William Strickland, John Haviland, John Notman, Thomas Walter, and Samuel Sloan.[94] Frank Furness is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century. His contemporaries included John McArthur Jr., Addison Hutton, Wilson Eyre, the Wilson Brothers, and Horace Trumbauer. In 1871, construction began on the Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall. The Philadelphia Historical Commission was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places, adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit.[95]\n\n\nIn 1932, Philadelphia became home to the first modern International Style skyscraper in the United States, the PSFS Building, designed by George Howe and William Lescaze. The 548 ft (167 m) City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when One Liberty Place was completed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the late 1980s. In 2007, the Comcast Center surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest building. The Comcast Technology Center was completed in 2018, reaching a height of 1,121 ft (342 m), as the tallest building in the United States outside of Manhattan and Chicago.[96]\n\n\nFor much of Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the row house. The row house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United States were known as \"Philadelphia rows\".[94] A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Federal-style continuous blocks in Old City and Society Hill to Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia to twin row houses in West Philadelphia. While newer homes have been built recently, much of the housing dates to the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, which has created problems such as urban decay and vacant lots. Some neighborhoods, including Northern Liberties and Society Hill, have been rehabilitated through gentrification.[97][98]\n\n\n\n* ![Elfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]](image)\n\nElfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]\n* ![Carpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style](image)\n\nCarpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style\n* ![The Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture](image)\n\nThe Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture\n* ![Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street](image)\n\nSecond Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street\n* ![The Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933](image)\n\nThe Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933\n\n\n#### Parks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Drinking fountains in Philadelphia, Fairmount Park, and List of parks in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's Fairmount Park on the Schuylkill River, the city's largest and one of the world's largest public parks\nAs of 2014[update], the city's total park space, including municipal, state, and federal parks in the city, amounts to 11,211 acres (17.5 sq mi).[29] Philadelphia's largest park is Fairmount Park, which includes the Philadelphia Zoo and encompasses 2,052 acres (3.2 sq mi) of the total parkland. Fairmount Park's adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park contains 2,042 acres (3.2 sq mi).[100] Fairmount Park, when combined with Wissahickon Valley Park, is one of the largest contiguous urban park areas in the U.S.[29] The two parks, along with the Colonial Revival, Georgian and Federal-style mansions in them, have been listed as one entity on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972.[101]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3.1\n\n\n\n41\n\n26\n | 2.8\n\n\n\n44\n\n28\n | 4\n\n\n\n53\n\n34\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n65\n\n44\n | 3.3\n\n\n\n74\n\n54\n | 4\n\n\n\n83\n\n64\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n88\n\n70\n | 4.3\n\n\n\n86\n\n68\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n79\n\n61\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n67\n\n49\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n56\n\n39\n | 4\n\n\n\n46\n\n31\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 80\n\n\n\n5\n\n−3\n | 70\n\n\n\n7\n\n−3\n | 101\n\n\n\n12\n\n1\n | 88\n\n\n\n18\n\n7\n | 85\n\n\n\n24\n\n12\n | 103\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 111\n\n\n\n31\n\n21\n | 109\n\n\n\n30\n\n20\n | 112\n\n\n\n26\n\n16\n | 88\n\n\n\n20\n\n10\n | 74\n\n\n\n13\n\n4\n | 101\n\n\n\n8\n\n0\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification, Philadelphia falls under the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen *Cfa*),[102] whereas according to the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (*Do*) limited to the north by the continental climate (*Dc*).[103] Summers are typically hot and muggy, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is moderately cold. The plant life hardiness zones are 7a and 7b, representing an average annual extreme minimum temperature between 0 and 10 °F (−18 and −12 °C).[104]\n\n\nSnowfall is highly variable, with some winters experiencing only light snow, while others include major snowstorms. The normal seasonal snowfall averages 22.4 in (57 cm), with rare snowfalls in November or April, and rarely any sustained snow cover.[105] Seasonal snowfall accumulation has ranged from trace amounts in 1972–73 to 78.7 inches (200 cm) in the winter of 2009–10.[105][b] The city's heaviest single-storm snowfall was 30.7 in (78 cm) which occurred in January 1996.[106]\n\n\nPrecipitation is generally spread throughout the year, with eight to eleven wet days per month,[107] at an average annual rate of 44.1 inches (1,120 mm), but historically ranging from 29.31 in (744 mm) in 1922 to 64.33 in (1,634 mm) in 2011.[105] The most rain recorded in one day occurred on July 28, 2013, when 8.02 in (204 mm) fell at Philadelphia International Airport.[105] Philadelphia has a moderately sunny climate with an average of 2,498 hours of sunshine annually, and a percentage of sunshine ranging from 47% in December to 61% in June, July, and August.[108]\n\n\nThe January daily average temperature is 33.7 °F (0.9 °C), though the temperature frequently rises to 50 °F (10 °C) during thaws. July averages 78.7 °F (25.9 °C), although heat waves accompanied by high humidity and heat indices are frequent, with highs reaching or exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) on 30 days of the year. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 6 thru April 2,[105] allowing a growing season of 217 days. Early fall and late winter are generally dry with February having the lowest average precipitation at 2.75 inches (70 mm).

Many smaller CSAs were also ranked higher for ozone including Sacramento (8th), Las Vegas (10th), Denver (11th), El Paso (16th), and Salt Lake City (20th); however, only two of those same ten CSAs—San Jose and Los Angeles—were ranked higher than Philadelphia for both year-round and short-term particle pollution.[117]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Chinese in Philadelphia; History of Irish Americans in Philadelphia; History of Italian Americans in Philadelphia; Koreans in Philadelphia; Little Saigon, Philadelphia; History of Jews in Philadelphia; LGBT culture in Philadelphia; and Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1683 | 600 | —     |\n| 1731 | 12,000 | +1900.0% |\n| 1790 | 28,522 | +137.7% |\n| 1800 | 41,220 | +44.5% |\n| 1810 | 53,722 | +30.3% |\n| 1820 | 63,802 | +18.8% |\n| 1830 | 80,462 | +26.1% |\n| 1840 | 93,665 | +16.4% |\n| 1850 | 121,376 | +29.6% |\n| 1860 | 565,529 | +365.9% |\n| 1870 | 674,022 | +19.2% |\n| 1880 | 847,170 | +25.7% |\n| 1890 | 1,046,964 | +23.6% |\n| 1900 | 1,293,697 | +23.6% |\n| 1910 | 1,549,008 | +19.7% |\n| 1920 | 1,823,779 | +17.7% |\n| 1930 | 1,950,961 | +7.0% |\n| 1940 | 1,931,334 | −1.0% |\n| 1950 | 2,071,605 | +7.3% |\n| 1960 | 2,002,512 | −3.3% |\n| 1970 | 1,948,609 | −2.7% |\n| 1980 | 1,688,210 | −13.4% |\n| 1990 | 1,585,577 | −6.1% |\n| 2000 | 1,517,550 | −4.3% |\n| 2010 | 1,526,006 | +0.6% |\n| 2020 | 1,603,797 | +5.1% |\n| 2022 | 1,567,258 | −2.3% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[118]2010–2020[12]Source: U.S. Decennial Census[119] |\n\n\nAccording to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau's tabulation, there were 1,603,797 people residing in Philadelphia, representing a 1.2% increase from the 2019 census estimate.[78] The racial composition of the city was 39.3% Black alone (42.0% Black alone or in combination), 36.3% White alone (41.9% White alone or in combination), 8.7% Asian alone, 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 8.7% some other race, and 6.9% multiracial. 14.9% of residents were Hispanic or Latino. 34.8% had a bachelor's degree or higher. 23.9% spoke a language other than English at home, the most common of which was Spanish (10.8%). 15.0% of the populations foreign born, roughly half of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens. 3.7% of the population are veterans. The median household income was $52,889 and 22.8% of the population lived in poverty. 49.5% of the population drove alone to work, while 23.2% used public transit, 8.2% carpooled, 7.9% walked, and 7.0% worked from home. The average commute is 31 minutes.[120]\n\n\nAfter the 1950 census, when a record high of 2,071,605 was recorded, the city's population began a long decline. The population dropped to a low of 1,488,710 residents in 2006 before beginning to rise again. Between 2006 and 2017, Philadelphia added 92,153 residents. In 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the racial composition of the city was 41.3% Black (non-Hispanic), 34.9% White (non-Hispanic), 14.1% Hispanic or Latino, 7.1% Asian, 0.4% Native American, 0.05% Pacific Islander, and 2.8% multiracial.[121]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Census racial composition | 2020[120] | 2010[122] | 2000 | 1990[123] | 1980[123] | 1970[123] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Black or African American (non-Hispanic) | 38.3% | 42.2% | 42.6% | 39.3% | 37.5% | 33.3%[e] |\n| White (non-Hispanic) | 34.3% | 36.9% | 42.5% | 52.1% | 57.1% | 63.8[e] |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race) | 14.9% | 12.3% | 8.5% | 5.6% | 3.8% | 2.4%[e] |\n| Asian | 8.3% | 6.3% | 4.5% | 2.7% | 1.1% | 0.3%\n |\n| Pacific Islanders | 0.1% | <0.1% | <0.1% | <0.1%\n |\n| Native Americans | 0.4% | 0.5% | 0.3% | 0.2% | 0.1% | 0.1%\n |\n| Two or more races | 6.9% | 2.8% | 2.2% | n/a[124] | n/a | n/a\n |\n\n\n![](image)Ethnic origins in Philadelphia\n### Immigration and cultural diversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's famed Italian Market in South Philadelphia\n![](image)A Gayborhood street sign near Washington Square\nIn addition to the city's economic growth, the city's population has been fueled by foreign immigration. According to The Pew Charitable Trusts, the city's foreign-born population increased by 69% between 2000 and 2016 to constitute nearly 20% of Philadelphia's workforce,[125] and it doubled between 1990 and 2017 to constitute 13.8% of the city's total population, with the top five countries of origin being China by a significant margin followed by the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, India, and Vietnam.[126]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 countries of origin for foreign-born Philadelphians, 2017[127]\n| Country | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) China | 22,140\n |\n| ![](image) Dominican Republic | 13,792\n |\n| ![](image) Jamaica | 13,500\n |\n| ![](image) India | 11,382\n |\n| ![](image) Vietnam | 10,132\n |\n| ![](image) Haiti | 9,186\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 7,823\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 6,898\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 5,258\n |\n| ![](image) South Korea/![](image) North Korea | 4,385\n |\n\n\nIrish, Italian, German, Polish, English, Russian, Ukrainian, and French ancestries constitute the largest European ethnic groups in the city.[128] Philadelphia has the second-largest Irish and Italian populations in the United States after New York City. South Philadelphia remains one of the largest Italian neighborhoods in the country and is home to the Italian Market.\n\n\nThe Pennsport neighborhood and Gray's Ferry section of South Philadelphia, home to many Mummer clubs, are well known as Irish neighborhoods. The Kensington, Port Richmond, and Fishtown neighborhoods have historically been heavily Irish and Polish. Port Richmond is a center for the Polish-American community in Philadelphia, and it remains a common destination for Polish immigrants. Northeast Philadelphia, although known for its Irish and Irish-American population, is home to a Jewish and Russian population. Mount Airy in Northwest Philadelphia also contains a Jewish community. Nearby Chestnut Hill is historically known as an Anglo-Saxon Protestant community.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Black American population is the fourth-largest in the country after New York City, Chicago, and Houston. West Philadelphia and North Philadelphia are largely African-American neighborhoods, but many are leaving those areas in favor of the Northeast and Southwest sections of Philadelphia. A higher proportion of African-American Muslims reside in Philadelphia than most other major U.S. cities. West Philadelphia and Southwest Philadelphia are home to various Afro-Caribbean and African immigrant communities.[129]\n\n\nThe Puerto Rican population in Philadelphia is the second-largest on the U.S. mainland after New York City, and the second-fastest growing after Orlando.[130] Eastern North Philadelphia, particularly Fairhill and surrounding areas to the north and east, has one of the highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans outside Puerto Rico, with many large swaths of blocks being close to 100% Puerto Rican.[131][132] Puerto Rican and Dominican populations reside in North Philadelphia and the Northeast, and Mexican and Central American populations exist in South Philadelphia.[133] South American migrants were being transported by bus from Texas to Philadelphia beginning in 2022.[134]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Asian American population includes those of Chinese, Indians, Vietnamese, South Koreans, and Filipinos. Over 35,000 Chinese Americans lived in the city in 2015,[135] including a Fuzhounese population. Center City hosts a Chinatown that is served by Chinatown bus lines with service to/from Chinatown, Manhattan.[136] A Korean community initially settled in the North Philadelphia neighborhood of Olney; however, the primary Koreatown has subsequently shifted further north, straddling the city's border with adjacent Cheltenham in Montgomery County and Cherry Hill in South Jersey. South Philadelphia is home to Vietnamese-Americans in Little Saigon, as well as Cambodian Americans, Thai Americans, and Chinese communities.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Gay village near Washington Square is home to a concentration of gay and lesbian-friendly businesses, restaurants, and bars.[137][138]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Philadelphia\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 68% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christian.[139] Approximately 41% of Christians in the city and area professed attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, while 26% professed Catholic beliefs.\n\n\nThe Protestant Christian community in Philadelphia is dominated by mainline Protestant denominations including the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church in the United States, Presbyterian Church (USA) and American Baptist Churches USA. One of the most prominent mainline Protestant jurisdictions is the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in Philadelphia. Historically, the city has strong connections to the Quakers, Unitarian Universalism, and the Ethical Culture movement, all of which continue to be represented in the city. The Quaker Friends General Conference is based in Philadelphia. Evangelical Protestants making up less than 15% of the population were also prevalent. Evangelical Protestant bodies included the Anglican Church in North America, Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, Presbyterian Church in America, and National Baptist Convention of America.\nThe Catholic community is primarily served by the Latin Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia, and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Eparchy of the United States of America and Canada, though some independent Catholic churches exist throughout Philadelphia and its suburbs. The Latin Church-based jurisdiction is headquartered in the city, and its see is the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. The Ukrainian Catholic jurisdiction is also headquartered in Philadelphia, and is seated at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.\n\n\nLess than 1% of Philadelphia's Christians were Mormons. The remainder of the Christian demographic is spread among smaller Protestant denominations and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox among others. The Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania (Orthodox Church in America) and Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (Ecumenical Patriarchate) divide the Eastern Orthodox in Philadelphia. The Russian Orthodox St. Andrew's Cathedral is in the city.\nThe same study says that other religions collectively compose about 8% of the population, including Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, and Sikhism.[140] Philadelphia has the fifth-largest Muslim population among U.S. cities.[141] The remaining 24% claimed no religious affiliation.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metropolitan area's Jewish population was estimated at 206,000 in 2001, which was the sixth-largest in the U.S. at that time.[142] Jewish traders were operating in southeastern Pennsylvania long before William Penn. Furthermore, Jews in Philadelphia took a prominent part in the War of Independence. Although the majority of the early Jewish residents were of Portuguese or Spanish descent, some among them had emigrated from Germany and Poland. About the beginning of the 19th century, a number of Jews from the latter countries, finding the services of the Congregation Mickvé Israel unfamiliar to them, resolved to form a new congregation which would use the ritual to which they had been accustomed.\n\n\nAfrican diasporic religions are practiced in some Latino and Hispanic and Caribbean communities in North and West Philadelphia.[143][144]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], 79.12% (1,112,441) of Philadelphia residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 9.72% (136,688) spoke Spanish, 1.64% (23,075) Chinese, 0.89% (12,499) Vietnamese, 0.77% (10,885) Russian, 0.66% (9,240) French, 0.61% (8,639) other Asian languages, 0.58% (8,217) African languages, 0.56% (7,933) Cambodian (Mon-Khmer), and Italian was spoken as a main language by 0.55% (7,773) of the population over the age of five. In total, 20.88% (293,544) of Philadelphia's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[145]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Philadelphia\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Top publicly traded companiesheadquartered in Philadelphia** |\n| **Corporation** | **2019****rank** | **Revenue****(billions)** |\n| Comcast | 32 | 94.5\n |\n| Aramark | 198 | 15.8\n |\n| FMC | 556 | 4.7\n |\n| Urban Outfitters | 634 | 4.0\n |\n| Carpenter Technology | 940 | 2.2\n |\n| **Source:** *Fortune*[146] |\n\n\nPhiladelphia's close geographical and transportation connections to other large metropolitan economies along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States have been cited as offering a significant competitive advantage for business creation and entrepreneurship.[147] The city is the center of economic activity in both Pennsylvania and the four-state Delaware Valley metropolitan region. Five Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the city. As of 2021[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of US$479 billion,[148] an increase from the $445 billion calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis for 2017,[149] representing the ninth-largest U.S. metropolitan economy.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's economic sectors include financial services, health care, biotechnology, information technology, trade and transportation, manufacturing, oil refining, food processing, and tourism. Metropolitan Philadelphia is one of the top five American venture capital hubs, credited to its proximity to New York City's financial and tech and biotechnology ecosystems.[22] Financial activities account for the largest economic sector of the metropolitan area, which is also one of the largest health education and research centers in the United States. The city's two largest employers are the federal and city governments. Philadelphia's largest private employer is the University of Pennsylvania, followed by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.[150] A study commissioned by the city's government in 2011 projected 40,000 jobs would be added to the city within 25 years, raising the number of jobs from 675,000 in 2010 to an estimated 715,000 by 2035.[151]\n\n\n\n### Corporations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies based in the Philadelphia area\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the nation's first stock exchange, at 1411 Walnut Street\n![](image)Comcast Center in Center City, headquarters of the nation's largest multinational telecommunications conglomerate and the city's second-tallest building after Comcast Technology Center[152]\nThe Philadelphia Stock Exchange, acquired by Nasdaq in 2007, is a global leader in options trading.[23] The city is also home to the headquarters of cable television and internet service provider Comcast, insurance companies Cigna, Colonial Penn, and Independence Blue Cross, food services company Aramark, chemical makers FMC Corporation and Rohm and Haas, pharmaceutical companies GlaxoSmithKline, Amicus Therapeutics, Spark Therapeutics, apparel retailers Five Below and Urban Outfitters and its subsidiary Anthropologie, automotive parts retailer Pep Boys, and stainless steel producer Carpenter Technology Corporation.

The School District of Philadelphia is the local school district, operating public schools, in all of the city.[160] The Philadelphia School District is the eighth-largest school district in the nation[161] with 142,266 students in 218 traditional public schools and 86 charter schools as of 2014[update].[162]\n\n\nThe city's K-12 enrollment in district–run schools dropped from 156,211 students in 2010 to 130,104 students in 2015. During the same time period, the enrollment in charter schools increased from 33,995 students in 2010 to 62,358 students in 2015.[150] This consistent drop in enrollment led the city to close 24 of its public schools in 2013.[163] During the 2014 school year, the city spent an average of $12,570 per pupil, below the average among comparable urban school districts.[150]\n\n\nGraduation rates among district-run schools, meanwhile, steadily increased in the ten years from 2005. In 2005, Philadelphia had a district graduation rate of 52%. This number increased to 65% in 2014, still below the national and state averages. Scores on the state's standardized test, the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) trended upward from 2005 to 2011 but subsequently decreased. In 2005, the district-run schools scored an average of 37.4% on math and 35.5% on reading. The city's schools reached their peak scores in 2011 with 59.0% on math and 52.3% on reading. In 2014, the scores dropped significantly to 45.2% on math and 42.0% on reading.[150]\n\n\nOf the city's public high schools, including charter schools, only four performed above the national average on the SAT (1497 out of 2400[164]) in 2014: Masterman, Central, Girard Academic Music Program, and MaST Community Charter School.

The city's major art museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, is one of the largest art museums in the world. The long flight of steps to the Art Museum's main entrance became famous after the film *Rocky* (1976).[176]\n\n\nAreas such as South Street and Old City have a vibrant night life. The Avenue of the Arts in Center City contains many restaurants and theaters, such as the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Academy of Music, home of Opera Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Ballet.[176] The Wilma Theatre and the Philadelphia Theatre Company at the Suzanne Roberts Theatre produce a variety of new plays.[177][178] Several blocks to the east are the Lantern Theater Company at St. Stephens Episcopal Church;[179] and the Walnut Street Theatre, a National Historic Landmark stated to be the oldest and most subscribed-to theatre in the English-speaking world, founded in 1809.[180] In May 2019, the Walnut Street Theatre announced a major expansion to begin in 2020.[181] New Freedom Theatre, which is Pennsylvania's oldest African-American theatre, sits on North Broad Street.\n\n\nPhiladelphia has more public art than any other American city.[182] In 1872, the Association for Public Art (formerly the Fairmount Park Art Association) was created as the first private association in the United States dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning.[183] In 1959, lobbying by the Artists Equity Association helped create the Percent for Art ordinance, the first for a U.S. city.[184] The program, which has funded more than 200 pieces of public art, is administered by the Philadelphia Office of Arts and Culture, the city's art agency.[185] The city also has more murals than any other American city, due to the 1984 creation of the Department of Recreation's Mural Arts Program, which seeks to beautify neighborhoods and provide an outlet for graffiti artists. The program has funded more than 2,800 murals by professional, staff and volunteer artists and educated more than 20,000 youth in underserved neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia.[186]\n\n\nThe city is home to a number of art organizations including the regional art advocacy nonprofit Philadelphia Tri-State Artists Equity,[187] the Philadelphia Sketch Club, one of the country's oldest artists' clubs,[188] and The Plastic Club, started by women excluded from the Sketch Club.[189] Many Old City art galleries stay open late on the First Friday event of each month.[190] Annual events include the Philadelphia Film Festival, held annually each October, the 6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade, the nation's longest-running continuously held Thanksgiving Day parade, and the Mummers Parade, the nation's longest continuously held folk parade, which is held every New Year's Day.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Philadelphia\n\n![](image)The Curtis Institute of Music at 1726 Locust Street in Center City, one of the world's premier conservatories\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra is generally considered one of the top five orchestras in the United States. The orchestra performs at the Kimmel Center[191] and has a summer concert series at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts.[192] Opera Philadelphia performs at the nation's oldest continually operating opera house—the Academy of Music.[176] The Philadelphia Boys Choir & Chorale has performed its music all over the world.[193] The Philly Pops plays orchestral versions of popular jazz, swing, Broadway, and blues songs at the Kimmel Center and other venues within the mid-Atlantic region.[194] The Curtis Institute of Music is one of the world's premier conservatories and among the most selective institutes of higher education in the nation.[195]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has played a prominent role in the music of the United States. The culture of American popular music has been influenced by significant contributions of Philadelphia area musicians and producers, in both the recording and broadcasting industries. In 1952, the teen dance party program called *Bandstand* premiered on local television, hosted by Bob Horn. The show was renamed *American Bandstand* in 1957, when it began national syndication on ABC, hosted by Dick Clark and produced in Philadelphia until 1964 when it moved to Los Angeles.[196] Promoters marketed youthful musical artists known as teen idols to appeal to the young audience. Philadelphia-born singers such as Frankie Avalon, James Darren, Eddie Fisher, Fabian Forte, and Bobby Rydell, along with South Philly-raised Chubby Checker, topped the music charts, establishing a clean-cut rock and roll image.\n\n\nPhilly soul music of the late 1960s–1970s is a highly produced version of soul music which led to later forms of popular music such as disco and urban contemporary rhythm and blues.[197] On July 13, 1985, John F. Kennedy Stadium was the American venue for the Live Aid concert.[198] The city also hosted the Live 8 concert, which attracted about 700,000 people to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway on July 2, 2005.[199]\n\n\nNotable rock and pop musicians from Philadelphia and its suburbs include Bill Haley & His Comets, Nazz, Todd Rundgren, Hall & Oates, the Hooters, Cinderella, DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Ween, Schoolly D, Pink, the Roots, Beanie Sigel, State Property, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, Meek Mill, Lil Uzi Vert, and others.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Pat's Steaks (foreground) and Geno's Steaks (background) in South Philadelphia\nThe city is known for its hoagies, stromboli, roast pork sandwich, scrapple, soft pretzels, water ice, Irish potato candy, tastykakes, and the cheesesteak sandwich which was developed by Italian immigrants.[200] The Philadelphia area has many establishments that serve cheesesteaks, including restaurants, taverns, delicatessens and pizza parlors.[201][202][203] The originator of the thinly-sliced steak sandwich in the 1930s, initially without cheese, is Pat's King of Steaks, which faces its rival Geno's Steaks, founded in 1966,[204] across the intersection of 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue in the Italian Market of South Philadelphia.[205]\n\n\nMcGillin's Olde Ale House, opened in 1860 on Drury Street in Center City, is the oldest continuously operated tavern in the city.[206] The City Tavern is a replica of a historic 18th-century building first opened in 1773, demolished in 1854 after a fire, and rebuilt in 1975 on the same site as part of Independence National Historical Park.[207] The tavern offers authentic 18th-century recipes, served in seven period dining rooms, three wine cellar rooms and an outdoor garden.[208]\n\n\nThe Reading Terminal Market is a historic food market founded in 1893 in the Reading Terminal building, a designated National Historic Landmark. The enclosed market is one of the oldest and largest markets in the country, hosting over a hundred merchants offering Pennsylvania Dutch specialties, artisan cheese and meat, locally grown groceries, and specialty and ethnic foods.[209]\n\n\n\n### Dialect[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia English\n\nThe traditional Philadelphia accent is considered by some linguists to be the most distinctive accent in North America.[210] The Philadelphia dialect, which is spread throughout the Delaware Valley and South Jersey, is part of a larger Mid-Atlantic American English family, a designation that also includes the Baltimore dialect. Additionally, it shares many similarities with the New York accent. Owing to over a century of linguistic data collected by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania under sociolinguist William Labov, the Philadelphia dialect has been one of the best-studied forms of American English.[211][212][f] The accent is especially found within the Irish American and Italian American working-class neighborhoods.[213] Philadelphia also has its own unique collection of neologisms and slang terms.[214]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Philadelphia 76ers, Philadelphia Flyers, Philadelphia Eagles, Philadelphia Phillies, and Philadelphia Union\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nCitizens Bank Park, home of the Phillies since 2004, and Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Eagles since 2003\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Eagles are presented with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018\n![](image)Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia, home of the two-time Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and three-time champion Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA)\n![](image)Historic Boathouse Row at night on the Schuylkill River, a symbol of the city's rich rowing history\nPhiladelphia's first professional sports team was baseball's Athletics, organized in 1860.[215] The Athletics were initially an amateur league team that turned professional in 1871, and then became a founding team of the current National League in 1876.[216] The city is one of 13 U.S. cities to have teams in all four major league sports: the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB), the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL), the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL), and the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[217] The Phillies, formed in 1883 as the Quakers and renamed in 1884,[218] are the oldest team continuously playing under the same name in the same city in the history of American professional sports.[219]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metro area is also home to the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer (MLS). The Union began playing their home games in 2010 at PPL Park, a soccer-specific stadium in Chester, Pennsylvania.[220] The stadium's name was changed to Talen Energy Stadium in 2016[221] and to Subaru Park in 2020.[222]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the second of eight American cities to have won titles in all four major leagues (MLB, NFL, NHL and NBA), and also has a title in soccer from the now-defunct North American Soccer League in the 1970s. The city's professional teams and their fans endured 25 years without a championship, from the 76ers 1983 NBA Finals win[223] until the Phillies 2008 World Series win.[224][225] The lack of championships was sometimes attributed in jest to the Curse of Billy Penn after One Liberty Place became the first building to surpass the height of the William Penn statue on top of City Hall's tower in 1987.[226] After nine years passed without another championship, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl following the 2017 season.[227] In 2004, ESPN placed Philadelphia second on its list of The Fifteen Most Tortured Sports Cities.[228][229] Fans of the Eagles and Phillies were singled out as the worst fans in the country by *GQ* magazine in 2011, which used the subtitle of \"Meanest Fans in America\" to summarize incidents of drunken behavior and a history of booing.[230][231]\n\n\nMajor professional sports teams that originated in Philadelphia but later moved to other cities include the Golden State Warriors basketball team, which played in Philadelphia from 1946 to 1962[232] and the Oakland Athletics baseball team, which was originally the Philadelphia Athletics and played in Philadelphia from 1901 to 1954.[233]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to professional, semi-professional, and elite amateur teams in cricket, rugby league (Philadelphia Fight), and rugby union. Major running events in the city include the Penn Relays (track and field), the Philadelphia Marathon, and the Broad Street Run. The Collegiate Rugby Championship is played every June at Talen Energy Stadium in Chester.[234]\n\n\nRowing has been popular in Philadelphia since the 18th century.[235] Boathouse Row is a symbol of Philadelphia's rich rowing history, and each Big Five member has its own boathouse.[236] Philadelphia hosts numerous local and collegiate rowing clubs and competitions, including the annual Dad Vail Regatta, which is the largest intercollegiate rowing event in North America with more than 100 U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities participating;[237] the annual Stotesbury Cup Regatta, which is billed as the world's oldest and largest rowing event for high school students;[238][239] and the Head of the Schuylkill Regatta.[240] The regattas are held on the Schuylkill River and organized by the Schuylkill Navy, an association of area rowing clubs that has produced numerous Olympic rowers.[241]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Spinners were a professional ultimate team in Major League Ultimate (MLU) until 2016. The Spinners were one of the original eight teams of the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) that began in 2012. They played at Franklin Field and won the inaugural AUDL championship and the final MLU championship in 2016.[242] The MLU was suspended indefinitely by its investors in December 2016.[243] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia Phoenix continue to play in the AUDL.[244]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to the Philadelphia Big 5, a group of five NCAA Division I college basketball programs. The Big 5 include La Salle, Penn, Saint Joseph's, Temple, and Villanova universities.[245] The sixth NCAA Division I school in Philadelphia is Drexel University. Villanova won the 1985,[246] 2016,[247] and 2018[248] championship of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

All county functions were assumed by the city in 1952.[252] The city has been coterminous with the county since 1854.[63]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 1952 Home Rule Charter was written by the City Charter Commission, which was created by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in an act of April 21, 1949, and a city ordinance of June 15, 1949. The existing city council received a proposed draft on February 14, 1951, and the electors approved it in an election held April 17, 1951.[253] The first elections under the new Home Rule Charter were held in November 1951, and the newly elected officials took office in January 1952.[252]\n\n\nThe city uses the strong-mayor version of the mayor–council form of government, which is led by one mayor in whom executive authority is vested. The mayor has the authority to appoint and dismiss members of all boards and commissions without the approval of the city council. Elected at-large, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms, but can run for the position again after an intervening term.[253]\n\n\n\n### Courts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District Attorney of Philadelphia, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia County is coterminous with the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas is the trial court of general jurisdiction for the city, hearing felony-level criminal cases and civil suits above the minimum jurisdictional limit of $10,000. The court also has appellate jurisdiction over rulings from the Municipal and Traffic Courts, and some administrative agencies and boards. The trial division has 70 commissioned judges elected by the voters, along with about one thousand other employees.[254] The court also has a family division with 25 judges[255] and an orphans' court with three judges.[256]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city's District Attorney is Larry Krasner, a Democrat.[257] The last Republican to hold the office is Ronald D. Castille, who left in 1991 and later served as the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court from 2008 to 2014.[258]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Municipal Court handles traffic cases, misdemeanor and felony criminal cases with maximum incarceration of five years, and civil cases involving $12,000 or less ($15,000 in real estate and school tax cases), and all landlord-tenant disputes. The municipal court has 27 judges elected by the voters.[259]\n\n\nPennsylvania's three appellate courts also have sittings in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the court of last resort in the state, regularly hears arguments in Philadelphia City Hall.[260] The Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania also sit in Philadelphia several times a year.[261][262] Judges for these courts are elected at large.[263] The state Supreme Court and Superior Court have deputy prothonotary offices in Philadelphia.[264][265]\n\n\nAdditionally, Philadelphia is home to the federal United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, both of which are housed in the James A.

Roosevelt in his landslide victory of 1932 as Pennsylvania was one of only six states won by Republican Herbert Hoover. Voter turnout surged from 600,000 in 1932 to nearly 900,000 in 1936 and Roosevelt carried Philadelphia with over 60% of the vote. The city has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1936. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama drew 83% of the city's vote. Obama's win was even greater in 2012, capturing 85% of the vote. In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton won 82% of the vote.[273]\n\n\nAs a result of the previously declining population in the city and state,[277] Philadelphia has only three congressional districts of the 18 districts in Pennsylvania, based on the 2010 census apportionment:[278] the 2nd district, represented by Brendan Boyle; the 3rd, represented by Dwight Evans; and the 5th, represented by Mary Gay Scanlon.[279] All three representatives are Democrats though Republicans still have some support in the city, primarily in the Northeast.[280] Sam Katz ran competitive mayoral races as the Republican nominee in 1999 and 2003, losing to Democrat John Street both times.[281][282]\n\n\nPennsylvania's longest-serving Senator, Arlen Specter,[283] was an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania who opened his first law practice in Philadelphia.[284] Specter served as a Republican from 1981 and as a Democrat from 2009, losing that party's primary in 2010 and leaving office in January 2011.[285] He had also been assistant counsel on the Warren Commission in 1964 and the city's district attorney from 1966 to 1974.[284]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has hosted various national conventions, including in 1848 (Whig), 1856 (Republican), 1872 (Republican), 1900 (Republican), 1936 (Democratic), 1940 (Republican), 1948 (Republican), 1948 (Progressive), 2000 (Republican), and 2016 (Democratic).[286] Philadelphia has been home to one vice president, George M. Dallas,[287] and one general of the American Civil War, George B. McClellan, who won his party's nomination for president but lost in the general election to Abraham Lincoln in 1864.[288] In May 2019, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden chose Philadelphia to be his 2020 U.S. presidential campaign headquarters.[289]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\n\"Green Cities, Clean Water\" is an environmental policy initiative based in Philadelphia that has shown promising results in mitigating the effects of climate change.[290] The researchers on the policy have stated that despite such promising plans of green infrastructure building, \"the city is forecasted to grow warmer, wetter, and more urbanized over the century, runoff and local temperatures will increase on average throughout the city\".[290] Even though landcover predictive models on the effects of the policy initiative have indicated that green infrastructure could be useful at decreasing the amount of runoff in the city over time, the city government would have to expand its current plans and \"consider the cobenefit of climate change adaptation when planning new projects'' in limiting the scope of city-wide temperature increase.[290]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crime in Philadelphia and Philadelphia crime family\n\n#### Police and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Police Department\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Police Department administration building, known as the Roundhouse, in Center City east of Chinatown\n![](image)A Philadelphia police cruiser on Benjamin Franklin Parkway\nAccording to a 2015 report by Pew Charitable Trusts, the police districts with the highest rates of violent crime were Frankford (15th district) and Kensington (24th district) in the Near Northeast, and districts to the North (22nd, 25th, and 35th districts), West (19th district) and Southwest (12th district) of Center City. Each of those seven districts recorded more than a thousand violent crimes in 2014. The lowest rates of violent crime occurred in Center City, South Philadelphia, the Far Northeast, and Roxborough districts, the latter of which includes Manayunk.[150]\n\n\nPhiladelphia had 500 (503 according to some sources) murders in 1990, a rate of 31.5 per 100,000. An average of about 400 murders occurred each year for most of the 1990s. The murder count dropped in 2002 to 288, then rose to 406 by 2006, before dropping slightly to 392 in 2007.[291][292] A few years later, Philadelphia began to see a rapid decline in homicides and violent crime. In 2013, the city had 246 murders, which is a decrease of nearly 40% since 2006.[293] In 2014, 248 homicides were committed. The homicide rate rose to 280 in 2015, then fell slightly to 277 in 2016, before rising again to 317 in 2017.[294] Homicides increased dramatically in the late 2010s/early 2020s, reaching 499 homicides in 2020[291] and surpassing the 1990 \"record\" in 2021, with 501st murder on November 27 and 510 by the end of the month.[295]\n\n\nIn 2006, Philadelphia's homicide rate of 27.7 per 100,000 people was the highest of the country's 10 most populous cities.[296] In 2012, Philadelphia had the fourth-highest homicide rate among the country's most populous cities. The rate dropped to 16 homicides per 100,000 residents by 2014 placing Philadelphia as the sixth-highest city in the country.[150]\n\n\nThe number of shootings in the city has declined significantly since the early years of the 21st century. Shooting incidents peaked at 1,857 in 2006 before declining nearly 44 percent to 1,047 shootings in 2014.[150] Major crimes have decreased gradually since a peak in 2006 when 85,498 major crimes were reported. The number of reported major crimes fell 11 percent in three years to 68,815 occurrences in 2014. Violent crimes, which include homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery, decreased 14 percent in three years to 15,771 occurrences in 2014.[150]\n\n\nIn 2014, Philadelphia enacted an ordinance decriminalizing the possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana or 8 grams of hashish; the ordinance gave police officers the discretion to treat possession of these amounts as a civil infraction punishable by a $25 ticket, rather than a crime.[297][298] Philadelphia was at the time the largest city to decriminalize the possession of marijuana.[298] From 2013 to 2018, marijuana arrests in the city dropped by more than 85%.[297] The purchase or sale of marijuana remains a criminal offense in Philadelphia.[298]\n\n\n\n#### Firefighting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Fire Department\n\nThe Philadelphia Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services (EMS). The department's official mission is to protect public safety by quick and professional response to emergencies and the promotion of sound emergency prevention measures. This mandate encompasses all traditional firefighting functions, including fire suppression, with 60 engine companies and 30 ladder companies[299] as well as specialty and support units deployed throughout the city; specialized firefighting units for Philadelphia International Airport and the Port of Philadelphia; investigations conducted by the fire marshal's office to determine the origins of fires and develop preventive strategies; prevention programs to educate the public; and support services including research and planning, management of the fire communications center within the city's 911 system, and operation of the Philadelphia Fire Academy.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Media in Philadelphia\n\n### Newspapers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Inquirer Building at 400 North Broad Street was home of *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, the nation's third-longest continuously published newspaper, until 2012 when it moved its headquarters to Market Street. The building is currently undergoing renovations to become the new headquarters of the Philadelphia Police Department.\nPhiladelphia's two major daily newspapers are *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, first published in 1829—the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the country—and the *Philadelphia Daily News*, first published in 1925.[300] The *Daily News* has been published as an edition of the *Inquirer* since 2009.[301] Recent owners of the *Inquirer* and *Daily News* have included Knight Ridder, The McClatchy Company, and Philadelphia Media Holdings, with the latter organization declaring bankruptcy in 2010.[302] After two years of financial struggle, the newspapers were sold to Interstate General Media in 2012.[302] The two newspapers had a combined daily circulation of 306,831 and a Sunday circulation of 477,313 in 2013[update], the 18th-largest circulation in the country, and the website of the newspapers, Philly.com,[303] was ranked 13th in popularity among online U.S. newspapers by Alexa Internet that same year.[304]\n\n\nSmaller publications include the *Philadelphia Tribune* published five days each week for the African-American community;[305] *Philadelphia* magazine, a monthly regional magazine;[306] *Philadelphia Weekly*, a weekly alternative newspaper;[307] *Philadelphia Gay News*, a weekly newspaper for the LGBT community;[308] *The Jewish Exponent*, a weekly newspaper for the Jewish community;[309] *Al Día*, a weekly newspaper for the Latino community;[310] and *Philadelphia Metro*, a free daily newspaper.[311]\n\n\nStudent-run newspapers include the University of Pennsylvania's *The Daily Pennsylvanian*,[312] Temple University's *The Temple News*,[313] and Drexel University's *The Triangle*.[314]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nThe first experimental radio license was issued in Philadelphia in August 1912 to St. Joseph's College. The first commercial AM radio stations began broadcasting in 1922: first WIP, then owned by Gimbels department store, followed by WFIL, then owned by Strawbridge & Clothier department store, and WOO, a defunct station owned by Wanamaker's department store, as well as WCAU and WDAS.[315]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the FCC lists 28 FM and 11 AM stations for Philadelphia.[316][317] As of December 2017, the ten highest-rated stations in Philadelphia were adult contemporary WBEB-FM (101.1), sports talk WIP-FM (94.1), classic rock WMGK-FM (102.9), urban adult contemporary WDAS-FM (105.3), classic hits WOGL-FM (98.1), album-oriented rock WMMR-FM (93.3), country music WXTU-FM (92.5), all-news KYW-AM (1060), talk radio WHYY-FM (90.9), and urban adult contemporary WRNB-FM (100.3).[318][319] Philadelphia is served by three non-commercial public radio stations: WHYY-FM (NPR),[320] WRTI-FM (classical and jazz),[321] and WXPN-FM (adult alternative music).[322]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRadio stations in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, metropolitan area\n |\n| --- |\n| By AM frequency | * 560\n* 610\n* 640\n* 690\n* 740\n* 800\n* 860\n* 900\n* 950\n* 990\n* 10601\n* 1180\n* 12101\n* 1310\n* 1340\n* 1370\n* 1420\n* 1440\n* 1460\n* 1480\n* 1490\n* 1520\n* 1540\n* 1570\n* 1590\n* 1640\n* 1680\n |\n| By FM frequency | * 88.1\n\t+ WPEB\n\t+ WTHA\n\t+ WZZD\n* 88.3\n* 88.5\n* 88.7\n* 88.9\n\t+ WBYO\n\t+ WBZC\n* 89.1\n* 89.3\n\t+ WRDV\n\t+ WRTJ\n* 89.5\n* 89.7\n* 90.1\n* 90.9\n* 91.5\n\t+ WDBK\n\t+ WSRN-FM\n* 91.7\n\t+ WBMR\n\t+ WCUR\n\t+ WKDU\n\t+ WLBS\n* 92.5\n* 93.3\n* 93.7\n* 94.1\n* 94.5\n* 94.9\n* 95.7\n* 96.5\n* 97.5\n* 98.1\n* 98.9\n* 99.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.3\n* 101.1\n* 101.5\n* 102.1\n* 102.9\n* 103.9\n* 104.5\n* 105.3\n* 106.1\n* 106.9\n* 107.9\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| LPFM | * 92.9\n\t+ WGGT-LP\n\t+ WOOM-LP\n\t+ WRGU-LP\n\t+ WRLG-LP\n\t+ WZML-LP\n* 98.5\n\t+ WJYN-LP\n\t+ WNUW-LP\n\t+ WQEW-LP\n* 106.5\n |\n| Translators | * 92.9\n* 94.9\n* 95.1\n* 95.3\n* 96.1\n* 97.1\n\t+ W246AR\n\t+ W246AQ\n* 98.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.7\n* 102.5\n* 103.3\n* 103.5\n* 103.9\n* 104.1\n* 105.7\n\t+ W289AZ\n\t+ W289CZ\n* 107.3\n |\n\n |\n| NOAA Weather Radiofrequency | * 162.425\n* 162.475\n |\n| Digital radioby frequency & subchannel | * 1210\n* 88.5-1\n* 88.5-2\n* 89.3-1\n* 89.3-2\n* 89.5-1\n* 89.5-2\n* 90.1-1\n* 90.1-2\n* 90.9-1\n* 92.5-1\n* 92.5-2\n* 93.3-1\n* 93.3-2\n* 93.7-1\n* 93.7-2\n* 93.7-3\n* 94.1-1\n* 94.1-2\n* 94.1-3\n* 95.7-1\n* 95.7-2\n* 96.5-1\n* 96.5-2\n* 97.5-1\n* 97.5-2\n* 97.5-3\n* 98.1-1\n* 98.1-2\n* 98.1-3\n* 98.9-1\n* 99.5-1\n* 100.3-1\n* 100.3-2\n* 100.3-3\n* 101.1-1\n* 101.1-2\n* 101.5-1\n* 101.5-2\n* 102.1-1\n* 102.1-2\n* 102.1-3\n* 102.9-1\n* 102.9-2\n* 102.9-3\n* 104.5-1\n* 104.5-2\n* 105.3-1\n* 105.3-2\n* 106.1-1\n* 106.1-2\n* 106.9-1\n* 106.9-2\n* 106.9-3\n* 107.9-1\n* 107.9-2\n |\n| By call sign | * KIH28\n* KYW1\n* W225DJ\n* W235CE\n* W236CL\n* W237EH\n* W241CH\n* W246AR\n* W246AQ\n* W253CA\n* W260CZ\n* W264BH\n* W273DO\n* W277DL\n* W278AK\n* W280CP\n* W281CL\n* W289AZ\n* W289CZ\n* W297AD\n* WBCB\n* WBEB\n\t+ HD2\n* WBEN-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WBMR\n* WBYO\n* WBZC\n* WCHE\n* WCHR\n* WCOJ\n* WCUR\n* WDAS\n* WDAS-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WDBK\n* WEMG\n* WFIL\n* WFYL\n* WGGT-LP\n* WGLS-FM\n* WHAT\n* WHHS\n* WHYY\n* WIFI\n* WIOQ\n* WIP-FM\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WISP\n* WJFP\n* WJYN-LP\n* WKDN\n* WKDU\n* WKVP\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WKXW\n\t+ HD2\n* WLBS\n* WMGK\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WMMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WNG704\n* WNPV\n* WNTP\n* WNUW-LP\n* WNWR\n* WOGL\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WOOM-LP\n* WPAZ\n* WPEB\n* WPEN\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WPHE\n* WPHI-FM\n* WPHT1\n* WPNX700\n* WPPM-LP\n* WPPZ-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WPST\n* WPWA\n* WQEW-LP\n* WQHS\n* WRDV\n* WRFF\n\t+ HD2\n* WRGU-LP\n* WRLG-LP\n* WRNB\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WRSD\n* WRTI\n\t+ HD2\n* WRTJ\n\t+ HD2\n* WSRN-FM\n* WSTW\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WTDY-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WTEL\n* WTHA\n* WTMR\n* WTTM\n* WUMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WURD\n* WUSL\n* WVCW\n* WWDB\n* WWJZ\n* WWLU\n* WXPN\n\t+ HD2\n* WXTU\n\t+ HD2\n* WXVU\n* WYPA\n\t+ HD2\n* WZML-LP\n* WZXE\n* WZZD\n |\n| Internet | * WEXP\n* WQHS\n* WYBF\n |\n| Defunct | * WDNR (89.5 FM)\n* WEXP (1600 AM)\n* WJJZ (1460 AM)\n* WNAP (1110 AM)\n* WNJC (1360 AM)\n* WOO\n* WQHS\n* WYBF (89.1 FM)\n* WZZE (97.3 FM)\n |\n| Radio stations in the Delaware Valley\nPhiladelphia\nVineland-Millville-Bridgeton\nWilmington\n\nOther nearby regions\nAllentown-Bethlehem\nAtlantic City-Cape May\nDover\nLancaster\nReading\nTrenton\nSee also\nList of radio stations in Pennsylvania\n* Mass media in the Philadelphia Area\n\t+ Radio stations\n\t+ TV stations\n\t+ Newspapers\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nNotes\n1.

The station became NBC's first affiliate in 1939, and later became KYW-TV (currently a CBS affiliate). WCAU-TV, WFIL-TV, and WHYY-TV were all founded by the 1960s.[315] In 1952, WFIL (renamed WPVI) premiered the television show *Bandstand*, which later became the nationally broadcast *American Bandstand* hosted by Dick Clark.[323]\n\n\nEach commercial network has an affiliate in Philadelphia: KYW-TV 3 (CBS), WPVI-TV 6 (ABC), WCAU 10 (NBC), WPHL-TV 17 (The CW with MyNetworkTV on DT2), WFPA-CD 28 (UniMás), WTXF-TV 29 (Fox), WPSG 57 (Independent), WWSI 62 (Telemundo), and WUVP-DT 65 (Univision). The region is served also by public broadcasting stations WPPT-TV (Philadelphia), WHYY-TV (Wilmington, Delaware and Philadelphia), WLVT-TV (Lehigh Valley), and NJTV (New Jersey).[324]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has owned-and-operated stations for five major English-language broadcast networks: NBC – WCAU-TV, CBS – KYW-TV, ABC – WPVI-TV, Fox – WTXF-TV and The CW – WPHL-TV. The major Spanish-language networks are Univision – WUVP-DT, UniMás – WFPA-CD, and Telemundo – WWSI-TV.[324]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city is the nation's fourth-largest consumer in media market, as ranked by the Nielsen Media Research firm, with nearly 2.9 million TV households.[325]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBroadcast television in the Delaware Valley region\n |\n| --- |\n| This region

Philadelphia\n\nSince at least the 1700s, hundreds of books and articles have been written about Philadelphia's history, culture, sports teams, crime, politics, and other themes related to the city's past, present, and future.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: 30th Street Station, List of Philadelphia subway stations, and Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's 30th Street Station serves both SEPTA regional and Amtrak national trains and is Amtrak's third-busiest train station in the nation.\n![](image)A Market–Frankford Line train departing 52nd Street station\nPhiladelphia is served by SEPTA, which operates buses, trains, rapid transit (as both subways and elevated trains), trolleys, and trackless trolleys (electric buses) throughout Philadelphia, the four Pennsylvania suburban counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery, in addition to service to Mercer County, New Jersey (Trenton) and New Castle County, Delaware (Wilmington and Newark, Delaware).[326] The city's subway system consists of two routes: the subway section of the Market–Frankford Line running east–west under Market Street which opened in 1905 to the west and 1908 to the east of City Hall,[327] and the Broad Street Line running north–south beneath Broad Street which opened in stages from 1928 to 1938.[328]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, large sections of the SEPTA Regional Rail service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia were discontinued due to a lack of funding for equipment and infrastructure maintenance.[329][330][331]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 30th Street Station is a major railroad station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor with 4.4 million passengers in 2017 making it the third-busiest station in the country after New York City's Pennsylvania Station and Washington's Union Station.[332] 30th Street Station offers access to Amtrak,[333] SEPTA,[334] and NJ Transit lines.[335] Over 12 million SEPTA and NJ Transit rail commuters use the station each year, and more than 100,000 people on an average weekday.[332]\n\n\nThe PATCO Speedline provides rapid transit service to Camden, Collingswood, Westmont, Haddonfield, Woodcrest (Cherry Hill), Ashland (Voorhees), and Lindenwold, New Jersey, from stations on Locust Street between 16th and 15th, 13th and 12th, and 10th and 9th Streets, and on Market Street at 8th Street.[336]\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Philadelphia International Airport, the busiest airport in Pennsylvania and 21st-busiest in the nation\nTwo airports serve Philadelphia: the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is 7 mi (11 km) south-southwest of Center City on the boundary with Delaware County, providing scheduled domestic and international air service,[337] while Northeast Philadelphia Airport (PNE) is a general aviation relief airport in Northeast Philadelphia serving general and corporate aviation.[338] Philadelphia International Airport is among the busiest airports in the world measured by traffic movements (i.e., takeoffs and landings).[339] More than 30 million passengers pass through the airport annually on 25 airlines, including all major domestic carriers. The airport has nearly 500 daily departures to more than 120 destinations worldwide.[337] SEPTA's Airport Regional Rail Line provides direct service between Center City railroad stations and Philadelphia International Airport.[340]\n\n\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 9,650 feet (2,940 m) long Benjamin Franklin Bridge spans the Delaware River, connecting Philadelphia and South Jersey\n![](image)The Schuylkill Expressway eastbound at I-676 and US 30, also known as the Vine Street Expressway, in Center City\nWilliam Penn planned Philadelphia with numbered streets traversing north and south, and streets named for trees, such as Chestnut, Walnut, and Mulberry (since renamed Arch Street), traversing east and west. The two main streets were named Broad Street (the north–south artery, since designated Pennsylvania Route 611) and High Street (the east–west artery, since renamed Market Street) converging at Centre Square which later became the site of City Hall.[341]\n\n\nInterstate 95 (the Delaware Expressway) traverses the southern and eastern edges of the city along the Delaware River as the main north–south controlled-access highway, connecting Philadelphia with Newark, New Jersey and New York City to the north and with Baltimore and Washington, D.C. southward. The city is also served by Interstate 76 (the Schuylkill Expressway), which runs along the Schuylkill River, intersecting the Pennsylvania Turnpike at King of Prussia and providing access to Harrisburg and points west. Interstate 676 (the Vine Street Expressway) links I-95 and I-76 through Center City by running below street level between the eastbound and westbound lanes of Vine Street. Entrance and exit ramps for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge are near the eastern end of the expressway, just west of the I-95 interchange.[342]\n\n\nThe Roosevelt Boulevard and Expressway (U.S. 1) connect Northeast Philadelphia with Center City via I-76 through Fairmount Park. Woodhaven Road (Route 63) and Cottman Avenue (Route 73) serve the neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia, running between I-95 and the Roosevelt Boulevard. The Fort Washington Expressway (Route 309) extends north from the city's northern border, serving Montgomery County and Bucks County. U.S. Route 30 (Lancaster Avenue) extends westward from West Philadelphia to Lancaster.[342]\n\n\nInterstate 476 (locally referred to as the Blue Route[343]) traverses Delaware County, bypassing the city to the west and serving the city's western suburbs, and provides a direct route to Allentown and points north, including the Poconos. Interstate 276, the Pennsylvania Turnpike's Delaware River extension, is a bypass and commuter route to the north of the city and a link to the New Jersey Turnpike and New York City.[342]\n\n\nThe Delaware River Port Authority operates four bridges in the Philadelphia area across the Delaware River to New Jersey: the Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), the Benjamin Franklin Bridge (I-676 and U.S. 30), the Betsy Ross Bridge (New Jersey Route 90), and the Commodore Barry Bridge (U.S. 322 in Delaware County, south of the city).[344] The Burlington County Bridge Commission maintains two bridges across the Delaware River: the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge which connects PA Route 73 in the Tacony section of Northeast Philadelphia with New Jersey Route 73 in Palmyra, Burlington County, and the Burlington–Bristol Bridge which connects NJ Route 413/U.S. Route 130 in Burlington, New Jersey with PA Route 413/U.S. 13 in Bristol Township, north of Philadelphia.[345]\n\n\n\n#### Bus service[edit]\n\n\nThe Greyhound terminal is at 1001 Filbert Street (at 10th Street) in Center City, southeast of the Pennsylvania Convention Center and south of Chinatown.[346] Several other bus operators provide service at the Greyhound terminal including Fullington Trailways,[347] Martz Trailways,[348] Peter Pan Bus Lines,[349] and NJ Transit buses.[350]\n\n\nOther intercity bus services include Megabus with stops at 30th Street Station and the visitor center for Independence Hall,[351] BoltBus (operated by Greyhound) at 30th Street Station,[352] OurBus at various stops in the city.\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of rail transport in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Suburban Station with art deco architecture at 16th Street and JFK Boulevard\nSince the early days of rail transportation in the United States, Philadelphia has served as a hub for several major rail companies, particularly the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad first operated Broad Street Station, then 30th Street Station and Suburban Station, and the Reading Railroad operated Reading Terminal, now part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area. The two systems now operate as a single system under the control of SEPTA, the regional transit authority. Additionally, the PATCO Speedline subway system and NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line operate successor services to southern New Jersey.[353]\n\n\nIn 1911, Philadelphia had nearly 4,000 electric trolleys running on 86 lines.[354] In 2005, SEPTA reintroduced trolley service to the Girard Avenue Line, Route 15.[355] SEPTA operates six subway-surface trolleys that run on street-level tracks in West Philadelphia and subway tunnels in Center City, along with two surface trolleys in adjacent suburbs.[356]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a regional hub of the federally-owned Amtrak system, with 30th Street Station being a primary stop on the Washington-Boston Northeast Corridor and the Keystone Corridor to Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. 30th Street also serves as a major station for services via the Pennsylvania Railroad's former Pennsylvania Main Line to Chicago. As of 2018[update], 30th Street is Amtrak's third-busiest station in the country, after New York City and Washington.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Walk Score ranks[edit]\n\n\nA 2017 study by Walk Score ranked Philadelphia the fifth-most walkable major city in the United States with a score of 79 out of 100, in the middle of the \"very walkable\" range. The city was just edged out by fourth place Miami (79.2), with the top three cities being New York, San Francisco, and Boston. Philadelphia placed fifth in the public transit friendly category, behind Washington, D.C., with the same three cities for walkability topping this category. The city ranked tenth in the bike friendly cities category, with the top three cities being Minneapolis, San Francisco and Portland.[357]\n\n\n*USA Today* readers voted the Schuylkill River Trail the best urban trail in the nation in 2015.[358]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n#### Water purity and availability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fairmount Water Works, Philadelphia's second municipal waterworks, in December 1984\nIn 1815, Philadelphia began sourcing its water via the Fairmount Water Works on the Schuylkill River, the nation's first major urban water supply system. In 1909, the Water Works was decommissioned as the city transitioned to modern sand filtration methods.[359] Today, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) provides drinking water, wastewater collection, and stormwater services for Philadelphia, as well as surrounding counties. PWD draws about 57 percent of its drinking water from the Delaware River and the balance from the Schuylkill River.[360] The city has two filtration plants on the Schuylkill River and one on the Delaware River. The three plants can treat up to 546 million gallons of water per day, while the total storage capacity of the combined plant and distribution system exceeds one billion gallons. The wastewater system consists of three water pollution control plants, 21 pumping stations, and about 3,657 miles (5,885 km) of sewers.[360]\n\n\n\n#### Electricity[edit]\n\n\nExelon subsidiary PECO Energy Company, founded as the Brush Electric Light Company of Philadelphia in 1881 and renamed Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) in 1902, provides electricity to about 1.6 million customers and more than 500,000 natural gas customers in the southeastern Pennsylvania area including the city of Philadelphia and most of its suburbs.[361] PECO is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state with 472 power substations and nearly 23,000 miles (37,000 km) of electric transmission and distribution lines, along with 12,000 miles (19,000 km) of natural gas transmission, distribution & service lines.[362]\n\n\n\n#### Natural gas[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Philadelphia Gas Works\n\nPhiladelphia Gas Works (PGW), overseen by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, is the nation's largest municipally-owned natural gas utility. PGW serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the Philadelphia area.[363] Founded in 1836, the company came under city ownership in 1987 and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits. In 2014, the City Council refused to conduct hearings on a $1.86 billion sale of PGW, part of a two-year effort that was proposed by the mayor. The refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer.[364][365]\n\n\n\n#### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Area codes 215, 267, and 445\n\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania was assigned the 215 area code in 1947 when the North American Numbering Plan of the Bell System went into effect. The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in half in 1994 when area code 610 was created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215. Overlay area code 267 was added to the 215 service area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas, area code 445 to 215 and area code 835 to 610, was delayed and later rescinded.[366] Area code 445 was implemented as an overlay for area codes 215 and 267 starting on February 3, 2018.[367]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Philadelphia\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Chinatown paifang at 10th and Arch Streets, a symbol of Philadelphia's sister city relationship with Tianjin\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Florence[368] | Italy\n | 1964\n |\n| Tel Aviv[369] | Israel\n | 1966\n |\n| Toruń[370] | Poland\n | 1976\n |\n| Tianjin[371] | China\n | 1979\n |\n| Incheon[372] | South Korea\n | 1984\n |\n| Douala[373] | Cameroon\n | 1986\n |\n| Nizhny Novgorod[374] | Russia\n | 1992\n |\n| Frankfurt[375] | Germany\n | 2015\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia also has three partnership cities or regions:[376]\n\n\n\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Kobe[377] | Japan\n | 1986\n |\n| Abruzzo[378] | Italy\n | 1997\n |\n| Aix-en-Provence[379] | France\n | 1999\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia has eight official sister cities as designated by the Citizen Diplomacy International of Philadelphia:[376] Philadelphia has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. The Sister Cities Park, a site of 0.5 acres (2,400 sq yd) at 18th and Benjamin Franklin Parkway within Logan Square, was dedicated in June 1976. The park was built to commemorate Philadelphia's first two sister city relationships, with Tel Aviv and Florence. The Toruń Triangle, honoring the sister city relationship with Toruń, Poland, was constructed in 1976, west of the United Way building at 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Sister Cities Park was redesigned and reopened in 2012, featuring an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's sister and partnership cities, a café and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, as well as a pavilion built to environmentally friendly standards.[380][381]\n\n\nThe Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans of Tianjin, stands astride 10th Street, on the north side of its intersection with Arch Street, as a symbol of the sister city relationship. The CDI of Philadelphia has participated in the U.S. Department of State's \"Partners for Peace\" project with Mosul, Iraq,[382] as well as accepting visiting delegations from dozens of other countries.[383]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n* ![](image)Philadelphia portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of Pennsylvania state historical markers in Philadelphia County\n* Metropolitan areas in the Americas\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n* USS *Philadelphia*, 6 ships\n* Alaşehir, ancient Philadelphia in Turkey\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Description of the Lenape peoples (Delaware nations) historic territories inside the divides of the frequently mountainous landforms flanking the Delaware River's drainage basin.

The February 2010 storms contributed to a single month record accumulation of 51.5 in (131 cm). If no snow fell outside of February that season, 2009–10 would still rank as 5th-snowiest. See the Franklin Institute for a visual representation of seasonal snowfall.\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Official temperature and precipitation measurements for Philadelphia were taken at the Weather Bureau Office in downtown from January 1872 to 19 June 1940, and at Philadelphia Int'l from 20 June 1940 to the present.[111] Snowfall and snow depth records date to 1 January 1884 and 1 October 1948, respectively.[105] In 2006, snowfall measurements were moved to National Park, New Jersey directly across the Delaware River from the airport.[112]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** From 15% sample\n6. **^** E.g., in the opening chapter of *The Handbook of Language Variation and Change* (ed.

It is one of the most historically significant cities in the United States and served as the nation's capital until 1800.[13] Philadelphia is the nation's sixth-most populous city with a population of 1,603,797 as of the 2020 census. Since 1854, the city has been coextensive with Philadelphia County, the most populous county in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia serves as the urban core of the larger Delaware Valley (or Philadelphia metropolitan area), the nation's seventh-largest and one of the world's largest metropolitan regions consisting of 6.245 million residents in the metropolitan statistical area and 7.366 million residents in its combined statistical area.[14] Philadelphia is known for its extensive contributions to American history, especially the American Revolution, and for its contemporary influence in business and industry, culture, sports, and music.[15][16]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was founded in 1682 by William Penn, an English Quaker and advocate of religious freedom. The city served as the capital of the Pennsylvania Colony during the British colonial era[5][17] and went on to play a historic and vital role as the central meeting place for the nation's founding fathers whose plans and actions in Philadelphia ultimately inspired the American Revolution and the nation's independence following the Revolutionary War. Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774, preserved the Liberty Bell, and hosted the Second Continental Congress during which the founders signed the Declaration of Independence, which historian Joseph Ellis has described as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history\".[18] Once the Revolutionary War commenced, the Battle of Germantown and the siege of Fort Mifflin were fought within Philadelphia's city limits. The U.S. Constitution was later ratified in Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until 1790, when it was surpassed by New York City, and it served as the nation's first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions during and following the American Revolution, including from 1790 to 1800 during the construction of the new national capital of Washington, D.C.\n\n\nWith 18 four-year universities and colleges, Philadelphia is one of the nation's leading centers for higher education and academic research.[19][20] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area was the state's largest and nation's ninth-largest metropolitan economy with a gross metropolitan product of US$444.1 billion. The city is home to five Fortune 500 corporate headquarters as of 2022.[21] As of 2023, metropolitan Philadelphia ranks among the top five U.S. venture capital centers, facilitated by its proximity to New York City's entrepreneurial and financial ecosystems.[22] The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, owned by Nasdaq since 2008, is the nation's oldest stock exchange and a global leader in options trading.[23] 30th Street Station, the city's primary rail station, is the third-busiest Amtrak hub in the nation, and the city's multimodal transport and logistics infrastructure, includes Philadelphia International Airport, and the rapidly-growing PhilaPort seaport.[24] A migration pattern has been established from New York City to Philadelphia by residents opting for a large city with relative proximity and a lower cost of living.[25][26]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a national cultural center, hosting more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other city in the nation.[27][28] Fairmount Park, when combined with adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the same watershed, is 2,052 acres (830 ha), representing one of the nation's largest and the world's 45th-largest urban park.[29] The city is known for its arts, culture, cuisine, and colonial and Revolution-era history; in 2016, it attracted 42 million domestic tourists who spent $6.8 billion, representing $11 billion in economic impact to the city and its surrounding Pennsylvania counties.[30]\n\n\nWith five professional sports teams and one of the nation's most loyal fan bases, Philadelphia is often ranked as the nation's best city for professional sports fans.[31][32][33][34] The city has a culturally and philanthropically active LGBTQ+ community. Philadelphia also has played an immensely influential historic and ongoing role in the development and evolution of American music, especially R&B, soul, and rock.[35][36]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a city of many firsts, including the nation's first library (1731),[37] hospital (1751),[37] medical school (1765),[38] national capital (1774),[39] university (by some accounts) (1779),[40] stock exchange (1790),[37] zoo (1874),[41] and business school (1881).[42] Philadelphia contains 67 National Historic Landmarks, including Independence Hall.[43][44][20] From the city's 17th century founding through the present, Philadelphia has been the birthplace or home to an extensive number of prominent and influential Americans. In 2021, *Time* magazine named Philadelphia one of the world's greatest 100 places.[45]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Philadelphia\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Philadelphia.\n\nSee also: List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia and National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n\n### Native peoples[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 17th century, the Philadelphia area was home to the Lenape (Delaware) Indians in the village of Shackamaxon. They were also called the Delaware Indians,[46] and their historical territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley.[a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts.[46] Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and conflict with Europeans. The Iroquois occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and the United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory to present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territories under the Indian removal policy.\n\n\n\n### Colonial[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Penn (holding paper) and King Charles II depicted in *The Birth of Pennsylvania*, an 1680 portrait by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris\n![A Portraiture of the City of Philadelphia, by Thomas Holme](image)A 1683 portrait of Philadelphia by Thomas Holme that is believed to be the city's first map\n![](image)William Penn's 1682 Treaty of Shackamaxon with the Lenape tribe depicted in *Penn's Treaty with the Indians*, a 1772 portrait by Benjamin West\nEuropeans came to the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century. The first settlements were founded by Dutch colonists, who built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River in 1623 in what is now Brooklawn, New Jersey. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New Netherland colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina, located in present-day Wilmington, Delaware, and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks in their war against Maryland colonists.[47] In 1648, the Dutch built Fort Beversreede on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill River near the present-day Eastwick section of Philadelphia, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building Fort Nya Korsholm, or New Korsholm, named after a town in Finland with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. An English fleet captured the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682, when the area was included in William Penn's charter for Pennsylvania.[48]\n\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape in an effort to establish good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for the colony.[49] Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown neighborhood.[5] Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for \"brotherly love\", derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος *phílos* (beloved, dear) and ἀδελφός *adelphós* (brother, brotherly). There were a number of cities named *Philadelphia* in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Greek and Roman periods, including modern Alaşehir, mentioned as the site of an early Christian congregation in the Book of Revelation. As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, which exceeded that of other colonies, led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city.[50]\n\n\nPenn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart with areas for gardens and orchards.\n\n\nThe city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, and instead crowded the present-day Port of Philadelphia on the Delaware River and subdivided and resold their lots.[51] Before Penn left Philadelphia for the final time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. Though poor at first, Philadelphia became an important trading center with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. Benjamin Franklin, a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones that were among the first in the nation, including a fire company, library, and hospital.\n\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life, including the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the Academy of Natural Sciences (1812), and the Franklin Institute (1824).[52] These societies developed and financed new industries that attracted skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n\n\n### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution and Philadelphia campaign\n\n![](image)The Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration of Independence in Independence Hall on June 28, 1776, depicted in an 1818 painting by John Trumbull; historian Joseph Ellis called the Declaration \"the most potent and consequential words in American history.\"[53]\n![](image)President's House on Market Street served as the presidential mansion for the nation's first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams, from 1790 to 1800 prior to the completion of the White House and the development of Washington, D.C. as the nation's new capital\n![](image)Independence Hall on Chestnut Street between 5th and 6th Streets, where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Constitution was ratified, on July 4, 1776, and June 21, 1788, respectively\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America's revolutionaries. By the 1750s, Philadelphia surpassed Boston as the largest city and busiest port in British America, and the second-largest city in the entire British Empire after London.[54][55] In 1774, as resentment of British colonial practices and support for independence was burgeoning in the colonies, Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress.\n\n\nFrom 1775 to 1781, Philadelphia hosted the Second Continental Congress,[56] which adopted the Declaration of Independence in what was then called the Pennsylvania State House and was later renamed Independence Hall. Historian Joseph Ellis, in 2007, described the Declaration of Independence, written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson, as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history,\"[18] and its adoption represented a declaration of war against the British Army, which was then the world's most powerful military force. Since the Declaration's July 4, 1776, adoption, its signing has been cited globally and repeatedly by various peoples of the world seeking independence and liberty. It also has been, since its adoption, the basis for annual celebration by Americans; in 1938, this celebration of the Declaration was formalized as Independence Day, one of only ten designated U.S. federal holidays.\n\n\nAfter George Washington's defeat at the Battle of Brandywine in Chadds Ford Township, on September 11, 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless and the city prepared for what was perceived to be an inevitable British attack. Because bells could easily be recast into munitions, the Liberty Bell, then known as the Pennsylvania State Bell, and bells from two Philadelphia churches, Christ Church and St. Peter's Church, were hastily taken down and transported by heavily guarded wagon train out of the city. The Liberty Bell was taken to Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, which is present-day Allentown, where it was hidden under the church's floor boards for nine months from September 1777 until the British Army's departure from Philadelphia in June 1778.[57] Two Revolutionary War battles, the Siege of Fort Mifflin, fought between September 26 and November 16, 1777, and the Battle of Germantown, fought on October 4, 1777, took place within Philadelphia's city limits.\n\n\nIn Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation on November 15, 1777, and the city later served as the meeting place for the Constitutional Convention, which ratified the Constitution in Independence Hall in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787.\n\n\nPhiladelphia served as capital of the United States for much of the colonial and early post-colonial periods, including for a decade, from 1790 to 1800, while Washington, D.C., was being constructed and prepared to serve as the new national capital.[58] In 1793, the largest yellow fever epidemic in U.S. history killed approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people in Philadelphia, or about ten percent of the city's population at the time.[59][60] The capital of the United States was moved to Washington, D.C. in 1800 upon completion of the White House and U.S. Capitol buildings.\n\n\nThe state capital was moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster in 1799, then ultimately to Harrisburg in 1812 Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until the late 18th century. It also was the nation's financial and cultural center until ultimately being eclipsed in total population by New York City in 1790. In 1816, the city's free Black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent Black denomination in the country, and the first Black Episcopal Church. The free Black community also established many schools for its children with the help of Quakers. Large-scale construction projects for new roads, canals, and railroads made Philadelphia the first major industrial city in the United States.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)Loan of the City of Philadelphia, issued March 7, 1866\n![](image)Opening day ceremonies at the Centennial Exposition at Memorial Hall in Fairmount Park in 1876, the first world fair held in the U.S. on the centennial anniversary of the nation's founding\nThroughout the 19th century, Philadelphia hosted a variety of industries and businesses; the largest was the textile industry. Major corporations in the 19th and early 20th centuries included the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad.[61] Established in 1870, the Philadelphia Conveyancers' Association was chartered by the state in 1871. Along with the U.S. Centennial in 1876, the city's industry was celebrated in the Centennial Exposition, the first official World's fair in the U.S.\n\n\nImmigrants, mostly from Ireland and Germany, settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. These immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street and later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic nativist riots erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the Act of Consolidation of 1854, which extended the city limits from the 2 square miles (5.2 km2) of Center City to the roughly 134 square miles (350 km2) of Philadelphia County.[62][63]\nIn the latter half of the 19th century and leading into the 20th century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy, and African Americans from the southern U.S. settled in the city.[64]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was represented by the Washington Grays in the American Civil War. The African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559 between 1880 and 1930.[65][66] Black newcomers in the 20th century were part of the Great Migration out of the rural south and into northern and midwestern industrial cities.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chestnut Street in Center City at night in February 2016\nBy the 20th century, Philadelphia had an entrenched Republican political machine and a complacent population.[67] In 1910, a general strike shut down the entire city.[68]\n\n\nIn 1917, following outrage over the election-year murder of a Philadelphia police officer, led to the shrinking of the City Council from two houses to just one.[69] In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot during Red Summer in post-World War I unrest as recent immigrants competed with Blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of Prohibition laws, organized crime, mob violence, and corrupt police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of Brig. Gen. Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as the city's director of public safety, but political pressure still prevented long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.[70]\n\n\nIn 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population.[71] In 1950, the population peaked at more than two million residents, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry that led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization enticed many affluent residents to depart the city for its outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The resulting reduction in Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government caused the city to struggle through a long period of adjustment, and it approached bankruptcy by the late 1980s.[72][73]\n\n\nIn 1985, the MOVE Bombing of the Cobbs Creek neighborhood by city helicopters occurred, killing 11 and destroying 61 homes.[74]\n\n\nRevitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century with much of the development occurring in the Center City and University City neighborhoods. But this expanded a shortage of affordable housing in the city. After many manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to market itself more aggressively as a tourist destination. Contemporary glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the 1980s. Historic areas such as Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s, making both areas among the most desirable Center City neighborhoods. Immigrants from around the world began to enter the U.S. through Philadelphia as their gateway, leading to a reversal of the city's population decline between 1950 and 2000, during which it lost about 25 percent of its residents.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia eventually began experiencing a growth in its population in 2007, which continued with gradual yearly increases through the present.[77][78]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's geographic center is about 40° 0′ 34″ north latitude and 75° 8′ 0″ west longitude. The 40th parallel north passes through neighborhoods in Northeast Philadelphia, North Philadelphia, and West Philadelphia including Fairmount Park. The city encompasses 142.71 square miles (369.62 km2), of which 134.18 square miles (347.52 km2) is land and 8.53 square miles (22.09 km2), or 6%, is water.[79] Natural bodies of water include the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, lakes in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park, and Cobbs, Wissahickon, and Pennypack creeks. The largest artificial body of water is East Park Reservoir in Fairmount Park.\n\n\nThe lowest point is sea level and the highest point is in Chestnut Hill about 446 feet (136 m) above sea level on Summit Street near the intersection of Germantown Avenue and Bethlehem Pike at: 40.07815 N, 75.20747 W.[80][81] Philadelphia is located on the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line that separates the Atlantic Plain from the Piedmont.[82] The Schuylkill River's rapids at East Falls were inundated by completion of the dam at Fairmount Water Works.[83]\n\n\nThe city is the seat of its own county. The city is bordered by six adjacent counties: Montgomery to the northwest; Bucks to the north and northeast; Burlington County, New Jersey to the east; Camden County, New Jersey to the southeast; Gloucester County, New Jersey to the south; and Delaware County to the southwest.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)\nThe skyline of Philadelphia seen from the northwest on the Spring Garden Street Bridge over the Schuylkill River in April 2018 (annotated version)\n\n![](image)\nPhiladelphia's skyline at twilight from the southwest on the South Street Bridge with the Schuylkill River on the left in July 2016 (annotated version)\n\n#### City planning[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia neighborhoods\n\nPhiladelphia was created in the 17th century following the plan by William Penn's surveyor Thomas Holme. Center City is structured with long, straight streets running nearly due east–west and north–south, forming a grid pattern between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers that is aligned with their courses. The original city plan was designed to allow for easy travel and to keep residences separated by open space that would help prevent the spread of fire.[84] In keeping with the idea of a \"Greene Countrie Towne\", and inspired by the many types of trees that grew in the region, Penn named many of the east–west streets for local trees.[85] Penn planned the creation of five public parks in the city which were renamed in 1824.[84] Centre Square was renamed Penn Square;[86] Northeast Square was renamed Franklin Square; Southeast Square was renamed Washington Square; Southwest Square was renamed Rittenhouse Square; and Northwest Square was renamed Logan Circle/Square.[87] Center City had an estimated 183,240 residents as of 2015[update], making it the second-most populated downtown area in the United States after Midtown Manhattan in New York City.[88]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's neighborhoods are divided into six large sections that surround Center City: North Philadelphia, Northeast Philadelphia, South Philadelphia, Southwest Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, and Northwest Philadelphia. The city's geographic boundaries have been largely unchanged since these neighborhoods were consolidated in 1854. However, each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that constituted Pennsylvania County before their inclusion within the city.[89]\n\n\nThe City Planning Commission, tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the *Philadelphia2035* physical development plan.[90][91] Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007 to 2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors John F. Street and Michael Nutter. The zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning maps to facilitate future community development, as the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs will be added by 2035.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, the PHA is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, serving about 81,000 people with affordable housing, while employing 1,400 on a budget of $371 million.[92] The Philadelphia Parking Authority is responsible for ensuring adequate parking for city residents, businesses, and visitors.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia City Hall at night in December 2012\n![](image)Two of Center City Philadelphia's most prominent high-rise buildings, One Liberty Place, built between 1985 and 1987 (in background), and Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901 (in foreground)\nPhiladelphia's architectural history dates back to colonial times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest structures were constructed with logs, but brick structures were common by 1700. During the 18th century, the cityscape was dominated by Georgian architecture, including Independence Hall and Christ Church.\n\n\nIn the first decades of the 19th century, Federal and Greek Revival architecture were the dominant styles produced by Philadelphia architects such as Benjamin Latrobe, William Strickland, John Haviland, John Notman, Thomas Walter, and Samuel Sloan.[94] Frank Furness is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century. His contemporaries included John McArthur Jr., Addison Hutton, Wilson Eyre, the Wilson Brothers, and Horace Trumbauer. In 1871, construction began on the Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall. The Philadelphia Historical Commission was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places, adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit.[95]\n\n\nIn 1932, Philadelphia became home to the first modern International Style skyscraper in the United States, the PSFS Building, designed by George Howe and William Lescaze. The 548 ft (167 m) City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when One Liberty Place was completed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the late 1980s. In 2007, the Comcast Center surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest building. The Comcast Technology Center was completed in 2018, reaching a height of 1,121 ft (342 m), as the tallest building in the United States outside of Manhattan and Chicago.[96]\n\n\nFor much of Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the row house. The row house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United States were known as \"Philadelphia rows\".[94] A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Federal-style continuous blocks in Old City and Society Hill to Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia to twin row houses in West Philadelphia. While newer homes have been built recently, much of the housing dates to the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, which has created problems such as urban decay and vacant lots. Some neighborhoods, including Northern Liberties and Society Hill, have been rehabilitated through gentrification.[97][98]\n\n\n\n* ![Elfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]](image)\n\nElfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]\n* ![Carpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style](image)\n\nCarpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style\n* ![The Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture](image)\n\nThe Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture\n* ![Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street](image)\n\nSecond Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street\n* ![The Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933](image)\n\nThe Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933\n\n\n#### Parks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Drinking fountains in Philadelphia, Fairmount Park, and List of parks in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's Fairmount Park on the Schuylkill River, the city's largest and one of the world's largest public parks\nAs of 2014[update], the city's total park space, including municipal, state, and federal parks in the city, amounts to 11,211 acres (17.5 sq mi).[29] Philadelphia's largest park is Fairmount Park, which includes the Philadelphia Zoo and encompasses 2,052 acres (3.2 sq mi) of the total parkland. Fairmount Park's adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park contains 2,042 acres (3.2 sq mi).[100] Fairmount Park, when combined with Wissahickon Valley Park, is one of the largest contiguous urban park areas in the U.S.[29] The two parks, along with the Colonial Revival, Georgian and Federal-style mansions in them, have been listed as one entity on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972.[101]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3.1\n\n\n\n41\n\n26\n | 2.8\n\n\n\n44\n\n28\n | 4\n\n\n\n53\n\n34\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n65\n\n44\n | 3.3\n\n\n\n74\n\n54\n | 4\n\n\n\n83\n\n64\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n88\n\n70\n | 4.3\n\n\n\n86\n\n68\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n79\n\n61\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n67\n\n49\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n56\n\n39\n | 4\n\n\n\n46\n\n31\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 80\n\n\n\n5\n\n−3\n | 70\n\n\n\n7\n\n−3\n | 101\n\n\n\n12\n\n1\n | 88\n\n\n\n18\n\n7\n | 85\n\n\n\n24\n\n12\n | 103\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 111\n\n\n\n31\n\n21\n | 109\n\n\n\n30\n\n20\n | 112\n\n\n\n26\n\n16\n | 88\n\n\n\n20\n\n10\n | 74\n\n\n\n13\n\n4\n | 101\n\n\n\n8\n\n0\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification, Philadelphia falls under the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen *Cfa*),[102] whereas according to the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (*Do*) limited to the north by the continental climate (*Dc*).[103] Summers are typically hot and muggy, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is moderately cold. The plant life hardiness zones are 7a and 7b, representing an average annual extreme minimum temperature between 0 and 10 °F (−18 and −12 °C).[104]\n\n\nSnowfall is highly variable, with some winters experiencing only light snow, while others include major snowstorms. The normal seasonal snowfall averages 22.4 in (57 cm), with rare snowfalls in November or April, and rarely any sustained snow cover.[105] Seasonal snowfall accumulation has ranged from trace amounts in 1972–73 to 78.7 inches (200 cm) in the winter of 2009–10.[105][b] The city's heaviest single-storm snowfall was 30.7 in (78 cm) which occurred in January 1996.[106]\n\n\nPrecipitation is generally spread throughout the year, with eight to eleven wet days per month,[107] at an average annual rate of 44.1 inches (1,120 mm), but historically ranging from 29.31 in (744 mm) in 1922 to 64.33 in (1,634 mm) in 2011.[105] The most rain recorded in one day occurred on July 28, 2013, when 8.02 in (204 mm) fell at Philadelphia International Airport.[105] Philadelphia has a moderately sunny climate with an average of 2,498 hours of sunshine annually, and a percentage of sunshine ranging from 47% in December to 61% in June, July, and August.[108]\n\n\nThe January daily average temperature is 33.7 °F (0.9 °C), though the temperature frequently rises to 50 °F (10 °C) during thaws. July averages 78.7 °F (25.9 °C), although heat waves accompanied by high humidity and heat indices are frequent, with highs reaching or exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) on 30 days of the year. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 6 thru April 2,[105] allowing a growing season of 217 days. Early fall and late winter are generally dry with February having the lowest average precipitation at 2.75 inches (70 mm).

Many smaller CSAs were also ranked higher for ozone including Sacramento (8th), Las Vegas (10th), Denver (11th), El Paso (16th), and Salt Lake City (20th); however, only two of those same ten CSAs—San Jose and Los Angeles—were ranked higher than Philadelphia for both year-round and short-term particle pollution.[117]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Chinese in Philadelphia; History of Irish Americans in Philadelphia; History of Italian Americans in Philadelphia; Koreans in Philadelphia; Little Saigon, Philadelphia; History of Jews in Philadelphia; LGBT culture in Philadelphia; and Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1683 | 600 | —     |\n| 1731 | 12,000 | +1900.0% |\n| 1790 | 28,522 | +137.7% |\n| 1800 | 41,220 | +44.5% |\n| 1810 | 53,722 | +30.3% |\n| 1820 | 63,802 | +18.8% |\n| 1830 | 80,462 | +26.1% |\n| 1840 | 93,665 | +16.4% |\n| 1850 | 121,376 | +29.6% |\n| 1860 | 565,529 | +365.9% |\n| 1870 | 674,022 | +19.2% |\n| 1880 | 847,170 | +25.7% |\n| 1890 | 1,046,964 | +23.6% |\n| 1900 | 1,293,697 | +23.6% |\n| 1910 | 1,549,008 | +19.7% |\n| 1920 | 1,823,779 | +17.7% |\n| 1930 | 1,950,961 | +7.0% |\n| 1940 | 1,931,334 | −1.0% |\n| 1950 | 2,071,605 | +7.3% |\n| 1960 | 2,002,512 | −3.3% |\n| 1970 | 1,948,609 | −2.7% |\n| 1980 | 1,688,210 | −13.4% |\n| 1990 | 1,585,577 | −6.1% |\n| 2000 | 1,517,550 | −4.3% |\n| 2010 | 1,526,006 | +0.6% |\n| 2020 | 1,603,797 | +5.1% |\n| 2022 | 1,567,258 | −2.3% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[118]2010–2020[12]Source: U.S. Decennial Census[119] |\n\n\nAccording to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau's tabulation, there were 1,603,797 people residing in Philadelphia, representing a 1.2% increase from the 2019 census estimate.[78] The racial composition of the city was 39.3% Black alone (42.0% Black alone or in combination), 36.3% White alone (41.9% White alone or in combination), 8.7% Asian alone, 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 8.7% some other race, and 6.9% multiracial. 14.9% of residents were Hispanic or Latino. 34.8% had a bachelor's degree or higher. 23.9% spoke a language other than English at home, the most common of which was Spanish (10.8%). 15.0% of the populations foreign born, roughly half of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens. 3.7% of the population are veterans. The median household income was $52,889 and 22.8% of the population lived in poverty. 49.5% of the population drove alone to work, while 23.2% used public transit, 8.2% carpooled, 7.9% walked, and 7.0% worked from home. The average commute is 31 minutes.[120]\n\n\nAfter the 1950 census, when a record high of 2,071,605 was recorded, the city's population began a long decline. The population dropped to a low of 1,488,710 residents in 2006 before beginning to rise again. Between 2006 and 2017, Philadelphia added 92,153 residents. In 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the racial composition of the city was 41.3% Black (non-Hispanic), 34.9% White (non-Hispanic), 14.1% Hispanic or Latino, 7.1% Asian, 0.4% Native American, 0.05% Pacific Islander, and 2.8% multiracial.[121]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Census racial composition | 2020[120] | 2010[122] | 2000 | 1990[123] | 1980[123] | 1970[123] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Black or African American (non-Hispanic) | 38.3% | 42.2% | 42.6% | 39.3% | 37.5% | 33.3%[e] |\n| White (non-Hispanic) | 34.3% | 36.9% | 42.5% | 52.1% | 57.1% | 63.8[e] |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race) | 14.9% | 12.3% | 8.5% | 5.6% | 3.8% | 2.4%[e] |\n| Asian | 8.3% | 6.3% | 4.5% | 2.7% | 1.1% | 0.3%\n |\n| Pacific Islanders | 0.1% | <0.1% | <0.1% | <0.1%\n |\n| Native Americans | 0.4% | 0.5% | 0.3% | 0.2% | 0.1% | 0.1%\n |\n| Two or more races | 6.9% | 2.8% | 2.2% | n/a[124] | n/a | n/a\n |\n\n\n![](image)Ethnic origins in Philadelphia\n### Immigration and cultural diversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's famed Italian Market in South Philadelphia\n![](image)A Gayborhood street sign near Washington Square\nIn addition to the city's economic growth, the city's population has been fueled by foreign immigration. According to The Pew Charitable Trusts, the city's foreign-born population increased by 69% between 2000 and 2016 to constitute nearly 20% of Philadelphia's workforce,[125] and it doubled between 1990 and 2017 to constitute 13.8% of the city's total population, with the top five countries of origin being China by a significant margin followed by the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, India, and Vietnam.[126]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 countries of origin for foreign-born Philadelphians, 2017[127]\n| Country | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) China | 22,140\n |\n| ![](image) Dominican Republic | 13,792\n |\n| ![](image) Jamaica | 13,500\n |\n| ![](image) India | 11,382\n |\n| ![](image) Vietnam | 10,132\n |\n| ![](image) Haiti | 9,186\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 7,823\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 6,898\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 5,258\n |\n| ![](image) South Korea/![](image) North Korea | 4,385\n |\n\n\nIrish, Italian, German, Polish, English, Russian, Ukrainian, and French ancestries constitute the largest European ethnic groups in the city.[128] Philadelphia has the second-largest Irish and Italian populations in the United States after New York City. South Philadelphia remains one of the largest Italian neighborhoods in the country and is home to the Italian Market.\n\n\nThe Pennsport neighborhood and Gray's Ferry section of South Philadelphia, home to many Mummer clubs, are well known as Irish neighborhoods. The Kensington, Port Richmond, and Fishtown neighborhoods have historically been heavily Irish and Polish. Port Richmond is a center for the Polish-American community in Philadelphia, and it remains a common destination for Polish immigrants. Northeast Philadelphia, although known for its Irish and Irish-American population, is home to a Jewish and Russian population. Mount Airy in Northwest Philadelphia also contains a Jewish community. Nearby Chestnut Hill is historically known as an Anglo-Saxon Protestant community.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Black American population is the fourth-largest in the country after New York City, Chicago, and Houston. West Philadelphia and North Philadelphia are largely African-American neighborhoods, but many are leaving those areas in favor of the Northeast and Southwest sections of Philadelphia. A higher proportion of African-American Muslims reside in Philadelphia than most other major U.S. cities. West Philadelphia and Southwest Philadelphia are home to various Afro-Caribbean and African immigrant communities.[129]\n\n\nThe Puerto Rican population in Philadelphia is the second-largest on the U.S. mainland after New York City, and the second-fastest growing after Orlando.[130] Eastern North Philadelphia, particularly Fairhill and surrounding areas to the north and east, has one of the highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans outside Puerto Rico, with many large swaths of blocks being close to 100% Puerto Rican.[131][132] Puerto Rican and Dominican populations reside in North Philadelphia and the Northeast, and Mexican and Central American populations exist in South Philadelphia.[133] South American migrants were being transported by bus from Texas to Philadelphia beginning in 2022.[134]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Asian American population includes those of Chinese, Indians, Vietnamese, South Koreans, and Filipinos. Over 35,000 Chinese Americans lived in the city in 2015,[135] including a Fuzhounese population. Center City hosts a Chinatown that is served by Chinatown bus lines with service to/from Chinatown, Manhattan.[136] A Korean community initially settled in the North Philadelphia neighborhood of Olney; however, the primary Koreatown has subsequently shifted further north, straddling the city's border with adjacent Cheltenham in Montgomery County and Cherry Hill in South Jersey. South Philadelphia is home to Vietnamese-Americans in Little Saigon, as well as Cambodian Americans, Thai Americans, and Chinese communities.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Gay village near Washington Square is home to a concentration of gay and lesbian-friendly businesses, restaurants, and bars.[137][138]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Philadelphia\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 68% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christian.[139] Approximately 41% of Christians in the city and area professed attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, while 26% professed Catholic beliefs.\n\n\nThe Protestant Christian community in Philadelphia is dominated by mainline Protestant denominations including the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church in the United States, Presbyterian Church (USA) and American Baptist Churches USA. One of the most prominent mainline Protestant jurisdictions is the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in Philadelphia. Historically, the city has strong connections to the Quakers, Unitarian Universalism, and the Ethical Culture movement, all of which continue to be represented in the city. The Quaker Friends General Conference is based in Philadelphia. Evangelical Protestants making up less than 15% of the population were also prevalent. Evangelical Protestant bodies included the Anglican Church in North America, Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, Presbyterian Church in America, and National Baptist Convention of America.\nThe Catholic community is primarily served by the Latin Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia, and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Eparchy of the United States of America and Canada, though some independent Catholic churches exist throughout Philadelphia and its suburbs. The Latin Church-based jurisdiction is headquartered in the city, and its see is the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. The Ukrainian Catholic jurisdiction is also headquartered in Philadelphia, and is seated at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.\n\n\nLess than 1% of Philadelphia's Christians were Mormons. The remainder of the Christian demographic is spread among smaller Protestant denominations and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox among others. The Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania (Orthodox Church in America) and Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (Ecumenical Patriarchate) divide the Eastern Orthodox in Philadelphia. The Russian Orthodox St. Andrew's Cathedral is in the city.\nThe same study says that other religions collectively compose about 8% of the population, including Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, and Sikhism.[140] Philadelphia has the fifth-largest Muslim population among U.S. cities.[141] The remaining 24% claimed no religious affiliation.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metropolitan area's Jewish population was estimated at 206,000 in 2001, which was the sixth-largest in the U.S. at that time.[142] Jewish traders were operating in southeastern Pennsylvania long before William Penn. Furthermore, Jews in Philadelphia took a prominent part in the War of Independence. Although the majority of the early Jewish residents were of Portuguese or Spanish descent, some among them had emigrated from Germany and Poland. About the beginning of the 19th century, a number of Jews from the latter countries, finding the services of the Congregation Mickvé Israel unfamiliar to them, resolved to form a new congregation which would use the ritual to which they had been accustomed.\n\n\nAfrican diasporic religions are practiced in some Latino and Hispanic and Caribbean communities in North and West Philadelphia.[143][144]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], 79.12% (1,112,441) of Philadelphia residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 9.72% (136,688) spoke Spanish, 1.64% (23,075) Chinese, 0.89% (12,499) Vietnamese, 0.77% (10,885) Russian, 0.66% (9,240) French, 0.61% (8,639) other Asian languages, 0.58% (8,217) African languages, 0.56% (7,933) Cambodian (Mon-Khmer), and Italian was spoken as a main language by 0.55% (7,773) of the population over the age of five. In total, 20.88% (293,544) of Philadelphia's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[145]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Philadelphia\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Top publicly traded companiesheadquartered in Philadelphia** |\n| **Corporation** | **2019****rank** | **Revenue****(billions)** |\n| Comcast | 32 | 94.5\n |\n| Aramark | 198 | 15.8\n |\n| FMC | 556 | 4.7\n |\n| Urban Outfitters | 634 | 4.0\n |\n| Carpenter Technology | 940 | 2.2\n |\n| **Source:** *Fortune*[146] |\n\n\nPhiladelphia's close geographical and transportation connections to other large metropolitan economies along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States have been cited as offering a significant competitive advantage for business creation and entrepreneurship.[147] The city is the center of economic activity in both Pennsylvania and the four-state Delaware Valley metropolitan region. Five Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the city. As of 2021[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of US$479 billion,[148] an increase from the $445 billion calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis for 2017,[149] representing the ninth-largest U.S. metropolitan economy.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's economic sectors include financial services, health care, biotechnology, information technology, trade and transportation, manufacturing, oil refining, food processing, and tourism. Metropolitan Philadelphia is one of the top five American venture capital hubs, credited to its proximity to New York City's financial and tech and biotechnology ecosystems.[22] Financial activities account for the largest economic sector of the metropolitan area, which is also one of the largest health education and research centers in the United States. The city's two largest employers are the federal and city governments.

The city's major art museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, is one of the largest art museums in the world. The long flight of steps to the Art Museum's main entrance became famous after the film *Rocky* (1976).[176]\n\n\nAreas such as South Street and Old City have a vibrant night life. The Avenue of the Arts in Center City contains many restaurants and theaters, such as the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Academy of Music, home of Opera Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Ballet.[176] The Wilma Theatre and the Philadelphia Theatre Company at the Suzanne Roberts Theatre produce a variety of new plays.[177][178] Several blocks to the east are the Lantern Theater Company at St. Stephens Episcopal Church;[179] and the Walnut Street Theatre, a National Historic Landmark stated to be the oldest and most subscribed-to theatre in the English-speaking world, founded in 1809.[180] In May 2019, the Walnut Street Theatre announced a major expansion to begin in 2020.[181] New Freedom Theatre, which is Pennsylvania's oldest African-American theatre, sits on North Broad Street.\n\n\nPhiladelphia has more public art than any other American city.[182] In 1872, the Association for Public Art (formerly the Fairmount Park Art Association) was created as the first private association in the United States dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning.[183] In 1959, lobbying by the Artists Equity Association helped create the Percent for Art ordinance, the first for a U.S. city.[184] The program, which has funded more than 200 pieces of public art, is administered by the Philadelphia Office of Arts and Culture, the city's art agency.[185] The city also has more murals than any other American city, due to the 1984 creation of the Department of Recreation's Mural Arts Program, which seeks to beautify neighborhoods and provide an outlet for graffiti artists. The program has funded more than 2,800 murals by professional, staff and volunteer artists and educated more than 20,000 youth in underserved neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia.[186]\n\n\nThe city is home to a number of art organizations including the regional art advocacy nonprofit Philadelphia Tri-State Artists Equity,[187] the Philadelphia Sketch Club, one of the country's oldest artists' clubs,[188] and The Plastic Club, started by women excluded from the Sketch Club.[189] Many Old City art galleries stay open late on the First Friday event of each month.[190] Annual events include the Philadelphia Film Festival, held annually each October, the 6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade, the nation's longest-running continuously held Thanksgiving Day parade, and the Mummers Parade, the nation's longest continuously held folk parade, which is held every New Year's Day.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Philadelphia\n\n![](image)The Curtis Institute of Music at 1726 Locust Street in Center City, one of the world's premier conservatories\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra is generally considered one of the top five orchestras in the United States. The orchestra performs at the Kimmel Center[191] and has a summer concert series at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts.[192] Opera Philadelphia performs at the nation's oldest continually operating opera house—the Academy of Music.[176] The Philadelphia Boys Choir & Chorale has performed its music all over the world.[193] The Philly Pops plays orchestral versions of popular jazz, swing, Broadway, and blues songs at the Kimmel Center and other venues within the mid-Atlantic region.[194] The Curtis Institute of Music is one of the world's premier conservatories and among the most selective institutes of higher education in the nation.[195]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has played a prominent role in the music of the United States. The culture of American popular music has been influenced by significant contributions of Philadelphia area musicians and producers, in both the recording and broadcasting industries. In 1952, the teen dance party program called *Bandstand* premiered on local television, hosted by Bob Horn. The show was renamed *American Bandstand* in 1957, when it began national syndication on ABC, hosted by Dick Clark and produced in Philadelphia until 1964 when it moved to Los Angeles.[196] Promoters marketed youthful musical artists known as teen idols to appeal to the young audience. Philadelphia-born singers such as Frankie Avalon, James Darren, Eddie Fisher, Fabian Forte, and Bobby Rydell, along with South Philly-raised Chubby Checker, topped the music charts, establishing a clean-cut rock and roll image.\n\n\nPhilly soul music of the late 1960s–1970s is a highly produced version of soul music which led to later forms of popular music such as disco and urban contemporary rhythm and blues.[197] On July 13, 1985, John F. Kennedy Stadium was the American venue for the Live Aid concert.[198] The city also hosted the Live 8 concert, which attracted about 700,000 people to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway on July 2, 2005.[199]\n\n\nNotable rock and pop musicians from Philadelphia and its suburbs include Bill Haley & His Comets, Nazz, Todd Rundgren, Hall & Oates, the Hooters, Cinderella, DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Ween, Schoolly D, Pink, the Roots, Beanie Sigel, State Property, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, Meek Mill, Lil Uzi Vert, and others.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Pat's Steaks (foreground) and Geno's Steaks (background) in South Philadelphia\nThe city is known for its hoagies, stromboli, roast pork sandwich, scrapple, soft pretzels, water ice, Irish potato candy, tastykakes, and the cheesesteak sandwich which was developed by Italian immigrants.[200] The Philadelphia area has many establishments that serve cheesesteaks, including restaurants, taverns, delicatessens and pizza parlors.[201][202][203] The originator of the thinly-sliced steak sandwich in the 1930s, initially without cheese, is Pat's King of Steaks, which faces its rival Geno's Steaks, founded in 1966,[204] across the intersection of 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue in the Italian Market of South Philadelphia.[205]\n\n\nMcGillin's Olde Ale House, opened in 1860 on Drury Street in Center City, is the oldest continuously operated tavern in the city.[206] The City Tavern is a replica of a historic 18th-century building first opened in 1773, demolished in 1854 after a fire, and rebuilt in 1975 on the same site as part of Independence National Historical Park.[207] The tavern offers authentic 18th-century recipes, served in seven period dining rooms, three wine cellar rooms and an outdoor garden.[208]\n\n\nThe Reading Terminal Market is a historic food market founded in 1893 in the Reading Terminal building, a designated National Historic Landmark.

Additionally, it shares many similarities with the New York accent. Owing to over a century of linguistic data collected by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania under sociolinguist William Labov, the Philadelphia dialect has been one of the best-studied forms of American English.[211][212][f] The accent is especially found within the Irish American and Italian American working-class neighborhoods.[213] Philadelphia also has its own unique collection of neologisms and slang terms.[214]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Philadelphia 76ers, Philadelphia Flyers, Philadelphia Eagles, Philadelphia Phillies, and Philadelphia Union\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nCitizens Bank Park, home of the Phillies since 2004, and Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Eagles since 2003\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Eagles are presented with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018\n![](image)Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia, home of the two-time Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and three-time champion Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA)\n![](image)Historic Boathouse Row at night on the Schuylkill River, a symbol of the city's rich rowing history\nPhiladelphia's first professional sports team was baseball's Athletics, organized in 1860.[215] The Athletics were initially an amateur league team that turned professional in 1871, and then became a founding team of the current National League in 1876.[216] The city is one of 13 U.S. cities to have teams in all four major league sports: the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB), the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL), the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL), and the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[217] The Phillies, formed in 1883 as the Quakers and renamed in 1884,[218] are the oldest team continuously playing under the same name in the same city in the history of American professional sports.[219]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metro area is also home to the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer (MLS). The Union began playing their home games in 2010 at PPL Park, a soccer-specific stadium in Chester, Pennsylvania.[220] The stadium's name was changed to Talen Energy Stadium in 2016[221] and to Subaru Park in 2020.[222]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the second of eight American cities to have won titles in all four major leagues (MLB, NFL, NHL and NBA), and also has a title in soccer from the now-defunct North American Soccer League in the 1970s. The city's professional teams and their fans endured 25 years without a championship, from the 76ers 1983 NBA Finals win[223] until the Phillies 2008 World Series win.[224][225] The lack of championships was sometimes attributed in jest to the Curse of Billy Penn after One Liberty Place became the first building to surpass the height of the William Penn statue on top of City Hall's tower in 1987.[226] After nine years passed without another championship, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl following the 2017 season.[227] In 2004, ESPN placed Philadelphia second on its list of The Fifteen Most Tortured Sports Cities.[228][229] Fans of the Eagles and Phillies were singled out as the worst fans in the country by *GQ* magazine in 2011, which used the subtitle of \"Meanest Fans in America\" to summarize incidents of drunken behavior and a history of booing.[230][231]\n\n\nMajor professional sports teams that originated in Philadelphia but later moved to other cities include the Golden State Warriors basketball team, which played in Philadelphia from 1946 to 1962[232] and the Oakland Athletics baseball team, which was originally the Philadelphia Athletics and played in Philadelphia from 1901 to 1954.[233]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to professional, semi-professional, and elite amateur teams in cricket, rugby league (Philadelphia Fight), and rugby union. Major running events in the city include the Penn Relays (track and field), the Philadelphia Marathon, and the Broad Street Run. The Collegiate Rugby Championship is played every June at Talen Energy Stadium in Chester.[234]\n\n\nRowing has been popular in Philadelphia since the 18th century.[235] Boathouse Row is a symbol of Philadelphia's rich rowing history, and each Big Five member has its own boathouse.[236] Philadelphia hosts numerous local and collegiate rowing clubs and competitions, including the annual Dad Vail Regatta, which is the largest intercollegiate rowing event in North America with more than 100 U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities participating;[237] the annual Stotesbury Cup Regatta, which is billed as the world's oldest and largest rowing event for high school students;[238][239] and the Head of the Schuylkill Regatta.[240] The regattas are held on the Schuylkill River and organized by the Schuylkill Navy, an association of area rowing clubs that has produced numerous Olympic rowers.[241]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Spinners were a professional ultimate team in Major League Ultimate (MLU) until 2016. The Spinners were one of the original eight teams of the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) that began in 2012. They played at Franklin Field and won the inaugural AUDL championship and the final MLU championship in 2016.[242] The MLU was suspended indefinitely by its investors in December 2016.[243] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia Phoenix continue to play in the AUDL.[244]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to the Philadelphia Big 5, a group of five NCAA Division I college basketball programs. The Big 5 include La Salle, Penn, Saint Joseph's, Temple, and Villanova universities.[245] The sixth NCAA Division I school in Philadelphia is Drexel University. Villanova won the 1985,[246] 2016,[247] and 2018[248] championship of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

All county functions were assumed by the city in 1952.[252] The city has been coterminous with the county since 1854.[63]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 1952 Home Rule Charter was written by the City Charter Commission, which was created by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in an act of April 21, 1949, and a city ordinance of June 15, 1949. The existing city council received a proposed draft on February 14, 1951, and the electors approved it in an election held April 17, 1951.[253] The first elections under the new Home Rule Charter were held in November 1951, and the newly elected officials took office in January 1952.[252]\n\n\nThe city uses the strong-mayor version of the mayor–council form of government, which is led by one mayor in whom executive authority is vested. The mayor has the authority to appoint and dismiss members of all boards and commissions without the approval of the city council. Elected at-large, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms, but can run for the position again after an intervening term.[253]\n\n\n\n### Courts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District Attorney of Philadelphia, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia County is coterminous with the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas is the trial court of general jurisdiction for the city, hearing felony-level criminal cases and civil suits above the minimum jurisdictional limit of $10,000. The court also has appellate jurisdiction over rulings from the Municipal and Traffic Courts, and some administrative agencies and boards. The trial division has 70 commissioned judges elected by the voters, along with about one thousand other employees.[254] The court also has a family division with 25 judges[255] and an orphans' court with three judges.[256]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city's District Attorney is Larry Krasner, a Democrat.[257] The last Republican to hold the office is Ronald D. Castille, who left in 1991 and later served as the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court from 2008 to 2014.[258]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Municipal Court handles traffic cases, misdemeanor and felony criminal cases with maximum incarceration of five years, and civil cases involving $12,000 or less ($15,000 in real estate and school tax cases), and all landlord-tenant disputes. The municipal court has 27 judges elected by the voters.[259]\n\n\nPennsylvania's three appellate courts also have sittings in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the court of last resort in the state, regularly hears arguments in Philadelphia City Hall.[260] The Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania also sit in Philadelphia several times a year.[261][262] Judges for these courts are elected at large.[263] The state Supreme Court and Superior Court have deputy prothonotary offices in Philadelphia.[264][265]\n\n\nAdditionally, Philadelphia is home to the federal United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, both of which are housed in the James A.

Roosevelt in his landslide victory of 1932 as Pennsylvania was one of only six states won by Republican Herbert Hoover. Voter turnout surged from 600,000 in 1932 to nearly 900,000 in 1936 and Roosevelt carried Philadelphia with over 60% of the vote. The city has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1936. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama drew 83% of the city's vote. Obama's win was even greater in 2012, capturing 85% of the vote. In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton won 82% of the vote.[273]\n\n\nAs a result of the previously declining population in the city and state,[277] Philadelphia has only three congressional districts of the 18 districts in Pennsylvania, based on the 2010 census apportionment:[278] the 2nd district, represented by Brendan Boyle; the 3rd, represented by Dwight Evans; and the 5th, represented by Mary Gay Scanlon.[279] All three representatives are Democrats though Republicans still have some support in the city, primarily in the Northeast.[280] Sam Katz ran competitive mayoral races as the Republican nominee in 1999 and 2003, losing to Democrat John Street both times.[281][282]\n\n\nPennsylvania's longest-serving Senator, Arlen Specter,[283] was an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania who opened his first law practice in Philadelphia.[284] Specter served as a Republican from 1981 and as a Democrat from 2009, losing that party's primary in 2010 and leaving office in January 2011.[285] He had also been assistant counsel on the Warren Commission in 1964 and the city's district attorney from 1966 to 1974.[284]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has hosted various national conventions, including in 1848 (Whig), 1856 (Republican), 1872 (Republican), 1900 (Republican), 1936 (Democratic), 1940 (Republican), 1948 (Republican), 1948 (Progressive), 2000 (Republican), and 2016 (Democratic).[286] Philadelphia has been home to one vice president, George M. Dallas,[287] and one general of the American Civil War, George B. McClellan, who won his party's nomination for president but lost in the general election to Abraham Lincoln in 1864.[288] In May 2019, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden chose Philadelphia to be his 2020 U.S. presidential campaign headquarters.[289]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\n\"Green Cities, Clean Water\" is an environmental policy initiative based in Philadelphia that has shown promising results in mitigating the effects of climate change.[290] The researchers on the policy have stated that despite such promising plans of green infrastructure building, \"the city is forecasted to grow warmer, wetter, and more urbanized over the century, runoff and local temperatures will increase on average throughout the city\".[290] Even though landcover predictive models on the effects of the policy initiative have indicated that green infrastructure could be useful at decreasing the amount of runoff in the city over time, the city government would have to expand its current plans and \"consider the cobenefit of climate change adaptation when planning new projects'' in limiting the scope of city-wide temperature increase.[290]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crime in Philadelphia and Philadelphia crime family\n\n#### Police and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Police Department\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Police Department administration building, known as the Roundhouse, in Center City east of Chinatown\n![](image)A Philadelphia police cruiser on Benjamin Franklin Parkway\nAccording to a 2015 report by Pew Charitable Trusts, the police districts with the highest rates of violent crime were Frankford (15th district) and Kensington (24th district) in the Near Northeast, and districts to the North (22nd, 25th, and 35th districts), West (19th district) and Southwest (12th district) of Center City. Each of those seven districts recorded more than a thousand violent crimes in 2014. The lowest rates of violent crime occurred in Center City, South Philadelphia, the Far Northeast, and Roxborough districts, the latter of which includes Manayunk.[150]\n\n\nPhiladelphia had 500 (503 according to some sources) murders in 1990, a rate of 31.5 per 100,000. An average of about 400 murders occurred each year for most of the 1990s. The murder count dropped in 2002 to 288, then rose to 406 by 2006, before dropping slightly to 392 in 2007.[291][292] A few years later, Philadelphia began to see a rapid decline in homicides and violent crime. In 2013, the city had 246 murders, which is a decrease of nearly 40% since 2006.[293] In 2014, 248 homicides were committed. The homicide rate rose to 280 in 2015, then fell slightly to 277 in 2016, before rising again to 317 in 2017.[294] Homicides increased dramatically in the late 2010s/early 2020s, reaching 499 homicides in 2020[291] and surpassing the 1990 \"record\" in 2021, with 501st murder on November 27 and 510 by the end of the month.[295]\n\n\nIn 2006, Philadelphia's homicide rate of 27.7 per 100,000 people was the highest of the country's 10 most populous cities.[296] In 2012, Philadelphia had the fourth-highest homicide rate among the country's most populous cities. The rate dropped to 16 homicides per 100,000 residents by 2014 placing Philadelphia as the sixth-highest city in the country.[150]\n\n\nThe number of shootings in the city has declined significantly since the early years of the 21st century. Shooting incidents peaked at 1,857 in 2006 before declining nearly 44 percent to 1,047 shootings in 2014.[150] Major crimes have decreased gradually since a peak in 2006 when 85,498 major crimes were reported. The number of reported major crimes fell 11 percent in three years to 68,815 occurrences in 2014. Violent crimes, which include homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery, decreased 14 percent in three years to 15,771 occurrences in 2014.[150]\n\n\nIn 2014, Philadelphia enacted an ordinance decriminalizing the possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana or 8 grams of hashish; the ordinance gave police officers the discretion to treat possession of these amounts as a civil infraction punishable by a $25 ticket, rather than a crime.[297][298] Philadelphia was at the time the largest city to decriminalize the possession of marijuana.[298] From 2013 to 2018, marijuana arrests in the city dropped by more than 85%.[297] The purchase or sale of marijuana remains a criminal offense in Philadelphia.[298]\n\n\n\n#### Firefighting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Fire Department\n\nThe Philadelphia Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services (EMS). The department's official mission is to protect public safety by quick and professional response to emergencies and the promotion of sound emergency prevention measures. This mandate encompasses all traditional firefighting functions, including fire suppression, with 60 engine companies and 30 ladder companies[299] as well as specialty and support units deployed throughout the city; specialized firefighting units for Philadelphia International Airport and the Port of Philadelphia; investigations conducted by the fire marshal's office to determine the origins of fires and develop preventive strategies; prevention programs to educate the public; and support services including research and planning, management of the fire communications center within the city's 911 system, and operation of the Philadelphia Fire Academy.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Media in Philadelphia\n\n### Newspapers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Inquirer Building at 400 North Broad Street was home of *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, the nation's third-longest continuously published newspaper, until 2012 when it moved its headquarters to Market Street. The building is currently undergoing renovations to become the new headquarters of the Philadelphia Police Department.\nPhiladelphia's two major daily newspapers are *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, first published in 1829—the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the country—and the *Philadelphia Daily News*, first published in 1925.[300] The *Daily News* has been published as an edition of the *Inquirer* since 2009.[301] Recent owners of the *Inquirer* and *Daily News* have included Knight Ridder, The McClatchy Company, and Philadelphia Media Holdings, with the latter organization declaring bankruptcy in 2010.[302] After two years of financial struggle, the newspapers were sold to Interstate General Media in 2012.[302] The two newspapers had a combined daily circulation of 306,831 and a Sunday circulation of 477,313 in 2013[update], the 18th-largest circulation in the country, and the website of the newspapers, Philly.com,[303] was ranked 13th in popularity among online U.S. newspapers by Alexa Internet that same year.[304]\n\n\nSmaller publications include the *Philadelphia Tribune* published five days each week for the African-American community;[305] *Philadelphia* magazine, a monthly regional magazine;[306] *Philadelphia Weekly*, a weekly alternative newspaper;[307] *Philadelphia Gay News*, a weekly newspaper for the LGBT community;[308] *The Jewish Exponent*, a weekly newspaper for the Jewish community;[309] *Al Día*, a weekly newspaper for the Latino community;[310] and *Philadelphia Metro*, a free daily newspaper.[311]\n\n\nStudent-run newspapers include the University of Pennsylvania's *The Daily Pennsylvanian*,[312] Temple University's *The Temple News*,[313] and Drexel University's *The Triangle*.[314]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nThe first experimental radio license was issued in Philadelphia in August 1912 to St. Joseph's College. The first commercial AM radio stations began broadcasting in 1922: first WIP, then owned by Gimbels department store, followed by WFIL, then owned by Strawbridge & Clothier department store, and WOO, a defunct station owned by Wanamaker's department store, as well as WCAU and WDAS.[315]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the FCC lists 28 FM and 11 AM stations for Philadelphia.[316][317] As of December 2017, the ten highest-rated stations in Philadelphia were adult contemporary WBEB-FM (101.1), sports talk WIP-FM (94.1), classic rock WMGK-FM (102.9), urban adult contemporary WDAS-FM (105.3), classic hits WOGL-FM (98.1), album-oriented rock WMMR-FM (93.3), country music WXTU-FM (92.5), all-news KYW-AM (1060), talk radio WHYY-FM (90.9), and urban adult contemporary WRNB-FM (100.3).[318][319] Philadelphia is served by three non-commercial public radio stations: WHYY-FM (NPR),[320] WRTI-FM (classical and jazz),[321] and WXPN-FM (adult alternative music).[322]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRadio stations in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, metropolitan area\n |\n| --- |\n| By AM frequency | * 560\n* 610\n* 640\n* 690\n* 740\n* 800\n* 860\n* 900\n* 950\n* 990\n* 10601\n* 1180\n* 12101\n* 1310\n* 1340\n* 1370\n* 1420\n* 1440\n* 1460\n* 1480\n* 1490\n* 1520\n* 1540\n* 1570\n* 1590\n* 1640\n* 1680\n |\n| By FM frequency | * 88.1\n\t+ WPEB\n\t+ WTHA\n\t+ WZZD\n* 88.3\n* 88.5\n* 88.7\n* 88.9\n\t+ WBYO\n\t+ WBZC\n* 89.1\n* 89.3\n\t+ WRDV\n\t+ WRTJ\n* 89.5\n* 89.7\n* 90.1\n* 90.9\n* 91.5\n\t+ WDBK\n\t+ WSRN-FM\n* 91.7\n\t+ WBMR\n\t+ WCUR\n\t+ WKDU\n\t+ WLBS\n* 92.5\n* 93.3\n* 93.7\n* 94.1\n* 94.5\n* 94.9\n* 95.7\n* 96.5\n* 97.5\n* 98.1\n* 98.9\n* 99.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.3\n* 101.1\n* 101.5\n* 102.1\n* 102.9\n* 103.9\n* 104.5\n* 105.3\n* 106.1\n* 106.9\n* 107.9\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| LPFM | * 92.9\n\t+ WGGT-LP\n\t+ WOOM-LP\n\t+ WRGU-LP\n\t+ WRLG-LP\n\t+ WZML-LP\n* 98.5\n\t+ WJYN-LP\n\t+ WNUW-LP\n\t+ WQEW-LP\n* 106.5\n |\n| Translators | * 92.9\n* 94.9\n* 95.1\n* 95.3\n* 96.1\n* 97.1\n\t+ W246AR\n\t+ W246AQ\n* 98.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.7\n* 102.5\n* 103.3\n* 103.5\n* 103.9\n* 104.1\n* 105.7\n\t+ W289AZ\n\t+ W289CZ\n* 107.3\n |\n\n |\n| NOAA Weather Radiofrequency | * 162.425\n* 162.475\n |\n| Digital radioby frequency & subchannel | * 1210\n* 88.5-1\n* 88.5-2\n* 89.3-1\n* 89.3-2\n* 89.5-1\n* 89.5-2\n* 90.1-1\n* 90.1-2\n* 90.9-1\n* 92.5-1\n* 92.5-2\n* 93.3-1\n* 93.3-2\n* 93.7-1\n* 93.7-2\n* 93.7-3\n* 94.1-1\n* 94.1-2\n* 94.1-3\n* 95.7-1\n* 95.7-2\n* 96.5-1\n* 96.5-2\n* 97.5-1\n* 97.5-2\n* 97.5-3\n* 98.1-1\n* 98.1-2\n* 98.1-3\n* 98.9-1\n* 99.5-1\n* 100.3-1\n* 100.3-2\n* 100.3-3\n* 101.1-1\n* 101.1-2\n* 101.5-1\n* 101.5-2\n* 102.1-1\n* 102.1-2\n* 102.1-3\n* 102.9-1\n* 102.9-2\n* 102.9-3\n* 104.5-1\n* 104.5-2\n* 105.3-1\n* 105.3-2\n* 106.1-1\n* 106.1-2\n* 106.9-1\n* 106.9-2\n* 106.9-3\n* 107.9-1\n* 107.9-2\n |\n| By call sign | * KIH28\n* KYW1\n* W225DJ\n* W235CE\n* W236CL\n* W237EH\n* W241CH\n* W246AR\n* W246AQ\n* W253CA\n* W260CZ\n* W264BH\n* W273DO\n* W277DL\n* W278AK\n* W280CP\n* W281CL\n* W289AZ\n* W289CZ\n* W297AD\n* WBCB\n* WBEB\n\t+ HD2\n* WBEN-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WBMR\n* WBYO\n* WBZC\n* WCHE\n* WCHR\n* WCOJ\n* WCUR\n* WDAS\n* WDAS-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WDBK\n* WEMG\n* WFIL\n* WFYL\n* WGGT-LP\n* WGLS-FM\n* WHAT\n* WHHS\n* WHYY\n* WIFI\n* WIOQ\n* WIP-FM\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WISP\n* WJFP\n* WJYN-LP\n* WKDN\n* WKDU\n* WKVP\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WKXW\n\t+ HD2\n* WLBS\n* WMGK\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WMMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WNG704\n* WNPV\n* WNTP\n* WNUW-LP\n* WNWR\n* WOGL\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WOOM-LP\n* WPAZ\n* WPEB\n* WPEN\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WPHE\n* WPHI-FM\n* WPHT1\n* WPNX700\n* WPPM-LP\n* WPPZ-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WPST\n* WPWA\n* WQEW-LP\n* WQHS\n* WRDV\n* WRFF\n\t+ HD2\n* WRGU-LP\n* WRLG-LP\n* WRNB\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WRSD\n* WRTI\n\t+ HD2\n* WRTJ\n\t+ HD2\n* WSRN-FM\n* WSTW\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WTDY-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WTEL\n* WTHA\n* WTMR\n* WTTM\n* WUMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WURD\n* WUSL\n* WVCW\n* WWDB\n* WWJZ\n* WWLU\n* WXPN\n\t+ HD2\n* WXTU\n\t+ HD2\n* WXVU\n* WYPA\n\t+ HD2\n* WZML-LP\n* WZXE\n* WZZD\n |\n| Internet | * WEXP\n* WQHS\n* WYBF\n |\n| Defunct | * WDNR (89.5 FM)\n* WEXP (1600 AM)\n* WJJZ (1460 AM)\n* WNAP (1110 AM)\n* WNJC (1360 AM)\n* WOO\n* WQHS\n* WYBF (89.1 FM)\n* WZZE (97.3 FM)\n |\n| Radio stations in the Delaware Valley\nPhiladelphia\nVineland-Millville-Bridgeton\nWilmington\n\nOther nearby regions\nAllentown-Bethlehem\nAtlantic City-Cape May\nDover\nLancaster\nReading\nTrenton\nSee also\nList of radio stations in Pennsylvania\n* Mass media in the Philadelphia Area\n\t+ Radio stations\n\t+ TV stations\n\t+ Newspapers\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nNotes\n1.

The station became NBC's first affiliate in 1939, and later became KYW-TV (currently a CBS affiliate). WCAU-TV, WFIL-TV, and WHYY-TV were all founded by the 1960s.[315] In 1952, WFIL (renamed WPVI) premiered the television show *Bandstand*, which later became the nationally broadcast *American Bandstand* hosted by Dick Clark.[323]\n\n\nEach commercial network has an affiliate in Philadelphia: KYW-TV 3 (CBS), WPVI-TV 6 (ABC), WCAU 10 (NBC), WPHL-TV 17 (The CW with MyNetworkTV on DT2), WFPA-CD 28 (UniMás), WTXF-TV 29 (Fox), WPSG 57 (Independent), WWSI 62 (Telemundo), and WUVP-DT 65 (Univision). The region is served also by public broadcasting stations WPPT-TV (Philadelphia), WHYY-TV (Wilmington, Delaware and Philadelphia), WLVT-TV (Lehigh Valley), and NJTV (New Jersey).[324]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has owned-and-operated stations for five major English-language broadcast networks: NBC – WCAU-TV, CBS – KYW-TV, ABC – WPVI-TV, Fox – WTXF-TV and The CW – WPHL-TV. The major Spanish-language networks are Univision – WUVP-DT, UniMás – WFPA-CD, and Telemundo – WWSI-TV.[324]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city is the nation's fourth-largest consumer in media market, as ranked by the Nielsen Media Research firm, with nearly 2.9 million TV households.[325]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBroadcast television in the Delaware Valley region\n |\n| --- |\n| This region

Philadelphia\n\nSince at least the 1700s, hundreds of books and articles have been written about Philadelphia's history, culture, sports teams, crime, politics, and other themes related to the city's past, present, and future.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: 30th Street Station, List of Philadelphia subway stations, and Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's 30th Street Station serves both SEPTA regional and Amtrak national trains and is Amtrak's third-busiest train station in the nation.\n![](image)A Market–Frankford Line train departing 52nd Street station\nPhiladelphia is served by SEPTA, which operates buses, trains, rapid transit (as both subways and elevated trains), trolleys, and trackless trolleys (electric buses) throughout Philadelphia, the four Pennsylvania suburban counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery, in addition to service to Mercer County, New Jersey (Trenton) and New Castle County, Delaware (Wilmington and Newark, Delaware).[326] The city's subway system consists of two routes: the subway section of the Market–Frankford Line running east–west under Market Street which opened in 1905 to the west and 1908 to the east of City Hall,[327] and the Broad Street Line running north–south beneath Broad Street which opened in stages from 1928 to 1938.[328]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, large sections of the SEPTA Regional Rail service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia were discontinued due to a lack of funding for equipment and infrastructure maintenance.[329][330][331]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 30th Street Station is a major railroad station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor with 4.4 million passengers in 2017 making it the third-busiest station in the country after New York City's Pennsylvania Station and Washington's Union Station.[332] 30th Street Station offers access to Amtrak,[333] SEPTA,[334] and NJ Transit lines.[335] Over 12 million SEPTA and NJ Transit rail commuters use the station each year, and more than 100,000 people on an average weekday.[332]\n\n\nThe PATCO Speedline provides rapid transit service to Camden, Collingswood, Westmont, Haddonfield, Woodcrest (Cherry Hill), Ashland (Voorhees), and Lindenwold, New Jersey, from stations on Locust Street between 16th and 15th, 13th and 12th, and 10th and 9th Streets, and on Market Street at 8th Street.[336]\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Philadelphia International Airport, the busiest airport in Pennsylvania and 21st-busiest in the nation\nTwo airports serve Philadelphia: the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is 7 mi (11 km) south-southwest of Center City on the boundary with Delaware County, providing scheduled domestic and international air service,[337] while Northeast Philadelphia Airport (PNE) is a general aviation relief airport in Northeast Philadelphia serving general and corporate aviation.[338] Philadelphia International Airport is among the busiest airports in the world measured by traffic movements (i.e., takeoffs and landings).[339] More than 30 million passengers pass through the airport annually on 25 airlines, including all major domestic carriers. The airport has nearly 500 daily departures to more than 120 destinations worldwide.[337] SEPTA's Airport Regional Rail Line provides direct service between Center City railroad stations and Philadelphia International Airport.[340]\n\n\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 9,650 feet (2,940 m) long Benjamin Franklin Bridge spans the Delaware River, connecting Philadelphia and South Jersey\n![](image)The Schuylkill Expressway eastbound at I-676 and US 30, also known as the Vine Street Expressway, in Center City\nWilliam Penn planned Philadelphia with numbered streets traversing north and south, and streets named for trees, such as Chestnut, Walnut, and Mulberry (since renamed Arch Street), traversing east and west. The two main streets were named Broad Street (the north–south artery, since designated Pennsylvania Route 611) and High Street (the east–west artery, since renamed Market Street) converging at Centre Square which later became the site of City Hall.[341]\n\n\nInterstate 95 (the Delaware Expressway) traverses the southern and eastern edges of the city along the Delaware River as the main north–south controlled-access highway, connecting Philadelphia with Newark, New Jersey and New York City to the north and with Baltimore and Washington, D.C. southward. The city is also served by Interstate 76 (the Schuylkill Expressway), which runs along the Schuylkill River, intersecting the Pennsylvania Turnpike at King of Prussia and providing access to Harrisburg and points west. Interstate 676 (the Vine Street Expressway) links I-95 and I-76 through Center City by running below street level between the eastbound and westbound lanes of Vine Street. Entrance and exit ramps for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge are near the eastern end of the expressway, just west of the I-95 interchange.[342]\n\n\nThe Roosevelt Boulevard and Expressway (U.S. 1) connect Northeast Philadelphia with Center City via I-76 through Fairmount Park. Woodhaven Road (Route 63) and Cottman Avenue (Route 73) serve the neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia, running between I-95 and the Roosevelt Boulevard. The Fort Washington Expressway (Route 309) extends north from the city's northern border, serving Montgomery County and Bucks County. U.S. Route 30 (Lancaster Avenue) extends westward from West Philadelphia to Lancaster.[342]\n\n\nInterstate 476 (locally referred to as the Blue Route[343]) traverses Delaware County, bypassing the city to the west and serving the city's western suburbs, and provides a direct route to Allentown and points north, including the Poconos. Interstate 276, the Pennsylvania Turnpike's Delaware River extension, is a bypass and commuter route to the north of the city and a link to the New Jersey Turnpike and New York City.[342]\n\n\nThe Delaware River Port Authority operates four bridges in the Philadelphia area across the Delaware River to New Jersey: the Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), the Benjamin Franklin Bridge (I-676 and U.S. 30), the Betsy Ross Bridge (New Jersey Route 90), and the Commodore Barry Bridge (U.S. 322 in Delaware County, south of the city).[344] The Burlington County Bridge Commission maintains two bridges across the Delaware River: the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge which connects PA Route 73 in the Tacony section of Northeast Philadelphia with New Jersey Route 73 in Palmyra, Burlington County, and the Burlington–Bristol Bridge which connects NJ Route 413/U.S. Route 130 in Burlington, New Jersey with PA Route 413/U.S. 13 in Bristol Township, north of Philadelphia.[345]\n\n\n\n#### Bus service[edit]\n\n\nThe Greyhound terminal is at 1001 Filbert Street (at 10th Street) in Center City, southeast of the Pennsylvania Convention Center and south of Chinatown.[346] Several other bus operators provide service at the Greyhound terminal including Fullington Trailways,[347] Martz Trailways,[348] Peter Pan Bus Lines,[349] and NJ Transit buses.[350]\n\n\nOther intercity bus services include Megabus with stops at 30th Street Station and the visitor center for Independence Hall,[351] BoltBus (operated by Greyhound) at 30th Street Station,[352] OurBus at various stops in the city.\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of rail transport in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Suburban Station with art deco architecture at 16th Street and JFK Boulevard\nSince the early days of rail transportation in the United States, Philadelphia has served as a hub for several major rail companies, particularly the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad first operated Broad Street Station, then 30th Street Station and Suburban Station, and the Reading Railroad operated Reading Terminal, now part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area. The two systems now operate as a single system under the control of SEPTA, the regional transit authority. Additionally, the PATCO Speedline subway system and NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line operate successor services to southern New Jersey.[353]\n\n\nIn 1911, Philadelphia had nearly 4,000 electric trolleys running on 86 lines.[354] In 2005, SEPTA reintroduced trolley service to the Girard Avenue Line, Route 15.[355] SEPTA operates six subway-surface trolleys that run on street-level tracks in West Philadelphia and subway tunnels in Center City, along with two surface trolleys in adjacent suburbs.[356]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a regional hub of the federally-owned Amtrak system, with 30th Street Station being a primary stop on the Washington-Boston Northeast Corridor and the Keystone Corridor to Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. 30th Street also serves as a major station for services via the Pennsylvania Railroad's former Pennsylvania Main Line to Chicago. As of 2018[update], 30th Street is Amtrak's third-busiest station in the country, after New York City and Washington.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Walk Score ranks[edit]\n\n\nA 2017 study by Walk Score ranked Philadelphia the fifth-most walkable major city in the United States with a score of 79 out of 100, in the middle of the \"very walkable\" range. The city was just edged out by fourth place Miami (79.2), with the top three cities being New York, San Francisco, and Boston. Philadelphia placed fifth in the public transit friendly category, behind Washington, D.C., with the same three cities for walkability topping this category. The city ranked tenth in the bike friendly cities category, with the top three cities being Minneapolis, San Francisco and Portland.[357]\n\n\n*USA Today* readers voted the Schuylkill River Trail the best urban trail in the nation in 2015.[358]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n#### Water purity and availability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fairmount Water Works, Philadelphia's second municipal waterworks, in December 1984\nIn 1815, Philadelphia began sourcing its water via the Fairmount Water Works on the Schuylkill River, the nation's first major urban water supply system. In 1909, the Water Works was decommissioned as the city transitioned to modern sand filtration methods.[359] Today, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) provides drinking water, wastewater collection, and stormwater services for Philadelphia, as well as surrounding counties. PWD draws about 57 percent of its drinking water from the Delaware River and the balance from the Schuylkill River.[360] The city has two filtration plants on the Schuylkill River and one on the Delaware River. The three plants can treat up to 546 million gallons of water per day, while the total storage capacity of the combined plant and distribution system exceeds one billion gallons. The wastewater system consists of three water pollution control plants, 21 pumping stations, and about 3,657 miles (5,885 km) of sewers.[360]\n\n\n\n#### Electricity[edit]\n\n\nExelon subsidiary PECO Energy Company, founded as the Brush Electric Light Company of Philadelphia in 1881 and renamed Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) in 1902, provides electricity to about 1.6 million customers and more than 500,000 natural gas customers in the southeastern Pennsylvania area including the city of Philadelphia and most of its suburbs.[361] PECO is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state with 472 power substations and nearly 23,000 miles (37,000 km) of electric transmission and distribution lines, along with 12,000 miles (19,000 km) of natural gas transmission, distribution & service lines.[362]\n\n\n\n#### Natural gas[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Philadelphia Gas Works\n\nPhiladelphia Gas Works (PGW), overseen by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, is the nation's largest municipally-owned natural gas utility. PGW serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the Philadelphia area.[363] Founded in 1836, the company came under city ownership in 1987 and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits. In 2014, the City Council refused to conduct hearings on a $1.86 billion sale of PGW, part of a two-year effort that was proposed by the mayor. The refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer.[364][365]\n\n\n\n#### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Area codes 215, 267, and 445\n\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania was assigned the 215 area code in 1947 when the North American Numbering Plan of the Bell System went into effect. The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in half in 1994 when area code 610 was created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215. Overlay area code 267 was added to the 215 service area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas, area code 445 to 215 and area code 835 to 610, was delayed and later rescinded.[366] Area code 445 was implemented as an overlay for area codes 215 and 267 starting on February 3, 2018.[367]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Philadelphia\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Chinatown paifang at 10th and Arch Streets, a symbol of Philadelphia's sister city relationship with Tianjin\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Florence[368] | Italy\n | 1964\n |\n| Tel Aviv[369] | Israel\n | 1966\n |\n| Toruń[370] | Poland\n | 1976\n |\n| Tianjin[371] | China\n | 1979\n |\n| Incheon[372] | South Korea\n | 1984\n |\n| Douala[373] | Cameroon\n | 1986\n |\n| Nizhny Novgorod[374] | Russia\n | 1992\n |\n| Frankfurt[375] | Germany\n | 2015\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia also has three partnership cities or regions:[376]\n\n\n\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Kobe[377] | Japan\n | 1986\n |\n| Abruzzo[378] | Italy\n | 1997\n |\n| Aix-en-Provence[379] | France\n | 1999\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia has eight official sister cities as designated by the Citizen Diplomacy International of Philadelphia:[376] Philadelphia has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. The Sister Cities Park, a site of 0.5 acres (2,400 sq yd) at 18th and Benjamin Franklin Parkway within Logan Square, was dedicated in June 1976. The park was built to commemorate Philadelphia's first two sister city relationships, with Tel Aviv and Florence. The Toruń Triangle, honoring the sister city relationship with Toruń, Poland, was constructed in 1976, west of the United Way building at 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Sister Cities Park was redesigned and reopened in 2012, featuring an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's sister and partnership cities, a café and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, as well as a pavilion built to environmentally friendly standards.[380][381]\n\n\nThe Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans of Tianjin, stands astride 10th Street, on the north side of its intersection with Arch Street, as a symbol of the sister city relationship. The CDI of Philadelphia has participated in the U.S. Department of State's \"Partners for Peace\" project with Mosul, Iraq,[382] as well as accepting visiting delegations from dozens of other countries.[383]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n* ![](image)Philadelphia portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of Pennsylvania state historical markers in Philadelphia County\n* Metropolitan areas in the Americas\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n* USS *Philadelphia*, 6 ships\n* Alaşehir, ancient Philadelphia in Turkey\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Description of the Lenape peoples (Delaware nations) historic territories inside the divides of the frequently mountainous landforms flanking the Delaware River's drainage basin.

The February 2010 storms contributed to a single month record accumulation of 51.5 in (131 cm). If no snow fell outside of February that season, 2009–10 would still rank as 5th-snowiest. See the Franklin Institute for a visual representation of seasonal snowfall.\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Official temperature and precipitation measurements for Philadelphia were taken at the Weather Bureau Office in downtown from January 1872 to 19 June 1940, and at Philadelphia Int'l from 20 June 1940 to the present.[111] Snowfall and snow depth records date to 1 January 1884 and 1 October 1948, respectively.[105] In 2006, snowfall measurements were moved to National Park, New Jersey directly across the Delaware River from the airport.[112]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** From 15% sample\n6. **^** E.g., in the opening chapter of *The Handbook of Language Variation and Change* (ed.

It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S. with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area of Western Pennsylvania; its population of 2.457 million is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Furthermore, it is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area that extends into Ohio and West Virginia.\n\n\nPittsburgh is located in southwest Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[5] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[6] Pittsburgh is known both as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry, and as the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[7] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[8] Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out.[9]\n\n\nAfter 1990, Pittsburgh transformed into a hub for the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[10] Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Allegheny Health Network, and 68 colleges and universities, including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[11] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research and the nuclear navy.[12] In the private sector, Pittsburgh-based PNC is the nation's fifth-largest bank, and the city is home to eight Fortune 500 companies, and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. RAND Corporation, BNY Mellon, Nova, FedEx, Bayer, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have regional headquarters and offices that helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth.[13] Furthermore, the region is a hub for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and energy extraction.[14]\n\n\nPittsburgh's rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[15] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ *PITS-bər-ə* (similar to Edinburgh).[16][17]\n\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[18]\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[19]\n\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final *h* was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[20][16] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the *h* was reversed.[16] The *Pittsburg Press* continued spelling the city without an *h* until 1921.[21]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Pittsburgh and Name of Pittsburgh\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Pittsburgh.\n\nHistorical claims\n\n\n> \n> French Empire 1669–1758  \n> British Empire 1681–1781  \n> United States 1776–present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n### Native Americans[edit]\n\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[22] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[23]: 289\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\n![](image)Fort Pitt Block House, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh.\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[24][*better source needed*] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[25]\n\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[25] During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[26] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[27]\n\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[28][29][30][31]\n\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[32] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.\n\n\nOn April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[33][34] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[35]\n\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Viceroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![A historic 1857 scene of the Monongahela River in downtown Pittsburgh featuring a steamboat](image)The Monongahela River and its surroundings in 1857\n![](image)Lithograph of Pittsburgh by Otto Krebs (before 1874)\n![](image)Burning of Union Depot during the Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877\nThe federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[36] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.[37]\n\n\nThe War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats, that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\n\n\nIn the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, the most came from Germany.\n\n\nBecause Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[38] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[39] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[38]\n\n\nThe American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![Bird's Eye View of Pittsburgh, 1902](image)An aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902[40]\n![](image)Steel mills in the Strip District in 1906\nIn 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\n\n\nThe Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.[41]\n\n\nThe city suffered severe flooding in March 1936.\n\n\nThe city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[42] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[43] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[44]\n\n\nDuring World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[27] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[45][46] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[47]\n\n\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[9]\n\n\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDuring the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[48]\n\n\nIn September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[49]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Regional identity\n\n![](image)Downtown Pittsburgh and the Duquesne Incline from Mount Washington\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown.\n\n\nThe city is on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[50] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.\n\n\nMany Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.[a]\n\n\nThe steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[51] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[52]\n\n\nBike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n#### Areas[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Pittsburgh neighborhoods, List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh, List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations, and List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks\n\n![](image)Pittsburgh's 90 distinct neighborhoods\nThe city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[53] and four main areas surrounding it. These surrounding areas are subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (Pittsburgh has 90 neighborhoods).[54] Relative to downtown, these areas are known as the Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End.\n\n\n\n##### Golden Triangle[edit]\n\n\nDowntown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine of which top 500 feet (150 m). The U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest, at 841 ft (256 m).[55] The Cultural District consists of a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River. This district contains many theaters and arts venues and is home to a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a four-block mixed-use \"green\" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers of between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south.[56] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown.\n\n\n\n##### North Side[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: North Side (Pittsburgh)\n\n![](image)Townhouses in the Mexican War Streets neighborhood\nThe North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. What is known today as Pittsburgh's North Side was once known as Allegheny City, and operated as a city independently of Pittsburgh until it was merged with Pittsburgh in 1907 under great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for its well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to attractions such as Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, Carnegie Science Center, National Aviary, Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory art museum, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, Randyland, Penn Brewery, Allegheny Observatory, and Allegheny General Hospital.[57]\n\n\n\n##### South Side[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: South Side (Pittsburgh)\n\n![](image)East Carson Street in the South Side Flats\nThe South Side was once the site of railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. Since the late 20th century, the city undertook a Main Street program in cooperation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and supporting new retail. The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination, and the value of homes in the South Side had increased in value by about 10% annually for the 10 years up to 2014.[58] East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues.\n\n\nIn 1993 the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development, to include a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers. Construction began in 1998. The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005, featuring many stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters.[59]\n\n\n\n##### East End[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shadyside neighborhood\nThe East End of Pittsburgh is home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University, Chatham University, The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History, Phipps Conservatory, and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. It is also home to many parks and public spaces including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods with some apartments and condos, and pedestrian-oriented shopping/business districts. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.[60] Oakland, heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs.[61] Other East End neighborhoods include Point Breeze, Regent Square, Highland Park, Homewood, Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar, Larimer, East Hills, East Liberty, Polish Hill, Hazelwood, Garfield, Morningside, and Stanton Heights.\n\n\n\n##### West End[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: West End (Pittsburgh) § Region\n\nThe West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott.\n\n\n\n#### Ethnicities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Pittsburgh is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Combined Statistical Area, a Combined statistical area defined by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\n\nPittsburgh falls within the borders of Appalachia as defined by the Appalachian Regional Commission, and has long been characterized as the \"northern urban industrial anchor of Appalachia.\"[64] In its post-industrial state, Pittsburgh has been characterized as the \"Paris of Appalachia\",[65][66][67][68] recognizing the city's cultural, educational, healthcare, and technological resources, and is the largest city in Appalachia.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 2.6\n\n\n\n36\n\n21\n | 2.4\n\n\n\n39\n\n23\n | 3\n\n\n\n49\n\n30\n | 3.1\n\n\n\n62\n\n40\n | 4\n\n\n\n71\n\n49\n | 4.3\n\n\n\n79\n\n58\n | 3.8\n\n\n\n83\n\n63\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n81\n\n62\n | 3.1\n\n\n\n74\n\n54\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n63\n\n43\n | 3.2\n\n\n\n51\n\n35\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n39\n\n25\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 66\n\n\n\n2\n\n−6\n | 61\n\n\n\n4\n\n−5\n | 75\n\n\n\n10\n\n−1\n | 79\n\n\n\n17\n\n5\n | 100\n\n\n\n22\n\n10\n | 109\n\n\n\n26\n\n15\n | 97\n\n\n\n28\n\n17\n | 88\n\n\n\n27\n\n16\n | 79\n\n\n\n24\n\n12\n | 58\n\n\n\n17\n\n6\n | 82\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 72\n\n\n\n4\n\n−4\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Pittsburgh falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[69][70][71] The city and river valleys lie in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b while higher elevated areas and some suburbs lie in zone 6a.[72] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season.[73]\n\n\nThe warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74]\n\n\nAverage annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.[75] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51.[76] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[77] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh International Airport), 1991–2020 normals,[c] extremes 1874–present[d] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 75(24)\n | 78(26)\n | 84(29)\n | 90(32)\n | 95(35)\n | 98(37)\n | 103(39)\n | 103(39)\n | 102(39)\n | 91(33)\n | 82(28)\n | 74(23)\n | 103(39)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 61.5(16.4)\n | 63.2(17.3)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 81.5(27.5)\n | 86.8(30.4)\n | 90.4(32.4)\n | 91.3(32.9)\n | 90.3(32.4)\n | 88.2(31.2)\n | 79.9(26.6)\n | 70.8(21.6)\n | 62.6(17.0)\n | 92.6(33.7)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 36.3(2.4)\n | 39.6(4.2)\n | 49.1(9.5)\n | 62.4(16.9)\n | 71.9(22.2)\n | 79.4(26.3)\n | 82.9(28.3)\n | 81.7(27.6)\n | 75.1(23.9)\n | 63.1(17.3)\n | 50.9(10.5)\n | 40.6(4.8)\n | 61.1(16.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 28.8(−1.8)\n | 31.4(−0.3)\n | 39.7(4.3)\n | 51.5(10.8)\n | 61.2(16.2)\n | 69.4(20.8)\n | 73.2(22.9)\n | 71.8(22.1)\n | 64.9(18.3)\n | 53.4(11.9)\n | 42.6(5.9)\n | 33.7(0.9)\n | 51.8(11.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 21.4(−5.9)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 30.3(−0.9)\n | 40.7(4.8)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 59.3(15.2)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n | 54.8(12.7)\n | 43.7(6.5)\n | 34.3(1.3)\n | 26.7(−2.9)\n | 42.5(5.8)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 1.0(−17.2)\n | 5.0(−15.0)\n | 11.7(−11.3)\n | 25.4(−3.7)\n | 35.6(2.0)\n | 45.2(7.3)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 51.1(10.6)\n | 41.2(5.1)\n | 29.5(−1.4)\n | 19.3(−7.1)\n | 9.7(−12.4)\n | −1.5(−18.6)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −22(−30)\n | −20(−29)\n | −5(−21)\n | 11(−12)\n | 26(−3)\n | 34(1)\n | 42(6)\n | 39(4)\n | 31(−1)\n | 16(−9)\n | −1(−18)\n | −12(−24)\n | −22(−30)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 2.96(75)\n | 2.62(67)\n | 3.15(80)\n | 3.32(84)\n | 3.83(97)\n | 4.12(105)\n | 4.26(108)\n | 3.52(89)\n | 3.30(84)\n | 2.83(72)\n | 2.86(73)\n | 2.84(72)\n | 39.61(1,006)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 13.3(34)\n | 11.7(30)\n | 7.6(19)\n | 1.0(2.5)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.4(1.0)\n | 2.4(6.1)\n | 7.7(20)\n | 44.1(112)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 16.8\n | 13.9\n | 14.0\n | 13.9\n | 13.5\n | 12.4\n | 11.2\n | 10.5\n | 9.8\n | 11.1\n | 12.0\n | 14.6\n | 153.7\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 12.2\n | 9.3\n | 5.9\n | 1.6\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.3\n | 3.3\n | 7.6\n | 40.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 69.9\n | 67.3\n | 64.1\n | 59.8\n | 63.4\n | 66.2\n | 68.8\n | 71.2\n | 72.0\n | 68.3\n | 70.2\n | 71.9\n | 67.8\n |\n| Average dew point °F (°C)\n | 17.2(−8.2)\n | 18.9(−7.3)\n | 26.8(−2.9)\n | 34.5(1.4)\n | 45.9(7.7)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 60.1(15.6)\n | 59.5(15.3)\n | 53.4(11.9)\n | 40.8(4.9)\n | 32.4(0.2)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 39.0(3.9)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 93.9\n | 108.5\n | 155.4\n | 182.8\n | 217.4\n | 242.2\n | 254.9\n | 228.4\n | 196.7\n | 167.3\n | 99.4\n | 74.4\n | 2,021.3\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 31\n | 36\n | 42\n | 46\n | 49\n | 54\n | 56\n | 54\n | 53\n | 48\n | 33\n | 26\n | 45\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (relative humidity, dew point and sun 1961–1990)[74][78][73][79] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[80] |\n\n#### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, the \"State of the Air\" report from the American Lung Association (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. Outside of California, Allegheny County is the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[81]\n\n\nIn a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[82][83] The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.[84] The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.[85]\n\n\nAlthough the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[86] ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more.\"[87]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.[88]\n\n\nThe city contains 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets, by the last count conducted in 2005. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Water quality[edit]\n\n\nThe local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits.[90] This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959.[91] Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water.[92] As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers.[93] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[94] The local sewage authority, Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions.[95] In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which is moving closer to EPA approval.[96]\n\n\nPittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement.[97] In 2017, Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority.[98] Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).[97]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 1,565 |  | — |\n| 1810 | 4,768 |  | 204.7% |\n| 1820 | 7,248 |  | 52.0% |\n| 1830 | 12,568 |  | 73.4% |\n| 1840 | 21,115 |  | 68.0% |\n| 1850 | 46,601 |  | 120.7% |\n| 1860 | 49,221 |  | 5.6% |\n| 1870 | 86,076 |  | 74.9% |\n| 1880 | 156,389 |  | 81.7% |\n| 1890 | 238,617 |  | 52.6% |\n| 1900 | 321,616 |  | 34.8% |\n| 1910 | 533,905 |  | 66.0% |\n| 1920 | 588,343 |  | 10.2% |\n| 1930 | 669,817 |  | 13.8% |\n| 1940 | 671,659 |  | 0.3% |\n| 1950 | 676,806 |  | 0.8% |\n| 1960 | 604,332 |  | −10.7% |\n| 1970 | 520,117 |  | −13.9% |\n| 1980 | 423,938 |  | −18.5% |\n| 1990 | 369,879 |  | −12.8% |\n| 2000 | 334,563 |  | −9.5% |\n| 2010 | 305,704 |  | −8.6% |\n| 2020 | 302,971 |  | −0.9% |\n| 2022 (est.) | 302,898 |  | 0.0% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[99][100][2] |\n\n\nAt the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race.

Pittsburgh has one of the largest Italian-American communities in the nation,[104] and the fifth-largest Ukrainian community per the 1990 census.[105] Pittsburgh has one of the most extensive Croatian communities in the United States.[106] Overall, the Pittsburgh metro area has one of the largest populations of Slavic Americans in the country.\n\n\nPittsburgh has a sizable Black and African American population, concentrated in various neighborhoods especially in the East End. There is also a small Asian community consisting of Indian immigrants, and a small Hispanic community consisting of Mexicans and Puerto Ricans.[107]\n\n\nAccording to a 2010 Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) study, residents include 773,341 \"Catholics\"; 326,125 \"Mainline Protestants\"; 174,119 \"Evangelical Protestants;\" 20,976 \"Black Protestants;\" and 16,405 \"Orthodox Christians,\" with 996,826 listed as \"unclaimed\" and 16,405 as \"other\" in the metro area.[107] A 2017 study by the Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies at Brandeis University estimated the Jewish population of Greater Pittsburgh was 49,200.[108] Pittsburgh is also cited as the location where the earliest precursor to Jehovah's Witnesses was founded by Charles Taze Russell; today the denomination makes up approximately 1% of the population based on data from the Pew Research Center.[109][110]\n\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 78% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 42% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 32% professing Catholic beliefs. while 18% claim no religious affiliation.

The average household size was 2.17 and the average family size was 2.95.\n\n\nIn the city, the population was spread out, with 19.9% under the age of 18, 14.8% from 18 to 24, 28.6% from 25 to 44, 20.3% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.8 males.\n\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $28,588, and the median income for a family was $38,795. Males had a median income of $32,128 versus $25,500 for females. The per capita income for the city was $18,816. About 15.0% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.5% of those under the age of 18 and 13.5% ages 65 or older. By the 2019 American Community Survey, the median income for a household increased to $53,799.[112] Families had a median income of $68,922; married-couple families had a median income of $93,500; and non-family households had a median income of $34,448. Pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs within city limits are Squirrel Hill and Point Breeze, the only two areas of the city which have average household incomes over $100,000 a year. Outside of city limits, Sewickley Heights is by a wide margin the wealthiest suburb of Pittsburgh within Allegheny County, with an average yearly household income of just over $218,000. Sewickely Heights is seen as one of Pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs culturally as well, titles which the suburbs of Upper St. Clair, Fox Chapel, Wexford, and Warrendale also have been bestowed.[113][114]\n\n\nIn a 2002 study, Pittsburgh ranked 22nd of 69 urban places in the U.S. in the number of residents 25 years or older who had completed a bachelor's degree, at 31%.[115] Pittsburgh ranked 15th of the 69 places in the number of residents 25 years or older who completed a high school degree, at 84.7%.[116]\n\n\nThe metro area has shown greater residential racial integration during the last 30 years. The 2010 census ranked 18 other U.S. metros as having greater black-white segregation, while 32 other U.S. metros rank higher for black-white isolation.[117]\n\n\nAs of 2018, much of Pittsburgh's population density was concentrated in the central, southern, and eastern areas. The city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile; its most densely populated parts are North Oakland (at 21,200 per square mile) and Uptown Pittsburgh (at 19,869 per square mile). Outside of the city limits, Dormont and Mount Oliver are Pittsburgh's most densely-populated neighborhoods, with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively.[118]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Pittsburgh\n\nSee also: List of corporations in Pittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,[119] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[120] A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility[121] or the American Dream.[122] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square.[123] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[124] Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as \"the poster child for managing industrial transition\".[125] Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.[126]\n\n\nThe largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 48,000 employees. All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs in the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: \"That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s.\"[127]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Top publicly traded companiesin the Pittsburgh region for 2022**(ranked by revenues)*with metropolitan and U.S. ranks* |\n| **Metro** |  | **corporation** |  | **US** |  |\n| 1 |  | The Kraft Heinz Company |  | 139\n |  |\n| 2 |  | U.S. Steel |  | 172\n |  |\n| 3 |  | PNC Financial Services |  | 178\n |  |\n| 4 |  | Viatris |  | 204\n |  |\n| 5 |  | PPG Industries |  | 218\n |  |\n| 6 |  | Dick's Sporting Goods |  | 307\n |  |\n| 7 |  | Alcoa |  | 312\n |  |\n| 8 |  | WESCO International |  | 357\n |  |\n| 9 |  | Wabtec |  | 439\n |  |\n| 10 |  | Arconic |  | 452\n |  |\n|  |\n\n Education is a major economic driver in the region.

Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, David McCullough was born and raised in Pittsburgh.[159] Annie Dillard, a Pulitzer Prize–winning writer, was born and raised in Pittsburgh. Much of her memoir *An American Childhood* takes place in post-World War II Pittsburgh. Award-winning author John Edgar Wideman grew up in Pittsburgh and has based several of his books, including the memoir *Brothers and Keepers*, in his hometown. Poet Terrance Hayes, winner of the 2010 National Book Award and a 2014 MacArthur Foundation Fellow, received his MFA from the University of Pittsburgh, where he is a faculty member. Poet Michael Simms, founder of Autumn House Press, resides in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Poet Samuel John Hazo, the first poet Laureate of Pennsylvania, resides in the city. New writers include Chris Kuzneski, who attended the University of Pittsburgh and mentions Pittsburgh in his works, and Pittsburgher Brian Celio, author of *Catapult Soul*, who captured the Pittsburgh 'Yinzer' dialect in his writing. Pittsburgh's unique literary style extends to playwrights,[160] as well as local graffiti and hip hop artists.\n\n\nPittsburgh's position as the birthplace for community owned television and networked commercial television helped spawn the modern children's show genres exemplified by *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood*, *Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?*, *Happy's Party*, *Cappelli & Company*, and *The Children's Corner*, all nationally broadcast.\n\n\nThe *Pittsburgh Dad* series has showcased the Pittsburghese genre to a global YouTube audience since 2011.\n\n\nThe modern fantasy, macabre and science fiction genre was popularized by director George A. Romero, television's Bill Cardille and his *Chiller Theatre*,[161] director and writer Rusty Cundieff and makeup effects guru Tom Savini.[162] The genre continues today with the PARSEC science fiction organization,[163] The It's Alive Show, the annual \"Zombie Fest\",[164] and several writer's workshops including Write or Die,[165] Pittsburgh SouthWrites,[166] and Pittsburgh Worldwrights[167][168] with Barton Paul Levenson, Kenneth Chiacchia and Elizabeth Humphreys Penrose.\n\n\n\n### Food[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Primanti Bros. sandwich\nPittsburgh is known for several specialties including pierogies, kielbasa, chipped chopped ham sandwiches, and Klondike bars.[169][170] In 2019, Pittsburgh was deemed \"Food City of the Year\" by the San Francisco-based restaurant and hospitality consulting firm af&co.[171] Many restaurants were favorably mentioned, among them were Superior Motors in Braddock, Driftwood Oven in Lawrenceville, Spork in Bloomfield, Fish nor Fowl in Garfield, Bitter Ends Garden & Luncheonette in Bloomfield, and Rolling Pepperoni in Lawrenceville.[172]\n\n\nPittsburgh is home to the annual pickle-themed festival Picklesburgh, which has been named the \"best specialty food festival in America\".[173]\n\n\n\n### Local dialect[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Pennsylvania English\n\nThe Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called *Pittsburghese*, was influenced by Scots-Irish, German, and Eastern European immigrants and African Americans.[174] Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as \"Yinzers\" (from the local word \"yinz\" [var. *yunz*], a blended form of \"you ones\", similar to \"y'all\" and \"you all\" in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: \"slippy\" (slippery), \"redd up\" (clean up), \"jagger bush\" (thorn bush), and \"gum bands\" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb \"to be\". In Pittsburghese one would say \"the car needs washed\" instead of \"needs to be washed\", \"needs washing\", or \"needs a wash.\" The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore, but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted *The New York Times* to describe Pittsburgh as \"the Galapagos Islands of American dialect\".[175] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include *babushka*, *pierogi*, and *halušky*.[176]\n\n\n\n### Livability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Frick Environmental Center at Frick Park\nPittsburgh has five city parks and several parks managed by the Nature Conservancy.

The cost of a comprehensive flood control program for the region has been estimated at a prohibitive $50 billion.[178]\n\n\nPittsburgh has the greatest number of bars per capita in the nation.[15]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Pittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh hosted the first professional football game and the first World Series.

In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed, \"No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh.\"[189]\n\n\nSince the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive National League Championship Series appearances (1990–92) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason appearances: the 2013 National League Division Series and the 2014–2015 Wild Card games. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[190]\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: American football in Western Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

His successor, Bill Peduto, was sworn in on January 6, 2014. In November 2021, Pittsburgh elected its first African-American mayor, Ed Gainey.\n\n\nPrior to the American Civil War, Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist. It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party,[203] as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election. The city's ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat.[204]\n\n\nPittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts (Lindsey Williams (D)-38, Wayne D. Fontana (D)-42, and Jay Costa (D)-43) and nine House Districts (Aerion Abney-19, Adam Ravenstahl-20, Sara Innamorato-21, Dan Frankel-23, Martell Covington-24, Dan Deasy-27, Summer Lee-34, and Harry Readshaw-36, Dan Miller-42).\n\n\nFederally, Pittsburgh is part of Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Summer Lee since 2023 and also by Democrat Chris Deluzio.\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford Taurus and a Chevrolet Impala belonging to the Pittsburgh Police\nThe area's largest law enforcement agency is the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, with close to 850 sworn officers.

The Allegheny County Sheriff focuses on jail and courthouse security. The Allegheny County Police primarily patrols county-owned parks and airports, while providing detective/investigatory functions for smaller suburbs and the Port Authority police patrols rapid transit. Pennsylvania State Police Troop B provides patrols for the city and immediate suburbs.\n\n\nThe county's lead law enforcement officer is Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala while the Allegheny County Medical Examiner heads forensics. Crimes of a federal nature are covered by the U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n### Crime[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh annually ranks as one of America's safest big cities, in 2013 being named the 3rd \"most secure\" big city by Farmers Insurance.[205] Among crime rates of the 60 largest U.S. cities, 43 had more instances of property crime while 16 had less when compared to Pittsburgh. More instances of violent crime were reported in 21 of the largest cities while 37 had less. The FBI recommends against using data for ranking.[206][207]\nPer 100,000 persons stats (2012):\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Murder | Rape | Robbery | Assault | Burglary | Theft | Motor vehicle | Total violent | Total property\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| City | 13.1 | 15.1 | 363.3 | 360.4 | 812.8 | 2,438.2 | 174.3 | 752.0 | 3,425.4\n |\n\n\nAt the end of 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police reported 37 murders in the city that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of colleges and universities in Pittsburgh\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh\n![](image)The main campus of Carnegie Mellon University\nPittsburgh is home to many colleges, universities and research facilities, the most well-known of which are Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Duquesne University.

Romero shot nearly all his films in the area, including his *Living Dead* series.[224]\n\n\nFilm production in Pittsburgh has notably impacted the region's economy and job creation, largely due to the 25% tax credit incentive established in 2007.[225][226] The Pittsburgh Film Office states that the film and television industry provides employment to over 10,000 people and pays over $500 million in wages in southwestern Pennsylvania.[227] Furthermore, the industry supports over 345,000 local businesses and contributes over $41 billion to them.[226]\n\n\nFrom 2017 to 2023, Pittsburgh has welcomed a series of major film and television productions like *Fences*, *Mindhunter*, *Ma Rainey's Black Bottom*, *Sweet Girl*, and *I'm Your Woman*.[228] These productions have significantly contributed to the local economy by hiring local personnel, leasing local facilities and equipment, purchasing local goods and services, and enhancing local tourism and visibility.[229]\n\n\nIn addition to a thriving film industry, Pittsburgh is home to several film festivals, film schools, and organizations that encourage and promote independent and diverse filmmakers. Notable film festivals include the Three Rivers Film Festival, the Pittsburgh Shorts Film Festival, the JFilm Festival, the ReelAbilities Film Festival, and the Black Bottom Film Festival.[230][231] The local film schools include Pittsburgh Filmmakers, Point Park University - Cinema & Digital Arts, and University of Pittsburgh - Film Studies.[232][233]\n\n\nMoreover, Pittsburgh is developing a robust film studio infrastructure, with several sound stages and production facilities available for hire. Prominent film studios in Pittsburgh are 3 Rivers Studios, Cinelease Studios, Post Script Films, Deeplocal, and The Videohouse.[234][235][236][237][238] There are also plans in the pipeline to develop a new film studio complex at the Carrie Furnace site in Rankin and Swissvale.[239]\n\n\n\n## Utilities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Allegheny County Sanitary Authority\n\nThe city is served by Duquesne Light, one of the original 1912 power companies founded by George Westinghouse.[240] Water service is provided by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority[241] and Pennsylvania American Water.

Both hospitals annually rank as among the best overall in the United States, with UPMC ranked among *U.S. News & World Report*'s \"Honor Roll\" every year since 2000.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe first military hospital in U.S. history and the first west of the Atlantic Plain—General Edward Hand Hospital—served the area from 1777 to 1845.[243] Since 1847, Pittsburgh has hosted the world's first \"Mercy Hospital\".[244] This was followed by West Penn hospital in 1848, Passavant Hospital in 1849,[25] the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1883, Children's Hospital in 1887, and Magee Womens Hospital in 1911. In 1954, Allegheny General (AGH) was among the first to administer Cobalt therapy.[245]\n\n\nIn 1980, UPMC announced a $250 million ($1.05 billion today) expansion and also hired transplant pioneer Thomas Starzl.[246] In 1984, Allegheny General surgeons pioneered modern brain surgery. Starzl arranged the 1985 liver transplant of 5-year-old Amie Garrison as a UPMC surgery team flew to Baylor University, starting its transplant program.[247] Also in 1985, UPMC surgeons Drs. Griffith, Hardesty, and Trento revealed a new device after a heart-lung transplant. In 1986, UPMC announced a $230 million ($639 million today) modernization. In 1996, UPMC's planned Sicily ISMETT branch was approved by the Italian government as transplant surgeons to supervise and deliver the world's third (both earlier ones done at UPMC)--and first public—cross species marrow transplant at University of California, San Francisco.[248] UPMC's Thomas Detre founded the International Society for Bipolar Disorders at a world medical conference in Pittsburgh in 1999.[249]\n\n\nThe $80 million ($142 million today) UPMC Sports Performance Complex for the Pittsburgh Panthers & Pittsburgh Steelers opened in 2000. In 2002, AGH opened its $30 million ($51.6 million today), 5-floor, 100,000 sq. ft., cancer center. The $130 million ($220 million today) 350,000 sq. ft. Hillman Cancer Center opened in 2003 as UPMC entered into an 8-year, $420 million ($678 million today) agreement with IBM to upgrade medical technologies & health information systems.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2009, the $600 million ($849 million today) UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened. The campus was featured in world news in 2012 for several unique approaches to patient care.[250] UPMC officially adopted in Erie, Pennsylvania's Hamot Medical Center in 2010. The Pittsburgh Penguins announced a state of the art training facility with UPMC in 2012.[251] UPMC announced in 2013 it had partnered with Nazarbayev University to help found its medical school.[252]\n\n\n\n### Health discoveries[edit]\n\n\nWhile he was a professor at the University of Pittsburgh, American virologist Jonas Salk developed one of the first successful polio vaccines, which came into use in 1955.\n\n\nUPMC has pioneered several world firsts including the first known cystic fibrosis heart-lung transplant (1983), the world's first simultaneous liver and heart transplant operation on a child (6-year-old Stormie Jones in 1984), the youngest heart-lung transplant (9 years old in 1985), the world's first heart-liver-kidney transplant (1989), the world's first heart-liver transplant on an infant (1997),[253] the first pediatric heart-double lung-liver transplant (1998), the nation's first double hand transplant (2009), and the first total forearm and hand transplant (2010), as well as the state's first heart transplant (1968).[254][255]\n\n\n*The Lancet* published a 2012 UPMC study of two 9-year quadriplegics being able to move a robotic arm by thought, to pick up objects, shake hands, and even eat. Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[256]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Pittsburgh\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Pittsburgh's numerous bridges\nPittsburgh is a city of bridges. With 446,[257] it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title \"City of Bridges.\"[258] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The south-western \"entrance\" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue/Red/Silver subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Public transportation statistics[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh is served by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the 26th-largest transit agency in the country prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 min. 23% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9 mi (6.3 km), while 11% travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction.[259]\n\n\n\n### Expressways and highways[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Expressways\n | Other Highways\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Parkway North | ![](image) | US 19 | ![](image) PA 88 |\n| ![](image)![](image) ![](image) | Parkway East & West | ![](image)![](image) | TruckUS 19 | ![](image) PA 121 |\n| ![](image) | Crosstown | ![](image) | PA 8 | ![](image) PA 130 |\n| ![](image) | Allegheny Valley Expressway | ![](image) | PA 50 | ![](image) PA 380 |\n| ![](image) | Ohio River Boulevard | ![](image) | PA 51 | ![](image) PA 837 |\n|   |   | ![](image) | PA 60 | ![](image) PA 885 |\n\n\n![](image)I-279\nLocals refer to the interstates fanning out from downtown Pittsburgh as the \"parkways.\" Interstate 376 is both the \"parkway east\" connecting to Interstate 76 (Pennsylvania Turnpike) and the \"parkway west\" connecting to Interstate 79, the Pittsburgh International Airport, the Ohio end of the Turnpike and Interstate 80. The \"parkway north\" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The \"crosstown\" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped \"beltway\" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region.\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Airports\n\nPittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh.\n\n\nOther airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron–Canton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Johnstown–Cambria County Airport (60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh).\n\n\n\n### Intercity passenger rail and bus[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Union Station (Pittsburgh) and Grant Street Transportation Center\n\nAmtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station, via the *Capitol Limited* between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the *Pennsylvanian* to New York City.\n\n\nMegabus, Greyhound Lines, and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[260]\n\n\nUntil declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore & Ohio Station, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station.\n\n\n\n### Regional mass transit[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pittsburgh Light Rail and Port Authority of Allegheny County § Bus rapid transit\n\n![](image)Steel Plaza subway station\nPittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.[261] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an \"incline\") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[262] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[263] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares.\n\n\nThe Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport, Monroeville, McCandless, and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook.\n\n\n\n### Freight rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Union Station, built in 1903\nPittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the city and Philadelphia, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865 Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.\n\n\nPittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S. also has major operations around Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n### Port[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[264]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Pittsburgh\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh's sister cities are:[265]\n\n\n\n* ![Spain](image) Bilbao, Spain\n* ![Vietnam](image) Da Nang, Vietnam\n* ![Paraguay](image) Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay\n* ![Turkey](image) Gaziantep, Turkey\n* ![Scotland](image) Glasgow, Scotland\n* ![Israel](image) Karmiel, Israel\n* ![Cuba](image) Matanzas, Cuba\n* ![Israel](image) Misgav, Israel\n* ![Mexico](image) Naucalpan, Mexico\n* ![Czech Republic](image) Ostrava, Czech Republic\n* ![Slovakia](image) Prešov, Slovakia\n* ![Germany](image) Saarbrücken, Germany\n* ![Japan](image) Saitama, Japan\n* ![Nicaragua](image) San Isidro, Nicaragua\n* ![England](image) Sheffield, England[g]\n* ![North Macedonia](image) Skopje, North Macedonia\n* ![Bulgaria](image) Sofia, Bulgaria\n* ![China](image) Wuhan, China\n* ![Croatia](image) Zagreb, Croatia\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Greater Pittsburgh Region\n* List of fiction set in Pittsburgh\n* List of municipalities in Pennsylvania\n* List of people from Pittsburgh\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The neighborhoods are Arlington Heights, Bluff, Brighton Heights, Crafton Heights, Duquesne Heights, East Hills, Fineview, Highland Park, Middle Hill, Mount Oliver, Mount Washington, Northview Heights, Perry North (also known as Observatory Hill), Perry South (also known as Perry Hilltop), Polish Hill, Ridgemont, South Side Slopes, Spring Hill-City View, Squirrel Hill, Stanton Heights, Summer Hill, Troy Hill, and Upper Hill.\n2. **^** The warmest daily minimum at the current observation location, Pittsburgh Int'l, is only 77 °F (25 °C) on July 23, 2010, and July 16, 1980.[74]\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Records kept September 1874 to June 1935 at the Weather Bureau Office across the Allegheny River from downtown, at Allegheny County Airport from July 1935 to 14 September 1952, and at Pittsburgh Int'l (KPIT) since 15 September 1952. Due to its river valley and urban location as well as elevation, many of the summertime warm minima temperature records set at the WBO have not even come close to being matched at KPIT, which is at-elevation and located in the western suburbs.

It is the second-most populous city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia and the 68th-most populous city in the U.S. with a population of 302,971 as of the 2020 census. The city anchors the Pittsburgh metropolitan area of Western Pennsylvania; its population of 2.457 million is the largest in both the Ohio Valley and Appalachia, the second-largest in Pennsylvania, and the 26th-largest in the U.S. Furthermore, it is the principal city of the greater Pittsburgh–Weirton–Steubenville combined statistical area that extends into Ohio and West Virginia.\n\n\nPittsburgh is located in southwest Pennsylvania at the confluence of the Allegheny River and the Monongahela River, which combine to form the Ohio River.[5] It developed as a vital link of the Atlantic coast and Midwest, as the mineral-rich Allegheny Mountains led to the region being contested by the French and British empires, Virginians, Whiskey Rebels, and Civil War raiders.[6] Pittsburgh is known both as \"the Steel City\" for its dominant role in the history of the U.S. steel industry, and as the \"City of Bridges\" for its 446 bridges.[7] For part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was behind only New York City and Chicago in corporate headquarters employment; it had the most U.S. stockholders per capita.[8] Deindustrialization in the 1970s and 1980s laid off area blue-collar workers as steel and other heavy industries declined, and thousands of downtown white-collar workers also lost jobs when several Pittsburgh-based companies moved out.[9]\n\n\nAfter 1990, Pittsburgh transformed into a hub for the healthcare, education, and technology industries.[10] Pittsburgh is home to large medical providers, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Allegheny Health Network, and 68 colleges and universities, including research and development leaders Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh.[11] The area has served as the federal agency headquarters for cyber defense, software engineering, robotics, energy research and the nuclear navy.[12] In the private sector, Pittsburgh-based PNC is the nation's fifth-largest bank, and the city is home to eight Fortune 500 companies, and seven of the largest 300 U.S. law firms. RAND Corporation, BNY Mellon, Nova, FedEx, Bayer, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have regional headquarters and offices that helped Pittsburgh become the sixth-best area for U.S. job growth.[13] Furthermore, the region is a hub for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and energy extraction.[14]\n\n\nPittsburgh's rich industrial history left the area with renowned cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens, the National Aviary, and a diverse cultural district.[15] The city's major league professional sports teams include the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pittsburgh Pirates. Pittsburgh is additionally where Jehovah's Witnesses traces its earliest origins, and was the host of the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh was named in 1758, by General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. As Forbes was a Scotsman, he probably pronounced the name /ˈpɪtsbərə/ *PITS-bər-ə* (similar to Edinburgh).[16][17]\n\n\nPittsburgh was incorporated as a borough on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:[18]\n\"Be it enacted by the Pennsylvania State Senate and Pennsylvania House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ... by the authority of the same, that the said town of Pittsburgh shall be ... erected into a borough, which shall be called the borough of Pittsburgh for ever.\"[19]\n\n\nFrom 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as \"Pittsburg\", though use of the final *h* was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.[20][16] After a public campaign, the federal decision to drop the *h* was reversed.[16] The *Pittsburg Press* continued spelling the city without an *h* until 1921.[21]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Pittsburgh and Name of Pittsburgh\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Pittsburgh.\n\nHistorical claims\n\n\n> \n> French Empire 1669–1758  \n> British Empire 1681–1781  \n> United States 1776–present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n### Native Americans[edit]\n\n\nThe area of the Ohio headwaters was long inhabited by the Shawnee and several other settled groups of Native Americans.[22] Shannopin's Town was an 18th-century Lenape (Delaware) town located roughly from where Penn Avenue is today, below the mouth of Two Mile Run, from 30th Street to 39th Street. According to George Croghan, the town was situated on the south bank of the Allegheny, nearly opposite what is now known as Herr's Island, in what is now the Lawrenceville neighborhood.[23]: 289\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\n![](image)Fort Pitt Block House, built by the British in 1764, is the oldest extant structure in Pittsburgh.\nThe first known European to enter the region was the French explorer Robert de La Salle from Quebec during his 1669 expedition down the Ohio River.[24][*better source needed*] European pioneers, primarily Dutch, followed in the early 18th century. Michael Bezallion was the first to describe the forks of the Ohio in a 1717 manuscript, and later that year European fur traders established area posts and settlements.[25]\n\n\nIn 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite Canada with French Louisiana via the rivers.[25] During 1753–1754, the British hastily built Fort Prince George before a larger French force drove them off. The French built Fort Duquesne based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War, began with the future Pittsburgh as its center. British General Edward Braddock was dispatched with Major George Washington as his aide to take Fort Duquesne.[26] The British and colonial force were defeated at Braddock's Field. General John Forbes finally took the forks in 1758. He began construction on Fort Pitt, named after William Pitt the Elder, while the settlement was named \"Pittsborough\".[27]\n\n\nDuring Pontiac's War, a loose confederation of Native American tribes laid siege to Fort Pitt in 1763; the siege was eventually lifted after Colonel Henry Bouquet defeated a portion of the besieging force at the Battle of Bushy Run. Bouquet strengthened the defenses of Fort Pitt the next year.[28][29][30][31]\n\n\nDuring this period, the powerful nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, the Penns were allowed to purchase the modern region from the Iroquois. A 1769 survey referenced the future city as the \"Manor of Pittsburgh\".[32] Both the Colony of Virginia and the Province of Pennsylvania claimed the region under their colonial charters until 1780, when they agreed under a federal initiative to extend the Mason–Dixon line westward, placing Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. On March 8, 1771, Bedford County, Pennsylvania was created to govern the frontier.\n\n\nOn April 16, 1771, the city's first civilian local government was created as Pitt Township.[33][34] William Teagarden was the first constable, and William Troop was the first clerk.[35]\n\n\nFollowing the American Revolution, the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the Ohio Country. In 1784, Thomas Viceroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette was started, and in 1787, the Pittsburgh Academy was chartered. Unrest during the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the Appalachian Mountains or through the Great Lakes. Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the Northwest Territory.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![A historic 1857 scene of the Monongahela River in downtown Pittsburgh featuring a steamboat](image)The Monongahela River and its surroundings in 1857\n![](image)Lithograph of Pittsburgh by Otto Krebs (before 1874)\n![](image)Burning of Union Depot during the Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877\nThe federal government recognizes Pittsburgh as the starting point for the Lewis and Clark Expedition.[36] Preparations began in Pittsburgh in 1803 when Meriwether Lewis purchased a keelboat that would later be used to ascend the Missouri River.[37]\n\n\nThe War of 1812 cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats, that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\n\n\nIn the 1830s, many Welsh people from the Merthyr steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the Merthyr Rising. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the Allegheny Mountains. The Great Fire of Pittsburgh destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the Great Famine. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, the most came from Germany.\n\n\nBecause Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the Underground Railroad in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.[38] The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.[39] Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.[38]\n\n\nThe American Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. Andrew Carnegie began steel production in 1875 at the Edgar Thomson Steel Works in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, which evolved into the Carnegie Steel Company. He adopted the Bessemer process to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![Bird's Eye View of Pittsburgh, 1902](image)An aerial view of Pittsburgh in 1902[40]\n![](image)Steel mills in the Strip District in 1906\nIn 1901, J. P. Morgan and attorney Elbert H. Gary merged Carnegie Steel Company and several other companies into U.S. Steel. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.\n\n\nThe Pittsburgh Agreement was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by T. G. Masaryk, concerning the future foundation of Czechoslovakia.[41]\n\n\nThe city suffered severe flooding in March 1936.\n\n\nThe city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.[42] Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American Great Migration from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.[43] Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.[44]\n\n\nDuring World War II, demand for steel increased and area mills operated 24 hours a day to produce 95 million tons of steel for the war effort.[27] This resulted in the highest levels of air pollution in the city's almost century of industry. The city's reputation as the \"arsenal of democracy\"[45][46] was being overshadowed by James Parton's 1868 observation of Pittsburgh being \"hell with the lid off.\"[47]\n\n\nFollowing World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the \"Renaissance,\" cleaning up the air and the rivers. The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.[9]\n\n\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDuring the late 2000s recession, Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.[48]\n\n\nIn September 2009, the 2009 G20 Pittsburgh summit was held in Pittsburgh.[49]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Regional identity\n\n![](image)Downtown Pittsburgh and the Duquesne Incline from Mount Washington\nPittsburgh has an area of 58.3 square miles (151 km2), of which 55.6 square miles (144 km2) is land and 2.8 square miles (7.3 km2), or 4.75%, is water. The 80th meridian west passes directly through the city's downtown.\n\n\nThe city is on the Allegheny Plateau, within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau.[50] The Downtown area (also known as the Golden Triangle) sits where the Allegheny River flows from the northeast and the Monongahela River from the southeast to form the Ohio River. The convergence is at Point State Park and is referred to as \"the Point.\" The city extends east to include the Oakland and Shadyside sections, which are home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham University, Carnegie Museum and Library, and many other educational, medical, and cultural institutions. The southern, western, and northern areas of the city are primarily residential.\n\n\nMany Pittsburgh neighborhoods are steeply sloped with two-lane roads. More than a quarter of neighborhood names make reference to \"hills,\" \"heights,\" or similar features.[a]\n\n\nThe steps of Pittsburgh consist of 800 sets of outdoor public stairways with 44,645 treads and 24,090 vertical feet. They include hundreds of streets composed entirely of stairs, and many other steep streets with stairs for sidewalks.[51] Many provide vistas of the Pittsburgh area while attracting hikers and fitness walkers.[52]\n\n\nBike and walking trails have been built to border many of the city's rivers and hollows. The Great Allegheny Passage and Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Towpath connect the city directly to downtown Washington, D.C. (some 335 miles [539 km] away) with a continuous bike/running trail.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n#### Areas[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Pittsburgh neighborhoods, List of tallest buildings in Pittsburgh, List of City of Pittsburgh historic designations, and List of Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmarks\n\n![](image)Pittsburgh's 90 distinct neighborhoods\nThe city consists of the Downtown area, called the Golden Triangle,[53] and four main areas surrounding it. These surrounding areas are subdivided into distinct neighborhoods (Pittsburgh has 90 neighborhoods).[54] Relative to downtown, these areas are known as the Central, North Side/North Hills, South Side/South Hills, East End, and West End.\n\n\n\n##### Golden Triangle[edit]\n\n\nDowntown Pittsburgh has 30 skyscrapers, nine of which top 500 feet (150 m). The U.S. Steel Tower is the tallest, at 841 ft (256 m).[55] The Cultural District consists of a 14-block area of downtown along the Allegheny River. This district contains many theaters and arts venues and is home to a growing residential segment. Most significantly, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is embarking on RiverParc, a four-block mixed-use \"green\" community, featuring 700 residential units and multiple towers of between 20 and 30 stories. The Firstside portion of Downtown borders the Monongahela River, the historic Mon Wharf and hosts the distinctive PPG Place Gothic-style glass skyscraper complex. New condo towers have been constructed and historic office towers are converted to residential use, increasing 24-hour residents. Downtown is served by the Port Authority's light rail system and multiple bridges leading north and south.[56] It is also home to Point Park University and Duquesne University which borders Uptown.\n\n\n\n##### North Side[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: North Side (Pittsburgh)\n\n![](image)Townhouses in the Mexican War Streets neighborhood\nThe North Side is home to various neighborhoods in transition. What is known today as Pittsburgh's North Side was once known as Allegheny City, and operated as a city independently of Pittsburgh until it was merged with Pittsburgh in 1907 under great protest from its citizens. The North Side is primarily composed of residential neighborhoods and is noteworthy for its well-constructed and architecturally interesting homes. Many buildings date from the 19th century and are constructed of brick or stone and adorned with decorative woodwork, ceramic tile, slate roofs and stained glass. The North Side is also home to attractions such as Acrisure Stadium, PNC Park, Carnegie Science Center, National Aviary, Andy Warhol Museum, Mattress Factory art museum, Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, Randyland, Penn Brewery, Allegheny Observatory, and Allegheny General Hospital.[57]\n\n\n\n##### South Side[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: South Side (Pittsburgh)\n\n![](image)East Carson Street in the South Side Flats\nThe South Side was once the site of railyards and associated dense, inexpensive housing for mill and railroad workers. Since the late 20th century, the city undertook a Main Street program in cooperation with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, encouraging design and landscape improvements on East Carson Street, and supporting new retail. The area has become a local Pittsburgher destination, and the value of homes in the South Side had increased in value by about 10% annually for the 10 years up to 2014.[58] East Carson Street has developed as one of the most vibrant areas of the city, packed with diverse shopping, ethnic eateries, vibrant nightlife, and live music venues.\n\n\nIn 1993 the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh purchased the South Side Works steel mill property. It collaborated with the community and various developers to create a master plan for a mixed-use development, to include a riverfront park, office space, housing, health-care facilities, and indoor practice fields for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Pitt Panthers. Construction began in 1998. The SouthSide Works has been open since 2005, featuring many stores, restaurants, offices, and the world headquarters for American Eagle Outfitters.[59]\n\n\n\n##### East End[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shadyside neighborhood\nThe East End of Pittsburgh is home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University, Chatham University, The Carnegie Institute's Museums of Art and Natural History, Phipps Conservatory, and Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall. It is also home to many parks and public spaces including Mellon Park, Westinghouse Park, Schenley Park, Frick Park, The Frick Pittsburgh, Bakery Square, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. The neighborhoods of Shadyside and Squirrel Hill are large, wealthy neighborhoods with some apartments and condos, and pedestrian-oriented shopping/business districts. Squirrel Hill is also known as the hub of Jewish life in Pittsburgh, home to approximately 20 synagogues.[60] Oakland, heavily populated by undergraduate and graduate students, is home to most of the universities, and the Petersen Events Center. The Strip District to the west along the Allegheny River is an open-air marketplace by day and a clubbing destination by night. Bloomfield is Pittsburgh's Little Italy and is known for its Italian restaurants and grocers. Lawrenceville is a revitalizing rowhouse neighborhood popular with artists and designers. The Hill District was home to photographer Charles Harris as well as various African-American jazz clubs.[61] Other East End neighborhoods include Point Breeze, Regent Square, Highland Park, Homewood, Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar, Larimer, East Hills, East Liberty, Polish Hill, Hazelwood, Garfield, Morningside, and Stanton Heights.\n\n\n\n##### West End[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: West End (Pittsburgh) § Region\n\nThe West End includes Mt. Washington, with its famous view of the downtown skyline, and numerous other residential neighborhoods such as Sheraden and Elliott.\n\n\n\n#### Ethnicities[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Summers are hot and winters are moderately cold with wide variations in temperature. Despite this, it has one of the most pleasant summer climates between medium and large cities in the U.S.[69][70][71] The city and river valleys lie in the USDA plant hardiness zone 6b while higher elevated areas and some suburbs lie in zone 6a.[72] The area has four distinct seasons: winters are cold and snowy, springs and falls are mild with moderate levels of sunshine, and summers are warm. As measured by percent possible sunshine, summer is by far the sunniest season.[73]\n\n\nThe warmest month of the year in Pittsburgh is July, with a 24-hour average of 73.2 °F (22.9 °C). Conditions are often humid, and combined with highs reaching 90 °F (32 °C) on an average 9.5 days a year,[74] a considerable heat index arises. The coolest month is January, when the 24-hour average is 28.8 °F (−1.8 °C), and lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below can be expected on an average 2.6 nights per year.[74] Officially, record temperatures range from −22 °F (−30 °C), on January 19, 1994 to 103 °F (39 °C), which occurred three times, most recently on July 16, 1988; the record cold daily maximum is −3 °F (−19 °C), which occurred three times, most recently the day of the all-time record low, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 82 °F (28 °C) on July 1, 1901.[74][b] Due to elevation and location on the windward side of the Appalachian Mountains, 100 °F (38 °C)+ readings are very rare, and were last seen on July 15, 1995.[74]\n\n\nAverage annual precipitation is 39.61 inches (1,006 mm) and precipitation is greatest in May while least in October; annual precipitation has historically ranged from 22.65 in (575 mm) in 1930 to 57.83 in (1,469 mm) in 2018.[75] On average, December and January have the greatest number of precipitation days. Snowfall averages 44.1 inches (112 cm) per season, but has historically ranged from 8.8 in (22 cm) in 1918–19 to 80 in (200 cm) in 1950–51.[76] There is an average of 59 clear days and 103 partly cloudy days per year, while 203 days are cloudy.[77] In terms of annual percent-average possible sunshine received, Pittsburgh (45%) is similar to Seattle (49%).\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh International Airport), 1991–2020 normals,[c] extremes 1874–present[d] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 75(24)\n | 78(26)\n | 84(29)\n | 90(32)\n | 95(35)\n | 98(37)\n | 103(39)\n | 103(39)\n | 102(39)\n | 91(33)\n | 82(28)\n | 74(23)\n | 103(39)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 61.5(16.4)\n | 63.2(17.3)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 81.5(27.5)\n | 86.8(30.4)\n | 90.4(32.4)\n | 91.3(32.9)\n | 90.3(32.4)\n | 88.2(31.2)\n | 79.9(26.6)\n | 70.8(21.6)\n | 62.6(17.0)\n | 92.6(33.7)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 36.3(2.4)\n | 39.6(4.2)\n | 49.1(9.5)\n | 62.4(16.9)\n | 71.9(22.2)\n | 79.4(26.3)\n | 82.9(28.3)\n | 81.7(27.6)\n | 75.1(23.9)\n | 63.1(17.3)\n | 50.9(10.5)\n | 40.6(4.8)\n | 61.1(16.2)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 28.8(−1.8)\n | 31.4(−0.3)\n | 39.7(4.3)\n | 51.5(10.8)\n | 61.2(16.2)\n | 69.4(20.8)\n | 73.2(22.9)\n | 71.8(22.1)\n | 64.9(18.3)\n | 53.4(11.9)\n | 42.6(5.9)\n | 33.7(0.9)\n | 51.8(11.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 21.4(−5.9)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 30.3(−0.9)\n | 40.7(4.8)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 59.3(15.2)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n | 54.8(12.7)\n | 43.7(6.5)\n | 34.3(1.3)\n | 26.7(−2.9)\n | 42.5(5.8)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 1.0(−17.2)\n | 5.0(−15.0)\n | 11.7(−11.3)\n | 25.4(−3.7)\n | 35.6(2.0)\n | 45.2(7.3)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 51.1(10.6)\n | 41.2(5.1)\n | 29.5(−1.4)\n | 19.3(−7.1)\n | 9.7(−12.4)\n | −1.5(−18.6)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −22(−30)\n | −20(−29)\n | −5(−21)\n | 11(−12)\n | 26(−3)\n | 34(1)\n | 42(6)\n | 39(4)\n | 31(−1)\n | 16(−9)\n | −1(−18)\n | −12(−24)\n | −22(−30)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 2.96(75)\n | 2.62(67)\n | 3.15(80)\n | 3.32(84)\n | 3.83(97)\n | 4.12(105)\n | 4.26(108)\n | 3.52(89)\n | 3.30(84)\n | 2.83(72)\n | 2.86(73)\n | 2.84(72)\n | 39.61(1,006)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 13.3(34)\n | 11.7(30)\n | 7.6(19)\n | 1.0(2.5)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.4(1.0)\n | 2.4(6.1)\n | 7.7(20)\n | 44.1(112)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 16.8\n | 13.9\n | 14.0\n | 13.9\n | 13.5\n | 12.4\n | 11.2\n | 10.5\n | 9.8\n | 11.1\n | 12.0\n | 14.6\n | 153.7\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 12.2\n | 9.3\n | 5.9\n | 1.6\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.3\n | 3.3\n | 7.6\n | 40.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 69.9\n | 67.3\n | 64.1\n | 59.8\n | 63.4\n | 66.2\n | 68.8\n | 71.2\n | 72.0\n | 68.3\n | 70.2\n | 71.9\n | 67.8\n |\n| Average dew point °F (°C)\n | 17.2(−8.2)\n | 18.9(−7.3)\n | 26.8(−2.9)\n | 34.5(1.4)\n | 45.9(7.7)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 60.1(15.6)\n | 59.5(15.3)\n | 53.4(11.9)\n | 40.8(4.9)\n | 32.4(0.2)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 39.0(3.9)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 93.9\n | 108.5\n | 155.4\n | 182.8\n | 217.4\n | 242.2\n | 254.9\n | 228.4\n | 196.7\n | 167.3\n | 99.4\n | 74.4\n | 2,021.3\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 31\n | 36\n | 42\n | 46\n | 49\n | 54\n | 56\n | 54\n | 53\n | 48\n | 33\n | 26\n | 45\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 2\n | 2\n | 4\n | 6\n | 6\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 3\n | 2\n | 1\n | 4\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (relative humidity, dew point and sun 1961–1990)[74][78][73][79] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV)[80] |\n\n#### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, the \"State of the Air\" report from the American Lung Association (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. Outside of California, Allegheny County is the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.[81]\n\n\nIn a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the American Lung Association ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.[82][83] The area has improved its air quality with every annual survey. The ALA's rankings have been disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), since data from only the worst of the region's 20 air quality monitors is considered by the ALA, without any context or averaging. The lone monitor used is immediately downwind and adjacent to U.S. Steel's Clairton Coke Works, the nation's largest coke mill, and several municipalities outside the city's jurisdiction of pollution controls, leading to possible confusion that Pittsburgh is the source or center of the emissions cited in the survey.[84] The region's readings also reflect pollution swept in from Ohio and West Virginia.[85]\n\n\nAlthough the county was still below the \"pass\" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.[86] ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated \"It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ... We've seen a steady decrease in pollution levels over the past decade and certainly over the past 20, 30, 40, 50 years, or more.\"[87]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017, a crowd sourced air quality monitoring application, Smell PGH, was launched. As air quality is still a concern of many in the area, the app allows for users to report odd smells and informs local authorities.[88]\n\n\nThe city contains 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets, by the last count conducted in 2005. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the urban forest contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Water quality[edit]\n\n\nThe local rivers continue to have pollution levels exceeding EPA limits.[90] This is caused by frequently overflowing untreated sewage into local waterways, due to flood conditions and antiquated infrastructure. Pittsburgh has a combined sewer system, where its sewage pipes contain both stormwater and wastewater. The pipes were constructed in the early 1900s, and the sewage treatment plant was built in 1959.[91] Due to insufficient improvements over time, the city is faced with public health concerns regarding its water.[92] As little as a tenth of an inch of rain causes runoffs from the sewage system to drain into local rivers.[93] Nine billion gallons of untreated waste and stormwater flow into rivers, leading to health hazards and Clean Water Act violations.[94] The local sewage authority, Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, or ALCOSAN, is operating under Consent Decree from the EPA to come up with solutions.[95] In 2017, ALCOSAN proposed a $2 billion upgrade to the system which is moving closer to EPA approval.[96]\n\n\nPittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) is the city's agency required to replace pipes and charge water rates. They have come under fire from both city and state authorities due to alleged mismanagement.[97] In 2017, Mayor William Peduto advocated for a restructuring of the PWSA and a partially privatized water authority.[98] Governor Wolf subsequently assigned the PWSA to be under the oversight of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).[97]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 1,565 |  | — |\n| 1810 | 4,768 |  | 204.7% |\n| 1820 | 7,248 |  | 52.0% |\n| 1830 | 12,568 |  | 73.4% |\n| 1840 | 21,115 |  | 68.0% |\n| 1850 | 46,601 |  | 120.7% |\n| 1860 | 49,221 |  | 5.6% |\n| 1870 | 86,076 |  | 74.9% |\n| 1880 | 156,389 |  | 81.7% |\n| 1890 | 238,617 |  | 52.6% |\n| 1900 | 321,616 |  | 34.8% |\n| 1910 | 533,905 |  | 66.0% |\n| 1920 | 588,343 |  | 10.2% |\n| 1930 | 669,817 |  | 13.8% |\n| 1940 | 671,659 |  | 0.3% |\n| 1950 | 676,806 |  | 0.8% |\n| 1960 | 604,332 |  | −10.7% |\n| 1970 | 520,117 |  | −13.9% |\n| 1980 | 423,938 |  | −18.5% |\n| 1990 | 369,879 |  | −12.8% |\n| 2000 | 334,563 |  | −9.5% |\n| 2010 | 305,704 |  | −8.6% |\n| 2020 | 302,971 |  | −0.9% |\n| 2022 (est.) | 302,898 |  | 0.0% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[99][100][2] |\n\n\nAt the 2010 census, there were 305,704 people residing in Pittsburgh, a decrease of 8.6% since 2000; 66.0% of the population was White, 25.8% Black or African American, 0.2% American Indian and Alaska Native, 4.4% Asian, 0.3% Other, and 2.3% mixed; in 2020, 2.3% of Pittsburgh's population was of Hispanic or Latino American origin of any race.

About 15.0% of families and 20.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 27.5% of those under the age of 18 and 13.5% ages 65 or older. By the 2019 American Community Survey, the median income for a household increased to $53,799.[112] Families had a median income of $68,922; married-couple families had a median income of $93,500; and non-family households had a median income of $34,448. Pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs within city limits are Squirrel Hill and Point Breeze, the only two areas of the city which have average household incomes over $100,000 a year. Outside of city limits, Sewickley Heights is by a wide margin the wealthiest suburb of Pittsburgh within Allegheny County, with an average yearly household income of just over $218,000. Sewickely Heights is seen as one of Pittsburgh's wealthiest suburbs culturally as well, titles which the suburbs of Upper St. Clair, Fox Chapel, Wexford, and Warrendale also have been bestowed.[113][114]\n\n\nIn a 2002 study, Pittsburgh ranked 22nd of 69 urban places in the U.S. in the number of residents 25 years or older who had completed a bachelor's degree, at 31%.[115] Pittsburgh ranked 15th of the 69 places in the number of residents 25 years or older who completed a high school degree, at 84.7%.[116]\n\n\nThe metro area has shown greater residential racial integration during the last 30 years. The 2010 census ranked 18 other U.S. metros as having greater black-white segregation, while 32 other U.S. metros rank higher for black-white isolation.[117]\n\n\nAs of 2018, much of Pittsburgh's population density was concentrated in the central, southern, and eastern areas. The city limits itself have a population density of 5,513 people per square mile; its most densely populated parts are North Oakland (at 21,200 per square mile) and Uptown Pittsburgh (at 19,869 per square mile). Outside of the city limits, Dormont and Mount Oliver are Pittsburgh's most densely-populated neighborhoods, with 11,167 and 9,902 people per square mile respectively.[118]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Pittsburgh\n\nSee also: List of corporations in Pittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh has adapted since the collapse of its century-long steel and electronics industries. The region has shifted to high technology, robotics, health care, nuclear engineering, tourism, biomedical technology, finance, education, and services. Annual payroll of the region's technology industries, when taken in aggregate, exceeded $10.8 billion in 2007,[119] and in 2010 there were 1,600 technology companies.[120] A National Bureau of Economic Research 2014 report named Pittsburgh the second-best U.S. city for intergenerational economic mobility[121] or the American Dream.[122] Reflecting the citywide shift from industry to technology, former factories have been renovated as modern office space. Google has research and technology offices in a refurbished 1918–1998 Nabisco factory, a complex known as Bakery Square.[123] Some of the factory's original equipment, such as a large dough mixer, were left standing in homage to the site's industrial roots.[124] Pittsburgh's transition from its industrial heritage has earned it praise as \"the poster child for managing industrial transition\".[125] Other major cities in the northeast and mid-west have increasingly borrowed from Pittsburgh's model in order to renew their industries and economic base.[126]\n\n\nThe largest employer in the city is the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, with 48,000 employees. All hospitals, outpatient clinics, and doctor's office positions combine for 116,000 jobs, approximately 10% of the jobs in the region. An analyst recently observed of the city's medical sector: \"That's both more jobs and a higher share of the region's total employment than the steel industry represented in the 1970s.\"[127]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Top publicly traded companiesin the Pittsburgh region for 2022**(ranked by revenues)*with metropolitan and U.S. ranks* |\n| **Metro** |  | **corporation** |  | **US** |  |\n| 1 |  | The Kraft Heinz Company |  | 139\n |  |\n| 2 |  | U.S. Steel |  | 172\n |  |\n| 3 |  | PNC Financial Services |  | 178\n |  |\n| 4 |  | Viatris |  | 204\n |  |\n| 5 |  | PPG Industries |  | 218\n |  |\n| 6 |  | Dick's Sporting Goods |  | 307\n |  |\n| 7 |  | Alcoa |  | 312\n |  |\n| 8 |  | WESCO International |  | 357\n |  |\n| 9 |  | Wabtec |  | 439\n |  |\n| 10 |  | Arconic |  | 452\n |  |\n|  |\n\n Education is a major economic driver in the region.

The National Negro Opera Company was founded in the city as the first all African-American opera company in the United States. This led to the prominence of African-American singers like Leontyne Price in the world of opera. One of the greatest American musicians and composers of the 20th century, Billy Strayhorn, grew up and was educated in Pittsburgh.\n\n\nPittsburgh's Wiz Khalifa is a recent artist to have a number one record.

Pittsburgh is home to over six-hundred heavy metal bands,[145] as well as heavy metal coffee shops[146] and bars. The city is noted for its doom metal, metalcore, and death metal scenes.\n\n\nThroughout the 1990s there was an electronic music subculture in Pittsburgh which likely traced its origins to similar Internet chatroom-based movements in Detroit, Cleveland, Minneapolis, and across the United States.[147][148][149] Pittsburgh promoters and DJs organized raves in warehouses, ice rinks, barns, and fields which eventually attracted thousands of attendees, some of whom were high school students or even younger.[148][150][151] As the events grew more popular, they drew internationally known DJs such as Adam Beyer and Richie Hawtin.[148] Pittsburgh rave culture itself spawned at least one well-known artist, the drum and bass DJ Dieselboy, who attended the University of Pittsburgh between 1990 and 1995.[147][152]\n\n\nSince 2012, Pittsburgh has been the home of Hot Mass, an afterhours electronic music dance party which critics have compared favorably to European nightclubs and parties.[153][154] Electronic music artist and DJ Yaeji credits Hot Mass with her \"indoctrination into nightlife\"; she regularly attended the party while studying at Carnegie Mellon University.[155][156]\n\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theatre in Pittsburgh\n\n![](image)Benedum Center\nThe city's first play was produced at the old courthouse in 1803[25] and the first theater built in 1812.[25] Collegiate companies include the University of Pittsburgh's Repertory Theatre and Kuntu Repertory Theatre, Point Park University's resident companies at its Pittsburgh Playhouse, and Carnegie Mellon University's School of Drama productions and Scotch'n'Soda organization.

Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, David McCullough was born and raised in Pittsburgh.[159] Annie Dillard, a Pulitzer Prize–winning writer, was born and raised in Pittsburgh. Much of her memoir *An American Childhood* takes place in post-World War II Pittsburgh. Award-winning author John Edgar Wideman grew up in Pittsburgh and has based several of his books, including the memoir *Brothers and Keepers*, in his hometown. Poet Terrance Hayes, winner of the 2010 National Book Award and a 2014 MacArthur Foundation Fellow, received his MFA from the University of Pittsburgh, where he is a faculty member. Poet Michael Simms, founder of Autumn House Press, resides in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Poet Samuel John Hazo, the first poet Laureate of Pennsylvania, resides in the city. New writers include Chris Kuzneski, who attended the University of Pittsburgh and mentions Pittsburgh in his works, and Pittsburgher Brian Celio, author of *Catapult Soul*, who captured the Pittsburgh 'Yinzer' dialect in his writing. Pittsburgh's unique literary style extends to playwrights,[160] as well as local graffiti and hip hop artists.\n\n\nPittsburgh's position as the birthplace for community owned television and networked commercial television helped spawn the modern children's show genres exemplified by *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood*, *Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?*, *Happy's Party*, *Cappelli & Company*, and *The Children's Corner*, all nationally broadcast.\n\n\nThe *Pittsburgh Dad* series has showcased the Pittsburghese genre to a global YouTube audience since 2011.\n\n\nThe modern fantasy, macabre and science fiction genre was popularized by director George A. Romero, television's Bill Cardille and his *Chiller Theatre*,[161] director and writer Rusty Cundieff and makeup effects guru Tom Savini.[162] The genre continues today with the PARSEC science fiction organization,[163] The It's Alive Show, the annual \"Zombie Fest\",[164] and several writer's workshops including Write or Die,[165] Pittsburgh SouthWrites,[166] and Pittsburgh Worldwrights[167][168] with Barton Paul Levenson, Kenneth Chiacchia and Elizabeth Humphreys Penrose.\n\n\n\n### Food[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Primanti Bros. sandwich\nPittsburgh is known for several specialties including pierogies, kielbasa, chipped chopped ham sandwiches, and Klondike bars.[169][170] In 2019, Pittsburgh was deemed \"Food City of the Year\" by the San Francisco-based restaurant and hospitality consulting firm af&co.[171] Many restaurants were favorably mentioned, among them were Superior Motors in Braddock, Driftwood Oven in Lawrenceville, Spork in Bloomfield, Fish nor Fowl in Garfield, Bitter Ends Garden & Luncheonette in Bloomfield, and Rolling Pepperoni in Lawrenceville.[172]\n\n\nPittsburgh is home to the annual pickle-themed festival Picklesburgh, which has been named the \"best specialty food festival in America\".[173]\n\n\n\n### Local dialect[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Pennsylvania English\n\nThe Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called *Pittsburghese*, was influenced by Scots-Irish, German, and Eastern European immigrants and African Americans.[174] Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as \"Yinzers\" (from the local word \"yinz\" [var. *yunz*], a blended form of \"you ones\", similar to \"y'all\" and \"you all\" in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: \"slippy\" (slippery), \"redd up\" (clean up), \"jagger bush\" (thorn bush), and \"gum bands\" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb \"to be\". In Pittsburghese one would say \"the car needs washed\" instead of \"needs to be washed\", \"needs washing\", or \"needs a wash.\" The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore, but is noted for its somewhat staccato rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted *The New York Times* to describe Pittsburgh as \"the Galapagos Islands of American dialect\".[175] The lexicon itself contains notable loans from Polish and other European languages; examples include *babushka*, *pierogi*, and *halušky*.[176]\n\n\n\n### Livability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Frick Environmental Center at Frick Park\nPittsburgh has five city parks and several parks managed by the Nature Conservancy. The largest, Frick Park, provides 664 acres (269 ha) of woodland park with extensive hiking and biking trails throughout steep valleys and wooded slopes. Birding enthusiasts visit the Clayton Hill area of Frick Park, where over 100 species of birds have been recorded.[177]\n\n\nResidents living in extremely low-lying areas near the rivers or one of the 1,400 creeks and streams may have occasional floods,[178] such as those caused when the remnants of Hurricane Ivan hit rainfall records in 2004.[179] River flooding is relatively rare due to federal flood control efforts extensively managing locks, dams, and reservoirs.[178][180][181] Residents living near smaller tributary streams are less protected from occasional flooding. The cost of a comprehensive flood control program for the region has been estimated at a prohibitive $50 billion.[178]\n\n\nPittsburgh has the greatest number of bars per capita in the nation.[15]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Pittsburgh\n\nPittsburgh hosted the first professional football game and the first World Series. In 2009, Pittsburgh won the *Sporting News* title of \"Best Sports City\" in the United States[182] and, in 2013, *Sperling's Best Places* \"top 15 cities for baseball\".[183] College sports also have large followings with the University of Pittsburgh in football and sharing Division I basketball fans with Robert Morris and Duquesne.\n\n\nPittsburgh has a long history with its major professional sports teams—the Steelers of the National Football League, the Penguins of the National Hockey League, and the Pirates of Major League Baseball—which all share the same team colors, the official city colors of black and gold.[f] Pittsburgh is the only city in the United States where this practice of sharing team colors in solidarity takes place.[184] The black-and-gold color scheme has since become widely associated with the city and personified in its famous Terrible Towel.[185]\n\n\nThe Pittsburgh Riverhounds are a professional soccer team who have been playing in Pittsburgh since they were established in 1999. They are a member of the USL Championship division, a second-tier league of US professional soccer and are in the league's Eastern Conference.

The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time World Series Champions, were in the first World Series (1903) and claim two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in PNC Park.\n\n\nPittsburgh also has a rich Negro league history, with the former Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s, while the Keystones fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed, \"No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh.\"[189]\n\n\nSince the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive National League Championship Series appearances (1990–92) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason appearances: the 2013 National League Division Series and the 2014–2015 Wild Card games. Their September pennant race in 1997 featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last award for Sporting News' Executive of the Year.[190]\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: American football in Western Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

News of the team has preempted news of elections and other events, and are important to the region and its diaspora. The Steelers have been owned by the Rooney family since the team's founding in 1933, show consistency in coaching (only three coaches since the 1960s all with the same basic philosophy) and are noted as one of sports' most respectable franchises.[191] The Steelers have a long waiting list for season tickets, and have sold out every home game since 1972.[192] The team won four Super Bowls in a six-year span in the 1970s, a fifth Super Bowl in 2006, and a league record sixth Super Bowl in 2009. Since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 they have qualified for the most NFL playoff berths (28) and have played in (15) and hosted (11) the most NFL conference championship games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHigh school football routinely attract 10,000 fans per game and extensive press coverage.[*citation needed*] The Tom Cruise film All the Right Moves and ESPN's Bound for Glory with Dick Butkus both filmed in the area to capture the tradition and passion of local high school football.\n\n\nCollege football in the city dates to 1889 with the Division I (FBS) Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh posting nine national championships and qualifying 34 total bowl games and appearing in the 2018 ACC Championship Game. Local universities Duquesne and Robert Morris have loyal fan bases that follow their lower (FCS) teams. Duquesne, Carnegie Mellon University, and Washington & Jefferson College all posted major bowl games and AP Poll rankings from the 1920s to the 1940s as that era's equivalent of Top 25 FBS programs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAcrisure Stadium serves as home for the Steelers, Panthers, and both the suburban and city high school championships. Playoff franchises Pittsburgh Power and Pittsburgh Gladiators competed in the Arena Football League in the 1980s and 2010s respectively. The Gladiators hosted ArenaBowl I in the city, competing in two, but losing both before moving to Tampa, Florida and becoming the Storm.[193] The Pittsburgh Passion has been the city's professional women's football team since 2002 and plays its home games at Highmark Stadium. The Ed Debartolo owned Pittsburgh Maulers featured a Heisman Trophy winner in the mid-1980s, former superstar University of Nebraska running back Mike Rozier.\n\n\n\n### Hockey[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Since 1999, Hall of Famer and back-to-back playoff MVP Mario Lemieux has served as Penguins owner. Until moving into the PPG Paints Arena in 2010 (when it was known as Consol Energy Center), the team played their home games at the world's first retractable domed stadium, the Civic Arena, or in local parlance \"The Igloo\".[194]\n\n\nIce hockey has had a regional fan base since the 1890s semi-pro Keystones. The city's first ice rink dates back to 1889, when there was an ice rink at the Casino in Schenley Park. From 1896 to 1956, the Exposition Building on the Allegheny River near The Point and Duquesne Gardens in Oakland offered indoor skating.[195]\n\n\nThe NHL awarded one of its first franchises to the city in 1924 on the strength of the back-to-back USAHA championship winning Pittsburgh Yellow Jackets featuring future Hall of Famers and a Stanley Cup winning coach. The NHL's Pittsburgh Pirates made several Stanley Cup playoff runs with a future Hall of Famer before folding from Great Depression financial pressures. Hockey survived with the Pittsburgh Hornets farm team (1936–1967) and their seven finals appearances and three championships in 18 playoff seasons.\n\n\nRobert Morris University fields a Division I college hockey team at the Island Sports Center.

It is considered the birthplace of the national Republican Party,[203] as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. The effects of the Great Depression, combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the 1973 and 1977 elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the 1933 election. The city's ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat.[204]\n\n\nPittsburgh is represented in the Pennsylvania General Assembly by three Senate Districts (Lindsey Williams (D)-38, Wayne D. Fontana (D)-42, and Jay Costa (D)-43) and nine House Districts (Aerion Abney-19, Adam Ravenstahl-20, Sara Innamorato-21, Dan Frankel-23, Martell Covington-24, Dan Deasy-27, Summer Lee-34, and Harry Readshaw-36, Dan Miller-42).\n\n\nFederally, Pittsburgh is part of Pennsylvania's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Summer Lee since 2023 and also by Democrat Chris Deluzio.\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Ford Taurus and a Chevrolet Impala belonging to the Pittsburgh Police\nThe area's largest law enforcement agency is the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, with close to 850 sworn officers.

Wiring the brain around spine damage to restore arm and leg muscle function was successful using robotic arms controlled via an embedded computer to translate signals near a small group of neurons with 200 needles.[256]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Pittsburgh\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Pittsburgh's numerous bridges\nPittsburgh is a city of bridges. With 446,[257] it has three bridges more than Venice, Italy, which has historically held the title \"City of Bridges.\"[258] Around 40 bridges cross the three rivers near the city. The Smithfield Street Bridge was the world's first lenticular truss bridge. The city's Three Sisters Bridges offer a picturesque view of the city from the North. The south-western \"entrance\" to Downtown for travelers coming in from Interstate 79 and the Pittsburgh International Airport is through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and over the Fort Pitt Bridge. The Fort Duquesne Bridge carrying Interstate 279 is the main gateway from Downtown to both PNC Park, Acrisure Stadium and the Rivers Casino. The Panhandle Bridge carries Pittsburgh Regional Transit's Blue/Red/Silver subway lines across the Monongahela River. The renovated J&L Steel Company bridge has been a key traffic/running-biking trail conduit connecting the Southside Works and Pittsburgh Technology Center. Over 2,000 bridges span the landscape of Allegheny County.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Public transportation statistics[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh is served by Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the 26th-largest transit agency in the country prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The \"parkway north\" is Interstate 279 connecting to I-79. The \"crosstown\" is Interstate 579 allowing access to the heart of downtown, the Liberty Tunnels and the PPG Paints Arena. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of Pennsylvania Route 28 and U.S. Route 22 also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. Interstate 70, 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped \"beltway\" with Interstate 68 and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the Mon–Fayette Expressway, Pennsylvania Route 576 and Route 66 also help traffic flow. The non-expressway Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System serves navigation in the region.\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pittsburgh metropolitan area § Airports\n\nPittsburgh International Airport provides commercial passenger service from over 15 airlines to the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. Arnold Palmer Regional Airport also provides limited commercial passenger service and is 44 miles (71 km) east of Pittsburgh.\n\n\nOther airports that have or have had scheduled commercial service include Morgantown Municipal Airport (79 miles (127 km) south of Pittsburgh), Youngstown–Warren Regional Airport (81 miles (130 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Akron–Canton Airport (120 miles (190 km) northwest of Pittsburgh), Johnstown–Cambria County Airport (60 miles (97 km) east of Pittsburgh) and Erie International Airport (123 miles (198 km) north of Pittsburgh).\n\n\n\n### Intercity passenger rail and bus[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Union Station (Pittsburgh) and Grant Street Transportation Center\n\nAmtrak provides intercity rail service to Pittsburgh Union Station, via the *Capitol Limited* between Chicago and Washington, D.C., and the *Pennsylvanian* to New York City.\n\n\nMegabus, Greyhound Lines, and Fullington Trailways connect Pittsburgh with distant cities by bus; Greyhound and Fullington Trailways buses stop at the Grant Street Transportation Center intercity bus terminal. Popular destinations include Philadelphia, New York City, and Washington, D.C.[260]\n\n\nUntil declines in passenger travel in the 1950s and 1960s, several stations served Pittsburgh: Baltimore & Ohio Station, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Station, Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal and Pittsburgh Union Station.\n\n\n\n### Regional mass transit[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pittsburgh Light Rail and Port Authority of Allegheny County § Bus rapid transit\n\n![](image)Steel Plaza subway station\nPittsburgh Regional Transit, formerly known as the Port Authority of Allegheny County, is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area, the nation's 20th-largest metropolitan area, it is the 11th-largest transit agency in the United States.[261] Pittsburgh Regional Transit runs a network of intracity and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline Funicular railway (more commonly known as an \"incline\") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.[262] Pittsburgh Regional Transit owns the Duquesne Incline but it is operated by a non-profit preservation trust,[263] but accepts Pittsburgh Regional Transit passes and charges PRT fares.\n\n\nThe Bus System lines are labeled by number and letter. These are the largest portion of Pittsburgh Regional Transit and serve on streets and designated busways. Buses serve most of the county, extending as far as Pittsburgh International Airport, Monroeville, McCandless, and the borders of Westmoreland County and Beaver County, Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the light rail system (commonly known as the \"T\") runs along both new tracks and those refurbished from the streetcar era. The light rail runs from Acrisure Stadium to South Hills Village and Library, taking commuters through one of two routes: one which serves Castle Shannon, Mt. Lebanon, and Beechview, and the other is an express line using railways through Overbrook.\n\n\n\n### Freight rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Union Station, built in 1903\nPittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the Pennsylvania Railroad first opened service between the city and Philadelphia, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad entered the city in 1871. In 1865 Andrew Carnegie opened the Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the Union Railroad in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while George Westinghouse's Wabtec has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.\n\n\nPittsburgh is home to one of Norfolk Southern Railway's busiest freight corridors, the Pittsburgh Line, and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban Conway Rail Yard, built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. CSX, the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S. also has major operations around Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n### Port[edit]\n\n\nThe Port of Pittsburgh ranks as the 20th-largest port in the United States with almost 34 million short tons of river cargo for 2011, the port ranked ninth-largest in the U.S. when measured in domestic trade.[264]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Pittsburgh\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nPittsburgh's sister cities are:[265]\n\n\n\n* ![Spain](image) Bilbao, Spain\n* ![Vietnam](image) Da Nang, Vietnam\n* ![Paraguay](image) Fernando de la Mora, Paraguay\n* ![Turkey](image) Gaziantep, Turkey\n* ![Scotland](image) Glasgow, Scotland\n* ![Israel](image) Karmiel, Israel\n* ![Cuba](image) Matanzas, Cuba\n* ![Israel](image) Misgav, Israel\n* ![Mexico](image) Naucalpan, Mexico\n* ![Czech Republic](image) Ostrava, Czech Republic\n* ![Slovakia](image) Prešov, Slovakia\n* ![Germany](image) Saarbrücken, Germany\n* ![Japan](image) Saitama, Japan\n* ![Nicaragua](image) San Isidro, Nicaragua\n* ![England](image) Sheffield, England[g]\n* ![North Macedonia](image) Skopje, North Macedonia\n* ![Bulgaria](image) Sofia, Bulgaria\n* ![China](image) Wuhan, China\n* ![Croatia](image) Zagreb, Croatia\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Greater Pittsburgh Region\n* List of fiction set in Pittsburgh\n* List of municipalities in Pennsylvania\n* List of people from Pittsburgh\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The neighborhoods are Arlington Heights, Bluff, Brighton Heights, Crafton Heights, Duquesne Heights, East Hills, Fineview, Highland Park, Middle Hill, Mount Oliver, Mount Washington, Northview Heights, Perry North (also known as Observatory Hill), Perry South (also known as Perry Hilltop), Polish Hill, Ridgemont, South Side Slopes, Spring Hill-City View, Squirrel Hill, Stanton Heights, Summer Hill, Troy Hill, and Upper Hill.\n2. **^** The warmest daily minimum at the current observation location, Pittsburgh Int'l, is only 77 °F (25 °C) on July 23, 2010, and July 16, 1980.[74]\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Records kept September 1874 to June 1935 at the Weather Bureau Office across the Allegheny River from downtown, at Allegheny County Airport from July 1935 to 14 September 1952, and at Pittsburgh Int'l (KPIT) since 15 September 1952. Due to its river valley and urban location as well as elevation, many of the summertime warm minima temperature records set at the WBO have not even come close to being matched at KPIT, which is at-elevation and located in the western suburbs.

In 1736, a large area north of Philadelphia was deeded by 23 chiefs of the Five Civilized Tribes to three sons of William Penn: John Penn, Thomas Penn, and Richard Penn. The price for this tract included shoes and buckles, hats, shirts, knives, scissors, combs, needles, looking glasses, rum, and pipes.[14]\n\n\nThe land was later part of a 5,000-acre (20 km2) plot that William Allen purchased on September 10, 1735, from his business partner Joseph Turner, who was assigned the land's warrant by Thomas Penn on May 18, 1732.[15] The land was surveyed on November 23, 1736, and again in 1753 as part of an effort to develop a road from Easton to Reading.[15] The 1753 survey reported the presence of a log house owned by Allen that was built around 1740 and was located near the western banks of Jordan Creek in the city. The house was used primarily as a hunting and fishing lodge, but Allen also used it to entertain prominent guests, including James Hamilton, who was his brother-in-law, and John Penn, who was then governor of the Province of Pennsylvania.[15]\n\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nThe geographic area that includes present-day Center City Allentown was acquired in the 1737 Walking Purchase and initially organized, established, and named in 1762 by William Allen, a wealthy shipping merchant who served as a mayor of Philadelphia and chief justice of the Province of Pennsylvania during the colonial era. It is likely that rivalry among the Penns prompted Allen to decide to start the city in 1762.[14]\n\n\nA decade earlier, in 1752, Northampton and Berks counties were formed; Easton was named the county seat of Northampton County, and Reading the county seat of Berks County. In 1763, a year after Allentown's founding, an effort was made by William Allen and others to move the county seat from Easton to Allentown, but the Penns' influence prevailed and the county seat remained in Easton.[14]\n\n\nThe town's original plan, which is detailed in archives now housed at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, included 42 city blocks and 756 lots, most 60 feet (18 m) in width and 230 feet (70 m) in depth. The city was located initially between present-day Fourth and Tenth Streets and Union and Liberty Streets and was initially named Northampton Towne. Many streets on the original plan were named for Allen's children, including Margaret (present-day Fifth Street), William (now Sixth Street), James (now Eighth Street), Ann (now Ninth Street), and John (now Walnut Street). Allen Street (now Seventh Street), the city's main thoroughfare, was named for Allen himself. Hamilton Street was named for James Hamilton, deputy governor of colonial-era Pennsylvania from 1748 to 1754. Gordon Street was named for Patrick Gordon, an earlier deputy governor of colonial Pennsylvania. Chew Street was named for Benjamin Chew, and Turner Street was named for Allen's business partner Joseph Turner.[15] Allen hoped that the city would displace Easton as the seat of Northampton County and become a commercial center due to its location along the Lehigh River and proximity to Philadelphia. Allen gave the property to his son James in 1767.[16]\n\n\nOn March 18, 1811, the city was formally incorporated as a borough. The following year, on March 6, 1812, Lehigh County was established from the western half of Northampton County. Northampton Towne was selected as the county seat of Lehigh County, and present-day Allentown was formally incorporated as a city on March 12, 1867. On April 16, 1838, the city was officially renamed Allentown after years of popular usage by that name.[17]\n\n\n\n### American Revolutionary War[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\nSee also: Farr Building and High German Evangelical Reformed Church\n\nSome of the first Patriot resistance to British colonialism, which led ultimately to the Revolutionary War, began in and around present-day Allentown. On December 21, 1774, a Committee of Observation for the Allentown area was formed by local patriots. Immediately following the Declaration of Independence's signing, the Colonial British government in Allentown began to break down and patriot militias took control. They pressured Tories out of the Allentown area, and patriot militias were expanded. The burden of supplying a military force logistically fell on the people, and requisitions for food, grain, cattle, horses, and cloth were common.[18]\n\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Hessian prisoners of war were kept in Allentown in the vicinity of present-day Seventh and Gordon Streets. Allentown also housed four hospital structures, including one at Zion Reformed Church and one on the grounds of the present-day Farr Building, that were used in treating wounded Continental Army soldiers. In 1777, a factory manufacturing paper cartridges for musket use in the Revolutionary War was relocated to Allentown from nearby Bethlehem. The same year, a shop of 16 armourers was established along Little Lehigh Creek that was used in repairing weapons and manufacturing saddles and scabbards.[15]\n\n\nAfter crossing the Delaware and prevailing in the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776, General George Washington and his Continental Army staff passed through Allentown, proceeding up present-day Lehigh Street, then called Water Street, where they stopped at the foot of the street at a large spring on what is now the property occupied by Wire Mill. There, Washington and his troops rested and watered their horses, then went their way to their post of duty.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Liberty Bell's hiding[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Liberty Bell Museum\n\nAllentown holds historical significance as the location where the Liberty Bell, then known as the State House Bell, was successfully hidden for nine months by American patriots to avoid its capture by the British Army after the fall of Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War. After George Washington's defeat at the Battle of Brandywine in Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was left defenseless and American patriots began preparing for what they saw as an imminent British attack on the city. Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council ordered that 11 bells, including the State House Bell and bells from Philadelphia's Christ Church and St. Peter's Church, be taken down and moved out of Philadelphia to protect them from the British Army, which would melt the bells down to cast into munitions. The bells were transported north to Northampton Towne (present-day Allentown) by two farmers and wagon masters, John Snyder and Henry Bartholomew, and hidden under floorboards in the basement of Zion Reformed Church in present-day Center City Allentown, just prior to Philadelphia's September 1777 fall to the British.\n\n\nA shrine and museum in the church's basement at 622 West Hamilton Street in Allentown, the Liberty Bell Museum, marks and celebrates the precise Allentown location where the Liberty Bell was successfully hidden from September 1777 until its June 18, 1778 return to Philadelphia following the British departure from Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n### Early Allentown[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton Street Bridge in Allentown, constructed between 1812 and 1814, was the first bridge built across the Lehigh River. Three times since, in 1841, 1862, and 1902, the bridge was destroyed by floods and subsequently rebuilt. In the 1980s, the bridge was extensively refurbished.\n![](image)Albertus L. Meyers Bridge, which crosses the Little Lehigh River at 8th Street in Allentown, was the longest and highest concrete bridge in the world at the time of its 1913 opening.[20]\nFollowing the Revolutionary War, Northampton Towne began to slowly grow as both a hub for commerce and ultimately industrialization and as a colonial era population center. Prior to American Revolution, there were 54 homes in Northampton Towne and approximately 330 residents. In 1782, there were 59 houses and over 100 cows were stabled in the town. The town was described by a visitor in 1783, \"One gets a glimpse of many good stone houses, many of them very neat, and everything about the premises shows good order and attention. The people are mainly German who speak bad English and distressing German.\" In 1795, the *U.S. Gazetteer* described Allentown as: \n\n\n> A handsome and flourishing town of Northampton County, pleasantly situated on the point of land formed by the junction of the Jordan Creek and Little Lehigh. It is regularly laid out and contains about ninety dwellings, a German Lutheran and a Calvinist (Zion) Church, an Academy and three merchant mills.[14]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1792, land north of Allentown was purchased by Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company for mining, but it initially proved difficult to transport the region's high quality anthracite coal over the primitive trail system that then existed. Very little anthracite was mined until 1818 when the company began constructing the Lehigh Canal to transport coal from Mauch Chunk, later renamed Jim Thorpe, down the Lehigh River to its confluence with the Delaware River in Easton. In 1829, Lehigh Canal, a 46.6 miles (75.0 km)-long canal on the Lehigh River's east side, was completed for both ascending and descending navigation. Its construction was the most important factor in making anthracite coal, one of the nation's most important domestic and industrial fuels, available to the nation's largest industrial markets in New York City, Philadelphia, and elsewhere.[14][21] In 1855, the first railroad was built on the Lehigh River's west side, and rail soon began to surpass river transport as the means for transporting anthracite through the city.[14][21]\n\n\nUntil 1803, residents of Northampton Towne received their mail in Bethlehem. That year, however, a post office was established inside Compass and Square Hotel at what today is Penn National Bank building on Hamilton Street. After reaching a population of over 700 residents in the 1810 U.S. census, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania granted Northampton Towne legal standing on March 18, 1811, incorporating it initially as the Borough of Northampton in what then was Northampton County. The new borough's government first undertaking was ordering that the city's cows be moved from public streets and into pastures, which proved unpopular. The following year, the city became part of Lehigh County, which was partitioned from a western section of Northampton County to establish the new county.[14][22]\n\n\nIn the early 1800s, the city grew primarily as a court and market town. Northampton Bank, the city's first bank located at the northeast corner of Center Square, was chartered in July 1814, and the first Hamilton Street Bridge, a 530 feet (160 m)-long chain structure, was constructed over the Lehigh River. The bridge featured two suspended lanes, one for east and one for westbound traffic, and a toll house at the bridge's western end.[14][22][23] In 1838, the city's name was officially changed to Allentown.\n\n\nThe 1840s were challenging to Allentown; in 1841, a flood swept away Hamilton Street Bridge and inflicted substantial damage on areas of the city near the Lehigh River. Two years later, in 1843, Northampton Bank failed as a result of the bank's excessive speculation, resulting in financial ruin for many bank customers. Five years later, on June 1, 1848, a large fire burned down most of Allentown's central business district between 7th and 8th Streets on Hamilton Street. During the 1850s, however, the city began recovering. A new bridge was built across the Lehigh River, and brick buildings were constructed to replace wooden ones that were burned in the 1848 fire. In 1852, the first Allentown Fair, now one of the nation's longest continual annual fairs, was held.[14][23]\n\n\n\n### American Civil War[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)A 1920 postcard of West End Park on Linden Street featuring a statue of Ignatz Gresser, a Union Army soldier from Allentown who received the Medal of Honor for acts of valor during the Battle of Antietam\n![](image)The 50th reunion of Allentown's First Defenders, a Union Army unit during the Civil War, in front of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument at Hamilton and South 7th Streets in Center City Allentown, Memorial Day 1911\nOn April 13, 1861, with tensions between the nation's North and South intensifying following the South's secession and its attack on Fort Sumter, residents of Lehigh and Northampton County called a public meeting in Easton to take steps to support the federal government.[24] At the meeting, citizens voted to establish and equip the 1st Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, a new military unit, and placed Captain Samuel Yohe of Easton and Thomas W. Lynn in charge, awarding them the respective ranks of colonel and major. Tilghman H. Good of South Whitehall Township, previously captain of the Allentown militia known as the Allen Rifles and commander of the 4th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, was placed in charge of the 1st Pennsylvania's Company I, which included his former Allen Rifles subordinates and members of the Jordan Artillerist, another Allentown-based militia.\n\n\nIn April 1861, these Allentown units were deployed in response to President Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to defend the nation's capital of Washington, D.C., from the Confederate Army following the bombardment of Fort Sumter.[25] After the Civil War's end, many of these soldiers were named Pennsylvania First Defenders in recognition of being among the first five units to answer Lincoln's call for volunteers to defend the national capital. After protecting Washington, D.C., from April to July 1861, they were honorably discharged and returned home. However, a significant number of them opted to reenlist to defend the nation as the Civil War escalated.[14][26]\n\n\n\n#### 47th Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment\n\nOn August 5, 1861, Andrew Gregg Curtin, Pennsylvania's Civil War-era governor, granted Tilghman H. Good authority to create the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, a new unit commonly known as the 47th Pennsylvania Volunteers.[27] Good secured help from William H. Gausler of Allentown, who was commissioned as a major with the regiment's central command staff, and John Peter Shindel Gobin, a senior officer with the Sunbury Guards in Northumberland County, who was repeatedly cited for valor and was promoted to colonel and ultimately commanding officer of the regiment.[28][29] Companies A and E of the regiment were recruited primarily from Easton and Northampton County; Companies B, G, I, and K were largely recruited from Allentown; Company C was recruited from Northumberland and Juniata counties; Company F was primarily composed of men from Catasaqua; and Companies D and H were recruited from Perry County. The 47th Pennsylvania Volunteers achieved Union victories at the Battle of St. Johns Bluff in Florida (October 1–3, 1862) before suffering a costly defeat in the Second Battle of Pocotaligo in South Carolina (October 21–23, 1862). They were the only Pennsylvania regiment to fight in the Union Army's 1864 Red River campaign across Louisiana.[30]\n\n\nWhile sustaining numerous casualties during the Red River campaign in the spring of 1864, the 47th Pennsylvania helped turn the Civil War in the Union's favor with victories in General Sheridan's 1864 Shenandoah Valley campaign across Virginia, including in the Battles of Berryville, Opequan, Fisher's Hill, and Cedar Creek and then again contributing to the defense of the nation's capital following Lincoln's assassination on April 15, 1865.[28][31][32] Other known Union Army units from Allentown included the 5th, 41st, 128th, and 176th Pennsylvania Infantries.[14][23]\n\n\nOn October 19, 1899, Allentown erected and dedicated the Soldiers and Sailors Monument at 7th and Hamilton Streets in the city's central square, where it still stands, in honor of these Union soldiers from Allentown and local Lehigh Valley towns and boroughs who were killed in defense of the Union's preservation during the Civil War.[14][23][33]\n\n\n\n### Industrialization[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Industrial Revolution in the United States\n\n![](image)An 1889 photo of the Allentown Rolling Mill Company, a sizable 19th and early 20th century iron and steel manufacturer on Washington Street in Allentown\n![](image)A 1910 postcard of Adelaide Silk Mill in Allentown, which opened in 1881 and was one of the world's largest silk mills throughout the early 20th century\n![](image)A 1910 postcard of Allentown's Center Square at North 7th and Hamilton Streets\n![](image)Mack Truck's assembly plant in Allentown in 1945; the company was headquartered in Allentown from 1905 until 2008 when it relocated to Greensboro, North Carolina.\n![](image)West Hamilton Street and 6th Streets in Allentown in 1950\nFile:1960 - Richard Nixon Motorcade Hamilton Street - Allentown PA.jpgRichard Nixon and his motorcade on Hamilton Street in Allentown in October 1960\nThe opening of Lehigh Canal in 1818 quickly transformed Allentown and the surrounding Lehigh Valley from a rural agricultural area dominated by German-speaking people into one of America's first urbanized industrialized areas and expanded the city's commercial and industrial capacity. With this, Allentown underwent significant industrialization, ultimately becoming a major center for heavy industry and manufacturing.\n\n\nAllentown's industrial development accelerated in the late 18th century. David Deshler, Allentown's first shopkeeper, opened a sawmill in the city in 1782. By 1814, industrial plants in Allentown included flour mills, sawmills, two saddle makers, a tannery and tan yard, a woolen mill, a card weaving plant, two gunsmiths, two tobacconists, two clockmakers, and two printers.[14] In 1855, the first railroads to reach Allentown were opened, presenting the Lehigh Canal with direct competition for coal transport. Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad ordered four locomotives, and train stations were built in Allentown, Easton, and Mauch Chunk. In September 1855, the railroad became operational with the Central Railroad of New Jersey providing transport between Allentown and New York City. Transport between Allentown and Philadelphia was made available through Perkiomen Railroad, which operated between Norristown and Freemansburg.[14][22]\n\n\nIn the 1840s, iron ore beds were discovered in hills around Allentown, and a furnace was constructed in 1846 by Allentown Iron Core Company for production of pig iron, a vital component used in the manufacturing of steel. The furnace opened in 1847 under supervision of Samuel Lewis, an expert in iron production, and was followed by the opening of other Allentown plants for production of a wide variety of metal products. In 1860, several smaller iron companies merged to create the Allentown Rolling Mill Company, which became Allentown's largest iron company and contributed to the city and the greater Lehigh Valley region's emergence as a major source for iron ore.[14][22]\n\n\nIn 1850, Leh's, a shoe and ready-to-wear clothing store, was opened in the city by Henry Leh. By 1861, with the Civil War commencing, Leh's emerged as a major source of military boots for the Union Army. In addition to Leh's, eight brick yards, a saw mill, a paint factory, two additional shoe factories, a piano factory, flour mills, breweries, and distilleries all opened in Allentown during the Civil War era.[14][22][23]\n\n\nIn 1883, Allentown Boiler Works was founded in Allentown by Charles Collum. Collum and his partner John D. Knouse built a large facility at 3rd and Gordon Streets in Allentown's First Ward near the Lehigh Valley Railroad yard near what later became Kline's Island. The company manufactured iron products, some of which were used in the construction of high-profile construction projects, including the building of the White House in Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The company's boilers and kilns were used for the production of iron products sold nationally and internationally, including to customers in Canada, Cuba, and the Philippines.[14][22]\n\n\nBrickworks flourished in Allentown through the end of World War I. The clay unearthed in various sections of Allentown and the city's suburbs proved suitable in manufacturing building brick and fire brick. Bricks were the first Allentown products shipped by rail and sold nationally.[14][22] A vibrant food processing industry began emerging in Allentown following the arrival of predominantly German immigrant bakers, who were among Allentown's first settlers. In 1887, Wilson Arbogast and Morris C. Bastian formed Arbogast and Bastian, which provided large scale commercial slaughtering.[14][23]\n\n\nWith industrialization, Allentown emerged as a major regional and national center for banking and finance. In 1860, William H. Ainey founded Allentown Savings and served as its first president. In 1864, Second National Bank of Allentown was formed, and Ainey was elected its first president, a position he held until his death. Ainey contributed to Allentown's industrial and retail growth, helping finance Iowa Barb Wire Company, which was later absorbed by American Steel & Wire, Pioneer Silk Factory, Palace Silk Mill, and Allentown Spinning Company.[23]\n\n\nIn the late 1870s, Allentown's iron industry collapsed, leaving the city economically depressed. Efforts were made to diversify the city's industrial base, including convincing Phoenix Manufacturing Company to open a silk mill in Allentown. Adelaide Mill at Race and Court Streets prompted the opening of Pioneer Silk Mill in 1886, and the city quickly emerged as a national leader in silk manufacturing. The silk industry grew to ultimately become Allentown's largest industry in the late 19th century and remained the city's largest industry through the end of the 20th century. In 1914, there were 26 silk mills in the city. By 1928, after the introduction of rayon, the number of Allentown silk mills grew to 85, and over 10,000 people were employed in the Allentown silk industry at the industry's height in the 1940s.[14][23]\n\n\nIn 1896, Max Hess, a retailer from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, visited Allentown and set about developing Allentown's first department store. He his brother Charles opened Hess Brothers at 9th and Hamilton Streets. Hess's developed a reputation for flamboyance, offering the latest European fashion apparel. The opening of Hess's was following by the opening of a second major department store in the city, the Zollinger-Harned Company, located in the Zollinger-Harned Company Building on Hamilton Street.[14][23]\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, Allentown also began emerging as a major center for the beer brewing industry. Notable Allentown breweries included Horlacher Brewery (founded 1897, closed 1978),[34] Neuweiler Brewery (founded 1875, closed 1968),[35] and Schaefer Beer, whose brewery was later acquired by Pabst and Guinness[36] and is now owned by Boston Beer Company, brewer of Samuel Adams beer.[37]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1905, Jack and Gus Mack moved Mack Trucks, their motor company, from Brooklyn to Allentown, taking over the foundries of Weaver-Hirsh on South 10th Street. By 1914, Mack Trucks developed a global reputation for manufacturing sturdy and reliable trucks and vehicles. Many were sent to Western Front battlefields in France prior to the U.S. formally entering World War I in 1917. The British nicknamed Mack AC's five and seven-ton trucks the \"Bulldog\". Mack eventually grew to have eight manufacturing plants in Allentown and adopted the bulldog as it corporate brand.[14][23]\n\n\n\nLike several other regions in Pennsylvania, Allentown residents continued speaking Pennsylvania German well into the early 20th century. Pennsylvania Guide, compiled by the Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration, described the Pennsylvania Dutch community's impact on Allentown's linguistic landscape, reporting in 1940 that:[38]\n\n\n> Allentown is among the few large Pennsylvania cities where newspapers still carry columns written in the dialect. Although English predominates on the streets, there is a tendency to enunciate the 'v' with open lips, to soften the hard 'g' into 'ch,' and to use too frequently such words as 'already,' 'yet,' and 'once.' Here also are heard such colloquialisms as 'the pie is all,' (all gone) and 'it wonders (mystifies) me.'\n> \n> — Federal Writers' Project, \"Part II: Cities and Towns\", *Pennsylvania: A Guide to the Keystone State* (1940)\n> \n\n\nIn October 1945, following the end of World War II, Western Electric opened a plant on Union Boulevard in Allentown. Six years later, on October 1, 1951, the company manufactured and released the world's first transistor, which was produced at the Allentown-based plant, and the Allentown-based company emerged as a leader in the nation's post-war electronics revolution.[39]\n\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Allentown was a major retailing and entertainment center distinct and separate from Philadelphia and New York City. Hess's, Leh's, and Zollinger department stores led to retail sector growth in Allentown, and dozens of smaller retail stores, restaurants, hotels, banks, and professional offices in the city emerged in present-day Center City Allentown, which was then referred to as downtown Allentown. At least seven cinemas and stage theaters were developed along Hamilton Street between 5th and 10th Streets.[14][23]\n\n\n\n### Late 20th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Deindustrialization and Rust Belt\n\n![](image)A 1974 postcard of Center City Allentown's Hamilton Mall, a failed attempt to redevelop Allentown's central business district as residents began fleeing the city for its suburbs in the 1970s\n![](image)The entrance to PPL Center (left) in Center City Allentown in October 2018\nBy the mid-1960s, Allentown's economy had been booming for decades but the city's rising taxes and regulations prohibiting expansion of the city's geographic limits began leading many of the city's residents, especially those in the post-World War II baby boom generation, to flee Allentown for its suburbs. Salisbury, South Whitehall, and Whitehall townships each had large areas of farmland that were prime locations for residential real estate development. Much of Allentown's working class began migrating to these newer, less-expensive housing developments in Allentown's suburbs, which offered lower taxes, more green space, less crime, and newer schools.\n\n\nThis demographic trend continued throughout the latter part of the 20th century, presenting a major challenge to Allentown's city government and the Allentown School District as it confronted greatly diminished resources. Allentown School District's financial challenges, in turn, further increased the working class flight to Allentown's suburbs, creating a sea change in the city's demographics. With the departure of many working-class families from older Center City Allentown neighborhoods, many homes were sold to landlords who converted them into inexpensive multifamily apartments, many of which became government-subsidized housing projects that were permitted under the city's lax zoning and city codes.\n\n\nWith Allentown's neighborhoods and school system declining, the city focused on attempting to develop its Hamilton Street retail district, largely ignoring Allentown neighborhoods not located in Center City. This also exacerbated the flight of Allentown families to the city's suburbs, leading to the development of shopping centers and services being developed outside the city to accommodate the demand from Allentown's expanding suburban communities. In 1966, Whitehall Mall, the first closed shopping mall north of Philadelphia, opened.\n\n\nTen years later, in 1976, the even larger Lehigh Valley Mall opened north of U.S. Route 22. Stores in Allentown's downtown shopping district began closing, replaced with stores whose customers were less affluent. Large areas of Allentown's downtown were subsequently razed and replaced with parking lots. The downtown business district was rebuilt in an attempt to compete with the newer suburban shopping locations. A multiblock row of stores known as Hamilton Mall was developed, featuring newly covered sidewalks and managed traffic patterns. But the effort was unsuccessful, and two of the city's major department stores, Leh's and Zollingers, were forced to close by 1990. The third, Hess's, was sold to The Bon-Ton in 1994, which closed its Hamilton Mall location two years later, in 1996.[40] In 1993, the Corporate Center, the city's new flagship business center on North Seventh Street, fell victim to a large sinkhole, which led to its condemnation and ultimate demolition.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Allentown, Pennsylvania and Neighborhood Improvement Zone\n\nCombined with challenges confronting Center City Allentown, the manufacturing economy of the Northeastern United States began suffering from deindustrialization associated with foreign competition, trade policies, and manufacturing costs. Many Allentown factories and corporations began closing or relocating.\n\n\nResponding to the late 20th century economic downturn, Allentown consciously sought to begin diversifying its economy in the early 21st century. In the 2000s and 2010s, Allentown's economy saw growth in its service, health care, transportation, warehousing, and some manufacturing industries. In 2009, the Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ), created by the Pennsylvania State Legislature, sought to address Allentown's economic challenges and encourage its development and revitalization. The NIZ includes approximately 128 acres (52 hectares) in Center City Allentown and the city's riverfront district on the Lehigh River's western side.\n\n\nIn 2006, Agere Systems, formerly Western Electric, was acquired by LSI Corporation and relocated to San Jose, California. Mack Trucks relocated to Greensboro, North Carolina in 2009, and other Allentown-based factories downsized considerably or ceased operations entirely. With the city's manufacturing base eroded, once high-paying industrial jobs were replaced with lower-paying service sector jobs, and Allentown began being cited widely as one of the most prominent examples of a late 20th century Rust Belt city.\n\n\nIn 2014, Center City Allentown underwent major restructuring, including constructing and opening PPL Center, a 10,500-capacity indoor arena that now hosts the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, a professional American Hockey League ice hockey team, and other sports, entertainment, and concert events. A full-service Renaissance Hotel also opened, and older office buildings were redeveloped.[41]\n\n\nIn its 2023 edition of \"Best Places to Live\", *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Allentown the ninth-best location in the nation to retire.[42]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Allentown skyline at Christmas in 2017\n![](image)South Mountain, part of the Appalachian Mountain range, with Allentown in the foreground in December 2010\n![](image)Center City Allentown at night in October 2020\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania) and South Mountain (Eastern Pennsylvania)\n\nAllentown's geographic boundaries include a total area of 18.0 square miles (46.6 km2). Of this, 17.8 square miles (46.1 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.5 km2) is water, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Bodies of water include Jordan Creek and its tributary, Little Lehigh Creek, which join within the city limits and empty into the Lehigh River. Other bodies of water in Allentown include Lake Muhlenberg in Cedar Creek Parkway and a pond in Trexler Park.\n\n\n\n#### Adjacent counties[edit]\n\n\nAllentown is located in the Lehigh Valley, an eastern Pennsylvania geographic valley located between two Appalachian mountain ridges, Blue Mountain, which varies from 1,000 feet (300 m) to 1,600 feet (490 m) in height about 17 miles (27 km) north of the city, and South Mountain, a ridge of 500 feet (150 m) to 1,000 feet (300 m) in height that borders Allentown's southern edge. It includes both Lehigh and Northampton counties.\n\n\nThe Lehigh Valley's adjacent counties include Carbon and Monroe counties to its north, Bucks County to its southeast, Montgomery County to its south, Berks and Schuylkill counties to its west, and Warren County, New Jersey to its east.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape and neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Buildings and architecture of Allentown, Pennsylvania; Center City Allentown; and List of Allentown neighborhoods\n\nCenter City Allentown, which includes the downtown area and its 7th Street retail and residential corridor, is the city's central business district and the location of most of its city, county, and federal government buildings. To the east of Center City are The Wards, residential areas developed during Allentown's late 19th century and early 20th century industrial boom. Just east of the Lehigh River are the city's East Side residential neighborhoods, most of which border various routes to neighboring Bethlehem. South of Center City and across Little Lehigh Creek are the city's South Side neighborhoods, which border Emmaus. Allentown's West End, with a mix of commercial corridors, cultural centers, and larger single-family residences, begins approximately west of 15th Street.\n\n\nCenter City Allentown's tallest building is the PPL Building at 322 feet (98 m). In addition to the PPL Building, Center City commercial office buildings include the Dime Savings and Trust Company building, which features the Art Deco architecture of the region during the 1920s and 1930s. One City Center, Two City Center,[43][44] and other commercial buildings are also located in Center City. An 8,500-seat indoor arena, PPL Center, which hosts the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League, opened in August 2014 at 701 Hamilton Street in Center City.[45] Other Center City historic and recreational landmarks include Allentown Art Museum, Baum School of Art, Lehigh County Historical Society, Liberty Bell Museum, and Miller Symphony Hall.\n\n\nIn January 2015, two major hotels, Americus Hotel and a Marriott, opened in Center City Allentown.[46][47]\n\n\n\n#### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Buildings and architecture of Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\nSee also: List of historic places in Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)Miller Symphony Hall on North 6th Street, home of the Allentown Symphony Orchestra, in July 2008\nAllentown is characterized by a large stock of historic homes, commercial structures, and century-old industrial buildings reflecting its standing as one of the nation's earliest urban centers. Allentown's Center City neighborhoods include Victorian and terraced rowhouses. West Park includes mostly Victorian and American Craftsman-style architecture. Houses on Allentown's tree-lined streets in the West End were built mostly between the 1920s and 1940s. Houses in Allentown's East and South Sides are a mixture of architectural styles and are generally single and twin family homes built between the 1940s and 1960s; both areas include some older Victorian homes. Allentown has many loft apartments in converted mills and historic brick manufacturing buildings and modern and historic high-rise apartment buildings in Center City.\n\n\nAllentown has three primary historic districts: Old Allentown, the Old Fairgrounds, and West Park. Old Allentown and Old Fairgrounds are Center City neighborhoods that hold a joint house tour organized by the Old Allentown Preservation Association (OAPA) annually in September. West Park also offers a tour of its Victorian and Craftsman-style homes.[48]\n\n\nThe PPL Building, at 2 North 9th Street, is Allentown's tallest building at 322 feet (98 m). The building was designed by New York City architectural firm Helme, Corbett, and Harrison. Wallace Harrison was the primary designer of the building, which later served as a prototype for the Art Deco architecture of Rockefeller Center and other New York City building structures. Built between 1926 and 1928, the PPL Building's exterior decorative friezes were designed by Alexander Archipenko. The building, which opened July 16, 1928,[49] has been illuminated every night since its opening. In clear weather at night, the PPL Building's nighttime illumination can be seen from as far north as the Blue Mountain Ski Area in Palmerton. The building's exterior is featured in multiple scenes in the 1954 movie *Executive Suite*.[50]\n\n\nMiller Symphony Hall at 23 North 6th Street opened in 1896 and served initially as the city's public market; the 1,100 seat facility is now home to the Allentown Symphony Orchestra. The structure was converted to a theater in 1899 by architectural firm J. B. McElfatrick and was initially named the Lyric Theater. Miller Symphony Hall, one of roughly a dozen famous McElfatrick designs still standing in the nation, has been used for burlesque shows, vaudeville, silent films, symphony orchestras, and other entertainment for over a century.[51] Other Allentown-based performing arts facilities and programs include Pennsylvania Sinfonia, Community Concerts of Allentown, Allentown Band, and Community Music School of the Lehigh Valley.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Allentown falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are typically warm and muggy, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is cool to cold. Precipitation is almost uniformly distributed throughout the year.\n\n\nThe average temperature in January is 30.1 °F (−1.1 °C) and the lowest officially-recorded temperature was −15 °F (−26 °C) on January 21, 1994.[52] July averages 75.6 °F (24.2 °C) and the highest temperature on record was 105 °F (41 °C) on July 3, 1966.[52][53] January temperatures average below freezing, seven months average above 50 °F (10.0 °C), and two months average above 71.6 °F (22.0 °C).\n\n\nSnowfall is variable with some winters bringing light snow and others bringing multiple and significant snowstorms. Average snowfall is 33.1 inches (84 cm) seasonally[54] with February receiving the highest snowfall at just under 11 inches (280 mm). Rainfall is generally spread throughout the year with eight to 12 days of precipitation per month[55] at an average annual rate of 43.5 inches (110.5 cm).[56]\nAllentown falls under the USDA 6b Plant hardiness zone.[57]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Allentown, Pennsylvania at Lehigh Valley International Airport, 1991–2020 normals,[a] extremes 1922–present[b]\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 72(22)\n | 81(27)\n | 87(31)\n | 93(34)\n | 97(36)\n | 100(38)\n | 105(41)\n | 100(38)\n | 99(37)\n | 93(34)\n | 81(27)\n | 72(22)\n | 105(41)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 60.2(15.7)\n | 60.6(15.9)\n | 70.6(21.4)\n | 83.2(28.4)\n | 89.3(31.8)\n | 92.6(33.7)\n | 94.8(34.9)\n | 92.8(33.8)\n | 89.2(31.8)\n | 80.4(26.9)\n | 70.9(21.6)\n | 61.7(16.5)\n | 95.9(35.5)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 38.4(3.6)\n | 41.6(5.3)\n | 50.8(10.4)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 81.9(27.7)\n | 86.4(30.2)\n | 84.3(29.1)\n | 77.4(25.2)\n | 65.5(18.6)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 43.1(6.2)\n | 63.3(17.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 30.1(−1.1)\n | 32.4(0.2)\n | 40.7(4.8)\n | 51.8(11.0)\n | 62.0(16.7)\n | 70.9(21.6)\n | 75.6(24.2)\n | 73.6(23.1)\n | 66.3(19.1)\n | 54.6(12.6)\n | 43.9(6.6)\n | 35.0(1.7)\n | 53.1(11.7)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 21.8(−5.7)\n | 23.2(−4.9)\n | 30.5(−0.8)\n | 40.3(4.6)\n | 50.6(10.3)\n | 59.9(15.5)\n | 64.7(18.2)\n | 62.8(17.1)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 43.8(6.6)\n | 34.1(1.2)\n | 26.8(−2.9)\n | 42.8(6.0)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 4.2(−15.4)\n | 5.9(−14.5)\n | 14.1(−9.9)\n | 25.9(−3.4)\n | 35.3(1.8)\n | 46.5(8.1)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n | 51.1(10.6)\n | 39.9(4.4)\n | 28.7(−1.8)\n | 19.1(−7.2)\n | 11.7(−11.3)\n | 1.8(−16.8)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −15(−26)\n | −12(−24)\n | −5(−21)\n | 12(−11)\n | 28(−2)\n | 39(4)\n | 46(8)\n | 41(5)\n | 30(−1)\n | 21(−6)\n | 3(−16)\n | −8(−22)\n | −15(−26)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.30(84)\n | 2.77(70)\n | 3.63(92)\n | 3.67(93)\n | 3.65(93)\n | 4.40(112)\n | 5.30(135)\n | 4.56(116)\n | 4.84(123)\n | 4.14(105)\n | 3.24(82)\n | 3.86(98)\n | 47.36(1,203)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 9.8(25)\n | 10.8(27)\n | 6.3(16)\n | 0.5(1.3)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.2(0.51)\n | 0.9(2.3)\n | 4.6(12)\n | 33.1(84)\n |\n| Average extreme snow depth inches (cm)\n | 6.4(16)\n | 7.9(20)\n | 4.9(12)\n | 0.3(0.76)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.2(0.51)\n | 0.6(1.5)\n | 2.9(7.4)\n | 12.4(31)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 11.4\n | 10.1\n | 10.9\n | 11.8\n | 12.4\n | 11.4\n | 11.0\n | 10.2\n | 9.6\n | 9.9\n | 8.9\n | 11.5\n | 129.1\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 5.1\n | 4.3\n | 2.6\n | 0.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.5\n | 2.9\n | 15.7\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 70\n | 66\n | 62\n | 61\n | 66\n | 68\n | 70\n | 72\n | 74\n | 72\n | 70\n | 71\n | 69\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 43\n | 48\n | 53\n | 47\n | 54\n | 63\n | 57\n | 56\n | 54\n | 53\n | 45\n | 42\n | 51\n |\n| Source: NOAA (relative humidity 1981–2010)[58][59][60] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1790 | 486 |  | — |\n| 1800 | 573 |  | 17.9% |\n| 1810 | 710 |  | 23.9% |\n| 1820 | 1,132 |  | 59.4% |\n| 1830 | 1,757 |  | 55.2% |\n| 1840 | 2,493 |  | 41.9% |\n| 1850 | 3,703 |  | 48.5% |\n| 1860 | 8,025 |  | 116.7% |\n| 1870 | 13,884 |  | 73.0% |\n| 1880 | 18,063 |  | 30.1% |\n| 1890 | 25,288 |  | 40.0% |\n| 1900 | 35,416 |  | 40.1% |\n| 1910 | 51,913 |  | 46.6% |\n| 1920 | 73,502 |  | 41.6% |\n| 1930 | 92,563 |  | 25.9% |\n| 1940 | 96,904 |  | 4.7% |\n| 1950 | 106,756 |  | 10.2% |\n| 1960 | 108,347 |  | 1.5% |\n| 1970 | 109,871 |  | 1.4% |\n| 1980 | 103,758 |  | −5.6% |\n| 1990 | 105,301 |  | 1.5% |\n| 2000 | 106,632 |  | 1.3% |\n| 2010 | 118,032 |  | 10.7% |\n| 2020 | 125,845 |  | 6.6% |\n| 2021 (est.) | 125,944 |  | 0.1% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[61][7] |\n\n\nAs of the 2020 U.S. census, there were 125,845 people residing in Allentown.

Beginning in the late 20th century, the city evolved into a more service-oriented economy due to Rust Belt decline in heavy industry that commenced around 1980 and accelerated through the 20th century's last two decades. Allentown is corporate headquarters for several large companies, including Air Products,[66] PPL Corporation, and others.[67] The largest employer in Allentown, as of 2007, is Lehigh Valley Health Network with over 7,800 employees.[68] Lehigh Valley Health Network's flagship hospital, Lehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest, is Pennsylvania's third-largest hospital with 877 licensed beds and 46 operating rooms.\n\n\nCenter City Allentown, along Hamilton Street between 5th and 10th Streets, was the primary shopping district in Allentown for most of the 20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, however, several shopping malls, including South Mall,[69] Lehigh Valley Mall, and Whitehall Mall were built in Allentown's suburbs and today represent the most popular shopping destinations.[70] In October 2006, The Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley opened south of Allentown in Upper Saucon Township.\n\n\n\n## Arts, culture, and recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\n### Amusement park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom\n\n![](image)Steel Force (left) and Thunderhawk (right), two roller coasters at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown.

Several weekly and monthly print publications are based in Allentown or cover the city's news and people.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lehigh Valley International Airport and Allentown Queen City Municipal Airport\n\n![](image)Lehigh Valley International Airport, Pennsylvania's fourth-busiest airport, is 3 miles (4.8 km) northeast of Allentown in Hanover Township.\nThe city's primary commercial airport, Lehigh Valley International Airport, is located 3 miles (4.8 km) (5 km) northeast of Allentown in Hanover Township and is operated by Lehigh–Northampton Airport Authority. The airport has direct flights to Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago–O'Hare, Detroit, Philadelphia, and multiple cities in Florida. The region is also served by Allentown Queen City Municipal Airport, a two-runway facility located on Lehigh Street in South Allentown used predominantly by private aircraft.\n\n\n\n### Roads and buses[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Allentown Parking Authority, LANta, and Lehigh Valley Transit Company\n\n![](image)I-78 West and PA Route 309 North in Allentown in August 2022\n![](image)Hamilton Street in Center City Allentown in November 2007\nThere are 314.10 miles (505.49 km) of public roads in Allentown, 26.16 miles (42.10 km) of which are maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and 287.94 miles (463.39 km) that are maintained by the city as of 2022.[91]\n\n\nThe most prominent highway passing through Allentown is Interstate 78, which runs concurrently with Pennsylvania Route 309 along an east–west alignment across the southern portion of the city. I-78 runs from Lebanon County in the west to the Holland Tunnel and Lower Manhattan in the east, while PA 309 runs from Philadelphia in the south to the Wyoming Valley in the north. U.S. Route 22 briefly passes through the northwestern corner of the city as it follows the Lehigh Valley Thruway along an east–west alignment; it runs from Cincinnati, Ohio in the west to Newark, New Jersey in the east. \n\n\nThere are nine major inbound roads to Center City Allentown: Airport Road, Cedar Crest Boulevard, Fullerton Avenue, Hamilton Boulevard, Lehigh Street, Mauch Chunk Road, MacArthur Road, Tilghman Street, and Union Boulevard. Interstate 476, the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, passes to the west of the Allentown city limits. It runs from Plymouth Meeting outside Philadelphia in the south to Interstate 81 at Clarks Summit in the north.\n\n\nPublic buses in Allentown are provided by LANt, a bus system serving Lehigh and Northampton counties. Allentown Transportation Center, located on North 7th Street, serves as a major hub for LANTA buses.[92] Multiple private bus lines serve Allentown at the intercity terminal at 325 Hamilton Street, including Trans-Bridge Lines and Greyhound Lines, offering direct bus service throughout the day to New York City's Port Authority Bus Terminal and intermediate points,[93][94] and Fullington Trailways, which offers direct service to Williamsport, Hazleton, Philadelphia, and intermediate points.[95] Martz Trailways stops in Allentown as part of its route between Scranton-Wilkes-Barre and Philadelphia and its commuter routes to New York City, which are part of the Amtrak Thruway route that connects Amtrak trains at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia.[96] Allentown's public parking is managed by the Allentown Parking Authority.\n\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n#### Passenger rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1915 postcard of Allentown station at Fourth and Hamilton streets, which opened in 1890, closed in 1961, and was demolished in 1972\nAllentown has no current passenger rail service. The last Allentown rail service, provided by SEPTA, ceased operating in 1979, though one of SEPTA's two main Allentown train stations remains standing. In September 2020, Amtrak, in its Amtrak 2035 expansion plan, proposed restoring rail service between Allentown and New York City by 2035.[97][98] Use of this mostly single-track route by Amtrak has consistently been opposed by Norfolk Southern Railway, which acquired ownership of the Lehigh Line when it purchased federally-founded Conrail in 1999. Previously, in November 2008, the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation (LVEDC), along with both Lehigh and Northampton County governments, commissioned a study to explore restoring part of the Black Diamond service, which ran until 1961, by extending New Jersey Transit's Raritan Valley Line to Allentown.[99]\n\n\nAllentown was once a passenger rail hub served by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, using the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad, Lehigh and New England Railroad, Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Reading Railroad, the Lehigh Valley Transit Company, and Conrail. Routes served Wilkes-Barre and Scranton to the north, Buffalo and Williamsport to the northwest, Reading and Harrisburg to the west, Jersey City and New York City to the east, and Philadelphia to the south.[100]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial rail[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lehigh Line (Norfolk Southern)\n\nAllentown is a regional center for commercial freight rail traffic. Norfolk Southern's primary Northeast hump classification yards are located in Allentown,[101] and the city is served by R.J. Corman Railroad Group, a commercial railroad company.[102] The city has major commercial rail traffic, including from the Norfolk Southern Lehigh Line, which runs east through the city across the Delaware River, and Norfolk Southern Railway's Reading Line, which runs west through Allentown to Reading.\n\n\n\n## Utilities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: PPL Corporation, RCN Corporation, Service Electric, and UGI Corporation\n\nElectricity in Allentown is provided by PPL Corporation, which is headquartered in Allentown.[103][104] UGI Corporation, headquartered in King of Prussia, supplies natural gas.[105][106] Two cable companies, RCN Corporation, based in Princeton, New Jersey, and Service Electric, based in Bethlehem, have provided cable service to Allentown since the 1960s.[107] The area's only landfill, Waste Connections of Canada, is locally headquartered in Bethlehem. Water and sewage, prior to 2013, were controlled by the city and are now managed by Lehigh County, following the end of a 50-year lease agreement. Waste, recycling, and yard waste are each administered by the city.\n\n\n\n## Health care[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lehigh Valley Health Network, Lehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest, and St. Luke's University Health Network\n\n![](image)Lehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest on Cedar Crest Boulevard in Allentown, is the largest hospital in the Lehigh Valley and third-largest hospital in Pennsylvania with 877 beds and 46 operating rooms\nLehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest, located on Cedar Crest Boulevard and part of Lehigh Valley Health Network, is Allentown and the Lehigh Valley's largest hospital and the third-largest hospital in Pennsylvania with 877 beds and 46 operating rooms. It is also a Level 1 trauma center. St. Luke's University Health Network, Sacred Heart Hospital, and Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network also provide hospital and rehabilitation services. In 2010, Allentown State Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Allentown, was closed as part of a statewide closing of psychiatric hospitals by the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services.\n\n\n\n## Fire department[edit]\n\n\nThe Allentown Fire Department, established in 1870, operates six fire stations in the city.[108]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from the Lehigh Valley\n\nSince its 1762 founding, Allentown has been the birthplace or home to several notable Americans, including:[109]\n\n\n\n* Stephen Barrett, former psychiatrist and co-founder, Quackwatch\n* Clair Blank, former author, *Beverly Gray* mystery series\n* Chakaia Booker, sculptor[110]\n* Lillian Briggs, former rock music singer\n* Thom Browne, fashion designer\n* Frank Buchman, founder of the Oxford Group and Moral Re-Armament religious movements\n* Howard J.

In 1736, a large area north of Philadelphia was deeded by 23 chiefs of the Five Civilized Tribes to three sons of William Penn: John Penn, Thomas Penn, and Richard Penn. The price for this tract included shoes and buckles, hats, shirts, knives, scissors, combs, needles, looking glasses, rum, and pipes.[14]\n\n\nThe land was later part of a 5,000-acre (20 km2) plot that William Allen purchased on September 10, 1735, from his business partner Joseph Turner, who was assigned the land's warrant by Thomas Penn on May 18, 1732.[15] The land was surveyed on November 23, 1736, and again in 1753 as part of an effort to develop a road from Easton to Reading.[15] The 1753 survey reported the presence of a log house owned by Allen that was built around 1740 and was located near the western banks of Jordan Creek in the city. The house was used primarily as a hunting and fishing lodge, but Allen also used it to entertain prominent guests, including James Hamilton, who was his brother-in-law, and John Penn, who was then governor of the Province of Pennsylvania.[15]\n\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nThe geographic area that includes present-day Center City Allentown was acquired in the 1737 Walking Purchase and initially organized, established, and named in 1762 by William Allen, a wealthy shipping merchant who served as a mayor of Philadelphia and chief justice of the Province of Pennsylvania during the colonial era. It is likely that rivalry among the Penns prompted Allen to decide to start the city in 1762.[14]\n\n\nA decade earlier, in 1752, Northampton and Berks counties were formed; Easton was named the county seat of Northampton County, and Reading the county seat of Berks County. In 1763, a year after Allentown's founding, an effort was made by William Allen and others to move the county seat from Easton to Allentown, but the Penns' influence prevailed and the county seat remained in Easton.[14]\n\n\nThe town's original plan, which is detailed in archives now housed at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, included 42 city blocks and 756 lots, most 60 feet (18 m) in width and 230 feet (70 m) in depth. The city was located initially between present-day Fourth and Tenth Streets and Union and Liberty Streets and was initially named Northampton Towne. Many streets on the original plan were named for Allen's children, including Margaret (present-day Fifth Street), William (now Sixth Street), James (now Eighth Street), Ann (now Ninth Street), and John (now Walnut Street). Allen Street (now Seventh Street), the city's main thoroughfare, was named for Allen himself. Hamilton Street was named for James Hamilton, deputy governor of colonial-era Pennsylvania from 1748 to 1754. Gordon Street was named for Patrick Gordon, an earlier deputy governor of colonial Pennsylvania. Chew Street was named for Benjamin Chew, and Turner Street was named for Allen's business partner Joseph Turner.[15] Allen hoped that the city would displace Easton as the seat of Northampton County and become a commercial center due to its location along the Lehigh River and proximity to Philadelphia. Allen gave the property to his son James in 1767.[16]\n\n\nOn March 18, 1811, the city was formally incorporated as a borough. The following year, on March 6, 1812, Lehigh County was established from the western half of Northampton County. Northampton Towne was selected as the county seat of Lehigh County, and present-day Allentown was formally incorporated as a city on March 12, 1867. On April 16, 1838, the city was officially renamed Allentown after years of popular usage by that name.[17]\n\n\n\n### American Revolutionary War[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\nSee also: Farr Building and High German Evangelical Reformed Church\n\nSome of the first Patriot resistance to British colonialism, which led ultimately to the Revolutionary War, began in and around present-day Allentown. On December 21, 1774, a Committee of Observation for the Allentown area was formed by local patriots. Immediately following the Declaration of Independence's signing, the Colonial British government in Allentown began to break down and patriot militias took control. They pressured Tories out of the Allentown area, and patriot militias were expanded. The burden of supplying a military force logistically fell on the people, and requisitions for food, grain, cattle, horses, and cloth were common.[18]\n\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Hessian prisoners of war were kept in Allentown in the vicinity of present-day Seventh and Gordon Streets. Allentown also housed four hospital structures, including one at Zion Reformed Church and one on the grounds of the present-day Farr Building, that were used in treating wounded Continental Army soldiers. In 1777, a factory manufacturing paper cartridges for musket use in the Revolutionary War was relocated to Allentown from nearby Bethlehem. The same year, a shop of 16 armourers was established along Little Lehigh Creek that was used in repairing weapons and manufacturing saddles and scabbards.[15]\n\n\nAfter crossing the Delaware and prevailing in the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776, General George Washington and his Continental Army staff passed through Allentown, proceeding up present-day Lehigh Street, then called Water Street, where they stopped at the foot of the street at a large spring on what is now the property occupied by Wire Mill. There, Washington and his troops rested and watered their horses, then went their way to their post of duty.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Liberty Bell's hiding[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Liberty Bell Museum\n\nAllentown holds historical significance as the location where the Liberty Bell, then known as the State House Bell, was successfully hidden for nine months by American patriots to avoid its capture by the British Army after the fall of Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War. After George Washington's defeat at the Battle of Brandywine in Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was left defenseless and American patriots began preparing for what they saw as an imminent British attack on the city. Pennsylvania's Supreme Executive Council ordered that 11 bells, including the State House Bell and bells from Philadelphia's Christ Church and St. Peter's Church, be taken down and moved out of Philadelphia to protect them from the British Army, which would melt the bells down to cast into munitions. The bells were transported north to Northampton Towne (present-day Allentown) by two farmers and wagon masters, John Snyder and Henry Bartholomew, and hidden under floorboards in the basement of Zion Reformed Church in present-day Center City Allentown, just prior to Philadelphia's September 1777 fall to the British.\n\n\nA shrine and museum in the church's basement at 622 West Hamilton Street in Allentown, the Liberty Bell Museum, marks and celebrates the precise Allentown location where the Liberty Bell was successfully hidden from September 1777 until its June 18, 1778 return to Philadelphia following the British departure from Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n### Early Allentown[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton Street Bridge in Allentown, constructed between 1812 and 1814, was the first bridge built across the Lehigh River. Three times since, in 1841, 1862, and 1902, the bridge was destroyed by floods and subsequently rebuilt. In the 1980s, the bridge was extensively refurbished.\n![](image)Albertus L. Meyers Bridge, which crosses the Little Lehigh River at 8th Street in Allentown, was the longest and highest concrete bridge in the world at the time of its 1913 opening.[20]\nFollowing the Revolutionary War, Northampton Towne began to slowly grow as both a hub for commerce and ultimately industrialization and as a colonial era population center. Prior to American Revolution, there were 54 homes in Northampton Towne and approximately 330 residents. In 1782, there were 59 houses and over 100 cows were stabled in the town. The town was described by a visitor in 1783, \"One gets a glimpse of many good stone houses, many of them very neat, and everything about the premises shows good order and attention. The people are mainly German who speak bad English and distressing German.\" In 1795, the *U.S. Gazetteer* described Allentown as: \n\n\n> A handsome and flourishing town of Northampton County, pleasantly situated on the point of land formed by the junction of the Jordan Creek and Little Lehigh. It is regularly laid out and contains about ninety dwellings, a German Lutheran and a Calvinist (Zion) Church, an Academy and three merchant mills.[14]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1792, land north of Allentown was purchased by Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company for mining, but it initially proved difficult to transport the region's high quality anthracite coal over the primitive trail system that then existed. Very little anthracite was mined until 1818 when the company began constructing the Lehigh Canal to transport coal from Mauch Chunk, later renamed Jim Thorpe, down the Lehigh River to its confluence with the Delaware River in Easton. In 1829, Lehigh Canal, a 46.6 miles (75.0 km)-long canal on the Lehigh River's east side, was completed for both ascending and descending navigation. Its construction was the most important factor in making anthracite coal, one of the nation's most important domestic and industrial fuels, available to the nation's largest industrial markets in New York City, Philadelphia, and elsewhere.[14][21] In 1855, the first railroad was built on the Lehigh River's west side, and rail soon began to surpass river transport as the means for transporting anthracite through the city.[14][21]\n\n\nUntil 1803, residents of Northampton Towne received their mail in Bethlehem. That year, however, a post office was established inside Compass and Square Hotel at what today is Penn National Bank building on Hamilton Street. After reaching a population of over 700 residents in the 1810 U.S. census, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania granted Northampton Towne legal standing on March 18, 1811, incorporating it initially as the Borough of Northampton in what then was Northampton County. The new borough's government first undertaking was ordering that the city's cows be moved from public streets and into pastures, which proved unpopular. The following year, the city became part of Lehigh County, which was partitioned from a western section of Northampton County to establish the new county.[14][22]\n\n\nIn the early 1800s, the city grew primarily as a court and market town. Northampton Bank, the city's first bank located at the northeast corner of Center Square, was chartered in July 1814, and the first Hamilton Street Bridge, a 530 feet (160 m)-long chain structure, was constructed over the Lehigh River. The bridge featured two suspended lanes, one for east and one for westbound traffic, and a toll house at the bridge's western end.[14][22][23] In 1838, the city's name was officially changed to Allentown.\n\n\nThe 1840s were challenging to Allentown; in 1841, a flood swept away Hamilton Street Bridge and inflicted substantial damage on areas of the city near the Lehigh River. Two years later, in 1843, Northampton Bank failed as a result of the bank's excessive speculation, resulting in financial ruin for many bank customers. Five years later, on June 1, 1848, a large fire burned down most of Allentown's central business district between 7th and 8th Streets on Hamilton Street. During the 1850s, however, the city began recovering. A new bridge was built across the Lehigh River, and brick buildings were constructed to replace wooden ones that were burned in the 1848 fire. In 1852, the first Allentown Fair, now one of the nation's longest continual annual fairs, was held.[14][23]\n\n\n\n### American Civil War[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)A 1920 postcard of West End Park on Linden Street featuring a statue of Ignatz Gresser, a Union Army soldier from Allentown who received the Medal of Honor for acts of valor during the Battle of Antietam\n![](image)The 50th reunion of Allentown's First Defenders, a Union Army unit during the Civil War, in front of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument at Hamilton and South 7th Streets in Center City Allentown, Memorial Day 1911\nOn April 13, 1861, with tensions between the nation's North and South intensifying following the South's secession and its attack on Fort Sumter, residents of Lehigh and Northampton County called a public meeting in Easton to take steps to support the federal government.[24] At the meeting, citizens voted to establish and equip the 1st Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, a new military unit, and placed Captain Samuel Yohe of Easton and Thomas W. Lynn in charge, awarding them the respective ranks of colonel and major. Tilghman H. Good of South Whitehall Township, previously captain of the Allentown militia known as the Allen Rifles and commander of the 4th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, was placed in charge of the 1st Pennsylvania's Company I, which included his former Allen Rifles subordinates and members of the Jordan Artillerist, another Allentown-based militia.\n\n\nIn April 1861, these Allentown units were deployed in response to President Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to defend the nation's capital of Washington, D.C., from the Confederate Army following the bombardment of Fort Sumter.[25] After the Civil War's end, many of these soldiers were named Pennsylvania First Defenders in recognition of being among the first five units to answer Lincoln's call for volunteers to defend the national capital. After protecting Washington, D.C., from April to July 1861, they were honorably discharged and returned home. However, a significant number of them opted to reenlist to defend the nation as the Civil War escalated.[14][26]\n\n\n\n#### 47th Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment\n\nOn August 5, 1861, Andrew Gregg Curtin, Pennsylvania's Civil War-era governor, granted Tilghman H. Good authority to create the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment, a new unit commonly known as the 47th Pennsylvania Volunteers.[27] Good secured help from William H. Gausler of Allentown, who was commissioned as a major with the regiment's central command staff, and John Peter Shindel Gobin, a senior officer with the Sunbury Guards in Northumberland County, who was repeatedly cited for valor and was promoted to colonel and ultimately commanding officer of the regiment.[28][29] Companies A and E of the regiment were recruited primarily from Easton and Northampton County; Companies B, G, I, and K were largely recruited from Allentown; Company C was recruited from Northumberland and Juniata counties; Company F was primarily composed of men from Catasaqua; and Companies D and H were recruited from Perry County. The 47th Pennsylvania Volunteers achieved Union victories at the Battle of St. Johns Bluff in Florida (October 1–3, 1862) before suffering a costly defeat in the Second Battle of Pocotaligo in South Carolina (October 21–23, 1862). They were the only Pennsylvania regiment to fight in the Union Army's 1864 Red River campaign across Louisiana.[30]\n\n\nWhile sustaining numerous casualties during the Red River campaign in the spring of 1864, the 47th Pennsylvania helped turn the Civil War in the Union's favor with victories in General Sheridan's 1864 Shenandoah Valley campaign across Virginia, including in the Battles of Berryville, Opequan, Fisher's Hill, and Cedar Creek and then again contributing to the defense of the nation's capital following Lincoln's assassination on April 15, 1865.[28][31][32] Other known Union Army units from Allentown included the 5th, 41st, 128th, and 176th Pennsylvania Infantries.[14][23]\n\n\nOn October 19, 1899, Allentown erected and dedicated the Soldiers and Sailors Monument at 7th and Hamilton Streets in the city's central square, where it still stands, in honor of these Union soldiers from Allentown and local Lehigh Valley towns and boroughs who were killed in defense of the Union's preservation during the Civil War.[14][23][33]\n\n\n\n### Industrialization[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Industrial Revolution in the United States\n\n![](image)An 1889 photo of the Allentown Rolling Mill Company, a sizable 19th and early 20th century iron and steel manufacturer on Washington Street in Allentown\n![](image)A 1910 postcard of Adelaide Silk Mill in Allentown, which opened in 1881 and was one of the world's largest silk mills throughout the early 20th century\n![](image)A 1910 postcard of Allentown's Center Square at North 7th and Hamilton Streets\n![](image)Mack Truck's assembly plant in Allentown in 1945; the company was headquartered in Allentown from 1905 until 2008 when it relocated to Greensboro, North Carolina.\n![](image)West Hamilton Street and 6th Streets in Allentown in 1950\nFile:1960 - Richard Nixon Motorcade Hamilton Street - Allentown PA.jpgRichard Nixon and his motorcade on Hamilton Street in Allentown in October 1960\nThe opening of Lehigh Canal in 1818 quickly transformed Allentown and the surrounding Lehigh Valley from a rural agricultural area dominated by German-speaking people into one of America's first urbanized industrialized areas and expanded the city's commercial and industrial capacity. With this, Allentown underwent significant industrialization, ultimately becoming a major center for heavy industry and manufacturing.\n\n\nAllentown's industrial development accelerated in the late 18th century. David Deshler, Allentown's first shopkeeper, opened a sawmill in the city in 1782. By 1814, industrial plants in Allentown included flour mills, sawmills, two saddle makers, a tannery and tan yard, a woolen mill, a card weaving plant, two gunsmiths, two tobacconists, two clockmakers, and two printers.[14] In 1855, the first railroads to reach Allentown were opened, presenting the Lehigh Canal with direct competition for coal transport. Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad ordered four locomotives, and train stations were built in Allentown, Easton, and Mauch Chunk. In September 1855, the railroad became operational with the Central Railroad of New Jersey providing transport between Allentown and New York City. Transport between Allentown and Philadelphia was made available through Perkiomen Railroad, which operated between Norristown and Freemansburg.[14][22]\n\n\nIn the 1840s, iron ore beds were discovered in hills around Allentown, and a furnace was constructed in 1846 by Allentown Iron Core Company for production of pig iron, a vital component used in the manufacturing of steel. The furnace opened in 1847 under supervision of Samuel Lewis, an expert in iron production, and was followed by the opening of other Allentown plants for production of a wide variety of metal products. In 1860, several smaller iron companies merged to create the Allentown Rolling Mill Company, which became Allentown's largest iron company and contributed to the city and the greater Lehigh Valley region's emergence as a major source for iron ore.[14][22]\n\n\nIn 1850, Leh's, a shoe and ready-to-wear clothing store, was opened in the city by Henry Leh. By 1861, with the Civil War commencing, Leh's emerged as a major source of military boots for the Union Army. In addition to Leh's, eight brick yards, a saw mill, a paint factory, two additional shoe factories, a piano factory, flour mills, breweries, and distilleries all opened in Allentown during the Civil War era.[14][22][23]\n\n\nIn 1883, Allentown Boiler Works was founded in Allentown by Charles Collum. Collum and his partner John D. Knouse built a large facility at 3rd and Gordon Streets in Allentown's First Ward near the Lehigh Valley Railroad yard near what later became Kline's Island. The company manufactured iron products, some of which were used in the construction of high-profile construction projects, including the building of the White House in Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The company's boilers and kilns were used for the production of iron products sold nationally and internationally, including to customers in Canada, Cuba, and the Philippines.[14][22]\n\n\nBrickworks flourished in Allentown through the end of World War I. The clay unearthed in various sections of Allentown and the city's suburbs proved suitable in manufacturing building brick and fire brick. Bricks were the first Allentown products shipped by rail and sold nationally.[14][22] A vibrant food processing industry began emerging in Allentown following the arrival of predominantly German immigrant bakers, who were among Allentown's first settlers. In 1887, Wilson Arbogast and Morris C. Bastian formed Arbogast and Bastian, which provided large scale commercial slaughtering.[14][23]\n\n\nWith industrialization, Allentown emerged as a major regional and national center for banking and finance. In 1860, William H. Ainey founded Allentown Savings and served as its first president. In 1864, Second National Bank of Allentown was formed, and Ainey was elected its first president, a position he held until his death. Ainey contributed to Allentown's industrial and retail growth, helping finance Iowa Barb Wire Company, which was later absorbed by American Steel & Wire, Pioneer Silk Factory, Palace Silk Mill, and Allentown Spinning Company.[23]\n\n\nIn the late 1870s, Allentown's iron industry collapsed, leaving the city economically depressed. Efforts were made to diversify the city's industrial base, including convincing Phoenix Manufacturing Company to open a silk mill in Allentown. Adelaide Mill at Race and Court Streets prompted the opening of Pioneer Silk Mill in 1886, and the city quickly emerged as a national leader in silk manufacturing. The silk industry grew to ultimately become Allentown's largest industry in the late 19th century and remained the city's largest industry through the end of the 20th century. In 1914, there were 26 silk mills in the city. By 1928, after the introduction of rayon, the number of Allentown silk mills grew to 85, and over 10,000 people were employed in the Allentown silk industry at the industry's height in the 1940s.[14][23]\n\n\nIn 1896, Max Hess, a retailer from Perth Amboy, New Jersey, visited Allentown and set about developing Allentown's first department store. He his brother Charles opened Hess Brothers at 9th and Hamilton Streets. Hess's developed a reputation for flamboyance, offering the latest European fashion apparel. The opening of Hess's was following by the opening of a second major department store in the city, the Zollinger-Harned Company, located in the Zollinger-Harned Company Building on Hamilton Street.[14][23]\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, Allentown also began emerging as a major center for the beer brewing industry. Notable Allentown breweries included Horlacher Brewery (founded 1897, closed 1978),[34] Neuweiler Brewery (founded 1875, closed 1968),[35] and Schaefer Beer, whose brewery was later acquired by Pabst and Guinness[36] and is now owned by Boston Beer Company, brewer of Samuel Adams beer.[37]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1905, Jack and Gus Mack moved Mack Trucks, their motor company, from Brooklyn to Allentown, taking over the foundries of Weaver-Hirsh on South 10th Street. By 1914, Mack Trucks developed a global reputation for manufacturing sturdy and reliable trucks and vehicles. Many were sent to Western Front battlefields in France prior to the U.S. formally entering World War I in 1917. The British nicknamed Mack AC's five and seven-ton trucks the \"Bulldog\". Mack eventually grew to have eight manufacturing plants in Allentown and adopted the bulldog as it corporate brand.[14][23]\n\n\n\nLike several other regions in Pennsylvania, Allentown residents continued speaking Pennsylvania German well into the early 20th century. Pennsylvania Guide, compiled by the Writers' Project of the Works Progress Administration, described the Pennsylvania Dutch community's impact on Allentown's linguistic landscape, reporting in 1940 that:[38]\n\n\n> Allentown is among the few large Pennsylvania cities where newspapers still carry columns written in the dialect. Although English predominates on the streets, there is a tendency to enunciate the 'v' with open lips, to soften the hard 'g' into 'ch,' and to use too frequently such words as 'already,' 'yet,' and 'once.' Here also are heard such colloquialisms as 'the pie is all,' (all gone) and 'it wonders (mystifies) me.'\n> \n> — Federal Writers' Project, \"Part II: Cities and Towns\", *Pennsylvania: A Guide to the Keystone State* (1940)\n> \n\n\nIn October 1945, following the end of World War II, Western Electric opened a plant on Union Boulevard in Allentown. Six years later, on October 1, 1951, the company manufactured and released the world's first transistor, which was produced at the Allentown-based plant, and the Allentown-based company emerged as a leader in the nation's post-war electronics revolution.[39]\n\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Allentown was a major retailing and entertainment center distinct and separate from Philadelphia and New York City. Hess's, Leh's, and Zollinger department stores led to retail sector growth in Allentown, and dozens of smaller retail stores, restaurants, hotels, banks, and professional offices in the city emerged in present-day Center City Allentown, which was then referred to as downtown Allentown. At least seven cinemas and stage theaters were developed along Hamilton Street between 5th and 10th Streets.[14][23]\n\n\n\n### Late 20th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Deindustrialization and Rust Belt\n\n![](image)A 1974 postcard of Center City Allentown's Hamilton Mall, a failed attempt to redevelop Allentown's central business district as residents began fleeing the city for its suburbs in the 1970s\n![](image)The entrance to PPL Center (left) in Center City Allentown in October 2018\nBy the mid-1960s, Allentown's economy had been booming for decades but the city's rising taxes and regulations prohibiting expansion of the city's geographic limits began leading many of the city's residents, especially those in the post-World War II baby boom generation, to flee Allentown for its suburbs. Salisbury, South Whitehall, and Whitehall townships each had large areas of farmland that were prime locations for residential real estate development. Much of Allentown's working class began migrating to these newer, less-expensive housing developments in Allentown's suburbs, which offered lower taxes, more green space, less crime, and newer schools.\n\n\nThis demographic trend continued throughout the latter part of the 20th century, presenting a major challenge to Allentown's city government and the Allentown School District as it confronted greatly diminished resources. Allentown School District's financial challenges, in turn, further increased the working class flight to Allentown's suburbs, creating a sea change in the city's demographics. With the departure of many working-class families from older Center City Allentown neighborhoods, many homes were sold to landlords who converted them into inexpensive multifamily apartments, many of which became government-subsidized housing projects that were permitted under the city's lax zoning and city codes.\n\n\nWith Allentown's neighborhoods and school system declining, the city focused on attempting to develop its Hamilton Street retail district, largely ignoring Allentown neighborhoods not located in Center City. This also exacerbated the flight of Allentown families to the city's suburbs, leading to the development of shopping centers and services being developed outside the city to accommodate the demand from Allentown's expanding suburban communities. In 1966, Whitehall Mall, the first closed shopping mall north of Philadelphia, opened.\n\n\nTen years later, in 1976, the even larger Lehigh Valley Mall opened north of U.S. Route 22. Stores in Allentown's downtown shopping district began closing, replaced with stores whose customers were less affluent. Large areas of Allentown's downtown were subsequently razed and replaced with parking lots. The downtown business district was rebuilt in an attempt to compete with the newer suburban shopping locations. A multiblock row of stores known as Hamilton Mall was developed, featuring newly covered sidewalks and managed traffic patterns. But the effort was unsuccessful, and two of the city's major department stores, Leh's and Zollingers, were forced to close by 1990. The third, Hess's, was sold to The Bon-Ton in 1994, which closed its Hamilton Mall location two years later, in 1996.[40] In 1993, the Corporate Center, the city's new flagship business center on North Seventh Street, fell victim to a large sinkhole, which led to its condemnation and ultimate demolition.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Allentown, Pennsylvania and Neighborhood Improvement Zone\n\nCombined with challenges confronting Center City Allentown, the manufacturing economy of the Northeastern United States began suffering from deindustrialization associated with foreign competition, trade policies, and manufacturing costs. Many Allentown factories and corporations began closing or relocating.\n\n\nResponding to the late 20th century economic downturn, Allentown consciously sought to begin diversifying its economy in the early 21st century. In the 2000s and 2010s, Allentown's economy saw growth in its service, health care, transportation, warehousing, and some manufacturing industries. In 2009, the Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ), created by the Pennsylvania State Legislature, sought to address Allentown's economic challenges and encourage its development and revitalization. The NIZ includes approximately 128 acres (52 hectares) in Center City Allentown and the city's riverfront district on the Lehigh River's western side.\n\n\nIn 2006, Agere Systems, formerly Western Electric, was acquired by LSI Corporation and relocated to San Jose, California. Mack Trucks relocated to Greensboro, North Carolina in 2009, and other Allentown-based factories downsized considerably or ceased operations entirely. With the city's manufacturing base eroded, once high-paying industrial jobs were replaced with lower-paying service sector jobs, and Allentown began being cited widely as one of the most prominent examples of a late 20th century Rust Belt city.\n\n\nIn 2014, Center City Allentown underwent major restructuring, including constructing and opening PPL Center, a 10,500-capacity indoor arena that now hosts the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, a professional American Hockey League ice hockey team, and other sports, entertainment, and concert events. A full-service Renaissance Hotel also opened, and older office buildings were redeveloped.[41]\n\n\nIn its 2023 edition of \"Best Places to Live\", *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Allentown the ninth-best location in the nation to retire.[42]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Allentown skyline at Christmas in 2017\n![](image)South Mountain, part of the Appalachian Mountain range, with Allentown in the foreground in December 2010\n![](image)Center City Allentown at night in October 2020\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania) and South Mountain (Eastern Pennsylvania)\n\nAllentown's geographic boundaries include a total area of 18.0 square miles (46.6 km2). Of this, 17.8 square miles (46.1 km2) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.5 km2) is water, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Bodies of water include Jordan Creek and its tributary, Little Lehigh Creek, which join within the city limits and empty into the Lehigh River. Other bodies of water in Allentown include Lake Muhlenberg in Cedar Creek Parkway and a pond in Trexler Park.\n\n\n\n#### Adjacent counties[edit]\n\n\nAllentown is located in the Lehigh Valley, an eastern Pennsylvania geographic valley located between two Appalachian mountain ridges, Blue Mountain, which varies from 1,000 feet (300 m) to 1,600 feet (490 m) in height about 17 miles (27 km) north of the city, and South Mountain, a ridge of 500 feet (150 m) to 1,000 feet (300 m) in height that borders Allentown's southern edge. It includes both Lehigh and Northampton counties.\n\n\nThe Lehigh Valley's adjacent counties include Carbon and Monroe counties to its north, Bucks County to its southeast, Montgomery County to its south, Berks and Schuylkill counties to its west, and Warren County, New Jersey to its east.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape and neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Buildings and architecture of Allentown, Pennsylvania; Center City Allentown; and List of Allentown neighborhoods\n\nCenter City Allentown, which includes the downtown area and its 7th Street retail and residential corridor, is the city's central business district and the location of most of its city, county, and federal government buildings. To the east of Center City are The Wards, residential areas developed during Allentown's late 19th century and early 20th century industrial boom. Just east of the Lehigh River are the city's East Side residential neighborhoods, most of which border various routes to neighboring Bethlehem. South of Center City and across Little Lehigh Creek are the city's South Side neighborhoods, which border Emmaus. Allentown's West End, with a mix of commercial corridors, cultural centers, and larger single-family residences, begins approximately west of 15th Street.\n\n\nCenter City Allentown's tallest building is the PPL Building at 322 feet (98 m). In addition to the PPL Building, Center City commercial office buildings include the Dime Savings and Trust Company building, which features the Art Deco architecture of the region during the 1920s and 1930s. One City Center, Two City Center,[43][44] and other commercial buildings are also located in Center City. An 8,500-seat indoor arena, PPL Center, which hosts the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League, opened in August 2014 at 701 Hamilton Street in Center City.[45] Other Center City historic and recreational landmarks include Allentown Art Museum, Baum School of Art, Lehigh County Historical Society, Liberty Bell Museum, and Miller Symphony Hall.\n\n\nIn January 2015, two major hotels, Americus Hotel and a Marriott, opened in Center City Allentown.[46][47]\n\n\n\n#### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Buildings and architecture of Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\nSee also: List of historic places in Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)Miller Symphony Hall on North 6th Street, home of the Allentown Symphony Orchestra, in July 2008\nAllentown is characterized by a large stock of historic homes, commercial structures, and century-old industrial buildings reflecting its standing as one of the nation's earliest urban centers. Allentown's Center City neighborhoods include Victorian and terraced rowhouses. West Park includes mostly Victorian and American Craftsman-style architecture. Houses on Allentown's tree-lined streets in the West End were built mostly between the 1920s and 1940s. Houses in Allentown's East and South Sides are a mixture of architectural styles and are generally single and twin family homes built between the 1940s and 1960s; both areas include some older Victorian homes. Allentown has many loft apartments in converted mills and historic brick manufacturing buildings and modern and historic high-rise apartment buildings in Center City.\n\n\nAllentown has three primary historic districts: Old Allentown, the Old Fairgrounds, and West Park. Old Allentown and Old Fairgrounds are Center City neighborhoods that hold a joint house tour organized by the Old Allentown Preservation Association (OAPA) annually in September. West Park also offers a tour of its Victorian and Craftsman-style homes.[48]\n\n\nThe PPL Building, at 2 North 9th Street, is Allentown's tallest building at 322 feet (98 m). The building was designed by New York City architectural firm Helme, Corbett, and Harrison. Wallace Harrison was the primary designer of the building, which later served as a prototype for the Art Deco architecture of Rockefeller Center and other New York City building structures. Built between 1926 and 1928, the PPL Building's exterior decorative friezes were designed by Alexander Archipenko. The building, which opened July 16, 1928,[49] has been illuminated every night since its opening. In clear weather at night, the PPL Building's nighttime illumination can be seen from as far north as the Blue Mountain Ski Area in Palmerton. The building's exterior is featured in multiple scenes in the 1954 movie *Executive Suite*.[50]\n\n\nMiller Symphony Hall at 23 North 6th Street opened in 1896 and served initially as the city's public market; the 1,100 seat facility is now home to the Allentown Symphony Orchestra. The structure was converted to a theater in 1899 by architectural firm J. B. McElfatrick and was initially named the Lyric Theater. Miller Symphony Hall, one of roughly a dozen famous McElfatrick designs still standing in the nation, has been used for burlesque shows, vaudeville, silent films, symphony orchestras, and other entertainment for over a century.[51] Other Allentown-based performing arts facilities and programs include Pennsylvania Sinfonia, Community Concerts of Allentown, Allentown Band, and Community Music School of the Lehigh Valley.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Allentown falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. Summers are typically warm and muggy, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is cool to cold.

Beginning in the late 20th century, the city evolved into a more service-oriented economy due to Rust Belt decline in heavy industry that commenced around 1980 and accelerated through the 20th century's last two decades. Allentown is corporate headquarters for several large companies, including Air Products,[66] PPL Corporation, and others.[67] The largest employer in Allentown, as of 2007, is Lehigh Valley Health Network with over 7,800 employees.[68] Lehigh Valley Health Network's flagship hospital, Lehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest, is Pennsylvania's third-largest hospital with 877 licensed beds and 46 operating rooms.\n\n\nCenter City Allentown, along Hamilton Street between 5th and 10th Streets, was the primary shopping district in Allentown for most of the 20th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, however, several shopping malls, including South Mall,[69] Lehigh Valley Mall, and Whitehall Mall were built in Allentown's suburbs and today represent the most popular shopping destinations.[70] In October 2006, The Promenade Shops at Saucon Valley opened south of Allentown in Upper Saucon Township.\n\n\n\n## Arts, culture, and recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Allentown, Pennsylvania\n\n### Amusement park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom\n\n![](image)Steel Force (left) and Thunderhawk (right), two roller coasters at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom in Allentown.

Several local churches make and sell fastnachts in fundraisers for Fastnacht Day, the day before Lent's commencement.\n\n\nAs Allentown's population has increased over the decades, many national restaurant and fast food chains have established a presence in the city. Growth of the city's ethnic populations has led to the opening of many family-run restaurants specializing in ethnic cuisine, including Chinese, Colombian, Dominican, Italian, Japanese, Mexican, Lebanese, Portuguese, Puerto Rican, Thai, and West Indian restaurants.\n\n\nDue in part to Allentown's proximity to Philadelphia, cheesesteaks are immensely popular. Yocco's Hot Dogs, a regionally well-known hot dog and cheesesteak establishment with four area locations (two of which are in Allentown), was founded in 1922 by Theodore Iacocca, uncle of former Chrysler chairman and president Lee Iacocca.

The airport has direct flights to Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago–O'Hare, Detroit, Philadelphia, and multiple cities in Florida. The region is also served by Allentown Queen City Municipal Airport, a two-runway facility located on Lehigh Street in South Allentown used predominantly by private aircraft.\n\n\n\n### Roads and buses[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Allentown Parking Authority, LANta, and Lehigh Valley Transit Company\n\n![](image)I-78 West and PA Route 309 North in Allentown in August 2022\n![](image)Hamilton Street in Center City Allentown in November 2007\nThere are 314.10 miles (505.49 km) of public roads in Allentown, 26.16 miles (42.10 km) of which are maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and 287.94 miles (463.39 km) that are maintained by the city as of 2022.[91]\n\n\nThe most prominent highway passing through Allentown is Interstate 78, which runs concurrently with Pennsylvania Route 309 along an east–west alignment across the southern portion of the city. I-78 runs from Lebanon County in the west to the Holland Tunnel and Lower Manhattan in the east, while PA 309 runs from Philadelphia in the south to the Wyoming Valley in the north. U.S. Route 22 briefly passes through the northwestern corner of the city as it follows the Lehigh Valley Thruway along an east–west alignment; it runs from Cincinnati, Ohio in the west to Newark, New Jersey in the east. \n\n\nThere are nine major inbound roads to Center City Allentown: Airport Road, Cedar Crest Boulevard, Fullerton Avenue, Hamilton Boulevard, Lehigh Street, Mauch Chunk Road, MacArthur Road, Tilghman Street, and Union Boulevard. Interstate 476, the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, passes to the west of the Allentown city limits. It runs from Plymouth Meeting outside Philadelphia in the south to Interstate 81 at Clarks Summit in the north.\n\n\nPublic buses in Allentown are provided by LANt, a bus system serving Lehigh and Northampton counties. Allentown Transportation Center, located on North 7th Street, serves as a major hub for LANTA buses.[92] Multiple private bus lines serve Allentown at the intercity terminal at 325 Hamilton Street, including Trans-Bridge Lines and Greyhound Lines, offering direct bus service throughout the day to New York City's Port Authority Bus Terminal and intermediate points,[93][94] and Fullington Trailways, which offers direct service to Williamsport, Hazleton, Philadelphia, and intermediate points.[95] Martz Trailways stops in Allentown as part of its route between Scranton-Wilkes-Barre and Philadelphia and its commuter routes to New York City, which are part of the Amtrak Thruway route that connects Amtrak trains at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia.[96] Allentown's public parking is managed by the Allentown Parking Authority.\n\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n#### Passenger rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1915 postcard of Allentown station at Fourth and Hamilton streets, which opened in 1890, closed in 1961, and was demolished in 1972\nAllentown has no current passenger rail service. The last Allentown rail service, provided by SEPTA, ceased operating in 1979, though one of SEPTA's two main Allentown train stations remains standing. In September 2020, Amtrak, in its Amtrak 2035 expansion plan, proposed restoring rail service between Allentown and New York City by 2035.[97][98] Use of this mostly single-track route by Amtrak has consistently been opposed by Norfolk Southern Railway, which acquired ownership of the Lehigh Line when it purchased federally-founded Conrail in 1999. Previously, in November 2008, the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation (LVEDC), along with both Lehigh and Northampton County governments, commissioned a study to explore restoring part of the Black Diamond service, which ran until 1961, by extending New Jersey Transit's Raritan Valley Line to Allentown.[99]\n\n\nAllentown was once a passenger rail hub served by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, using the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad, Lehigh and New England Railroad, Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Reading Railroad, the Lehigh Valley Transit Company, and Conrail. Routes served Wilkes-Barre and Scranton to the north, Buffalo and Williamsport to the northwest, Reading and Harrisburg to the west, Jersey City and New York City to the east, and Philadelphia to the south.[100]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial rail[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lehigh Line (Norfolk Southern)\n\nAllentown is a regional center for commercial freight rail traffic. Norfolk Southern's primary Northeast hump classification yards are located in Allentown,[101] and the city is served by R.J. Corman Railroad Group, a commercial railroad company.[102] The city has major commercial rail traffic, including from the Norfolk Southern Lehigh Line, which runs east through the city across the Delaware River, and Norfolk Southern Railway's Reading Line, which runs west through Allentown to Reading.\n\n\n\n## Utilities[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: PPL Corporation, RCN Corporation, Service Electric, and UGI Corporation\n\nElectricity in Allentown is provided by PPL Corporation, which is headquartered in Allentown.[103][104] UGI Corporation, headquartered in King of Prussia, supplies natural gas.[105][106] Two cable companies, RCN Corporation, based in Princeton, New Jersey, and Service Electric, based in Bethlehem, have provided cable service to Allentown since the 1960s.[107] The area's only landfill, Waste Connections of Canada, is locally headquartered in Bethlehem. Water and sewage, prior to 2013, were controlled by the city and are now managed by Lehigh County, following the end of a 50-year lease agreement. Waste, recycling, and yard waste are each administered by the city.\n\n\n\n## Health care[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lehigh Valley Health Network, Lehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest, and St. Luke's University Health Network\n\n![](image)Lehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest on Cedar Crest Boulevard in Allentown, is the largest hospital in the Lehigh Valley and third-largest hospital in Pennsylvania with 877 beds and 46 operating rooms\nLehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest, located on Cedar Crest Boulevard and part of Lehigh Valley Health Network, is Allentown and the Lehigh Valley's largest hospital and the third-largest hospital in Pennsylvania with 877 beds and 46 operating rooms.

Erie is the fifth-largest city in Pennsylvania and the largest city in Northwestern Pennsylvania[3][4] with a population of 94,831 at the 2020 census.[3] The estimated population in 2023 had decreased to 92,732.[5] The Erie metropolitan area, equivalent to all of Erie County, consists of 266,096 residents. The Erie–Meadville combined statistical area had a population of 369,331 at the 2010 census.\n\n\nErie is located approximately 80 miles (130 km) from Buffalo, 90 miles (140 km) from Cleveland, and 120 miles (190 km) from Pittsburgh.[6] Erie's manufacturing sector remains prominent in the local economy, while insurance, healthcare, higher education, technology, service industries, and tourism are emerging as significant economic drivers. Like the other Great Lakes port cities, Erie is accessible to the oceans via the Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River network in Canada. The local climate is humid, four-seasonal, and snowy, with warm summers and harsh winters, owing to its southern lakeshore location.\n\n\nThe city was named for the Native American Erie people who lived in the area until the mid-17th century. Erie is nicknamed both the \"Gem City\", in reference to it once being known as the \"Gem of the Great Lakes\" due to its fine natural harbor; and more recently, the \"Flagship City\", from a local marketing effort to promote its status as the home port of Oliver Hazard Perry's flagship *Niagara*.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812, a key historical event in Erie's history\nIndigenous peoples occupied the shoreline and bluffs in this area for thousands of years, taking advantage of the rich resources. Sommerheim Park Archaeological District in Millcreek Township west of the city, includes artifacts from the Archaic period in the Americas and the early and middle Woodland Period, roughly a span from 8,000 BCE to 500 CE.[8]\n\n\nEuropeans first arrived as settlers in the region when the French constructed Fort Presque Isle near present-day Erie in 1753, as part of their effort to defend New France against the encroaching British colonists. The name of the fort refers to the peninsula that juts into Lake Erie, now protected as Presque Isle State Park. The French term *presque-isle* means peninsula. When the French abandoned the fort in 1760 during the French and Indian War in the Seven Years' War, it was the last post they held west of Niagara River. The British established a garrison at the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the French and Indian War.[9]\n\n\nErie is in what was the disputed Erie Triangle, a tract of land comprising 202,187 acres in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania fronting Lake Erie that was claimed after the American Revolutionary War by the newly formed states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, as part of its Western Reserve, and Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\nThe Iroquois claimed ownership of present-day Erie. On January 9. 1789, a conference was arranged during which representatives from the Iroquois signed a deed relinquishing their ownership of the land[10] in exchange for $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. Seneca Nation separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800. It became a part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York relinquished their rights to the land and sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75 cents per acre or a total of $151,640.25 in continental certificates.[11]\n\n\nThe General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. Andrew Ellicott, who completed Pierre Charles L'Enfant's survey of Washington, D.C., and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey and lay out the plan for the city in June 1795. The initial settlement of the area began that year.[11][12] Lt. Colonel Seth Reed and his family moved to the Erie area from Geneva, New York; they were Yankees from Uxbridge, Massachusetts. They became the first European-American settlers of Erie in present-day Presque Isle.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Battle of Lake Erie and Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\nPresident James Madison began the construction of a naval fleet during the War of 1812 to gain control of the Great Lakes from the British. Daniel Dobbins of Erie and Noah Brown of Boston were notable shipbuilders who led the construction of four schooner−rigged gunboats and two brigs. Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry arrived from Rhode Island and led the squadron to success in the historic Battle of Lake Erie.[13]\n\n\nErie was an important shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the delays engendered cargo troubles for commerce and travel, they provided much-needed local jobs in Erie. When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, and the importance of the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up tracks, and rioted to try to stop the standardization.[14]\n\n\n\n### 20th and 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)State and 9th Streets in downtown Erie during the early 1920s\nOn August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek flooded downtown Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, was blocked by debris and collapsed.[15] A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225 houses and killed 36 people.[15] After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another, larger culvert, constructed under more than 2 miles of the city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.\n\n\nErie continued to grow for the first half of the 20th century, due to its strong manufacturing base. The city attracted numerous waves of European immigrants for industrial jobs. Erie was considered a wet city during the Prohibition Era in the United States. The city's economy began to suffer in the latter part of the 20th century as industrial restructuring took place and jobs moved out of the area. The Erie region is considered to be part of the Rust Belt. The importance of American manufacturing, US steel and coal production, and commercial fishing began to gradually decline,[16] resulting in a major population downturn in the 1970s.[16]\n\n\nWith the advent of the automobile age after World War II and government subsidies for highway construction, thousands of residents left Erie for suburbs such as Millcreek Township, which now has 55,000 residents.[16] This caused a decline in downtown retail businesses, some of which followed to the suburbs. Reflecting this perceived decline, Erie is occasionally referred to by residents as \"The Mistake on the Lake\" or \"Dreary Erie\".[17] Downtown Erie has undergone a resurgence in the early 2020s with the opening of Flagship City Food Hall and Flagship City Public Market.[18] [19]\n\n\nErie won the All-America City Award in 1972 and was a finalist in 1961, 1994, 1995, and 2009.[20][21] In 2012, Erie hosted the Perry 200,[22] a commemoration celebrating 200 years of peace between Britain, America, and Canada following the War of 1812 and Battle of Lake Erie.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of downtown Erie in 1912 looking West along the 15th Street tracks; the tallest steeple to the north of the tracks is St. Peter Cathedral.\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mill Creek passes through much of Erie, including the grounds of the Erie Zoo\nErie is situated in Northwestern Pennsylvania at 42°6′52″N 80°4′34″W﻿ / ﻿42.11444°N 80.07611°W﻿ / 42.11444; -80.07611 (42.114507, -80.076213),[23] on the southern shore of Lake Erie across from the Canadian province of Ontario. It is 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, 90 miles (140 km) southwest of Buffalo, New York, and 128 miles (206 km) north of Pittsburgh. Erie's bedrock is Devonian shale and siltstone, overlain by glacial tills and stratified drift. Stream drainage in the city flows northward into Lake Erie, then through Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence River, and out to the Atlantic Ocean. South of Erie is a drainage divide, beyond which most of the streams in western Pennsylvania flow south into the Allegheny or Ohio Rivers.[24] Lake Erie is about 571 ft (174 m) above sea level, while the city of Erie is about 728 ft (222 m) above sea level.\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 19.3 square miles (49.9 km2), with 19.1 square miles (49.4 km2) being land and the remaining 0.2 square miles (0.5 km2), or 1.03%, being water.[25] Presque Isle State Park (referred to by locals as \"the Peninsula\" or simply \"the beach\"), is a recurving sandspit peninsula that streches north into Lake Erie, providing a fine, natural harbor for Erie and offers 7 miles (11 km) of public beaches, wetlands, and fishing sites.\n\n\nErie fronts Presque Isle Bay and is laid out in a grid surrounding Perry Square in the downtown area.[26] The downtown area is separated from the waterfront by the Bayfront Parkway.[26] The tallest structure in Erie is St. Peter Cathedral at 265 ft (81 m), and the tallest building is Renaissance Centre at 198 ft (60 m). Historically, Erie had numerous ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Italy, which is located on Erie's west side, featuring the West 18th Street commercial corridor. South of 38th Street, the grid gives way to curvilinear roads of post-1970 suburban development. Millcreek Township and upper Peach Street in Summit Township include the Erie metropolitan area's newer developments.\n\n\nPost-industrial redevelopment of Erie's waterfront aimed at recreational and tourism uses include the Bayfront Parkway, Niagara Pier, Perry's Landing Marina, Liberty Park & Amphitheater, Bayfront Convention Center, hotels, and Dobbins Landing, which features the Bicentennial Tower at its northern end. On the east side of the bayfront, the Erie Maritime Museum and the Erie County main library (third-largest in Pennsylvania), host the USS *Niagara*. Docks and marinas fill the freshwater shoreline in between.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Erie falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. It is located in the snow belt that stretches from Cleveland to Syracuse and Watertown; winters are moderately cold, with heavy lake-effect snow, but also with occasional stretches of mild weather that cause accumulated snow to melt. The city experiences a full range of weather events, including snow, ice, rain, thunderstorms, and fog. The city's lakeside location helps to temper summer heat, with an average of 4 days with highs at or above 90 °F (32 °C) annually, and the highest temperature ever recorded was 100 °F (38 °C) on June 25, 1988. An average of 3 days have lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or colder annually, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was −18 °F (−28 °C) on January 19, 1994, and February 16, 2015.[27]\n\n\nErie is third on *The Daily Beast*'s list of snowiest places in the United States, averaging 78.7 inches (200 cm);[28] however, the 1981–2010 normal seasonal snowfall is 100.8 inches (256 cm). Average annual snowfall in the decade 2010-2019 was 100.7 inches (256 cm).[29] The adverse winter conditions caused USAir Flight 499 to overrun the runway at Erie International Airport on February 21, 1986, and caused whiteouts that were responsible for a 50-car pile-up on Interstate 90 on January 25, 2007.[30][31]\n\n\nThe coldest maximum temperature on record was −4 °F (−20 °C) in 1994 and the average coldest maximum between 1991 and 2020 was 13 °F (−11 °C).[27] The warmest overnight low on record was 82 °F (28 °C) once in 1918 and another time during the 1936 North American heat wave.[27] On average, the warmest low of the year is quite muggy 75 °F (24 °C).[27]\n\n\nOn December 24 and 25, 2017, Erie received 53 inches (135 cm) of snowfall, breaking a record for the largest two-day snowfall anywhere in Pennsylvania.[32][33] By the close of the 2017–2018 snow season, Erie had recorded 198.5 in (5.04 m) of snow, its snowiest season on record, breaking the previous record of 149.1 in (3.79 m) inches set in 2000–2001 by a large margin.[27]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Erie, Pennsylvania (Erie International Airport), 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1873–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 73(23)\n | 77(25)\n | 82(28)\n | 89(32)\n | 91(33)\n | 100(38)\n | 99(37)\n | 96(36)\n | 99(37)\n | 89(32)\n | 82(28)\n | 75(24)\n | 100(38)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 58.9(14.9)\n | 58.5(14.7)\n | 69.1(20.6)\n | 79.6(26.4)\n | 85.1(29.5)\n | 90.2(32.3)\n | 90.5(32.5)\n | 89.8(32.1)\n | 87.1(30.6)\n | 79.3(26.3)\n | 68.4(20.2)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 92.4(33.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 35.2(1.8)\n | 36.5(2.5)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 56.8(13.8)\n | 68.3(20.2)\n | 77.1(25.1)\n | 81.1(27.3)\n | 79.9(26.6)\n | 73.7(23.2)\n | 62.3(16.8)\n | 50.5(10.3)\n | 40.2(4.6)\n | 58.8(14.9)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 28.2(−2.1)\n | 28.9(−1.7)\n | 36.1(2.3)\n | 47.4(8.6)\n | 58.8(14.9)\n | 68.2(20.1)\n | 72.7(22.6)\n | 71.5(21.9)\n | 65.2(18.4)\n | 54.3(12.4)\n | 43.6(6.4)\n | 34.1(1.2)\n | 50.8(10.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 21.3(−5.9)\n | 21.4(−5.9)\n | 27.9(−2.3)\n | 38.0(3.3)\n | 49.3(9.6)\n | 59.4(15.2)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 63.2(17.3)\n | 56.7(13.7)\n | 46.3(7.9)\n | 36.7(2.6)\n | 28.0(−2.2)\n | 42.7(5.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 3.6(−15.8)\n | 4.1(−15.5)\n | 11.2(−11.6)\n | 25.7(−3.5)\n | 35.3(1.8)\n | 45.7(7.6)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 53.0(11.7)\n | 44.4(6.9)\n | 33.9(1.1)\n | 23.8(−4.6)\n | 13.3(−10.4)\n | 0.2(−17.7)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −18(−28)\n | −18(−28)\n | −9(−23)\n | 7(−14)\n | 26(−3)\n | 32(0)\n | 44(7)\n | 37(3)\n | 33(1)\n | 23(−5)\n | 6(−14)\n | −11(−24)\n | −18(−28)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.41(87)\n | 2.52(64)\n | 3.08(78)\n | 3.47(88)\n | 3.50(89)\n | 3.70(94)\n | 3.33(85)\n | 3.35(85)\n | 4.32(110)\n | 4.38(111)\n | 3.75(95)\n | 4.17(106)\n | 42.98(1,092)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 31.8(81)\n | 19.4(49)\n | 14.5(37)\n | 2.6(6.6)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 9.6(24)\n | 26.3(67)\n | 104.3(265)\n |\n| Average extreme snow depth inches (cm)\n | 9.9(25)\n | 9.1(23)\n | 7.3(19)\n | 1.7(4.3)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 4.8(12)\n | 7.6(19)\n | 13.8(35)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 19.7\n | 15.4\n | 14.3\n | 14.0\n | 13.5\n | 11.5\n | 10.5\n | 10.2\n | 10.1\n | 14.3\n | 14.9\n | 18.5\n | 166.9\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 16.3\n | 12.3\n | 7.8\n | 2.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.2\n | 4.8\n | 11.5\n | 55.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74.5\n | 75.4\n | 71.9\n | 67.9\n | 68.9\n | 71.3\n | 71.7\n | 74.0\n | 74.5\n | 71.1\n | 72.3\n | 75.0\n | 72.4\n |\n| Source: NOAA (relative humidity 1961–1990)[27][34][35] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 81 |  | — |\n| 1810 | 394 |  | 386.4% |\n| 1820 | 635 |  | 61.2% |\n| 1830 | 1,465 |  | 130.7% |\n| 1840 | 3,412 |  | 132.9% |\n| 1850 | 5,858 |  | 71.7% |\n| 1860 | 9,419 |  | 60.8% |\n| 1870 | 19,646 |  | 108.6% |\n| 1880 | 27,737 |  | 41.2% |\n| 1890 | 40,634 |  | 46.5% |\n| 1900 | 52,733 |  | 29.8% |\n| 1910 | 66,525 |  | 26.2% |\n| 1920 | 93,372 |  | 40.4% |\n| 1930 | 115,967 |  | 24.2% |\n| 1940 | 116,955 |  | 0.9% |\n| 1950 | 130,803 |  | 11.8% |\n| 1960 | 138,440 |  | 5.8% |\n| 1970 | 129,231 |  | −6.7% |\n| 1980 | 119,123 |  | −7.8% |\n| 1990 | 108,718 |  | −8.7% |\n| 2000 | 103,717 |  | −4.6% |\n| 2010 | 101,786 |  | −1.9% |\n| 2020 | 94,831 |  | −6.8% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[36][2] |\n\n\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, 101,786 people,[37] 40,913 households, and 22,915 families were residing in the city.[38] Its 44,790 housing units averaged a vacancy rate of 8%. Erie has long been declining in population due to the departure of factories and dependent businesses.[39] The city has lost about 40,000 people since the early 1960s, allowing Allentown to claim the position as Pennsylvania's third-largest city behind Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographics of Erie compared on the state and national levels, as of 2010[update] Census\n|  | Erie\n | Pennsylvania\n | United States\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 101,786\n | 12,702,379\n | 308,745,538\n |\n| Population %±, 2000−2010\n | −1.9%\n | +3.4%\n | +9.7%\n |\n| Population density\n | 4,631.7/sq mi (1,788.3/km2)\n | 283.4/sq mi (109.4/km2)\n | 87.3/sq mi (33.7/km2)\n |\n| Median household income (1999)\n | $28,387\n | $34,619\n | $41,994\n |\n| Bachelor's degree or higher\n | 17.4%\n | 22.4%\n | 24.4%\n |\n| Foreign born\n | 5.8%\n | 5.0%\n | 11.0%\n |\n| White (non-Hispanic)\n | 75.0%\n | 81.9%\n | 72.4%\n |\n| Black\n | 19.7%\n | 10.8%\n | 12.6%\n |\n| Hispanic (any race)\n | 6.9%\n | 5.7%\n | 16.3%\n |\n| Asian\n | 1.5%\n | 2.7%\n | 4.8%\n |\n\n\nErie's population was spread evenly among all age groups, with the median being 34. About 13% of families and 19% of the population were below the poverty line. Most of the people who reside in Erie are of European descent.[40]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, the International Institute of Erie (IIE), founded in 1919, has helped with the resettlement of refugees from Bosnia, Eritrea, Ghana, Iraq, Kosovo, Liberia, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, Romania, Russia, Syria, and Vietnam. The inclusion of refugees in Erie's community augments religious diversity and prompts community events such as cultural festivals.[41]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Catholic influence is present broadly in Erie, including at Mercyhurst University\nIn the early 20th century, Erie had a significant Russian immigrant community, many members of which worked in the shipbuilding plants along the bayfront. Unusual for a Great Lakes city, a substantial number of these Russian immigrants were priestless (*Bespopovtsy*) Old Believers. In 1983, most of this community united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, and Father Pimen Simon became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Eastern Orthodox Church.[42] Even today, the gold-domed Church of the Nativity,[43] on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.[44]\n\n\nThe Erie Jewish community is over 150 years old. Temple Anshe Hesed, a member of the Union for Reform Judaism, is served by its spiritual leader, Rabbi Robert Morais.[45] Congregation Brith Sholom (Jewish Center) is affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and Rabbi Leonard Lifshen has been its spiritual leader since 1989.\n\n\nErie is home to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, covering 13 counties—at 9,936 sq mi (25,734 km2), it is the largest in the state in area. Its diocesan seat is Saint Peter Cathedral in Erie, which has a 265 ft (81 m) central tower flanked by two 150 ft (46 m) towers. Since October 1, 2012, Lawrence T. Persico has been the bishop of Erie; Donald Trautman was the bishop emeritus of the diocese until his death in 2022.[46]\n\n\nAccording to the Association of Religion Data Archives,[47] Erie County had a total population of 280,843 people in 2000, of which 103,333 claimed affiliation with the Catholic Church, 40,301 with mainline Protestant houses of worship, and 12,980 with evangelical Protestant churches.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Erie Forge and Steel factory at 16th and Greengarden Streets\nErie is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's primary access point to Lake Erie, the Great Lakes, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The city emerged as a maritime center after the American Revolution, then as a railroad hub during the great American westward expansion. Erie became an important city for iron and steel manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution and thrived well into the 20th century with firms such as Griswold Manufacturing, once the leader in cast-iron cookware.\n\n\nSince the decline of large manufacturers in the later 20th century, a more diverse mix of midsized industries has emerged. This broader economic base includes smaller and more agile steel and plastic plants (with about 10% of tooling and molding located in the tri-state area) and vigorous service sectors: health, insurance, and tourism. The zip code 16501 covering some of the downtown areas is considered one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country.[48][49]\n\n\nErie is the corporate headquarters of the Erie Insurance Group and Marquette Savings Bank. Lord Corporation was founded and has major operations in Erie.[50] Along with GE and Erie Insurance, major employers in the county include the county, state, and federal governments, as well as the Erie City School District.[51]\n\n\nOver 10% of the USA's plastics are manufactured or finished in Erie-based plastics plants.[7] Erie is an emerging center for biofuels and environmental research, producing over 45 million U.S. gallons of biofuel a year.[52] Tourism plays an increasingly important role in the local economy with over 4 million people visiting Presque Isle State Park and other attractions. Shoppers from Ohio, New York, and the Canadian province of Ontario frequent the Millcreek Mall and Peach Street stores and attractions as a result of Pennsylvania's tax exemption on clothing.\n\n\nBoth UPMC Hamot and Saint Vincent Health System are also major employers in Erie.[51] Although both of these hospitals had been stand-alone Erie entities, Hamot merged with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in 2011[53] and Saint Vincent, which affiliated with the Cleveland Clinic in 2012,[54] merged with Highmark's Allegheny Health Network in 2013.[55] The United States Department of Veterans Affairs operates the Erie Veterans Affairs Medical Center on East 38th Street. The Shriners International has operated Shriners Hospital for Children in Erie since 1927.[56]\nLake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) is a fast-growing educator and provider of healthcare in the city. LECOM is located both in the city and in adjacent Millcreek Township.\n\n\n\n## Arts and culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bicentennial Tower and the *Niagara*\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nThe Erie Art Museum is the city's main art gallery, located in the Old Customshouse on State Street. Its collection has an emphasis on folk art and modern art and it hosts a popular blues and jazz concert series. The Erie Art Museum also works on public art projects to revitalize and improve the city. In 2000, the Erie Art Museum created a project entitled GoFish, similar to CowParade; 95 fiberglass fish were decorated by Erie artists and placed throughout the city. Patrons paid $3,000 for a fish and the proceeds went to Gannon University's scholarship fund and the Erie Public Art endowment fund.[57] The Erie Art Museum created a similar public art project in 2004 that involved frogs rather than fish.[58] In 2012, the Erie Art Museum began a project to create 40 artistic and functional bike racks, designed and created by local artists.[59] The museum intends to add color and interest to downtown Erie and to promote bicycling, encourage healthy lifestyles, and provide environmental awareness.[60]\n\n\nThe Erie Maritime Museum recognizes Erie's significance during the War of 1812 and is home to the USS Brig *Niagara*, a modern recreation of the 1813 USS *Niagara* which served as Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's relief flagship during the Battle of Lake Erie.[61]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nErie is home to several professional and amateur performing arts groups. The most significant is the Erie Philharmonic, in continuous existence since 1913 (except an interregnum during World War II). This group of professional musicians also has a full chorus and a junior philharmonic division that tours the area. The Lake Erie Ballet is a professional company that performs well-known programs throughout the year.[62] The Erie Civic Music Association attracts, sponsors, and books performances by professional musicians, singers, entertainers, and ensembles from around the world.[63]\n\n\nDowntown Erie's historic and ornate Warner Theatre hosts a range of performances. Renovated in the 1980s and again in 2007,[64] the Warner is the hub of Erie's Civic Center. The downtown area is the home of the Erie Playhouse, one of the leading community theaters in the country, and the third-oldest community theater in the U.S.[65] Erie is also home to several other community theatres, including Dramashop, PACA, and All an Act Theatre. In addition to regular performances, Erie has many festivals including motorcycle rallies. Since 2007, the annual Roar on the Shore motorcycle rally has taken place in Erie, although in 2019, it moved to the Lake Erie Speedway.\n\n\nPresque Isle Downs & Casino opened on February 28, 2007, and was the fourth slots parlor in the state and the first in Western Pennsylvania.[66] Table games opened at the casino on July 8, 2010.[67]\n\n\nErie is home to The Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps, ten-time Drum Corps International World Champion as of 2023. The Cadets entered a long-term partnership with the Erie Sports Center in February 2023, prompting them to move The Cadets all operations of Cadets Arts & Entertainment, Inc. to Erie.[68][69]\n\n\nErie has been the location for many movies, including the hometown for the fictional band The Wonders in *That Thing You Do!* featuring Tom Hanks. It is mentioned in the film *Wall Street* as the location of the fictional company Anacott Steel. Erie is the hometown of Train lead singer, Patrick Monahan. Erie is also the hometown of Marc Brown, the author and illustrator of *Arthur* books and TV series.\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Erie Maritime Museum, the *Niagara*, and the Main Library\nThere are five Erie County library system branches in Erie, and a bookmobile.[70] The Main Library opened in 1996,[71] and is the third-largest library in Pennsylvania.[72] It is connected to the Erie Maritime Museum, and has waterfront views of the Presque Isle Bay. The Main Library contains an art collection and provides internet access to patrons.[73] The four remaining libraries are the Edinboro Branch Library, Iroquois Avenue Branch Library, Lincoln Community Center Branch Library, and Millcreek Branch Library.[70]\n\n\n\n### Historic structures[edit]\n\n\nAlong West 6th Street is Millionaires Row, a collection of 19th-century Victorian mansions. The John Hill House is one of the notable residences. First Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, a well-known landmark, is also located here. The Watson-Curtze Mansion, one of the most notable residences on this street, is also home to the Erie County Historical Society.[74] Permanent and rotating exhibits showcase the life of some of Erie's influential founders and the development of Erie.\n\n\nThe Erie Land Light stands at the foot of Lighthouse Street.[75] The lighthouse was built in 1818 and replaced in 1867.\n\n\nThe Bicentennial Tower, on Dobbins Landing at the foot of State Street, was built in 1995−96 to celebrate the city's bicentennial. It is 187 ft (57 m) tall and gives a panoramic view of Lake Erie and downtown. The Blasco Library and Erie Maritime Museum are its neighbors to the east.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)UPMC Park, home of the Erie SeaWolves, pictured from the first-base side overlooking downtown Erie\nErie plays host to several semi-professional and professional sports teams. The Erie SeaWolves play AA baseball in the Eastern League as an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. The Erie Otters play hockey in the Ontario Hockey League. Hockey games are played at Erie Insurance Arena, while Minor League Baseball games are held at UPMC Park.\n\n\nGannon University, Mercyhurst University, Edinboro University, and Penn State Behrend have active NCAA collegiate sports programs. The local high schools compete in PIAA District 10 sporting events. Additionally, Cathedral Preparatory School hosts the annual high-school basketball tournament featuring top national teams, called the Burger King Classic since 2010. Scholastic and intramural sports are held at school and park facilities around the city. The Mercyhurst Ice Center, JMC Ice Arena, Erie Sports Park, and Erie Veterans Memorial Stadium are many sports arenas and stadiums available in and around the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Club\n | League\n | Sport\n | Venue\n | Established\n | Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Erie SeaWolves | EL | Baseball | UPMC Park | 1995\n | 2 (2023, 2024)\n |\n| Erie Otters | OHL | Ice hockey | Erie Insurance Arena | 1996\n | 2 (2002, 2017)\n |\n| Erie Express | GDFL | Football | Erie Veterans Memorial Stadium | 2012\n | 3 (2010, 2021, 2022)\n |\n| Erie Commodores FC | NPSL | Men's soccer | McConnell Family Stadium | 2009\n |  |\n| Erie Commodores FC | UWS | Women's soccer | McConnell Family Stadium | 2021\n |  |\n| Erie FC\n | WPSL | Women's soccer | Gus Anderson Field | 2022\n |  |\n\n\n\n## Parks and recreation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of city parks of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)Looking towards Presque Isle Bay and Downtown Erie from Presque Isle State Park\nDowntown Erie is surrounded by Presque Isle State Park, a National Natural Landmark.[76] The Seaway Trail runs through downtown Erie along the lakefront. The Tom Ridge Environmental Center, at the foot of Presque Isle, features 7,000 sq ft (650 m2) of exhibit space.[77]\n\n\nThe region grows grapes and produces the third-largest amount of wine in the United States.[4] Other tourist destinations include the Bayfront Convention Center; the Bicentennial Tower that overlooks Lake Erie; Dobbins Landing, a pier in downtown Erie; the Erie Land Light, and the Erie Maritime Museum, the home port of the *Niagara*. The 2,600,000 sq ft (240,000 m2) Millcreek Mall, one of the largest shopping malls in the United States, is located on Peach Street in nearby Millcreek Township.[78] The indoor waterpark Splash Lagoon, in Summit Township, is the largest indoor waterpark on the East Coast and third-largest in the United States.[65] Waldameer Park, located at the base of Presque Isle, is the fourth-oldest amusement park in Pennsylvania, and the 10th-oldest in the US.[79]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mayors of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Erie Municipal Building on State Street\nThe city of Erie is incorporated as a third-class city under Pennsylvania law.[80] Incorporated under an \"optional charter\", the city is governed by a mayor–council government. The government consists of a mayor, treasurer, and controller, and a seven-member city council. They are elected to four-year terms, with the terms of the council designed to be overlapping.[80] The mayor is chief executive and the city council prepares legislation and conducts oversight. The city council meets in Mario S. Bagnoni Council Chambers at City Hall. Joseph Schember (D) is the mayor of the city of Erie and was first elected in 2017. As of February 2023[update], the Erie City Council consists of:[81]\n\n\n\n* Michael Keys\n* Ed Brzezinski\n* Jasmine Flores\n* Chuck Nelson\n* Maurice \"Mo\" Troop\n* Mel Witherspoon\n* Susannah Faulkner[82]\n\n\nErie is the largest city in Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district and is currently represented in Congress by Republican Mike Kelly, who was elected in 2010. Republican Dan Laughlin of the 49th District represents Erie in the Pennsylvania State Senate. The city of Erie is split by the 1st and 2nd Districts of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and is represented by Democrats Patrick Harkins and Robert E. Merski, respectively.[83]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Erie City School District and Higher education in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine's main campus\nErie Public Schools enroll 12,527 students in primary and secondary grades.[84] The district has 23 public schools including elementary, middle, and high schools, with one charter school. Other than public schools, the city is home to more than 40 private schools and academies. Erie public schools are under frequent criticism for education quality, school rankings, and abnormally high teacher salaries.[*citation needed*]\nThe City of Erie is served by two public high schools, Erie High School and Northwest Pennsylvania Collegiate Academy, plus three Catholic high schools: Cathedral Preparatory School, Mercyhurst Preparatory School, and Villa Maria Academy.\n\n\nErie is home to several colleges and universities, including Gannon University located in downtown Erie, and Mercyhurst University in the southeast part of the city. Other notable colleges in the Erie area include Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM, a large medical school), and Edinboro University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\nErie is also home to the Barber National Institute and its Elizabeth Lee Black School, which provides services and education for children and adults with mental disabilities. Erie is home to its main campus, and it provides services in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.[85] The Achievement Center also serves the needs of children from birth to age 21 with physical and mental health disabilities.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The *Erie Times-News* headquarters office\nErie is served by *Erie Times-News*, the city's daily newspaper, as well as *Erie Reader*, an alternative weekly newspaper.\n\n\nThe Nielsen Company ranks Erie as 152 out of the 210 largest television markets in the United States, as of the 2019−2020 report.[86] The market is served by stations affiliated with major American networks, including WICU-TV 12 (NBC), WJET-TV 24 (ABC), WFXP 66 (FOX), WSEE-TV 35 (CBS), and WSEE-DT2 35.2 (CW). WQLN 54 is a member station of PBS and also broadcasts toward London, Ontario. Cable companies available for Erie include Charter Spectrum, DirecTV, and Dish Network.\n\n\nErie is served by several AM and FM radio stations based in the city, and dozens of other nearby station broadcasts can be heard.\n\n\nIn August 2019, Erie was the subject of a new television show, *Undercover Billionaire*, from the Discovery Channel. In this show, a wealthy businessman, Glenn Stearns, travels to Erie under a fake name, Glenn Bryant. He starts with $100, a cell phone, and an old pickup truck. He is then asked to make a business worth over $1 million in 90 days. If he fails, he has to put $1 million of his own money into the business. Stearns makes the now prosperous business of UnderDog BBQ. Although he only gets the company valuation of around $750,000, it is still a successful business to date. He gave everyone who helped his big roles in the company's future and also invested the $1 million he owed.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The last McDonnell Douglas DC-9 to fly for US Air arriving at Erie International Airport\n![](image)Union Station is served by Amtrak's *Lake Shore Limited*\n![](image)A road map of Erie and its major routes\n![](image)Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority\nErie is well connected to the Interstate Highway System. Six \"Erie exits\" are along Interstate 90, a major cross-country thoroughfare running from Boston to Seattle. Erie is the northern terminus of Interstate 79, which travels south to Pittsburgh and, ultimately, West Virginia. The western terminus for Interstate 86, also called the \"Southern Tier Expressway\", is at Interstate 90 near Harborcreek, between Erie and North East. Interstate 86 continues east through New York to Binghamton. The Bayfront Connector runs from Interstate 90 in Harborcreek to the Bayfront Parkway and downtown Erie, along the east side of the city, then connects to Interstate 79 on the west side of the city. Major thoroughfares in the city include 12th Street, 26th Street, 38th Street, and Peach Street. Peach is also a part of U.S. Route 19, whose northern terminus is in Erie and continues south, eventually reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Other major routes running through Erie are Pennsylvania Route 5, known as the Seaway Trail and is made up of parts of 6th Street, 8th Street, 12th Street, and East Lake Road in the city, U.S. Route 20, which is 26th Street in the city. The city is divided between east and west by State Street.\n\n\nThe Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority operates the city's transit bus system, known as the 'e'. Buses run seven days a week in the city, with trips out to other parts of the county occurring a few times a week. Intercity buses providing transportation between Buffalo, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh are operated by Greyhound Lines. Service between Buffalo and Cleveland is also provided by Lakefront Lines. Both companies operate out of the Intermodal Transportation Center, which opened in 2002 at the foot of Holland Street.\n\n\nThe former \"Water Level Route\" of the New York Central Railroad travels directly through Erie. It is now the mainline for CSX freight trains. The main line of the Norfolk Southern Railway, originally built by the Nickel Plate Railroad, also travels through Erie. At one time, Norfolk Southern trains ran down the middle of 19th Street, but were removed in 2002.[87] Passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak's *Lake Shore Limited* out of Union Station at 14th and State Streets. The *Lake Shore Limited* stops twice daily—one eastbound towards New York City or Boston, and one westbound towards Chicago.\n\n\nErie International Airport and Tom Ridge Field (IATA code: ERI; ICAO code: KERI) are located 5 miles (8.0 km) west of the city and host general aviation, charter, and airline service. Destinations with nonstop flights out of Erie include Chicago O'Hare International Airport via United Airlines, Charlotte Douglas International Airport via American Airlines, and Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport via Delta Air Lines (Currently suspended). Erie International is amid an $80.5 million runway extension. The extension is slated to increase the runway's length by 1,920 ft (590 m), for a total runway length of 8,420 ft (2,600 m), \"to meet safety requirements\" and allow the airport to accommodate larger aircraft.[88]\n\n\nThe Port of Erie is located on Presque Isle Bay, a natural harbor formed by Presque Isle. It offers some of the finest port facilities for cargo shipping on the Great Lakes, with direct rail access. The Erie−Western Pennsylvania Port Authority provides water taxi service in the summer between Dobbins Landing and Liberty Park in downtown Erie, and the Waterworks ferry landing on Presque Isle.[89]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\nThe Erie Water Works, which was incorporated in 1865 as the Erie Water and Gas Company, includes a reservoir, two water-treatment plants, and an elaborate water works and pipe network that provides water for most of the city and suburbs. Penelec, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy, supplies electricity to the region, as well as the Northwestern Pennsylvania Rural Electric Cooperative. National Fuel Gas Company provides residents with natural gas. Time Warner Cable became the region's cable television provider, after taking over Adelphia, and also provides digital phone and high-speed internet to the region. Local telephone and high-speed internet service are also provided by Verizon.\n\n\nSewage service in Erie is provided by the Erie Sewer Authority, and many outlying townships have partnerships with the Sewer Authority for service. The authority cleans about 30 40×10~~^~~6 US gal (150,000 m3) of wastewater every day.[90]\n\n\nThe time and temperature number in Erie is 452-6311 and was originally discontinued by Verizon in October 2008 before being restarted by a private individual two years later.[91] The city of Erie and northwest Pennsylvania is located in area code 814. On December 16, 2010, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted to split the area code, which was to take effect February 1, 2012.[92] The North American Numbering Plan decided that northwest Pennsylvania would receive the new code of 582. A local grassroots coalition began organizing an opposition to the plan and generated numerous petitions for reconsideration. The PUC immediately voted to review their decision and ordered additional public-input hearings and technical conferences as a response to the strong public outcry.[93] In January 2011, the PUC announced that it was placing the entire area code split plan on hold as NEUSTAR pushed the projected exhaustion date back two years to 2015.[94]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The city currently has six fire stations and protects about 20 sq mi (52 km2). The city has five engine companies, including two rescue engines, one tower company, and one water-rescue unit. The city provides mutual aid to fire departments of Millcreek Township, Summit Township, and East County.\n\n\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nErie has four official sister cities as designated by Sister Cities International:[96]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Dungarvan, Ireland (2007)\n* ![](image) Lublin, Poland (1998)\n* ![](image) Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico (1973)\n* ![](image) Zibo, Shandong, China (1985)\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* List of people from Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n\n\n* USS *Erie*, at least one ship==References==\n\n\n1. **^** \"ArcGIS REST Services Directory\".

Erie is the fifth-largest city in Pennsylvania and the largest city in Northwestern Pennsylvania[3][4] with a population of 94,831 at the 2020 census.[3] The estimated population in 2023 had decreased to 92,732.[5] The Erie metropolitan area, equivalent to all of Erie County, consists of 266,096 residents. The Erie–Meadville combined statistical area had a population of 369,331 at the 2010 census.\n\n\nErie is located approximately 80 miles (130 km) from Buffalo, 90 miles (140 km) from Cleveland, and 120 miles (190 km) from Pittsburgh.[6] Erie's manufacturing sector remains prominent in the local economy, while insurance, healthcare, higher education, technology, service industries, and tourism are emerging as significant economic drivers. Like the other Great Lakes port cities, Erie is accessible to the oceans via the Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River network in Canada. The local climate is humid, four-seasonal, and snowy, with warm summers and harsh winters, owing to its southern lakeshore location.\n\n\nThe city was named for the Native American Erie people who lived in the area until the mid-17th century. Erie is nicknamed both the \"Gem City\", in reference to it once being known as the \"Gem of the Great Lakes\" due to its fine natural harbor; and more recently, the \"Flagship City\", from a local marketing effort to promote its status as the home port of Oliver Hazard Perry's flagship *Niagara*.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812, a key historical event in Erie's history\nIndigenous peoples occupied the shoreline and bluffs in this area for thousands of years, taking advantage of the rich resources. Sommerheim Park Archaeological District in Millcreek Township west of the city, includes artifacts from the Archaic period in the Americas and the early and middle Woodland Period, roughly a span from 8,000 BCE to 500 CE.[8]\n\n\nEuropeans first arrived as settlers in the region when the French constructed Fort Presque Isle near present-day Erie in 1753, as part of their effort to defend New France against the encroaching British colonists. The name of the fort refers to the peninsula that juts into Lake Erie, now protected as Presque Isle State Park. The French term *presque-isle* means peninsula. When the French abandoned the fort in 1760 during the French and Indian War in the Seven Years' War, it was the last post they held west of Niagara River. The British established a garrison at the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the French and Indian War.[9]\n\n\nErie is in what was the disputed Erie Triangle, a tract of land comprising 202,187 acres in the northwest corner of Pennsylvania fronting Lake Erie that was claimed after the American Revolutionary War by the newly formed states of New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, as part of its Western Reserve, and Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\nThe Iroquois claimed ownership of present-day Erie. On January 9. 1789, a conference was arranged during which representatives from the Iroquois signed a deed relinquishing their ownership of the land[10] in exchange for $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. Seneca Nation separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800. It became a part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York relinquished their rights to the land and sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75 cents per acre or a total of $151,640.25 in continental certificates.[11]\n\n\nThe General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. Andrew Ellicott, who completed Pierre Charles L'Enfant's survey of Washington, D.C., and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey and lay out the plan for the city in June 1795. The initial settlement of the area began that year.[11][12] Lt. Colonel Seth Reed and his family moved to the Erie area from Geneva, New York; they were Yankees from Uxbridge, Massachusetts. They became the first European-American settlers of Erie in present-day Presque Isle.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Battle of Lake Erie and Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\nPresident James Madison began the construction of a naval fleet during the War of 1812 to gain control of the Great Lakes from the British. Daniel Dobbins of Erie and Noah Brown of Boston were notable shipbuilders who led the construction of four schooner−rigged gunboats and two brigs. Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry arrived from Rhode Island and led the squadron to success in the historic Battle of Lake Erie.[13]\n\n\nErie was an important shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the delays engendered cargo troubles for commerce and travel, they provided much-needed local jobs in Erie. When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, and the importance of the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up tracks, and rioted to try to stop the standardization.[14]\n\n\n\n### 20th and 21st centuries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)State and 9th Streets in downtown Erie during the early 1920s\nOn August 3, 1915, the Mill Creek flooded downtown Erie. A culvert, or a tunnel, was blocked by debris and collapsed.[15] A four-block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225 houses and killed 36 people.[15] After the flood, Mayor Miles Brown Kitts had the Mill Creek directed into another, larger culvert, constructed under more than 2 miles of the city, before emptying into Presque Isle Bay on the city's lower east side.\n\n\nErie continued to grow for the first half of the 20th century, due to its strong manufacturing base. The city attracted numerous waves of European immigrants for industrial jobs. Erie was considered a wet city during the Prohibition Era in the United States. The city's economy began to suffer in the latter part of the 20th century as industrial restructuring took place and jobs moved out of the area. The Erie region is considered to be part of the Rust Belt. The importance of American manufacturing, US steel and coal production, and commercial fishing began to gradually decline,[16] resulting in a major population downturn in the 1970s.[16]\n\n\nWith the advent of the automobile age after World War II and government subsidies for highway construction, thousands of residents left Erie for suburbs such as Millcreek Township, which now has 55,000 residents.[16] This caused a decline in downtown retail businesses, some of which followed to the suburbs. Reflecting this perceived decline, Erie is occasionally referred to by residents as \"The Mistake on the Lake\" or \"Dreary Erie\".[17] Downtown Erie has undergone a resurgence in the early 2020s with the opening of Flagship City Food Hall and Flagship City Public Market.[18] [19]\n\n\nErie won the All-America City Award in 1972 and was a finalist in 1961, 1994, 1995, and 2009.[20][21] In 2012, Erie hosted the Perry 200,[22] a commemoration celebrating 200 years of peace between Britain, America, and Canada following the War of 1812 and Battle of Lake Erie.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of downtown Erie in 1912 looking West along the 15th Street tracks; the tallest steeple to the north of the tracks is St. Peter Cathedral.\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mill Creek passes through much of Erie, including the grounds of the Erie Zoo\nErie is situated in Northwestern Pennsylvania at 42°6′52″N 80°4′34″W﻿ / ﻿42.11444°N 80.07611°W﻿ / 42.11444; -80.07611 (42.114507, -80.076213),[23] on the southern shore of Lake Erie across from the Canadian province of Ontario. It is 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, 90 miles (140 km) southwest of Buffalo, New York, and 128 miles (206 km) north of Pittsburgh. Erie's bedrock is Devonian shale and siltstone, overlain by glacial tills and stratified drift. Stream drainage in the city flows northward into Lake Erie, then through Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence River, and out to the Atlantic Ocean. South of Erie is a drainage divide, beyond which most of the streams in western Pennsylvania flow south into the Allegheny or Ohio Rivers.[24] Lake Erie is about 571 ft (174 m) above sea level, while the city of Erie is about 728 ft (222 m) above sea level.\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 19.3 square miles (49.9 km2), with 19.1 square miles (49.4 km2) being land and the remaining 0.2 square miles (0.5 km2), or 1.03%, being water.[25] Presque Isle State Park (referred to by locals as \"the Peninsula\" or simply \"the beach\"), is a recurving sandspit peninsula that streches north into Lake Erie, providing a fine, natural harbor for Erie and offers 7 miles (11 km) of public beaches, wetlands, and fishing sites.\n\n\nErie fronts Presque Isle Bay and is laid out in a grid surrounding Perry Square in the downtown area.[26] The downtown area is separated from the waterfront by the Bayfront Parkway.[26] The tallest structure in Erie is St. Peter Cathedral at 265 ft (81 m), and the tallest building is Renaissance Centre at 198 ft (60 m). Historically, Erie had numerous ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Italy, which is located on Erie's west side, featuring the West 18th Street commercial corridor. South of 38th Street, the grid gives way to curvilinear roads of post-1970 suburban development. Millcreek Township and upper Peach Street in Summit Township include the Erie metropolitan area's newer developments.\n\n\nPost-industrial redevelopment of Erie's waterfront aimed at recreational and tourism uses include the Bayfront Parkway, Niagara Pier, Perry's Landing Marina, Liberty Park & Amphitheater, Bayfront Convention Center, hotels, and Dobbins Landing, which features the Bicentennial Tower at its northern end. On the east side of the bayfront, the Erie Maritime Museum and the Erie County main library (third-largest in Pennsylvania), host the USS *Niagara*. Docks and marinas fill the freshwater shoreline in between.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification, Erie falls within either a hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*) if the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm is used or a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) if the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm is used. It is located in the snow belt that stretches from Cleveland to Syracuse and Watertown; winters are moderately cold, with heavy lake-effect snow, but also with occasional stretches of mild weather that cause accumulated snow to melt. The city experiences a full range of weather events, including snow, ice, rain, thunderstorms, and fog. The city's lakeside location helps to temper summer heat, with an average of 4 days with highs at or above 90 °F (32 °C) annually, and the highest temperature ever recorded was 100 °F (38 °C) on June 25, 1988. An average of 3 days have lows of 0 °F (−18 °C) or colder annually, and the lowest temperature ever recorded was −18 °F (−28 °C) on January 19, 1994, and February 16, 2015.[27]\n\n\nErie is third on *The Daily Beast*'s list of snowiest places in the United States, averaging 78.7 inches (200 cm);[28] however, the 1981–2010 normal seasonal snowfall is 100.8 inches (256 cm). Average annual snowfall in the decade 2010-2019 was 100.7 inches (256 cm).[29] The adverse winter conditions caused USAir Flight 499 to overrun the runway at Erie International Airport on February 21, 1986, and caused whiteouts that were responsible for a 50-car pile-up on Interstate 90 on January 25, 2007.[30][31]\n\n\nThe coldest maximum temperature on record was −4 °F (−20 °C) in 1994 and the average coldest maximum between 1991 and 2020 was 13 °F (−11 °C).[27] The warmest overnight low on record was 82 °F (28 °C) once in 1918 and another time during the 1936 North American heat wave.[27] On average, the warmest low of the year is quite muggy 75 °F (24 °C).[27]\n\n\nOn December 24 and 25, 2017, Erie received 53 inches (135 cm) of snowfall, breaking a record for the largest two-day snowfall anywhere in Pennsylvania.[32][33] By the close of the 2017–2018 snow season, Erie had recorded 198.5 in (5.04 m) of snow, its snowiest season on record, breaking the previous record of 149.1 in (3.79 m) inches set in 2000–2001 by a large margin.[27]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Erie, Pennsylvania (Erie International Airport), 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1873–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 73(23)\n | 77(25)\n | 82(28)\n | 89(32)\n | 91(33)\n | 100(38)\n | 99(37)\n | 96(36)\n | 99(37)\n | 89(32)\n | 82(28)\n | 75(24)\n | 100(38)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 58.9(14.9)\n | 58.5(14.7)\n | 69.1(20.6)\n | 79.6(26.4)\n | 85.1(29.5)\n | 90.2(32.3)\n | 90.5(32.5)\n | 89.8(32.1)\n | 87.1(30.6)\n | 79.3(26.3)\n | 68.4(20.2)\n | 59.7(15.4)\n | 92.4(33.6)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 35.2(1.8)\n | 36.5(2.5)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 56.8(13.8)\n | 68.3(20.2)\n | 77.1(25.1)\n | 81.1(27.3)\n | 79.9(26.6)\n | 73.7(23.2)\n | 62.3(16.8)\n | 50.5(10.3)\n | 40.2(4.6)\n | 58.8(14.9)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 28.2(−2.1)\n | 28.9(−1.7)\n | 36.1(2.3)\n | 47.4(8.6)\n | 58.8(14.9)\n | 68.2(20.1)\n | 72.7(22.6)\n | 71.5(21.9)\n | 65.2(18.4)\n | 54.3(12.4)\n | 43.6(6.4)\n | 34.1(1.2)\n | 50.8(10.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 21.3(−5.9)\n | 21.4(−5.9)\n | 27.9(−2.3)\n | 38.0(3.3)\n | 49.3(9.6)\n | 59.4(15.2)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 63.2(17.3)\n | 56.7(13.7)\n | 46.3(7.9)\n | 36.7(2.6)\n | 28.0(−2.2)\n | 42.7(5.9)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 3.6(−15.8)\n | 4.1(−15.5)\n | 11.2(−11.6)\n | 25.7(−3.5)\n | 35.3(1.8)\n | 45.7(7.6)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 53.0(11.7)\n | 44.4(6.9)\n | 33.9(1.1)\n | 23.8(−4.6)\n | 13.3(−10.4)\n | 0.2(−17.7)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −18(−28)\n | −18(−28)\n | −9(−23)\n | 7(−14)\n | 26(−3)\n | 32(0)\n | 44(7)\n | 37(3)\n | 33(1)\n | 23(−5)\n | 6(−14)\n | −11(−24)\n | −18(−28)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.41(87)\n | 2.52(64)\n | 3.08(78)\n | 3.47(88)\n | 3.50(89)\n | 3.70(94)\n | 3.33(85)\n | 3.35(85)\n | 4.32(110)\n | 4.38(111)\n | 3.75(95)\n | 4.17(106)\n | 42.98(1,092)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 31.8(81)\n | 19.4(49)\n | 14.5(37)\n | 2.6(6.6)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.1(0.25)\n | 9.6(24)\n | 26.3(67)\n | 104.3(265)\n |\n| Average extreme snow depth inches (cm)\n | 9.9(25)\n | 9.1(23)\n | 7.3(19)\n | 1.7(4.3)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 4.8(12)\n | 7.6(19)\n | 13.8(35)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 19.7\n | 15.4\n | 14.3\n | 14.0\n | 13.5\n | 11.5\n | 10.5\n | 10.2\n | 10.1\n | 14.3\n | 14.9\n | 18.5\n | 166.9\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 16.3\n | 12.3\n | 7.8\n | 2.3\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.2\n | 4.8\n | 11.5\n | 55.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74.5\n | 75.4\n | 71.9\n | 67.9\n | 68.9\n | 71.3\n | 71.7\n | 74.0\n | 74.5\n | 71.1\n | 72.3\n | 75.0\n | 72.4\n |\n| Source: NOAA (relative humidity 1961–1990)[27][34][35] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 81 |  | — |\n| 1810 | 394 |  | 386.4% |\n| 1820 | 635 |  | 61.2% |\n| 1830 | 1,465 |  | 130.7% |\n| 1840 | 3,412 |  | 132.9% |\n| 1850 | 5,858 |  | 71.7% |\n| 1860 | 9,419 |  | 60.8% |\n| 1870 | 19,646 |  | 108.6% |\n| 1880 | 27,737 |  | 41.2% |\n| 1890 | 40,634 |  | 46.5% |\n| 1900 | 52,733 |  | 29.8% |\n| 1910 | 66,525 |  | 26.2% |\n| 1920 | 93,372 |  | 40.4% |\n| 1930 | 115,967 |  | 24.2% |\n| 1940 | 116,955 |  | 0.9% |\n| 1950 | 130,803 |  | 11.8% |\n| 1960 | 138,440 |  | 5.8% |\n| 1970 | 129,231 |  | −6.7% |\n| 1980 | 119,123 |  | −7.8% |\n| 1990 | 108,718 |  | −8.7% |\n| 2000 | 103,717 |  | −4.6% |\n| 2010 | 101,786 |  | −1.9% |\n| 2020 | 94,831 |  | −6.8% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[36][2] |\n\n\nAs of the 2010 United States Census, 101,786 people,[37] 40,913 households, and 22,915 families were residing in the city.[38] Its 44,790 housing units averaged a vacancy rate of 8%. Erie has long been declining in population due to the departure of factories and dependent businesses.[39] The city has lost about 40,000 people since the early 1960s, allowing Allentown to claim the position as Pennsylvania's third-largest city behind Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographics of Erie compared on the state and national levels, as of 2010[update] Census\n|  | Erie\n | Pennsylvania\n | United States\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 101,786\n | 12,702,379\n | 308,745,538\n |\n| Population %±, 2000−2010\n | −1.9%\n | +3.4%\n | +9.7%\n |\n| Population density\n | 4,631.7/sq mi (1,788.3/km2)\n | 283.4/sq mi (109.4/km2)\n | 87.3/sq mi (33.7/km2)\n |\n| Median household income (1999)\n | $28,387\n | $34,619\n | $41,994\n |\n| Bachelor's degree or higher\n | 17.4%\n | 22.4%\n | 24.4%\n |\n| Foreign born\n | 5.8%\n | 5.0%\n | 11.0%\n |\n| White (non-Hispanic)\n | 75.0%\n | 81.9%\n | 72.4%\n |\n| Black\n | 19.7%\n | 10.8%\n | 12.6%\n |\n| Hispanic (any race)\n | 6.9%\n | 5.7%\n | 16.3%\n |\n| Asian\n | 1.5%\n | 2.7%\n | 4.8%\n |\n\n\nErie's population was spread evenly among all age groups, with the median being 34. About 13% of families and 19% of the population were below the poverty line. Most of the people who reside in Erie are of European descent.[40]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, the International Institute of Erie (IIE), founded in 1919, has helped with the resettlement of refugees from Bosnia, Eritrea, Ghana, Iraq, Kosovo, Liberia, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, Romania, Russia, Syria, and Vietnam. The inclusion of refugees in Erie's community augments religious diversity and prompts community events such as cultural festivals.[41]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Catholic influence is present broadly in Erie, including at Mercyhurst University\nIn the early 20th century, Erie had a significant Russian immigrant community, many members of which worked in the shipbuilding plants along the bayfront. Unusual for a Great Lakes city, a substantial number of these Russian immigrants were priestless (*Bespopovtsy*) Old Believers. In 1983, most of this community united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, and Father Pimen Simon became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Eastern Orthodox Church.[42] Even today, the gold-domed Church of the Nativity,[43] on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.[44]\n\n\nThe Erie Jewish community is over 150 years old. Temple Anshe Hesed, a member of the Union for Reform Judaism, is served by its spiritual leader, Rabbi Robert Morais.[45] Congregation Brith Sholom (Jewish Center) is affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and Rabbi Leonard Lifshen has been its spiritual leader since 1989.\n\n\nErie is home to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, covering 13 counties—at 9,936 sq mi (25,734 km2), it is the largest in the state in area. Its diocesan seat is Saint Peter Cathedral in Erie, which has a 265 ft (81 m) central tower flanked by two 150 ft (46 m) towers. Since October 1, 2012, Lawrence T. Persico has been the bishop of Erie; Donald Trautman was the bishop emeritus of the diocese until his death in 2022.[46]\n\n\nAccording to the Association of Religion Data Archives,[47] Erie County had a total population of 280,843 people in 2000, of which 103,333 claimed affiliation with the Catholic Church, 40,301 with mainline Protestant houses of worship, and 12,980 with evangelical Protestant churches.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Erie Forge and Steel factory at 16th and Greengarden Streets\nErie is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's primary access point to Lake Erie, the Great Lakes, and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. The city emerged as a maritime center after the American Revolution, then as a railroad hub during the great American westward expansion. Erie became an important city for iron and steel manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution and thrived well into the 20th century with firms such as Griswold Manufacturing, once the leader in cast-iron cookware.\n\n\nSince the decline of large manufacturers in the later 20th century, a more diverse mix of midsized industries has emerged. This broader economic base includes smaller and more agile steel and plastic plants (with about 10% of tooling and molding located in the tri-state area) and vigorous service sectors: health, insurance, and tourism. The zip code 16501 covering some of the downtown areas is considered one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country.[48][49]\n\n\nErie is the corporate headquarters of the Erie Insurance Group and Marquette Savings Bank. Lord Corporation was founded and has major operations in Erie.[50] Along with GE and Erie Insurance, major employers in the county include the county, state, and federal governments, as well as the Erie City School District.[51]\n\n\nOver 10% of the USA's plastics are manufactured or finished in Erie-based plastics plants.[7] Erie is an emerging center for biofuels and environmental research, producing over 45 million U.S. gallons of biofuel a year.[52] Tourism plays an increasingly important role in the local economy with over 4 million people visiting Presque Isle State Park and other attractions. Shoppers from Ohio, New York, and the Canadian province of Ontario frequent the Millcreek Mall and Peach Street stores and attractions as a result of Pennsylvania's tax exemption on clothing.\n\n\nBoth UPMC Hamot and Saint Vincent Health System are also major employers in Erie.[51] Although both of these hospitals had been stand-alone Erie entities, Hamot merged with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in 2011[53] and Saint Vincent, which affiliated with the Cleveland Clinic in 2012,[54] merged with Highmark's Allegheny Health Network in 2013.[55] The United States Department of Veterans Affairs operates the Erie Veterans Affairs Medical Center on East 38th Street. The Shriners International has operated Shriners Hospital for Children in Erie since 1927.[56]\nLake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM) is a fast-growing educator and provider of healthcare in the city. LECOM is located both in the city and in adjacent Millcreek Township.\n\n\n\n## Arts and culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bicentennial Tower and the *Niagara*\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nThe Erie Art Museum is the city's main art gallery, located in the Old Customshouse on State Street. Its collection has an emphasis on folk art and modern art and it hosts a popular blues and jazz concert series. The Erie Art Museum also works on public art projects to revitalize and improve the city. In 2000, the Erie Art Museum created a project entitled GoFish, similar to CowParade; 95 fiberglass fish were decorated by Erie artists and placed throughout the city. Patrons paid $3,000 for a fish and the proceeds went to Gannon University's scholarship fund and the Erie Public Art endowment fund.[57] The Erie Art Museum created a similar public art project in 2004 that involved frogs rather than fish.[58] In 2012, the Erie Art Museum began a project to create 40 artistic and functional bike racks, designed and created by local artists.[59] The museum intends to add color and interest to downtown Erie and to promote bicycling, encourage healthy lifestyles, and provide environmental awareness.[60]\n\n\nThe Erie Maritime Museum recognizes Erie's significance during the War of 1812 and is home to the USS Brig *Niagara*, a modern recreation of the 1813 USS *Niagara* which served as Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry's relief flagship during the Battle of Lake Erie.[61]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nErie is home to several professional and amateur performing arts groups. The most significant is the Erie Philharmonic, in continuous existence since 1913 (except an interregnum during World War II). This group of professional musicians also has a full chorus and a junior philharmonic division that tours the area. The Lake Erie Ballet is a professional company that performs well-known programs throughout the year.[62] The Erie Civic Music Association attracts, sponsors, and books performances by professional musicians, singers, entertainers, and ensembles from around the world.[63]\n\n\nDowntown Erie's historic and ornate Warner Theatre hosts a range of performances. Renovated in the 1980s and again in 2007,[64] the Warner is the hub of Erie's Civic Center. The downtown area is the home of the Erie Playhouse, one of the leading community theaters in the country, and the third-oldest community theater in the U.S.[65] Erie is also home to several other community theatres, including Dramashop, PACA, and All an Act Theatre. In addition to regular performances, Erie has many festivals including motorcycle rallies. Since 2007, the annual Roar on the Shore motorcycle rally has taken place in Erie, although in 2019, it moved to the Lake Erie Speedway.\n\n\nPresque Isle Downs & Casino opened on February 28, 2007, and was the fourth slots parlor in the state and the first in Western Pennsylvania.[66] Table games opened at the casino on July 8, 2010.[67]\n\n\nErie is home to The Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps, ten-time Drum Corps International World Champion as of 2023. The Cadets entered a long-term partnership with the Erie Sports Center in February 2023, prompting them to move The Cadets all operations of Cadets Arts & Entertainment, Inc. to Erie.[68][69]\n\n\nErie has been the location for many movies, including the hometown for the fictional band The Wonders in *That Thing You Do!* featuring Tom Hanks. It is mentioned in the film *Wall Street* as the location of the fictional company Anacott Steel. Erie is the hometown of Train lead singer, Patrick Monahan. Erie is also the hometown of Marc Brown, the author and illustrator of *Arthur* books and TV series.\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Erie Maritime Museum, the *Niagara*, and the Main Library\nThere are five Erie County library system branches in Erie, and a bookmobile.[70] The Main Library opened in 1996,[71] and is the third-largest library in Pennsylvania.[72] It is connected to the Erie Maritime Museum, and has waterfront views of the Presque Isle Bay. The Main Library contains an art collection and provides internet access to patrons.[73] The four remaining libraries are the Edinboro Branch Library, Iroquois Avenue Branch Library, Lincoln Community Center Branch Library, and Millcreek Branch Library.[70]\n\n\n\n### Historic structures[edit]\n\n\nAlong West 6th Street is Millionaires Row, a collection of 19th-century Victorian mansions. The John Hill House is one of the notable residences. First Presbyterian Church of the Covenant, a well-known landmark, is also located here. The Watson-Curtze Mansion, one of the most notable residences on this street, is also home to the Erie County Historical Society.[74] Permanent and rotating exhibits showcase the life of some of Erie's influential founders and the development of Erie.\n\n\nThe Erie Land Light stands at the foot of Lighthouse Street.[75] The lighthouse was built in 1818 and replaced in 1867.\n\n\nThe Bicentennial Tower, on Dobbins Landing at the foot of State Street, was built in 1995−96 to celebrate the city's bicentennial. It is 187 ft (57 m) tall and gives a panoramic view of Lake Erie and downtown. The Blasco Library and Erie Maritime Museum are its neighbors to the east.\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)UPMC Park, home of the Erie SeaWolves, pictured from the first-base side overlooking downtown Erie\nErie plays host to several semi-professional and professional sports teams. The Erie SeaWolves play AA baseball in the Eastern League as an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. The Erie Otters play hockey in the Ontario Hockey League. Hockey games are played at Erie Insurance Arena, while Minor League Baseball games are held at UPMC Park.\n\n\nGannon University, Mercyhurst University, Edinboro University, and Penn State Behrend have active NCAA collegiate sports programs. The local high schools compete in PIAA District 10 sporting events. Additionally, Cathedral Preparatory School hosts the annual high-school basketball tournament featuring top national teams, called the Burger King Classic since 2010. Scholastic and intramural sports are held at school and park facilities around the city. The Mercyhurst Ice Center, JMC Ice Arena, Erie Sports Park, and Erie Veterans Memorial Stadium are many sports arenas and stadiums available in and around the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Club\n | League\n | Sport\n | Venue\n | Established\n | Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Erie SeaWolves | EL | Baseball | UPMC Park | 1995\n | 2 (2023, 2024)\n |\n| Erie Otters | OHL | Ice hockey | Erie Insurance Arena | 1996\n | 2 (2002, 2017)\n |\n| Erie Express | GDFL | Football | Erie Veterans Memorial Stadium | 2012\n | 3 (2010, 2021, 2022)\n |\n| Erie Commodores FC | NPSL | Men's soccer | McConnell Family Stadium | 2009\n |  |\n| Erie Commodores FC | UWS | Women's soccer | McConnell Family Stadium | 2021\n |  |\n| Erie FC\n | WPSL | Women's soccer | Gus Anderson Field | 2022\n |  |\n\n\n\n## Parks and recreation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of city parks of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)Looking towards Presque Isle Bay and Downtown Erie from Presque Isle State Park\nDowntown Erie is surrounded by Presque Isle State Park, a National Natural Landmark.[76] The Seaway Trail runs through downtown Erie along the lakefront. The Tom Ridge Environmental Center, at the foot of Presque Isle, features 7,000 sq ft (650 m2) of exhibit space.[77]\n\n\nThe region grows grapes and produces the third-largest amount of wine in the United States.[4] Other tourist destinations include the Bayfront Convention Center; the Bicentennial Tower that overlooks Lake Erie; Dobbins Landing, a pier in downtown Erie; the Erie Land Light, and the Erie Maritime Museum, the home port of the *Niagara*. The 2,600,000 sq ft (240,000 m2) Millcreek Mall, one of the largest shopping malls in the United States, is located on Peach Street in nearby Millcreek Township.[78] The indoor waterpark Splash Lagoon, in Summit Township, is the largest indoor waterpark on the East Coast and third-largest in the United States.[65] Waldameer Park, located at the base of Presque Isle, is the fourth-oldest amusement park in Pennsylvania, and the 10th-oldest in the US.[79]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mayors of Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The Erie Municipal Building on State Street\nThe city of Erie is incorporated as a third-class city under Pennsylvania law.[80] Incorporated under an \"optional charter\", the city is governed by a mayor–council government. The government consists of a mayor, treasurer, and controller, and a seven-member city council. They are elected to four-year terms, with the terms of the council designed to be overlapping.[80] The mayor is chief executive and the city council prepares legislation and conducts oversight. The city council meets in Mario S. Bagnoni Council Chambers at City Hall. Joseph Schember (D) is the mayor of the city of Erie and was first elected in 2017. As of February 2023[update], the Erie City Council consists of:[81]\n\n\n\n* Michael Keys\n* Ed Brzezinski\n* Jasmine Flores\n* Chuck Nelson\n* Maurice \"Mo\" Troop\n* Mel Witherspoon\n* Susannah Faulkner[82]\n\n\nErie is the largest city in Pennsylvania's 16th congressional district and is currently represented in Congress by Republican Mike Kelly, who was elected in 2010. Republican Dan Laughlin of the 49th District represents Erie in the Pennsylvania State Senate. The city of Erie is split by the 1st and 2nd Districts of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and is represented by Democrats Patrick Harkins and Robert E. Merski, respectively.[83]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Erie City School District and Higher education in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine's main campus\nErie Public Schools enroll 12,527 students in primary and secondary grades.[84] The district has 23 public schools including elementary, middle, and high schools, with one charter school. Other than public schools, the city is home to more than 40 private schools and academies. Erie public schools are under frequent criticism for education quality, school rankings, and abnormally high teacher salaries.[*citation needed*]\nThe City of Erie is served by two public high schools, Erie High School and Northwest Pennsylvania Collegiate Academy, plus three Catholic high schools: Cathedral Preparatory School, Mercyhurst Preparatory School, and Villa Maria Academy.\n\n\nErie is home to several colleges and universities, including Gannon University located in downtown Erie, and Mercyhurst University in the southeast part of the city. Other notable colleges in the Erie area include Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine (LECOM, a large medical school), and Edinboro University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\nErie is also home to the Barber National Institute and its Elizabeth Lee Black School, which provides services and education for children and adults with mental disabilities. Erie is home to its main campus, and it provides services in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.[85] The Achievement Center also serves the needs of children from birth to age 21 with physical and mental health disabilities.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Media in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The *Erie Times-News* headquarters office\nErie is served by *Erie Times-News*, the city's daily newspaper, as well as *Erie Reader*, an alternative weekly newspaper.\n\n\nThe Nielsen Company ranks Erie as 152 out of the 210 largest television markets in the United States, as of the 2019−2020 report.[86] The market is served by stations affiliated with major American networks, including WICU-TV 12 (NBC), WJET-TV 24 (ABC), WFXP 66 (FOX), WSEE-TV 35 (CBS), and WSEE-DT2 35.2 (CW). WQLN 54 is a member station of PBS and also broadcasts toward London, Ontario. Cable companies available for Erie include Charter Spectrum, DirecTV, and Dish Network.\n\n\nErie is served by several AM and FM radio stations based in the city, and dozens of other nearby station broadcasts can be heard.\n\n\nIn August 2019, Erie was the subject of a new television show, *Undercover Billionaire*, from the Discovery Channel. In this show, a wealthy businessman, Glenn Stearns, travels to Erie under a fake name, Glenn Bryant. He starts with $100, a cell phone, and an old pickup truck. He is then asked to make a business worth over $1 million in 90 days. If he fails, he has to put $1 million of his own money into the business. Stearns makes the now prosperous business of UnderDog BBQ. Although he only gets the company valuation of around $750,000, it is still a successful business to date. He gave everyone who helped his big roles in the company's future and also invested the $1 million he owed.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)The last McDonnell Douglas DC-9 to fly for US Air arriving at Erie International Airport\n![](image)Union Station is served by Amtrak's *Lake Shore Limited*\n![](image)A road map of Erie and its major routes\n![](image)Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority\nErie is well connected to the Interstate Highway System. Six \"Erie exits\" are along Interstate 90, a major cross-country thoroughfare running from Boston to Seattle. Erie is the northern terminus of Interstate 79, which travels south to Pittsburgh and, ultimately, West Virginia. The western terminus for Interstate 86, also called the \"Southern Tier Expressway\", is at Interstate 90 near Harborcreek, between Erie and North East. Interstate 86 continues east through New York to Binghamton. The Bayfront Connector runs from Interstate 90 in Harborcreek to the Bayfront Parkway and downtown Erie, along the east side of the city, then connects to Interstate 79 on the west side of the city. Major thoroughfares in the city include 12th Street, 26th Street, 38th Street, and Peach Street. Peach is also a part of U.S. Route 19, whose northern terminus is in Erie and continues south, eventually reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Other major routes running through Erie are Pennsylvania Route 5, known as the Seaway Trail and is made up of parts of 6th Street, 8th Street, 12th Street, and East Lake Road in the city, U.S. Route 20, which is 26th Street in the city. The city is divided between east and west by State Street.\n\n\nThe Erie Metropolitan Transit Authority operates the city's transit bus system, known as the 'e'. Buses run seven days a week in the city, with trips out to other parts of the county occurring a few times a week. Intercity buses providing transportation between Buffalo, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh are operated by Greyhound Lines. Service between Buffalo and Cleveland is also provided by Lakefront Lines. Both companies operate out of the Intermodal Transportation Center, which opened in 2002 at the foot of Holland Street.\n\n\nThe former \"Water Level Route\" of the New York Central Railroad travels directly through Erie. It is now the mainline for CSX freight trains. The main line of the Norfolk Southern Railway, originally built by the Nickel Plate Railroad, also travels through Erie. At one time, Norfolk Southern trains ran down the middle of 19th Street, but were removed in 2002.[87] Passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak's *Lake Shore Limited* out of Union Station at 14th and State Streets. The *Lake Shore Limited* stops twice daily—one eastbound towards New York City or Boston, and one westbound towards Chicago.\n\n\nErie International Airport and Tom Ridge Field (IATA code: ERI; ICAO code: KERI) are located 5 miles (8.0 km) west of the city and host general aviation, charter, and airline service. Destinations with nonstop flights out of Erie include Chicago O'Hare International Airport via United Airlines, Charlotte Douglas International Airport via American Airlines, and Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport via Delta Air Lines (Currently suspended). Erie International is amid an $80.5 million runway extension. The extension is slated to increase the runway's length by 1,920 ft (590 m), for a total runway length of 8,420 ft (2,600 m), \"to meet safety requirements\" and allow the airport to accommodate larger aircraft.[88]\n\n\nThe Port of Erie is located on Presque Isle Bay, a natural harbor formed by Presque Isle. It offers some of the finest port facilities for cargo shipping on the Great Lakes, with direct rail access. The Erie−Western Pennsylvania Port Authority provides water taxi service in the summer between Dobbins Landing and Liberty Park in downtown Erie, and the Waterworks ferry landing on Presque Isle.[89]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\nThe Erie Water Works, which was incorporated in 1865 as the Erie Water and Gas Company, includes a reservoir, two water-treatment plants, and an elaborate water works and pipe network that provides water for most of the city and suburbs. Penelec, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy, supplies electricity to the region, as well as the Northwestern Pennsylvania Rural Electric Cooperative. National Fuel Gas Company provides residents with natural gas. Time Warner Cable became the region's cable television provider, after taking over Adelphia, and also provides digital phone and high-speed internet to the region. Local telephone and high-speed internet service are also provided by Verizon.\n\n\nSewage service in Erie is provided by the Erie Sewer Authority, and many outlying townships have partnerships with the Sewer Authority for service. The authority cleans about 30 40×10~~^~~6 US gal (150,000 m3) of wastewater every day.[90]\n\n\nThe time and temperature number in Erie is 452-6311 and was originally discontinued by Verizon in October 2008 before being restarted by a private individual two years later.[91] The city of Erie and northwest Pennsylvania is located in area code 814. On December 16, 2010, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted to split the area code, which was to take effect February 1, 2012.[92] The North American Numbering Plan decided that northwest Pennsylvania would receive the new code of 582. A local grassroots coalition began organizing an opposition to the plan and generated numerous petitions for reconsideration. The PUC immediately voted to review their decision and ordered additional public-input hearings and technical conferences as a response to the strong public outcry.[93] In January 2011, the PUC announced that it was placing the entire area code split plan on hold as NEUSTAR pushed the projected exhaustion date back two years to 2015.[94]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The city currently has six fire stations and protects about 20 sq mi (52 km2). The city has five engine companies, including two rescue engines, one tower company, and one water-rescue unit. The city provides mutual aid to fire departments of Millcreek Township, Summit Township, and East County.\n\n\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\nErie has four official sister cities as designated by Sister Cities International:[96]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Dungarvan, Ireland (2007)\n* ![](image) Lublin, Poland (1998)\n* ![](image) Mérida, Yucatán, Mexico (1973)\n* ![](image) Zibo, Shandong, China (1985)\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n* List of people from Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n\n\n* USS *Erie*, at least one ship==References==\n\n\n1. **^** \"ArcGIS REST Services Directory\".

The city had a population of 95,112 at the 2020 census and is the fourth-largest city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Allentown.[7][8][9][10] Reading is located in the southeastern part of the state and is the principal city of the Greater Reading Area, which had 420,152 residents in 2020.\n\n\nReading is part of the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area, a region that also includes Philadelphia, Upper Darby, Camden, Atlantic City, Wilmington, and other Philadelphia-area cities and counties. With a 2020 core metropolitan statistical area population of 6.288 million and a combined statistical area population of 7.366 million, the Delaware Valley is the nation's seventh-largest metropolitan region.\n\n\nReading gives its name to the now-defunct Reading Company, also known as the Reading Railroad, and since acquired by Conrail, that played a vital role in transporting anthracite coal from the Pennsylvania's Coal Region to major East Coast metropolitan markets through the Port of Philadelphia for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic U.S. version of the *Monopoly* board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as \"The Pretzel City\" because numerous local pretzel bakeries are based in the city and its suburbs; currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists with more than 125 miles of trails in five major preserves; the region is an International Mountain Bicycling Association ride center.[11]\n\n\nAccording to 2010 U.S. census data, Reading had the highest share of citizens living in poverty in the nation among cities with populations exceeding 65,000.[12] Reading's poverty rate fell over the next decade.[13] Reading's poverty rate in the five-year American Community Survey, published in 2018, showed that 35.4% of the city's residents were below the poverty line, or less \"than the infamous 41.3% from 2011, when Reading was declared the poorest small city in the nation.\"[14]\n\n\nReading is located 38.8 miles (62.4 km) southwest of Allentown and 62.9 miles (101.2 km) northwest of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\n![](image)The 500-block of Court Street in Downtown Reading with Berks County courthouse on the left\n![](image)Part of Reading's urbanized area in 1950\n![](image)Downtown Reading from Penn and 2nd Streets\nLenape people, also known as Delaware Indians, inhabited the Reading area prior to European settlement of the region in the 17th century. The Colony of Pennsylvania was a 1680 land grant from King Charles II of England to William Penn. Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, Sir William Penn.\n\n\nIn 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn, both sons of William Penn, mapped out the town of Reading with Conrad Weiser. Taking its name from Reading, Berkshire, England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western Germany, who bought land from the Penns. The first Amish community in the New World was established in Greater Reading, Berks County.[15] The Pennsylvanian German dialect was spoken in the area well into the 1950s.\n\n\nDuring the French and Indian War, Reading was a military base for a chain of forts along the Blue Mountain.\n\n\nBy the time of the American Revolution, the area's iron industry had a total production exceeding England's. There were several prominent Ironmasters like Samuel Van Leer who helped supply George Washington's troops with cannons, rifles, and ammunition in the Revolutionary War.[16] During the early period of the conflict, Reading was again a depot for military supply. Hessian prisoners from the Battle of Trenton were also detained here.\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the nation's capital at the time of the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic.[17] President George Washington traveled to Reading, and considered making it the emergency national capital, but chose Germantown instead.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\nIn 1809, Susanna Cox was tried and convicted for infanticide in Reading. Her case attracted tremendous sympathy; 20,000 viewers came to view her hanging, swamping the 3,000 inhabitants.\n\n\nAccording to census data, Reading was among the nation's most-populous 100 cities in the nation from 1810 to 1950.\n\n\nThe Schuylkill Canal, a north–south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the Schuylkill River and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the Delaware River. The Union Canal, an east–west canal completed in 1828, connected the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers, and ran from Reading to Middletown, Pennsylvania, a few miles south of Harrisburg, the state capital. Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s.\n\n\nThe naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird was born in Reading in 1823.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (P&R) was incorporated in 1833. During the Long Depression following the Panic of 1873, a statewide railroad strike in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed.[18] The Reading Brewing Company was also established around this same time, and was officially chartered in 1886.[19]\n\n\nThe Charles Evans Cemetery is the non-sectarian cemetery where many of the city's prominent business and community leaders have been buried since the cemetery's opening in the 1840s. Established through the donation of land by Reading attorney and philanthropist Charles Evans and a subsequent financial endowment upon his death in 1847, which provided for future improvements to the grounds,[20] the cemetery became a primary gathering point for annual Memorial Day activities from the late 19th through the late 20th centuries due to the presence of the Grand Army of the Republic monument, which was dedicated there in 1887.[21][22][23][24]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Kodachrome slide of Reading developed in May 1983\nIn the early 20th century, the city participated in the burgeoning automobile and motorcycle industry as home to the pioneer \"Brass Era\" companies, Daniels Motor Company, Duryea Motor Wagon Company, and Reading-Standard Company.[25]\n\n\nReading experienced continuous growth until the 1930s, when its population reached nearly 120,000. From the 1940s to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading had been built, and a national trend of urban decline.\n\n\nFollowing more than a century of prosperity, the Reading Company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in 1971. The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail). That same month, the Reading Brewing Company closed.[26]\nIn 1972, Hurricane Agnes caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the Schuylkill River. A similar, though not as devastating, flood occurred during June 2006.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2007, NBC's *Today* show featured Reading as one of the top four \"Up and Coming Neighborhoods\" in the U.S. as showing potential for a real estate boom.[27] The interviewee, Barbara Corcoran, chose the city by looking for areas of big change, renovations, cleanups of parks, waterfronts, and warehouses. Corcoran also noted Reading's proximity to Philadelphia, New York City, and other cities.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nReading is located at 40°20′30″N 75°55′35″W﻿ / ﻿40.34167°N 75.92639°W﻿ / 40.34167; -75.92639 (40.341692, −75.926301)[28] in southeastern Pennsylvania, roughly 65 miles (105 km) northwest of Philadelphia. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.1 square miles (26 km2). 9.8 square miles (25 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) of it (2.39%) is water. The city is largely bounded on the west by the Schuylkill River, on the east by Mount Penn, and on the south by Neversink Mountain. The Reading Prong, the mountain formation stretching northeast into New Jersey, has come to be associated with naturally occurring radon gas; however, homes in Reading are not particularly affected[*citation needed*]. The surrounding county is home to a number of family-owned farms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Reading, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3\n\n\n\n39\n\n23\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n42\n\n24\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n51\n\n32\n | 3.4\n\n\n\n63\n\n42\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n74\n\n52\n | 4.8\n\n\n\n82\n\n61\n | 4.8\n\n\n\n87\n\n66\n | 4.5\n\n\n\n84\n\n64\n | 4.9\n\n\n\n77\n\n57\n | 3.8\n\n\n\n65\n\n45\n | 3\n\n\n\n54\n\n35\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n43\n\n28\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n| Source: NOAA[29] |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 75\n\n\n\n4\n\n−5\n | 66\n\n\n\n6\n\n−4\n | 90\n\n\n\n11\n\n0\n | 85\n\n\n\n17\n\n5\n | 89\n\n\n\n23\n\n11\n | 121\n\n\n\n28\n\n16\n | 121\n\n\n\n30\n\n19\n | 114\n\n\n\n29\n\n18\n | 124\n\n\n\n25\n\n14\n | 97\n\n\n\n19\n\n7\n | 77\n\n\n\n12\n\n2\n | 89\n\n\n\n6\n\n−2\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nThe climate in and around Reading is variable, but relatively mild compared to areas further north. The Reading area falls under the southern periphery of the hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*), with areas just to the south designated as a humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen *Cfa*). Summers are warm and humid with average July highs around 86.5 °F (30.3 °C). Extended periods of heat and high humidity occur. On average, there are 27 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90 °F (32 °C). Reading becomes milder in the autumn, as the heat and humidity of summer relent to lower humidity and temperatures. The first killing frost generally occurs in late October.\n\n\nWinters bring freezing temperatures, but usually move above freezing during the day's warmest point. The average January high is 38.6 °F (3.7 °C); the average January low is 23.0 °F (−5.0 °C), but it is quite common for winter temperatures to undergo much variance from the averages. The all-time record low air temperature (not including wind chill) was −20 °F (−29 °C) during a widespread cold wave in January 1994. Annual snowfall is variable, but averages around 25 inches (64 cm). Spring temperatures vary widely between freezing temperatures and the 80s or even 90s (around 30 °C) later in spring. The last killing frost usually is in early to mid April. Total precipitation for the entire year is 45.21 inches (114.8 cm).\n\n\nJanuary is the only month averaging below freezing while two to three months average above 22 °C (71.6 °F) and seven-months average above 50 °F (10 °C).\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Reading, PA (Reading Regional Airport) 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1888–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 77(25)\n | 82(28)\n | 88(31)\n | 97(36)\n | 96(36)\n | 102(39)\n | 106(41)\n | 105(41)\n | 102(39)\n | 94(34)\n | 84(29)\n | 77(25)\n | 106(41)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 38.6(3.7)\n | 41.9(5.5)\n | 51.0(10.6)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 82.0(27.8)\n | 86.5(30.3)\n | 84.4(29.1)\n | 77.1(25.1)\n | 65.4(18.6)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 43.4(6.3)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 30.8(−0.7)\n | 33.1(0.6)\n | 41.5(5.3)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 62.5(16.9)\n | 71.6(22.0)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n | 74.3(23.5)\n | 66.9(19.4)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 44.6(7.0)\n | 35.7(2.1)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 23.0(−5.0)\n | 24.4(−4.2)\n | 31.9(−0.1)\n | 41.7(5.4)\n | 51.5(10.8)\n | 61.2(16.2)\n | 65.8(18.8)\n | 64.1(17.8)\n | 56.6(13.7)\n | 45.0(7.2)\n | 35.4(1.9)\n | 28.0(−2.2)\n | 44.1(6.7)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −20(−29)\n | −13(−25)\n | −2(−19)\n | 12(−11)\n | 26(−3)\n | 36(2)\n | 43(6)\n | 39(4)\n | 30(−1)\n | 20(−7)\n | 8(−13)\n | −6(−21)\n | −20(−29)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 2.97(75)\n | 2.61(66)\n | 3.53(90)\n | 3.35(85)\n | 3.51(89)\n | 4.77(121)\n | 4.77(121)\n | 4.49(114)\n | 4.88(124)\n | 3.80(97)\n | 3.02(77)\n | 3.51(89)\n | 45.21(1,148)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 10.3\n | 10.2\n | 10.7\n | 11.6\n | 12.5\n | 12.4\n | 10.7\n | 11.2\n | 9.1\n | 10.1\n | 8.9\n | 10.8\n | 128.5\n |\n| Source: NOAA[29][30] |\n\n### Neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Area\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Center City\n | 0.381 sq. mi\n | 5,374\n |\n| Callowhill\n | 0.751 sq. mi\n | 7,289\n |\n| Centre Park\n | 0.615 sq. mi\n | 10,781\n |\n| College Heights\n | 1.295 sq. mi\n | 14,903\n |\n| East Reading\n | 2.230 sq. mi\n | 34,572\n |\n| Eastside\n | 1.849 sq. mi\n | 29,198\n |\n| Glenside\n | 2.303 sq. mi\n | 11,837\n |\n| Hampden Heights\n | 3.144 sq. mi\n | 44,101\n |\n| Millmont\n | 1.024 sq. mi\n | 5,298\n |\n| North Riverside\n | 0.955 sq. mi\n | 12,674\n |\n| Northmont\n | 0.035 sq. mi\n | 697\n |\n| Northside\n | 0.187 sq. mi\n | 1,822\n |\n| Oakbrook/Wyomissing Park\n | 1.197 sq. mi\n | 5,947\n |\n| Outlet District\n | 0.554 sq. mi\n | 14,295\n |\n| Penn's Commons\n | 0.796 sq. mi\n | 15,891\n |\n| Prince Historic District\n | 0.123 sq. mi\n | 2,002\n |\n| Queen Anne Historic District\n | 0.330 sq. mi\n | 6,359\n |\n| Southside\n | 1.486 sq. mi\n | 10,317\n |\n| South of Penn\n | 1.122 sq. mi\n | 8,483\n |\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1790 | 2,225 |  | — |\n| 1800 | 2,386 |  | 7.2% |\n| 1810 | 3,462 |  | 45.1% |\n| 1820 | 4,332 |  | 25.1% |\n| 1830 | 5,856 |  | 35.2% |\n| 1840 | 8,410 |  | 43.6% |\n| 1850 | 15,743 |  | 87.2% |\n| 1860 | 23,162 |  | 47.1% |\n| 1870 | 33,930 |  | 46.5% |\n| 1880 | 43,278 |  | 27.6% |\n| 1890 | 58,661 |  | 35.5% |\n| 1900 | 78,961 |  | 34.6% |\n| 1910 | 96,071 |  | 21.7% |\n| 1920 | 107,784 |  | 12.2% |\n| 1930 | 111,171 |  | 3.1% |\n| 1940 | 110,568 |  | −0.5% |\n| 1950 | 109,320 |  | −1.1% |\n| 1960 | 98,061 |  | −10.3% |\n| 1970 | 87,643 |  | −10.6% |\n| 1980 | 78,686 |  | −10.2% |\n| 1990 | 78,380 |  | −0.4% |\n| 2000 | 81,207 |  | 3.6% |\n| 2010 | 88,082 |  | 8.5% |\n| 2020 | 95,112 |  | 8.0% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[31] |\n\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, Reading had a population of 95,112.

Scheduled commercial airline service to Reading ended in 2004, when the last airline, USAir stopped flying into Reading.[53]\n\n\nFreight rail service in Reading is provided by the Norfolk Southern Railway, the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad, and the East Penn Railroad.[48] Norfolk Southern Railway serves Reading along the Harrisburg Line, which runs east to Philadelphia and west to Harrisburg, and the Reading Line, which runs northeast to Allentown. Norfolk Southern Railway operates the Reading Yard in Reading.[48][54] The Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad operates the Reading Division line from an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading north to Port Clinton and Packerton.[55] The East Penn Railroad operates the Lancaster Northern line from Sinking Spring southwest to Ephrata, using trackage rights along Norfolk Southern Railway east from Sinking Spring to an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading.[56]\n\n\nPassenger trains ran between Pottsville, Reading, Pottstown, and Philadelphia along the Pottsville Line until July 27, 1981, when transit operator SEPTA curtailed commuter service to electrified lines. Since then, there have been repeated calls for the resumption of the services.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and up to 2003, SEPTA, in cooperation with Reading-based BARTA, funded a study called the Schuylkill Valley Metro which included plans to extend SEPTA's R6 passenger line to Pottstown, Reading, and Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. The project suffered a major setback when it was rejected by the Federal Transit Administration New Starts program, which cited doubts about the ridership projections and financing assumptions used by the study. With the recent surge in gasoline prices and ever-increasing traffic, the planning commissions of Montgomery County and Berks County have teamed to study the feasibility of a simple diesel shuttle train between the Manayunk/Norristown Line and Pottstown/Reading.[57] In 2018, a panel led by the Greater Reading Chamber Alliance pushed for an extension of the Manayunk/Norristown Line to Reading along existing Norfolk Southern freight railroad tracks, with service terminating either at the Franklin Street Station in Reading or in Wyomissing.[58] In 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation conducted a feasibility study on passenger train service from Reading to Philadelphia.[59][60] In 2021, Amtrak announced a plan to implement intercity train service from Reading to Philadelphia and New York City, mostly following the Norfolk Southern line between Reading and Philadelphia and the Northeast Corridor between Philadelphia and New York City.[61] In April 2022, the commissions of Berks, Chester, and Montgomery County voted to establish the Schuylkill River Passenger Rail Authority to oversee the restoration of Philadelphia-Reading passenger rail service on the former Reading Railroad right-of-way.[62]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Ontelaunee, a primary water supplier to Reading\nElectricity in Reading is provided by Met-Ed, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy.[63][64] Natural gas service in the city is provided by UGI Utilities.[65][66] The Reading Area Water Authority provides water to the city, with the city's water supply coming from Lake Ontelaunee and the city's water treated at the Maidencreek Filter Plant. The Reading Water Company was founded in 1821 to supply water to the city. The Reading Area Water Authority was established on May 20, 1994, to take over the water system in the city.[67] Sewer service is provided by the city's Public Works department, with a wastewater treatment plant owned by the city located on Fritz Island.[68] The city's Public Works department provides trash and recycling collection to Reading.[69]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nHospitals serving the Reading area include Reading Hospital in West Reading and Penn State Health St. Joseph in Bern Township and downtown Reading. Reading Hospital offers an emergency department with a Level I trauma center and various services including Cancer Care, Heart Center, Orthopedic Services, Pediatrics, Primary Care, and Women's Health.[70] Penn State Health St. Joseph offers an emergency department, heart institute, cancer center, stroke center, wound center, orthopedics, and primary care physicians.[71]\n\n\n\n### Fire department[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Reading Fire Department\n\n![](image)Reading Fire Museum\nThe city of Reading is protected by the 135 firefighters and paramedics of the Reading Fire and EMS Department (RFD). The RFD operates out of seven fire stations throughout the city. The RFD operates a fire apparatus fleet of five Engine Companies, three Ladder Companies, one Rescue Company, brush unit, and four front-line Medic Ambulances. In 2018, fire units responded to 9,992 incidents. EMS responses totaled 19,505 calls for service.[*citation needed*] Department staffing is only two firefighters per apparatus.[72]\n\n\n\n## In media[edit]\n\n\nThe book and movie *Rabbit, Run* and the other three novels of the *Rabbit* series by John Updike were set in fictionalized versions of Reading and nearby Shillington, called Brewer and Olinger respectively. Updike was born in Reading and lived in nearby Shillington until he was thirteen. He also makes reference to the Brewer suburb of Mount Judge, equivalent to Mount Penn, east of Reading.\n\n\nThe play *Sweat* by Lynn Nottage is set in Reading.[73][74]\n\n\nThe movie *Goon: Last of the Enforcers* features Reading as the home of the rival team, the Reading Wolf Dogs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn season nine, episode four of the sitcom, Seinfeld, the character George Costanza (Jason Alexander) lies that Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is moving to Reading, Pennsylvania to live with her grandparents.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain category: People from Reading, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)*David McMurtrie Gregg*, an Augustus Lukeman erected in 1922\n* Gus Alberts (1861–1912), Major League Baseball player[75]\n* Coit Albertson (1880–1953), Silent Film actor\n* George Warren Alexander (1829–1903), US Army officer and founder of G.W.

The city had a population of 95,112 at the 2020 census and is the fourth-largest city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Allentown.[7][8][9][10] Reading is located in the southeastern part of the state and is the principal city of the Greater Reading Area, which had 420,152 residents in 2020.\n\n\nReading is part of the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area, a region that also includes Philadelphia, Upper Darby, Camden, Atlantic City, Wilmington, and other Philadelphia-area cities and counties. With a 2020 core metropolitan statistical area population of 6.288 million and a combined statistical area population of 7.366 million, the Delaware Valley is the nation's seventh-largest metropolitan region.\n\n\nReading gives its name to the now-defunct Reading Company, also known as the Reading Railroad, and since acquired by Conrail, that played a vital role in transporting anthracite coal from the Pennsylvania's Coal Region to major East Coast metropolitan markets through the Port of Philadelphia for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic U.S. version of the *Monopoly* board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as \"The Pretzel City\" because numerous local pretzel bakeries are based in the city and its suburbs; currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists with more than 125 miles of trails in five major preserves; the region is an International Mountain Bicycling Association ride center.[11]\n\n\nAccording to 2010 U.S. census data, Reading had the highest share of citizens living in poverty in the nation among cities with populations exceeding 65,000.[12] Reading's poverty rate fell over the next decade.[13] Reading's poverty rate in the five-year American Community Survey, published in 2018, showed that 35.4% of the city's residents were below the poverty line, or less \"than the infamous 41.3% from 2011, when Reading was declared the poorest small city in the nation.\"[14]\n\n\nReading is located 38.8 miles (62.4 km) southwest of Allentown and 62.9 miles (101.2 km) northwest of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\n![](image)The 500-block of Court Street in Downtown Reading with Berks County courthouse on the left\n![](image)Part of Reading's urbanized area in 1950\n![](image)Downtown Reading from Penn and 2nd Streets\nLenape people, also known as Delaware Indians, inhabited the Reading area prior to European settlement of the region in the 17th century. The Colony of Pennsylvania was a 1680 land grant from King Charles II of England to William Penn. Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, Sir William Penn.\n\n\nIn 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn, both sons of William Penn, mapped out the town of Reading with Conrad Weiser. Taking its name from Reading, Berkshire, England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western Germany, who bought land from the Penns. The first Amish community in the New World was established in Greater Reading, Berks County.[15] The Pennsylvanian German dialect was spoken in the area well into the 1950s.\n\n\nDuring the French and Indian War, Reading was a military base for a chain of forts along the Blue Mountain.\n\n\nBy the time of the American Revolution, the area's iron industry had a total production exceeding England's. There were several prominent Ironmasters like Samuel Van Leer who helped supply George Washington's troops with cannons, rifles, and ammunition in the Revolutionary War.[16] During the early period of the conflict, Reading was again a depot for military supply. Hessian prisoners from the Battle of Trenton were also detained here.\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the nation's capital at the time of the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic.[17] President George Washington traveled to Reading, and considered making it the emergency national capital, but chose Germantown instead.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\nIn 1809, Susanna Cox was tried and convicted for infanticide in Reading. Her case attracted tremendous sympathy; 20,000 viewers came to view her hanging, swamping the 3,000 inhabitants.\n\n\nAccording to census data, Reading was among the nation's most-populous 100 cities in the nation from 1810 to 1950.\n\n\nThe Schuylkill Canal, a north–south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the Schuylkill River and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the Delaware River. The Union Canal, an east–west canal completed in 1828, connected the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers, and ran from Reading to Middletown, Pennsylvania, a few miles south of Harrisburg, the state capital. Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s.\n\n\nThe naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird was born in Reading in 1823.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (P&R) was incorporated in 1833. During the Long Depression following the Panic of 1873, a statewide railroad strike in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed.[18] The Reading Brewing Company was also established around this same time, and was officially chartered in 1886.[19]\n\n\nThe Charles Evans Cemetery is the non-sectarian cemetery where many of the city's prominent business and community leaders have been buried since the cemetery's opening in the 1840s. Established through the donation of land by Reading attorney and philanthropist Charles Evans and a subsequent financial endowment upon his death in 1847, which provided for future improvements to the grounds,[20] the cemetery became a primary gathering point for annual Memorial Day activities from the late 19th through the late 20th centuries due to the presence of the Grand Army of the Republic monument, which was dedicated there in 1887.[21][22][23][24]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Kodachrome slide of Reading developed in May 1983\nIn the early 20th century, the city participated in the burgeoning automobile and motorcycle industry as home to the pioneer \"Brass Era\" companies, Daniels Motor Company, Duryea Motor Wagon Company, and Reading-Standard Company.[25]\n\n\nReading experienced continuous growth until the 1930s, when its population reached nearly 120,000. From the 1940s to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading had been built, and a national trend of urban decline.\n\n\nFollowing more than a century of prosperity, the Reading Company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in 1971. The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail). That same month, the Reading Brewing Company closed.[26]\nIn 1972, Hurricane Agnes caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the Schuylkill River. A similar, though not as devastating, flood occurred during June 2006.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2007, NBC's *Today* show featured Reading as one of the top four \"Up and Coming Neighborhoods\" in the U.S. as showing potential for a real estate boom.[27] The interviewee, Barbara Corcoran, chose the city by looking for areas of big change, renovations, cleanups of parks, waterfronts, and warehouses. Corcoran also noted Reading's proximity to Philadelphia, New York City, and other cities.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nReading is located at 40°20′30″N 75°55′35″W﻿ / ﻿40.34167°N 75.92639°W﻿ / 40.34167; -75.92639 (40.341692, −75.926301)[28] in southeastern Pennsylvania, roughly 65 miles (105 km) northwest of Philadelphia. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.1 square miles (26 km2). 9.8 square miles (25 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) of it (2.39%) is water. The city is largely bounded on the west by the Schuylkill River, on the east by Mount Penn, and on the south by Neversink Mountain. The Reading Prong, the mountain formation stretching northeast into New Jersey, has come to be associated with naturally occurring radon gas; however, homes in Reading are not particularly affected[*citation needed*]. The surrounding county is home to a number of family-owned farms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Reading, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3\n\n\n\n39\n\n23\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n42\n\n24\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n51\n\n32\n | 3.4\n\n\n\n63\n\n42\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n74\n\n52\n | 4.8\n\n\n\n82\n\n61\n | 4.8\n\n\n\n87\n\n66\n | 4.5\n\n\n\n84\n\n64\n | 4.9\n\n\n\n77\n\n57\n | 3.8\n\n\n\n65\n\n45\n | 3\n\n\n\n54\n\n35\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n43\n\n28\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n| Source: NOAA[29] |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 75\n\n\n\n4\n\n−5\n | 66\n\n\n\n6\n\n−4\n | 90\n\n\n\n11\n\n0\n | 85\n\n\n\n17\n\n5\n | 89\n\n\n\n23\n\n11\n | 121\n\n\n\n28\n\n16\n | 121\n\n\n\n30\n\n19\n | 114\n\n\n\n29\n\n18\n | 124\n\n\n\n25\n\n14\n | 97\n\n\n\n19\n\n7\n | 77\n\n\n\n12\n\n2\n | 89\n\n\n\n6\n\n−2\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nThe climate in and around Reading is variable, but relatively mild compared to areas further north. The Reading area falls under the southern periphery of the hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*), with areas just to the south designated as a humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen *Cfa*). Summers are warm and humid with average July highs around 86.5 °F (30.3 °C). Extended periods of heat and high humidity occur. On average, there are 27 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90 °F (32 °C). Reading becomes milder in the autumn, as the heat and humidity of summer relent to lower humidity and temperatures. The first killing frost generally occurs in late October.\n\n\nWinters bring freezing temperatures, but usually move above freezing during the day's warmest point. The average January high is 38.6 °F (3.7 °C); the average January low is 23.0 °F (−5.0 °C), but it is quite common for winter temperatures to undergo much variance from the averages. The all-time record low air temperature (not including wind chill) was −20 °F (−29 °C) during a widespread cold wave in January 1994. Annual snowfall is variable, but averages around 25 inches (64 cm). Spring temperatures vary widely between freezing temperatures and the 80s or even 90s (around 30 °C) later in spring. The last killing frost usually is in early to mid April. Total precipitation for the entire year is 45.21 inches (114.8 cm).\n\n\nJanuary is the only month averaging below freezing while two to three months average above 22 °C (71.6 °F) and seven-months average above 50 °F (10 °C).\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Reading, PA (Reading Regional Airport) 1991–2020 normals, extremes 1888–present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 77(25)\n | 82(28)\n | 88(31)\n | 97(36)\n | 96(36)\n | 102(39)\n | 106(41)\n | 105(41)\n | 102(39)\n | 94(34)\n | 84(29)\n | 77(25)\n | 106(41)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 38.6(3.7)\n | 41.9(5.5)\n | 51.0(10.6)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 82.0(27.8)\n | 86.5(30.3)\n | 84.4(29.1)\n | 77.1(25.1)\n | 65.4(18.6)\n | 53.8(12.1)\n | 43.4(6.3)\n | 63.4(17.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 30.8(−0.7)\n | 33.1(0.6)\n | 41.5(5.3)\n | 52.5(11.4)\n | 62.5(16.9)\n | 71.6(22.0)\n | 76.1(24.5)\n | 74.3(23.5)\n | 66.9(19.4)\n | 55.2(12.9)\n | 44.6(7.0)\n | 35.7(2.1)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 23.0(−5.0)\n | 24.4(−4.2)\n | 31.9(−0.1)\n | 41.7(5.4)\n | 51.5(10.8)\n | 61.2(16.2)\n | 65.8(18.8)\n | 64.1(17.8)\n | 56.6(13.7)\n | 45.0(7.2)\n | 35.4(1.9)\n | 28.0(−2.2)\n | 44.1(6.7)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −20(−29)\n | −13(−25)\n | −2(−19)\n | 12(−11)\n | 26(−3)\n | 36(2)\n | 43(6)\n | 39(4)\n | 30(−1)\n | 20(−7)\n | 8(−13)\n | −6(−21)\n | −20(−29)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 2.97(75)\n | 2.61(66)\n | 3.53(90)\n | 3.35(85)\n | 3.51(89)\n | 4.77(121)\n | 4.77(121)\n | 4.49(114)\n | 4.88(124)\n | 3.80(97)\n | 3.02(77)\n | 3.51(89)\n | 45.21(1,148)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 10.3\n | 10.2\n | 10.7\n | 11.6\n | 12.5\n | 12.4\n | 10.7\n | 11.2\n | 9.1\n | 10.1\n | 8.9\n | 10.8\n | 128.5\n |\n| Source: NOAA[29][30] |\n\n### Neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Area\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Center City\n | 0.381 sq. mi\n | 5,374\n |\n| Callowhill\n | 0.751 sq. mi\n | 7,289\n |\n| Centre Park\n | 0.615 sq. mi\n | 10,781\n |\n| College Heights\n | 1.295 sq. mi\n | 14,903\n |\n| East Reading\n | 2.230 sq. mi\n | 34,572\n |\n| Eastside\n | 1.849 sq. mi\n | 29,198\n |\n| Glenside\n | 2.303 sq. mi\n | 11,837\n |\n| Hampden Heights\n | 3.144 sq. mi\n | 44,101\n |\n| Millmont\n | 1.024 sq. mi\n | 5,298\n |\n| North Riverside\n | 0.955 sq. mi\n | 12,674\n |\n| Northmont\n | 0.035 sq. mi\n | 697\n |\n| Northside\n | 0.187 sq. mi\n | 1,822\n |\n| Oakbrook/Wyomissing Park\n | 1.197 sq. mi\n | 5,947\n |\n| Outlet District\n | 0.554 sq. mi\n | 14,295\n |\n| Penn's Commons\n | 0.796 sq. mi\n | 15,891\n |\n| Prince Historic District\n | 0.123 sq. mi\n | 2,002\n |\n| Queen Anne Historic District\n | 0.330 sq. mi\n | 6,359\n |\n| Southside\n | 1.486 sq. mi\n | 10,317\n |\n| South of Penn\n | 1.122 sq. mi\n | 8,483\n |\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1790 | 2,225 |  | — |\n| 1800 | 2,386 |  | 7.2% |\n| 1810 | 3,462 |  | 45.1% |\n| 1820 | 4,332 |  | 25.1% |\n| 1830 | 5,856 |  | 35.2% |\n| 1840 | 8,410 |  | 43.6% |\n| 1850 | 15,743 |  | 87.2% |\n| 1860 | 23,162 |  | 47.1% |\n| 1870 | 33,930 |  | 46.5% |\n| 1880 | 43,278 |  | 27.6% |\n| 1890 | 58,661 |  | 35.5% |\n| 1900 | 78,961 |  | 34.6% |\n| 1910 | 96,071 |  | 21.7% |\n| 1920 | 107,784 |  | 12.2% |\n| 1930 | 111,171 |  | 3.1% |\n| 1940 | 110,568 |  | −0.5% |\n| 1950 | 109,320 |  | −1.1% |\n| 1960 | 98,061 |  | −10.3% |\n| 1970 | 87,643 |  | −10.6% |\n| 1980 | 78,686 |  | −10.2% |\n| 1990 | 78,380 |  | −0.4% |\n| 2000 | 81,207 |  | 3.6% |\n| 2010 | 88,082 |  | 8.5% |\n| 2020 | 95,112 |  | 8.0% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[31] |\n\n\nAs of the 2020 United States census, Reading had a population of 95,112.

The Astor, Embassy, Loew's Colonial, and Rajah Shrine Theater were grand monuments of architecture and entertainment. Today, after depression, recession, and urban renewal, the Rajah is the only one to remain. The Astor Theater was demolished in 1998 to make way for The Sovereign Center. Certain steps were taken to retain mementos of the Astor, including its ornate Art Deco chandelier and gates. These are on display and in use inside the arena corridors, allowing insight into the ambiance of the former movie house. In 2000, the Rajah was purchased from the Shriners. After a much needed restoration, it was renamed the Sovereign Performing Arts Center. In 2013 the theatre and arena were rebranded as the Santander Performing Arts Center and Santander Arena respectively after Santander Bank purchased Sovereign.\n\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic Air Museum is a membership-supported museum and restoration facility located at Carl A.

The Republican and Democratic parties united against the Socialists in the 1917 local elections. Reading became the third city in the United States to have a local government controlled by the Socialists after the 1927 election including the election of J. Henry Stump as mayor and James H. Maurer to the city council. After the 1929 election the Socialists gained control over the city council. The Socialists lost support during the Great Depression and were defeated by a united Republican and Democratic ticket in the 1931 election. Stump was defeated by Heber Ermentrout and the party was reduced to two seats on the city council. The Socialists lost their two seats on the city council in the 1933 election.[44]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Reading School District\n\n![](image)\nReading Senior High School in May 2008\nFile:Berks Catholic school.jpg\nBerks Catholic High School in August 2021\n\nReading School District provides elementary and middle schools for the city's children. As of 2023, Reading Senior High School, serving grades nine through 12, is the largest traditional high school in Pennsylvania with a student population of 5,498.[45]\n\n\nThree high schools serve the city:\n\n\n\n* Berks Catholic High School (grades 9–12)\n* Reading High School (grades 9–12)\n* Reading Intermediate High School (grade 8)\n\n\nAs of 2012, according to a report in *The New York Times*, approximately eight percent of Reading's residents have a college degree, compared to a national average of 28 percent.[46]\n\n\nFour institutions of higher learning are located in Reading:\n\n\n\n* Albright College\n* Alvernia University\n* Penn State Berks\n* Reading Area Community College\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Roads and highways[edit]\n\n\n![](image)US 422 westbound in Reading\nAs of 2013, there were 157.48 miles (253.44 km) of public roads in Reading, of which 25.33 miles (40.76 km) were maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) and 132.15 miles (212.67 km) were maintained by the city.[47]\n\n\nA number of federal and state highways allow entry to and egress from Reading. U.S. Route 422, the major east–west artery, circles the western edge of the city and is known locally as The West Shore Bypass. Various interchanges allow for vehicles on US 422 to enter the City of Reading and vice versa, with the most notable interchange bringing vehicles on and off of the Penn Street Bridge, a historic bridge considered to be the primary gateway to downtown Reading. US 422 leads west to Lebanon and east to Pottstown. U.S. Route 222 bypasses the city to the west, leading southwest to Lancaster and northeast to Allentown. Interstate 176 heads south from US 422 near Reading and leads to the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76) in Morgantown. Pennsylvania Route 12 is known as the Warren Street Bypass, as it bypasses downtown Reading to the northwest. PA 12 begins at US 422/US 222 in Wyomissing and heads northeast on the Warren Street Bypass before becoming Pricetown Road and leading northeast to Pricetown. Pennsylvania Route 10 is known as Morgantown Road and heads south from Reading parallel to I-176 to Morgantown. Pennsylvania Route 61 heads north from Reading on Centre Avenue and leads to Pottsville. Pennsylvania Route 183 heads northwest from Reading on Schuylkill Avenue and Bernville Road, leading to Bernville. U.S. Route 222 Business is designated as Lancaster Avenue, Bingaman Street, South 4th Street, and 5th Street through Reading. U.S. Route 422 Business is designated as Penn Street, Washington Street (westbound), Franklin Street (eastbound), and Perkiomen Avenue through Reading.[48]\n\n\n\n### Public transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A BARTA bus in downtown Reading\n![](image)Franklin Street station at Franklin and 7th Streets\nPublic transit in Reading and its surrounding communities has been provided since 1973 by the Berks Area Regional Transportation Authority (BARTA). BARTA operates a fleet of 50 buses (all hybrid electric buses) serving 20 routes, mostly originating at the BARTA Transportation Center in Downtown Reading. BARTA also provides paratransit service in addition to fixed route service. The former Reading Railroad Franklin Street Station was refurbished and reopened to bus service on September 9, 2013, with buses running the express route back and forth to Lebanon Transit. The route to Lebanon was discontinued after a short period, resulting in the refurbished station sitting vacant.\n\n\nKlein Transportation provides bus service to Reading from a stop in downtown Reading and a stop at the Boscov's at the former Fairgrounds Square Mall to Douglassville, Kutztown, Wescosville, Hellertown, and Midtown Manhattan in New York City.[49] Transport Azumah provides bus service from the InterCity Bus Terminal to New York City.[50][51] Amtrak Thruway bus service operated by Krapf Coaches runs from the BARTA Transportation Center in Reading to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, with an intermediate stop in Pottstown.[52]\n\n\nReading and the surrounding area is serviced by the Reading Regional Airport, a general aviation airfield. The three-letter airport code for Reading is RDG. Scheduled commercial airline service to Reading ended in 2004, when the last airline, USAir stopped flying into Reading.[53]\n\n\nFreight rail service in Reading is provided by the Norfolk Southern Railway, the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad, and the East Penn Railroad.[48] Norfolk Southern Railway serves Reading along the Harrisburg Line, which runs east to Philadelphia and west to Harrisburg, and the Reading Line, which runs northeast to Allentown. Norfolk Southern Railway operates the Reading Yard in Reading.[48][54] The Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad operates the Reading Division line from an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading north to Port Clinton and Packerton.[55] The East Penn Railroad operates the Lancaster Northern line from Sinking Spring southwest to Ephrata, using trackage rights along Norfolk Southern Railway east from Sinking Spring to an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading.[56]\n\n\nPassenger trains ran between Pottsville, Reading, Pottstown, and Philadelphia along the Pottsville Line until July 27, 1981, when transit operator SEPTA curtailed commuter service to electrified lines. Since then, there have been repeated calls for the resumption of the services.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and up to 2003, SEPTA, in cooperation with Reading-based BARTA, funded a study called the Schuylkill Valley Metro which included plans to extend SEPTA's R6 passenger line to Pottstown, Reading, and Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. The project suffered a major setback when it was rejected by the Federal Transit Administration New Starts program, which cited doubts about the ridership projections and financing assumptions used by the study. With the recent surge in gasoline prices and ever-increasing traffic, the planning commissions of Montgomery County and Berks County have teamed to study the feasibility of a simple diesel shuttle train between the Manayunk/Norristown Line and Pottstown/Reading.[57] In 2018, a panel led by the Greater Reading Chamber Alliance pushed for an extension of the Manayunk/Norristown Line to Reading along existing Norfolk Southern freight railroad tracks, with service terminating either at the Franklin Street Station in Reading or in Wyomissing.[58] In 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation conducted a feasibility study on passenger train service from Reading to Philadelphia.[59][60] In 2021, Amtrak announced a plan to implement intercity train service from Reading to Philadelphia and New York City, mostly following the Norfolk Southern line between Reading and Philadelphia and the Northeast Corridor between Philadelphia and New York City.[61] In April 2022, the commissions of Berks, Chester, and Montgomery County voted to establish the Schuylkill River Passenger Rail Authority to oversee the restoration of Philadelphia-Reading passenger rail service on the former Reading Railroad right-of-way.[62]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Ontelaunee, a primary water supplier to Reading\nElectricity in Reading is provided by Met-Ed, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy.[63][64] Natural gas service in the city is provided by UGI Utilities.[65][66] The Reading Area Water Authority provides water to the city, with the city's water supply coming from Lake Ontelaunee and the city's water treated at the Maidencreek Filter Plant. The Reading Water Company was founded in 1821 to supply water to the city. The Reading Area Water Authority was established on May 20, 1994, to take over the water system in the city.[67] Sewer service is provided by the city's Public Works department, with a wastewater treatment plant owned by the city located on Fritz Island.[68] The city's Public Works department provides trash and recycling collection to Reading.[69]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nHospitals serving the Reading area include Reading Hospital in West Reading and Penn State Health St. Joseph in Bern Township and downtown Reading. Reading Hospital offers an emergency department with a Level I trauma center and various services including Cancer Care, Heart Center, Orthopedic Services, Pediatrics, Primary Care, and Women's Health.[70] Penn State Health St. Joseph offers an emergency department, heart institute, cancer center, stroke center, wound center, orthopedics, and primary care physicians.[71]\n\n\n\n### Fire department[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Reading Fire Department\n\n![](image)Reading Fire Museum\nThe city of Reading is protected by the 135 firefighters and paramedics of the Reading Fire and EMS Department (RFD). The RFD operates out of seven fire stations throughout the city. The RFD operates a fire apparatus fleet of five Engine Companies, three Ladder Companies, one Rescue Company, brush unit, and four front-line Medic Ambulances. In 2018, fire units responded to 9,992 incidents. EMS responses totaled 19,505 calls for service.[*citation needed*] Department staffing is only two firefighters per apparatus.[72]\n\n\n\n## In media[edit]\n\n\nThe book and movie *Rabbit, Run* and the other three novels of the *Rabbit* series by John Updike were set in fictionalized versions of Reading and nearby Shillington, called Brewer and Olinger respectively. Updike was born in Reading and lived in nearby Shillington until he was thirteen. He also makes reference to the Brewer suburb of Mount Judge, equivalent to Mount Penn, east of Reading.\n\n\nThe play *Sweat* by Lynn Nottage is set in Reading.[73][74]\n\n\nThe movie *Goon: Last of the Enforcers* features Reading as the home of the rival team, the Reading Wolf Dogs.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn season nine, episode four of the sitcom, Seinfeld, the character George Costanza (Jason Alexander) lies that Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is moving to Reading, Pennsylvania to live with her grandparents.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain category: People from Reading, Pennsylvania\n\n![](image)*David McMurtrie Gregg*, an Augustus Lukeman erected in 1922\n* Gus Alberts (1861–1912), Major League Baseball player[75]\n* Coit Albertson (1880–1953), Silent Film actor\n* George Warren Alexander (1829–1903), US Army officer and founder of G.W.

It is one of the most historically significant cities in the United States and served as the nation's capital until 1800.[13] Philadelphia is the nation's sixth-most populous city with a population of 1,603,797 as of the 2020 census. Since 1854, the city has been coextensive with Philadelphia County, the most populous county in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia serves as the urban core of the larger Delaware Valley (or Philadelphia metropolitan area), the nation's seventh-largest and one of the world's largest metropolitan regions consisting of 6.245 million residents in the metropolitan statistical area and 7.366 million residents in its combined statistical area.[14] Philadelphia is known for its extensive contributions to American history, especially the American Revolution, and for its contemporary influence in business and industry, culture, sports, and music.[15][16]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was founded in 1682 by William Penn, an English Quaker and advocate of religious freedom. The city served as the capital of the Pennsylvania Colony during the British colonial era[5][17] and went on to play a historic and vital role as the central meeting place for the nation's founding fathers whose plans and actions in Philadelphia ultimately inspired the American Revolution and the nation's independence following the Revolutionary War. Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774, preserved the Liberty Bell, and hosted the Second Continental Congress during which the founders signed the Declaration of Independence, which historian Joseph Ellis has described as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history\".[18] Once the Revolutionary War commenced, the Battle of Germantown and the siege of Fort Mifflin were fought within Philadelphia's city limits. The U.S. Constitution was later ratified in Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until 1790, when it was surpassed by New York City, and it served as the nation's first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions during and following the American Revolution, including from 1790 to 1800 during the construction of the new national capital of Washington, D.C.\n\n\nWith 18 four-year universities and colleges, Philadelphia is one of the nation's leading centers for higher education and academic research.[19][20] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area was the state's largest and nation's ninth-largest metropolitan economy with a gross metropolitan product of US$444.1 billion. The city is home to five Fortune 500 corporate headquarters as of 2022.[21] As of 2023, metropolitan Philadelphia ranks among the top five U.S. venture capital centers, facilitated by its proximity to New York City's entrepreneurial and financial ecosystems.[22] The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, owned by Nasdaq since 2008, is the nation's oldest stock exchange and a global leader in options trading.[23] 30th Street Station, the city's primary rail station, is the third-busiest Amtrak hub in the nation, and the city's multimodal transport and logistics infrastructure, includes Philadelphia International Airport, and the rapidly-growing PhilaPort seaport.[24] A migration pattern has been established from New York City to Philadelphia by residents opting for a large city with relative proximity and a lower cost of living.[25][26]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a national cultural center, hosting more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other city in the nation.[27][28] Fairmount Park, when combined with adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the same watershed, is 2,052 acres (830 ha), representing one of the nation's largest and the world's 45th-largest urban park.[29] The city is known for its arts, culture, cuisine, and colonial and Revolution-era history; in 2016, it attracted 42 million domestic tourists who spent $6.8 billion, representing $11 billion in economic impact to the city and its surrounding Pennsylvania counties.[30]\n\n\nWith five professional sports teams and one of the nation's most loyal fan bases, Philadelphia is often ranked as the nation's best city for professional sports fans.[31][32][33][34] The city has a culturally and philanthropically active LGBTQ+ community. Philadelphia also has played an immensely influential historic and ongoing role in the development and evolution of American music, especially R&B, soul, and rock.[35][36]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a city of many firsts, including the nation's first library (1731),[37] hospital (1751),[37] medical school (1765),[38] national capital (1774),[39] university (by some accounts) (1779),[40] stock exchange (1790),[37] zoo (1874),[41] and business school (1881).[42] Philadelphia contains 67 National Historic Landmarks, including Independence Hall.[43][44][20] From the city's 17th century founding through the present, Philadelphia has been the birthplace or home to an extensive number of prominent and influential Americans. In 2021, *Time* magazine named Philadelphia one of the world's greatest 100 places.[45]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Philadelphia\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Philadelphia.\n\nSee also: List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia and National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n\n### Native peoples[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 17th century, the Philadelphia area was home to the Lenape (Delaware) Indians in the village of Shackamaxon. They were also called the Delaware Indians,[46] and their historical territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley.[a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts.[46] Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and conflict with Europeans. The Iroquois occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and the United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory to present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territories under the Indian removal policy.\n\n\n\n### Colonial[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Penn (holding paper) and King Charles II depicted in *The Birth of Pennsylvania*, an 1680 portrait by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris\n![A Portraiture of the City of Philadelphia, by Thomas Holme](image)A 1683 portrait of Philadelphia by Thomas Holme that is believed to be the city's first map\n![](image)William Penn's 1682 Treaty of Shackamaxon with the Lenape tribe depicted in *Penn's Treaty with the Indians*, a 1772 portrait by Benjamin West\nEuropeans came to the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century. The first settlements were founded by Dutch colonists, who built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River in 1623 in what is now Brooklawn, New Jersey. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New Netherland colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina, located in present-day Wilmington, Delaware, and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks in their war against Maryland colonists.[47] In 1648, the Dutch built Fort Beversreede on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill River near the present-day Eastwick section of Philadelphia, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building Fort Nya Korsholm, or New Korsholm, named after a town in Finland with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. An English fleet captured the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682, when the area was included in William Penn's charter for Pennsylvania.[48]\n\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape in an effort to establish good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for the colony.[49] Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown neighborhood.[5] Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for \"brotherly love\", derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος *phílos* (beloved, dear) and ἀδελφός *adelphós* (brother, brotherly). There were a number of cities named *Philadelphia* in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Greek and Roman periods, including modern Alaşehir, mentioned as the site of an early Christian congregation in the Book of Revelation. As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, which exceeded that of other colonies, led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city.[50]\n\n\nPenn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart with areas for gardens and orchards.\n\n\nThe city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, and instead crowded the present-day Port of Philadelphia on the Delaware River and subdivided and resold their lots.[51] Before Penn left Philadelphia for the final time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. Though poor at first, Philadelphia became an important trading center with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. Benjamin Franklin, a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones that were among the first in the nation, including a fire company, library, and hospital.\n\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life, including the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the Academy of Natural Sciences (1812), and the Franklin Institute (1824).[52] These societies developed and financed new industries that attracted skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n\n\n### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution and Philadelphia campaign\n\n![](image)The Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration of Independence in Independence Hall on June 28, 1776, depicted in an 1818 painting by John Trumbull; historian Joseph Ellis called the Declaration \"the most potent and consequential words in American history.\"[53]\n![](image)President's House on Market Street served as the presidential mansion for the nation's first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams, from 1790 to 1800 prior to the completion of the White House and the development of Washington, D.C. as the nation's new capital\n![](image)Independence Hall on Chestnut Street between 5th and 6th Streets, where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Constitution was ratified, on July 4, 1776, and June 21, 1788, respectively\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America's revolutionaries. By the 1750s, Philadelphia surpassed Boston as the largest city and busiest port in British America, and the second-largest city in the entire British Empire after London.[54][55] In 1774, as resentment of British colonial practices and support for independence was burgeoning in the colonies, Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress.\n\n\nFrom 1775 to 1781, Philadelphia hosted the Second Continental Congress,[56] which adopted the Declaration of Independence in what was then called the Pennsylvania State House and was later renamed Independence Hall. Historian Joseph Ellis, in 2007, described the Declaration of Independence, written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson, as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history,\"[18] and its adoption represented a declaration of war against the British Army, which was then the world's most powerful military force. Since the Declaration's July 4, 1776, adoption, its signing has been cited globally and repeatedly by various peoples of the world seeking independence and liberty. It also has been, since its adoption, the basis for annual celebration by Americans; in 1938, this celebration of the Declaration was formalized as Independence Day, one of only ten designated U.S. federal holidays.\n\n\nAfter George Washington's defeat at the Battle of Brandywine in Chadds Ford Township, on September 11, 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless and the city prepared for what was perceived to be an inevitable British attack. Because bells could easily be recast into munitions, the Liberty Bell, then known as the Pennsylvania State Bell, and bells from two Philadelphia churches, Christ Church and St. Peter's Church, were hastily taken down and transported by heavily guarded wagon train out of the city. The Liberty Bell was taken to Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, which is present-day Allentown, where it was hidden under the church's floor boards for nine months from September 1777 until the British Army's departure from Philadelphia in June 1778.[57] Two Revolutionary War battles, the Siege of Fort Mifflin, fought between September 26 and November 16, 1777, and the Battle of Germantown, fought on October 4, 1777, took place within Philadelphia's city limits.\n\n\nIn Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation on November 15, 1777, and the city later served as the meeting place for the Constitutional Convention, which ratified the Constitution in Independence Hall in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787.\n\n\nPhiladelphia served as capital of the United States for much of the colonial and early post-colonial periods, including for a decade, from 1790 to 1800, while Washington, D.C., was being constructed and prepared to serve as the new national capital.[58] In 1793, the largest yellow fever epidemic in U.S. history killed approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people in Philadelphia, or about ten percent of the city's population at the time.[59][60] The capital of the United States was moved to Washington, D.C. in 1800 upon completion of the White House and U.S. Capitol buildings.\n\n\nThe state capital was moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster in 1799, then ultimately to Harrisburg in 1812 Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until the late 18th century. It also was the nation's financial and cultural center until ultimately being eclipsed in total population by New York City in 1790. In 1816, the city's free Black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent Black denomination in the country, and the first Black Episcopal Church. The free Black community also established many schools for its children with the help of Quakers. Large-scale construction projects for new roads, canals, and railroads made Philadelphia the first major industrial city in the United States.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)Loan of the City of Philadelphia, issued March 7, 1866\n![](image)Opening day ceremonies at the Centennial Exposition at Memorial Hall in Fairmount Park in 1876, the first world fair held in the U.S. on the centennial anniversary of the nation's founding\nThroughout the 19th century, Philadelphia hosted a variety of industries and businesses; the largest was the textile industry. Major corporations in the 19th and early 20th centuries included the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad.[61] Established in 1870, the Philadelphia Conveyancers' Association was chartered by the state in 1871. Along with the U.S. Centennial in 1876, the city's industry was celebrated in the Centennial Exposition, the first official World's fair in the U.S.\n\n\nImmigrants, mostly from Ireland and Germany, settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. These immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street and later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic nativist riots erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the Act of Consolidation of 1854, which extended the city limits from the 2 square miles (5.2 km2) of Center City to the roughly 134 square miles (350 km2) of Philadelphia County.[62][63]\nIn the latter half of the 19th century and leading into the 20th century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy, and African Americans from the southern U.S. settled in the city.[64]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was represented by the Washington Grays in the American Civil War. The African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559 between 1880 and 1930.[65][66] Black newcomers in the 20th century were part of the Great Migration out of the rural south and into northern and midwestern industrial cities.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chestnut Street in Center City at night in February 2016\nBy the 20th century, Philadelphia had an entrenched Republican political machine and a complacent population.[67] In 1910, a general strike shut down the entire city.[68]\n\n\nIn 1917, following outrage over the election-year murder of a Philadelphia police officer, led to the shrinking of the City Council from two houses to just one.[69] In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot during Red Summer in post-World War I unrest as recent immigrants competed with Blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of Prohibition laws, organized crime, mob violence, and corrupt police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of Brig. Gen. Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as the city's director of public safety, but political pressure still prevented long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.[70]\n\n\nIn 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population.[71] In 1950, the population peaked at more than two million residents, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry that led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization enticed many affluent residents to depart the city for its outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The resulting reduction in Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government caused the city to struggle through a long period of adjustment, and it approached bankruptcy by the late 1980s.[72][73]\n\n\nIn 1985, the MOVE Bombing of the Cobbs Creek neighborhood by city helicopters occurred, killing 11 and destroying 61 homes.[74]\n\n\nRevitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century with much of the development occurring in the Center City and University City neighborhoods. But this expanded a shortage of affordable housing in the city. After many manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to market itself more aggressively as a tourist destination. Contemporary glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the 1980s. Historic areas such as Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s, making both areas among the most desirable Center City neighborhoods. Immigrants from around the world began to enter the U.S. through Philadelphia as their gateway, leading to a reversal of the city's population decline between 1950 and 2000, during which it lost about 25 percent of its residents.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia eventually began experiencing a growth in its population in 2007, which continued with gradual yearly increases through the present.[77][78]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's geographic center is about 40° 0′ 34″ north latitude and 75° 8′ 0″ west longitude. The 40th parallel north passes through neighborhoods in Northeast Philadelphia, North Philadelphia, and West Philadelphia including Fairmount Park. The city encompasses 142.71 square miles (369.62 km2), of which 134.18 square miles (347.52 km2) is land and 8.53 square miles (22.09 km2), or 6%, is water.[79] Natural bodies of water include the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, lakes in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park, and Cobbs, Wissahickon, and Pennypack creeks. The largest artificial body of water is East Park Reservoir in Fairmount Park.\n\n\nThe lowest point is sea level and the highest point is in Chestnut Hill about 446 feet (136 m) above sea level on Summit Street near the intersection of Germantown Avenue and Bethlehem Pike at: 40.07815 N, 75.20747 W.[80][81] Philadelphia is located on the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line that separates the Atlantic Plain from the Piedmont.[82] The Schuylkill River's rapids at East Falls were inundated by completion of the dam at Fairmount Water Works.[83]\n\n\nThe city is the seat of its own county. The city is bordered by six adjacent counties: Montgomery to the northwest; Bucks to the north and northeast; Burlington County, New Jersey to the east; Camden County, New Jersey to the southeast; Gloucester County, New Jersey to the south; and Delaware County to the southwest.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)\nThe skyline of Philadelphia seen from the northwest on the Spring Garden Street Bridge over the Schuylkill River in April 2018 (annotated version)\n\n![](image)\nPhiladelphia's skyline at twilight from the southwest on the South Street Bridge with the Schuylkill River on the left in July 2016 (annotated version)\n\n#### City planning[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia neighborhoods\n\nPhiladelphia was created in the 17th century following the plan by William Penn's surveyor Thomas Holme. Center City is structured with long, straight streets running nearly due east–west and north–south, forming a grid pattern between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers that is aligned with their courses. The original city plan was designed to allow for easy travel and to keep residences separated by open space that would help prevent the spread of fire.[84] In keeping with the idea of a \"Greene Countrie Towne\", and inspired by the many types of trees that grew in the region, Penn named many of the east–west streets for local trees.[85] Penn planned the creation of five public parks in the city which were renamed in 1824.[84] Centre Square was renamed Penn Square;[86] Northeast Square was renamed Franklin Square; Southeast Square was renamed Washington Square; Southwest Square was renamed Rittenhouse Square; and Northwest Square was renamed Logan Circle/Square.[87] Center City had an estimated 183,240 residents as of 2015[update], making it the second-most populated downtown area in the United States after Midtown Manhattan in New York City.[88]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's neighborhoods are divided into six large sections that surround Center City: North Philadelphia, Northeast Philadelphia, South Philadelphia, Southwest Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, and Northwest Philadelphia. The city's geographic boundaries have been largely unchanged since these neighborhoods were consolidated in 1854. However, each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that constituted Pennsylvania County before their inclusion within the city.[89]\n\n\nThe City Planning Commission, tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the *Philadelphia2035* physical development plan.[90][91] Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007 to 2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors John F. Street and Michael Nutter. The zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning maps to facilitate future community development, as the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs will be added by 2035.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, the PHA is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, serving about 81,000 people with affordable housing, while employing 1,400 on a budget of $371 million.[92] The Philadelphia Parking Authority is responsible for ensuring adequate parking for city residents, businesses, and visitors.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia City Hall at night in December 2012\n![](image)Two of Center City Philadelphia's most prominent high-rise buildings, One Liberty Place, built between 1985 and 1987 (in background), and Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901 (in foreground)\nPhiladelphia's architectural history dates back to colonial times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest structures were constructed with logs, but brick structures were common by 1700. During the 18th century, the cityscape was dominated by Georgian architecture, including Independence Hall and Christ Church.\n\n\nIn the first decades of the 19th century, Federal and Greek Revival architecture were the dominant styles produced by Philadelphia architects such as Benjamin Latrobe, William Strickland, John Haviland, John Notman, Thomas Walter, and Samuel Sloan.[94] Frank Furness is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century. His contemporaries included John McArthur Jr., Addison Hutton, Wilson Eyre, the Wilson Brothers, and Horace Trumbauer. In 1871, construction began on the Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall. The Philadelphia Historical Commission was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places, adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit.[95]\n\n\nIn 1932, Philadelphia became home to the first modern International Style skyscraper in the United States, the PSFS Building, designed by George Howe and William Lescaze. The 548 ft (167 m) City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when One Liberty Place was completed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the late 1980s. In 2007, the Comcast Center surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest building. The Comcast Technology Center was completed in 2018, reaching a height of 1,121 ft (342 m), as the tallest building in the United States outside of Manhattan and Chicago.[96]\n\n\nFor much of Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the row house. The row house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United States were known as \"Philadelphia rows\".[94] A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Federal-style continuous blocks in Old City and Society Hill to Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia to twin row houses in West Philadelphia. While newer homes have been built recently, much of the housing dates to the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, which has created problems such as urban decay and vacant lots. Some neighborhoods, including Northern Liberties and Society Hill, have been rehabilitated through gentrification.[97][98]\n\n\n\n* ![Elfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]](image)\n\nElfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]\n* ![Carpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style](image)\n\nCarpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style\n* ![The Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture](image)\n\nThe Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture\n* ![Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street](image)\n\nSecond Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street\n* ![The Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933](image)\n\nThe Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933\n\n\n#### Parks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Drinking fountains in Philadelphia, Fairmount Park, and List of parks in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's Fairmount Park on the Schuylkill River, the city's largest and one of the world's largest public parks\nAs of 2014[update], the city's total park space, including municipal, state, and federal parks in the city, amounts to 11,211 acres (17.5 sq mi).[29] Philadelphia's largest park is Fairmount Park, which includes the Philadelphia Zoo and encompasses 2,052 acres (3.2 sq mi) of the total parkland. Fairmount Park's adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park contains 2,042 acres (3.2 sq mi).[100] Fairmount Park, when combined with Wissahickon Valley Park, is one of the largest contiguous urban park areas in the U.S.[29] The two parks, along with the Colonial Revival, Georgian and Federal-style mansions in them, have been listed as one entity on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972.[101]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3.1\n\n\n\n41\n\n26\n | 2.8\n\n\n\n44\n\n28\n | 4\n\n\n\n53\n\n34\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n65\n\n44\n | 3.3\n\n\n\n74\n\n54\n | 4\n\n\n\n83\n\n64\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n88\n\n70\n | 4.3\n\n\n\n86\n\n68\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n79\n\n61\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n67\n\n49\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n56\n\n39\n | 4\n\n\n\n46\n\n31\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 80\n\n\n\n5\n\n−3\n | 70\n\n\n\n7\n\n−3\n | 101\n\n\n\n12\n\n1\n | 88\n\n\n\n18\n\n7\n | 85\n\n\n\n24\n\n12\n | 103\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 111\n\n\n\n31\n\n21\n | 109\n\n\n\n30\n\n20\n | 112\n\n\n\n26\n\n16\n | 88\n\n\n\n20\n\n10\n | 74\n\n\n\n13\n\n4\n | 101\n\n\n\n8\n\n0\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification, Philadelphia falls under the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen *Cfa*),[102] whereas according to the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (*Do*) limited to the north by the continental climate (*Dc*).[103] Summers are typically hot and muggy, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is moderately cold. The plant life hardiness zones are 7a and 7b, representing an average annual extreme minimum temperature between 0 and 10 °F (−18 and −12 °C).[104]\n\n\nSnowfall is highly variable, with some winters experiencing only light snow, while others include major snowstorms. The normal seasonal snowfall averages 22.4 in (57 cm), with rare snowfalls in November or April, and rarely any sustained snow cover.[105] Seasonal snowfall accumulation has ranged from trace amounts in 1972–73 to 78.7 inches (200 cm) in the winter of 2009–10.[105][b] The city's heaviest single-storm snowfall was 30.7 in (78 cm) which occurred in January 1996.[106]\n\n\nPrecipitation is generally spread throughout the year, with eight to eleven wet days per month,[107] at an average annual rate of 44.1 inches (1,120 mm), but historically ranging from 29.31 in (744 mm) in 1922 to 64.33 in (1,634 mm) in 2011.[105] The most rain recorded in one day occurred on July 28, 2013, when 8.02 in (204 mm) fell at Philadelphia International Airport.[105] Philadelphia has a moderately sunny climate with an average of 2,498 hours of sunshine annually, and a percentage of sunshine ranging from 47% in December to 61% in June, July, and August.[108]\n\n\nThe January daily average temperature is 33.7 °F (0.9 °C), though the temperature frequently rises to 50 °F (10 °C) during thaws. July averages 78.7 °F (25.9 °C), although heat waves accompanied by high humidity and heat indices are frequent, with highs reaching or exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) on 30 days of the year. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 6 thru April 2,[105] allowing a growing season of 217 days. Early fall and late winter are generally dry with February having the lowest average precipitation at 2.75 inches (70 mm). The dewpoint in the summer averages between 59.1 and 64.5 °F (15 and 18 °C).[105]\n\n\nThe highest recorded temperature was 106 °F (41 °C) on August 7, 1918, but temperatures at or above 100 °F (38 °C) are not common, with the last occurrence of such a temperature was July 21, 2019.[109] The lowest officially recorded temperature was −11 °F (−24 °C) on February 9, 1934.[109] Temperatures at or below 0 °F (−18 °C) are rare with the last such occurrence being January 19, 1994.[105] The record low maximum is 5 °F (−15 °C) on February 10, 1899, and December 30, 1880, while the record high minimum is 83 °F (28 °C) on July 23, 2011, and July 24, 2010.[110]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Philadelphia (Philadelphia Airport), 1991–2020 normals,[c] extremes 1872–present[d]\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high °F (°C)\n | 74(23)\n | 79(26)\n | 87(31)\n | 95(35)\n | 97(36)\n | 102(39)\n | 104(40)\n | 106(41)\n | 102(39)\n | 96(36)\n | 84(29)\n | 73(23)\n | 106(41)\n |\n| Mean maximum °F (°C)\n | 63.3(17.4)\n | 63.5(17.5)\n | 73.8(23.2)\n | 84.3(29.1)\n | 90.2(32.3)\n | 94.8(34.9)\n | 97.1(36.2)\n | 94.8(34.9)\n | 90.6(32.6)\n | 82.6(28.1)\n | 72.4(22.4)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 98.1(36.7)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum °F (°C)\n | 41.3(5.2)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 52.8(11.6)\n | 64.7(18.2)\n | 74.4(23.6)\n | 83.2(28.4)\n | 87.8(31.0)\n | 85.8(29.9)\n | 78.9(26.1)\n | 67.2(19.6)\n | 55.9(13.3)\n | 46.0(7.8)\n | 65.2(18.4)\n |\n| Daily mean °F (°C)\n | 33.7(0.9)\n | 35.9(2.2)\n | 43.6(6.4)\n | 54.5(12.5)\n | 64.3(17.9)\n | 73.5(23.1)\n | 78.7(25.9)\n | 76.8(24.9)\n | 69.9(21.1)\n | 58.2(14.6)\n | 47.4(8.6)\n | 38.6(3.7)\n | 56.3(13.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum °F (°C)\n | 26.0(−3.3)\n | 27.5(−2.5)\n | 34.3(1.3)\n | 44.3(6.8)\n | 54.2(12.3)\n | 63.9(17.7)\n | 69.6(20.9)\n | 67.9(19.9)\n | 60.9(16.1)\n | 49.2(9.6)\n | 38.8(3.8)\n | 31.2(−0.4)\n | 47.3(8.5)\n |\n| Mean minimum °F (°C)\n | 10.7(−11.8)\n | 13.7(−10.2)\n | 20.8(−6.2)\n | 33.0(0.6)\n | 43.1(6.2)\n | 53.2(11.8)\n | 62.2(16.8)\n | 60.3(15.7)\n | 49.5(9.7)\n | 37.1(2.8)\n | 26.4(−3.1)\n | 19.0(−7.2)\n | 8.6(−13.0)\n |\n| Record low °F (°C)\n | −7(−22)\n | −11(−24)\n | 5(−15)\n | 14(−10)\n | 28(−2)\n | 44(7)\n | 51(11)\n | 44(7)\n | 35(2)\n | 25(−4)\n | 8(−13)\n | −5(−21)\n | −11(−24)\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 3.13(80)\n | 2.75(70)\n | 3.96(101)\n | 3.47(88)\n | 3.34(85)\n | 4.04(103)\n | 4.38(111)\n | 4.29(109)\n | 4.40(112)\n | 3.47(88)\n | 2.91(74)\n | 3.97(101)\n | 44.11(1,120)\n |\n| Average snowfall inches (cm)\n | 7.1(18)\n | 8.4(21)\n | 3.6(9.1)\n | 0.3(0.76)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.2(0.51)\n | 3.5(8.9)\n | 23.1(59)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) | 11.0\n | 9.7\n | 10.9\n | 10.9\n | 11.0\n | 10.3\n | 10.1\n | 8.9\n | 9.3\n | 9.1\n | 8.6\n | 11.0\n | 120.8\n |\n| Average snowy days (≥ 0.1 in) | 4.1\n | 3.8\n | 2.0\n | 0.2\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.1\n | 1.8\n | 12.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 66.2\n | 63.6\n | 61.7\n | 60.4\n | 65.4\n | 67.8\n | 69.6\n | 70.4\n | 71.6\n | 70.8\n | 68.4\n | 67.7\n | 67.0\n |\n| Average dew point °F (°C)\n | 19.8(−6.8)\n | 21.0(−6.1)\n | 28.6(−1.9)\n | 37.0(2.8)\n | 49.5(9.7)\n | 59.2(15.1)\n | 64.6(18.1)\n | 63.7(17.6)\n | 57.2(14.0)\n | 45.7(7.6)\n | 35.6(2.0)\n | 25.5(−3.6)\n | 42.3(5.7)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 155.7\n | 154.7\n | 202.8\n | 217.0\n | 245.1\n | 271.2\n | 275.6\n | 260.1\n | 219.3\n | 204.5\n | 154.7\n | 137.7\n | 2,498.4\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 52\n | 52\n | 55\n | 55\n | 55\n | 61\n | 61\n | 61\n | 59\n | 59\n | 52\n | 47\n | 56\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 8\n | 9\n | 9\n | 8\n | 6\n | 4\n | 2\n | 2\n | 5\n |\n| Source 1: NOAA (relative humidity, dew point and sun 1961–1990)[113][108][105] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV index)[114] |\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Philadelphia\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Average sea temperature °F (°C)\n | 41.8(5.5)\n | 39.9(4.4)\n | 41.2(5.1)\n | 46.7(8.2)\n | 53.9(12.2)\n | 66.3(19.0)\n | 74.0(23.3)\n | 75.9(24.4)\n | 71.4(21.9)\n | 64.2(17.9)\n | 55.1(12.8)\n | 47.7(8.8)\n | 56.5(13.6)\n |\n| Mean daily daylight hours\n | 10.0\n | 11.0\n | 12.0\n | 13.0\n | 14.0\n | 15.0\n | 15.0\n | 14.0\n | 12.0\n | 11.0\n | 10.0\n | 9.0\n | 12.2\n |\n| Source: Weather Atlas [114] |\n\n\n### Time Series[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Many smaller CSAs were also ranked higher for ozone including Sacramento (8th), Las Vegas (10th), Denver (11th), El Paso (16th), and Salt Lake City (20th); however, only two of those same ten CSAs—San Jose and Los Angeles—were ranked higher than Philadelphia for both year-round and short-term particle pollution.[117]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Chinese in Philadelphia; History of Irish Americans in Philadelphia; History of Italian Americans in Philadelphia; Koreans in Philadelphia; Little Saigon, Philadelphia; History of Jews in Philadelphia; LGBT culture in Philadelphia; and Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1683 | 600 | —     |\n| 1731 | 12,000 | +1900.0% |\n| 1790 | 28,522 | +137.7% |\n| 1800 | 41,220 | +44.5% |\n| 1810 | 53,722 | +30.3% |\n| 1820 | 63,802 | +18.8% |\n| 1830 | 80,462 | +26.1% |\n| 1840 | 93,665 | +16.4% |\n| 1850 | 121,376 | +29.6% |\n| 1860 | 565,529 | +365.9% |\n| 1870 | 674,022 | +19.2% |\n| 1880 | 847,170 | +25.7% |\n| 1890 | 1,046,964 | +23.6% |\n| 1900 | 1,293,697 | +23.6% |\n| 1910 | 1,549,008 | +19.7% |\n| 1920 | 1,823,779 | +17.7% |\n| 1930 | 1,950,961 | +7.0% |\n| 1940 | 1,931,334 | −1.0% |\n| 1950 | 2,071,605 | +7.3% |\n| 1960 | 2,002,512 | −3.3% |\n| 1970 | 1,948,609 | −2.7% |\n| 1980 | 1,688,210 | −13.4% |\n| 1990 | 1,585,577 | −6.1% |\n| 2000 | 1,517,550 | −4.3% |\n| 2010 | 1,526,006 | +0.6% |\n| 2020 | 1,603,797 | +5.1% |\n| 2022 | 1,567,258 | −2.3% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[118]2010–2020[12]Source: U.S. Decennial Census[119] |\n\n\nAccording to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau's tabulation, there were 1,603,797 people residing in Philadelphia, representing a 1.2% increase from the 2019 census estimate.[78] The racial composition of the city was 39.3% Black alone (42.0% Black alone or in combination), 36.3% White alone (41.9% White alone or in combination), 8.7% Asian alone, 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 8.7% some other race, and 6.9% multiracial. 14.9% of residents were Hispanic or Latino. 34.8% had a bachelor's degree or higher. 23.9% spoke a language other than English at home, the most common of which was Spanish (10.8%). 15.0% of the populations foreign born, roughly half of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens. 3.7% of the population are veterans. The median household income was $52,889 and 22.8% of the population lived in poverty. 49.5% of the population drove alone to work, while 23.2% used public transit, 8.2% carpooled, 7.9% walked, and 7.0% worked from home. The average commute is 31 minutes.[120]\n\n\nAfter the 1950 census, when a record high of 2,071,605 was recorded, the city's population began a long decline.

According to The Pew Charitable Trusts, the city's foreign-born population increased by 69% between 2000 and 2016 to constitute nearly 20% of Philadelphia's workforce,[125] and it doubled between 1990 and 2017 to constitute 13.8% of the city's total population, with the top five countries of origin being China by a significant margin followed by the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, India, and Vietnam.[126]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 countries of origin for foreign-born Philadelphians, 2017[127]\n| Country | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) China | 22,140\n |\n| ![](image) Dominican Republic | 13,792\n |\n| ![](image) Jamaica | 13,500\n |\n| ![](image) India | 11,382\n |\n| ![](image) Vietnam | 10,132\n |\n| ![](image) Haiti | 9,186\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 7,823\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 6,898\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 5,258\n |\n| ![](image) South Korea/![](image) North Korea | 4,385\n |\n\n\nIrish, Italian, German, Polish, English, Russian, Ukrainian, and French ancestries constitute the largest European ethnic groups in the city.[128] Philadelphia has the second-largest Irish and Italian populations in the United States after New York City. South Philadelphia remains one of the largest Italian neighborhoods in the country and is home to the Italian Market.\n\n\nThe Pennsport neighborhood and Gray's Ferry section of South Philadelphia, home to many Mummer clubs, are well known as Irish neighborhoods. The Kensington, Port Richmond, and Fishtown neighborhoods have historically been heavily Irish and Polish. Port Richmond is a center for the Polish-American community in Philadelphia, and it remains a common destination for Polish immigrants. Northeast Philadelphia, although known for its Irish and Irish-American population, is home to a Jewish and Russian population. Mount Airy in Northwest Philadelphia also contains a Jewish community. Nearby Chestnut Hill is historically known as an Anglo-Saxon Protestant community.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Black American population is the fourth-largest in the country after New York City, Chicago, and Houston. West Philadelphia and North Philadelphia are largely African-American neighborhoods, but many are leaving those areas in favor of the Northeast and Southwest sections of Philadelphia. A higher proportion of African-American Muslims reside in Philadelphia than most other major U.S. cities. West Philadelphia and Southwest Philadelphia are home to various Afro-Caribbean and African immigrant communities.[129]\n\n\nThe Puerto Rican population in Philadelphia is the second-largest on the U.S. mainland after New York City, and the second-fastest growing after Orlando.[130] Eastern North Philadelphia, particularly Fairhill and surrounding areas to the north and east, has one of the highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans outside Puerto Rico, with many large swaths of blocks being close to 100% Puerto Rican.[131][132] Puerto Rican and Dominican populations reside in North Philadelphia and the Northeast, and Mexican and Central American populations exist in South Philadelphia.[133] South American migrants were being transported by bus from Texas to Philadelphia beginning in 2022.[134]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Asian American population includes those of Chinese, Indians, Vietnamese, South Koreans, and Filipinos. Over 35,000 Chinese Americans lived in the city in 2015,[135] including a Fuzhounese population. Center City hosts a Chinatown that is served by Chinatown bus lines with service to/from Chinatown, Manhattan.[136] A Korean community initially settled in the North Philadelphia neighborhood of Olney; however, the primary Koreatown has subsequently shifted further north, straddling the city's border with adjacent Cheltenham in Montgomery County and Cherry Hill in South Jersey. South Philadelphia is home to Vietnamese-Americans in Little Saigon, as well as Cambodian Americans, Thai Americans, and Chinese communities.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Gay village near Washington Square is home to a concentration of gay and lesbian-friendly businesses, restaurants, and bars.[137][138]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Philadelphia\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 68% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christian.[139] Approximately 41% of Christians in the city and area professed attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, while 26% professed Catholic beliefs.\n\n\nThe Protestant Christian community in Philadelphia is dominated by mainline Protestant denominations including the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church in the United States, Presbyterian Church (USA) and American Baptist Churches USA. One of the most prominent mainline Protestant jurisdictions is the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in Philadelphia. Historically, the city has strong connections to the Quakers, Unitarian Universalism, and the Ethical Culture movement, all of which continue to be represented in the city. The Quaker Friends General Conference is based in Philadelphia. Evangelical Protestants making up less than 15% of the population were also prevalent. Evangelical Protestant bodies included the Anglican Church in North America, Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, Presbyterian Church in America, and National Baptist Convention of America.\nThe Catholic community is primarily served by the Latin Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia, and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Eparchy of the United States of America and Canada, though some independent Catholic churches exist throughout Philadelphia and its suburbs. The Latin Church-based jurisdiction is headquartered in the city, and its see is the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. The Ukrainian Catholic jurisdiction is also headquartered in Philadelphia, and is seated at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.\n\n\nLess than 1% of Philadelphia's Christians were Mormons. The remainder of the Christian demographic is spread among smaller Protestant denominations and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox among others. The Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania (Orthodox Church in America) and Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (Ecumenical Patriarchate) divide the Eastern Orthodox in Philadelphia. The Russian Orthodox St. Andrew's Cathedral is in the city.\nThe same study says that other religions collectively compose about 8% of the population, including Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, and Sikhism.[140] Philadelphia has the fifth-largest Muslim population among U.S. cities.[141] The remaining 24% claimed no religious affiliation.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metropolitan area's Jewish population was estimated at 206,000 in 2001, which was the sixth-largest in the U.S. at that time.[142] Jewish traders were operating in southeastern Pennsylvania long before William Penn. Furthermore, Jews in Philadelphia took a prominent part in the War of Independence. Although the majority of the early Jewish residents were of Portuguese or Spanish descent, some among them had emigrated from Germany and Poland. About the beginning of the 19th century, a number of Jews from the latter countries, finding the services of the Congregation Mickvé Israel unfamiliar to them, resolved to form a new congregation which would use the ritual to which they had been accustomed.\n\n\nAfrican diasporic religions are practiced in some Latino and Hispanic and Caribbean communities in North and West Philadelphia.[143][144]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], 79.12% (1,112,441) of Philadelphia residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 9.72% (136,688) spoke Spanish, 1.64% (23,075) Chinese, 0.89% (12,499) Vietnamese, 0.77% (10,885) Russian, 0.66% (9,240) French, 0.61% (8,639) other Asian languages, 0.58% (8,217) African languages, 0.56% (7,933) Cambodian (Mon-Khmer), and Italian was spoken as a main language by 0.55% (7,773) of the population over the age of five. In total, 20.88% (293,544) of Philadelphia's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[145]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Philadelphia\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Top publicly traded companiesheadquartered in Philadelphia** |\n| **Corporation** | **2019****rank** | **Revenue****(billions)** |\n| Comcast | 32 | 94.5\n |\n| Aramark | 198 | 15.8\n |\n| FMC | 556 | 4.7\n |\n| Urban Outfitters | 634 | 4.0\n |\n| Carpenter Technology | 940 | 2.2\n |\n| **Source:** *Fortune*[146] |\n\n\nPhiladelphia's close geographical and transportation connections to other large metropolitan economies along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States have been cited as offering a significant competitive advantage for business creation and entrepreneurship.[147] The city is the center of economic activity in both Pennsylvania and the four-state Delaware Valley metropolitan region. Five Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the city. As of 2021[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of US$479 billion,[148] an increase from the $445 billion calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis for 2017,[149] representing the ninth-largest U.S. metropolitan economy.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's economic sectors include financial services, health care, biotechnology, information technology, trade and transportation, manufacturing, oil refining, food processing, and tourism. Metropolitan Philadelphia is one of the top five American venture capital hubs, credited to its proximity to New York City's financial and tech and biotechnology ecosystems.[22] Financial activities account for the largest economic sector of the metropolitan area, which is also one of the largest health education and research centers in the United States. The city's two largest employers are the federal and city governments. Philadelphia's largest private employer is the University of Pennsylvania, followed by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.[150] A study commissioned by the city's government in 2011 projected 40,000 jobs would be added to the city within 25 years, raising the number of jobs from 675,000 in 2010 to an estimated 715,000 by 2035.[151]\n\n\n\n### Corporations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies based in the Philadelphia area\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the nation's first stock exchange, at 1411 Walnut Street\n![](image)Comcast Center in Center City, headquarters of the nation's largest multinational telecommunications conglomerate and the city's second-tallest building after Comcast Technology Center[152]\nThe Philadelphia Stock Exchange, acquired by Nasdaq in 2007, is a global leader in options trading.[23] The city is also home to the headquarters of cable television and internet service provider Comcast, insurance companies Cigna, Colonial Penn, and Independence Blue Cross, food services company Aramark, chemical makers FMC Corporation and Rohm and Haas, pharmaceutical companies GlaxoSmithKline, Amicus Therapeutics, Spark Therapeutics, apparel retailers Five Below and Urban Outfitters and its subsidiary Anthropologie, automotive parts retailer Pep Boys, and stainless steel producer Carpenter Technology Corporation.

During the same time period, the enrollment in charter schools increased from 33,995 students in 2010 to 62,358 students in 2015.[150] This consistent drop in enrollment led the city to close 24 of its public schools in 2013.[163] During the 2014 school year, the city spent an average of $12,570 per pupil, below the average among comparable urban school districts.[150]\n\n\nGraduation rates among district-run schools, meanwhile, steadily increased in the ten years from 2005. In 2005, Philadelphia had a district graduation rate of 52%. This number increased to 65% in 2014, still below the national and state averages. Scores on the state's standardized test, the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA) trended upward from 2005 to 2011 but subsequently decreased. In 2005, the district-run schools scored an average of 37.4% on math and 35.5% on reading. The city's schools reached their peak scores in 2011 with 59.0% on math and 52.3% on reading.

The city's major art museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, is one of the largest art museums in the world. The long flight of steps to the Art Museum's main entrance became famous after the film *Rocky* (1976).[176]\n\n\nAreas such as South Street and Old City have a vibrant night life. The Avenue of the Arts in Center City contains many restaurants and theaters, such as the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Academy of Music, home of Opera Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Ballet.[176] The Wilma Theatre and the Philadelphia Theatre Company at the Suzanne Roberts Theatre produce a variety of new plays.[177][178] Several blocks to the east are the Lantern Theater Company at St. Stephens Episcopal Church;[179] and the Walnut Street Theatre, a National Historic Landmark stated to be the oldest and most subscribed-to theatre in the English-speaking world, founded in 1809.[180] In May 2019, the Walnut Street Theatre announced a major expansion to begin in 2020.[181] New Freedom Theatre, which is Pennsylvania's oldest African-American theatre, sits on North Broad Street.\n\n\nPhiladelphia has more public art than any other American city.[182] In 1872, the Association for Public Art (formerly the Fairmount Park Art Association) was created as the first private association in the United States dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning.[183] In 1959, lobbying by the Artists Equity Association helped create the Percent for Art ordinance, the first for a U.S. city.[184] The program, which has funded more than 200 pieces of public art, is administered by the Philadelphia Office of Arts and Culture, the city's art agency.[185] The city also has more murals than any other American city, due to the 1984 creation of the Department of Recreation's Mural Arts Program, which seeks to beautify neighborhoods and provide an outlet for graffiti artists. The program has funded more than 2,800 murals by professional, staff and volunteer artists and educated more than 20,000 youth in underserved neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia.[186]\n\n\nThe city is home to a number of art organizations including the regional art advocacy nonprofit Philadelphia Tri-State Artists Equity,[187] the Philadelphia Sketch Club, one of the country's oldest artists' clubs,[188] and The Plastic Club, started by women excluded from the Sketch Club.[189] Many Old City art galleries stay open late on the First Friday event of each month.[190] Annual events include the Philadelphia Film Festival, held annually each October, the 6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade, the nation's longest-running continuously held Thanksgiving Day parade, and the Mummers Parade, the nation's longest continuously held folk parade, which is held every New Year's Day.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Philadelphia\n\n![](image)The Curtis Institute of Music at 1726 Locust Street in Center City, one of the world's premier conservatories\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra is generally considered one of the top five orchestras in the United States.

The culture of American popular music has been influenced by significant contributions of Philadelphia area musicians and producers, in both the recording and broadcasting industries. In 1952, the teen dance party program called *Bandstand* premiered on local television, hosted by Bob Horn. The show was renamed *American Bandstand* in 1957, when it began national syndication on ABC, hosted by Dick Clark and produced in Philadelphia until 1964 when it moved to Los Angeles.[196] Promoters marketed youthful musical artists known as teen idols to appeal to the young audience. Philadelphia-born singers such as Frankie Avalon, James Darren, Eddie Fisher, Fabian Forte, and Bobby Rydell, along with South Philly-raised Chubby Checker, topped the music charts, establishing a clean-cut rock and roll image.\n\n\nPhilly soul music of the late 1960s–1970s is a highly produced version of soul music which led to later forms of popular music such as disco and urban contemporary rhythm and blues.[197] On July 13, 1985, John F. Kennedy Stadium was the American venue for the Live Aid concert.[198] The city also hosted the Live 8 concert, which attracted about 700,000 people to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway on July 2, 2005.[199]\n\n\nNotable rock and pop musicians from Philadelphia and its suburbs include Bill Haley & His Comets, Nazz, Todd Rundgren, Hall & Oates, the Hooters, Cinderella, DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Ween, Schoolly D, Pink, the Roots, Beanie Sigel, State Property, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, Meek Mill, Lil Uzi Vert, and others.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Pat's Steaks (foreground) and Geno's Steaks (background) in South Philadelphia\nThe city is known for its hoagies, stromboli, roast pork sandwich, scrapple, soft pretzels, water ice, Irish potato candy, tastykakes, and the cheesesteak sandwich which was developed by Italian immigrants.[200] The Philadelphia area has many establishments that serve cheesesteaks, including restaurants, taverns, delicatessens and pizza parlors.[201][202][203] The originator of the thinly-sliced steak sandwich in the 1930s, initially without cheese, is Pat's King of Steaks, which faces its rival Geno's Steaks, founded in 1966,[204] across the intersection of 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue in the Italian Market of South Philadelphia.[205]\n\n\nMcGillin's Olde Ale House, opened in 1860 on Drury Street in Center City, is the oldest continuously operated tavern in the city.[206] The City Tavern is a replica of a historic 18th-century building first opened in 1773, demolished in 1854 after a fire, and rebuilt in 1975 on the same site as part of Independence National Historical Park.[207] The tavern offers authentic 18th-century recipes, served in seven period dining rooms, three wine cellar rooms and an outdoor garden.[208]\n\n\nThe Reading Terminal Market is a historic food market founded in 1893 in the Reading Terminal building, a designated National Historic Landmark.

Additionally, it shares many similarities with the New York accent. Owing to over a century of linguistic data collected by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania under sociolinguist William Labov, the Philadelphia dialect has been one of the best-studied forms of American English.[211][212][f] The accent is especially found within the Irish American and Italian American working-class neighborhoods.[213] Philadelphia also has its own unique collection of neologisms and slang terms.[214]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Philadelphia 76ers, Philadelphia Flyers, Philadelphia Eagles, Philadelphia Phillies, and Philadelphia Union\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nCitizens Bank Park, home of the Phillies since 2004, and Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Eagles since 2003\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Eagles are presented with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018\n![](image)Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia, home of the two-time Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and three-time champion Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA)\n![](image)Historic Boathouse Row at night on the Schuylkill River, a symbol of the city's rich rowing history\nPhiladelphia's first professional sports team was baseball's Athletics, organized in 1860.[215] The Athletics were initially an amateur league team that turned professional in 1871, and then became a founding team of the current National League in 1876.[216] The city is one of 13 U.S. cities to have teams in all four major league sports: the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB), the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL), the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL), and the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[217] The Phillies, formed in 1883 as the Quakers and renamed in 1884,[218] are the oldest team continuously playing under the same name in the same city in the history of American professional sports.[219]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metro area is also home to the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer (MLS). The Union began playing their home games in 2010 at PPL Park, a soccer-specific stadium in Chester, Pennsylvania.[220] The stadium's name was changed to Talen Energy Stadium in 2016[221] and to Subaru Park in 2020.[222]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the second of eight American cities to have won titles in all four major leagues (MLB, NFL, NHL and NBA), and also has a title in soccer from the now-defunct North American Soccer League in the 1970s. The city's professional teams and their fans endured 25 years without a championship, from the 76ers 1983 NBA Finals win[223] until the Phillies 2008 World Series win.[224][225] The lack of championships was sometimes attributed in jest to the Curse of Billy Penn after One Liberty Place became the first building to surpass the height of the William Penn statue on top of City Hall's tower in 1987.[226] After nine years passed without another championship, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl following the 2017 season.[227] In 2004, ESPN placed Philadelphia second on its list of The Fifteen Most Tortured Sports Cities.[228][229] Fans of the Eagles and Phillies were singled out as the worst fans in the country by *GQ* magazine in 2011, which used the subtitle of \"Meanest Fans in America\" to summarize incidents of drunken behavior and a history of booing.[230][231]\n\n\nMajor professional sports teams that originated in Philadelphia but later moved to other cities include the Golden State Warriors basketball team, which played in Philadelphia from 1946 to 1962[232] and the Oakland Athletics baseball team, which was originally the Philadelphia Athletics and played in Philadelphia from 1901 to 1954.[233]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to professional, semi-professional, and elite amateur teams in cricket, rugby league (Philadelphia Fight), and rugby union. Major running events in the city include the Penn Relays (track and field), the Philadelphia Marathon, and the Broad Street Run. The Collegiate Rugby Championship is played every June at Talen Energy Stadium in Chester.[234]\n\n\nRowing has been popular in Philadelphia since the 18th century.[235] Boathouse Row is a symbol of Philadelphia's rich rowing history, and each Big Five member has its own boathouse.[236] Philadelphia hosts numerous local and collegiate rowing clubs and competitions, including the annual Dad Vail Regatta, which is the largest intercollegiate rowing event in North America with more than 100 U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities participating;[237] the annual Stotesbury Cup Regatta, which is billed as the world's oldest and largest rowing event for high school students;[238][239] and the Head of the Schuylkill Regatta.[240] The regattas are held on the Schuylkill River and organized by the Schuylkill Navy, an association of area rowing clubs that has produced numerous Olympic rowers.[241]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Spinners were a professional ultimate team in Major League Ultimate (MLU) until 2016. The Spinners were one of the original eight teams of the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) that began in 2012. They played at Franklin Field and won the inaugural AUDL championship and the final MLU championship in 2016.[242] The MLU was suspended indefinitely by its investors in December 2016.[243] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia Phoenix continue to play in the AUDL.[244]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to the Philadelphia Big 5, a group of five NCAA Division I college basketball programs. The Big 5 include La Salle, Penn, Saint Joseph's, Temple, and Villanova universities.[245] The sixth NCAA Division I school in Philadelphia is Drexel University. Villanova won the 1985,[246] 2016,[247] and 2018[248] championship of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Philadelphia will be one of the eleven US host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[249]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | League\n | Sport\n | Venue\n | Capacity\n | Founded\n | Championships\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Philadelphia Phillies | MLB | Baseball\n | Citizens Bank Park | 46,528\n | 1883\n | 1980, 2008\n |\n| Philadelphia Eagles | NFL | American football\n | Lincoln Financial Field | 69,176\n | 1933\n | 1948, 1949, 1960, 2017\n |\n| Philadelphia 76ers | NBA | Basketball\n | Wells Fargo Center | 21,600\n | 1963\n | 1966–67, 1982–83 |\n| Philadelphia Flyers | NHL | Ice hockey\n | Wells Fargo Center | 19,786\n | 1967\n | 1973–74, 1974–75 |\n| Philadelphia Union | MLS | Soccer\n | Subaru Park | 18,500\n | 2010\n | none\n |\n| Philadelphia Wings | NLL | Lacrosse\n | Wells Fargo Center | 19,786\n | 2018\n | none\n |\n\n\n## Law and government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Philadelphia City Hall\n\n![](image)Old City Hall at 5th and Chestnut Street served as Philadelphia's town hall from 1800 to 1854.\n![](image)The James A.

All county functions were assumed by the city in 1952.[252] The city has been coterminous with the county since 1854.[63]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 1952 Home Rule Charter was written by the City Charter Commission, which was created by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in an act of April 21, 1949, and a city ordinance of June 15, 1949. The existing city council received a proposed draft on February 14, 1951, and the electors approved it in an election held April 17, 1951.[253] The first elections under the new Home Rule Charter were held in November 1951, and the newly elected officials took office in January 1952.[252]\n\n\nThe city uses the strong-mayor version of the mayor–council form of government, which is led by one mayor in whom executive authority is vested. The mayor has the authority to appoint and dismiss members of all boards and commissions without the approval of the city council. Elected at-large, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms, but can run for the position again after an intervening term.[253]\n\n\n\n### Courts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District Attorney of Philadelphia, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia County is coterminous with the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas is the trial court of general jurisdiction for the city, hearing felony-level criminal cases and civil suits above the minimum jurisdictional limit of $10,000. The court also has appellate jurisdiction over rulings from the Municipal and Traffic Courts, and some administrative agencies and boards. The trial division has 70 commissioned judges elected by the voters, along with about one thousand other employees.[254] The court also has a family division with 25 judges[255] and an orphans' court with three judges.[256]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city's District Attorney is Larry Krasner, a Democrat.[257] The last Republican to hold the office is Ronald D. Castille, who left in 1991 and later served as the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court from 2008 to 2014.[258]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Municipal Court handles traffic cases, misdemeanor and felony criminal cases with maximum incarceration of five years, and civil cases involving $12,000 or less ($15,000 in real estate and school tax cases), and all landlord-tenant disputes. The municipal court has 27 judges elected by the voters.[259]\n\n\nPennsylvania's three appellate courts also have sittings in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the court of last resort in the state, regularly hears arguments in Philadelphia City Hall.[260] The Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania also sit in Philadelphia several times a year.[261][262] Judges for these courts are elected at large.[263] The state Supreme Court and Superior Court have deputy prothonotary offices in Philadelphia.[264][265]\n\n\nAdditionally, Philadelphia is home to the federal United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, both of which are housed in the James A. Byrne United States Courthouse.[266][267]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mayors of Philadelphia; Philadelphia City Council; and Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania § Politics\n\n![](image)Jim Kenney (D), the 99th and current Mayor of Philadelphia\nThe current mayor is Jim Kenney who won the election in November 2015.[268] Kenney's predecessor was Michael Nutter who had served two terms from 2009 to January 2016.[269] Kenney is a member of the Democratic Party as all Philadelphia mayors have been since 1952. Philadelphia City Council is the legislative branch which consists of ten council members representing individual districts and seven members elected at-large, all of whom are elected to four-year terms.[270] Democrats are currently the majority and hold 14 seats including nine of the ten districts and five at-large seats. Republicans hold two seats: one at-large seat and the Northeast-based Tenth District. The Working Families Party holds one at-large seat. The current council president is Darrell L. Clarke.[271]\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were 1,102,620 registered voters in Philadelphia.[272] Registered voters constitute 70.3% of the total population.[g]\n\n\n\n* Democratic: 853,140 (77.4%)\n* Republican: 125,530 (11.4%)\n* Other parties and unaffiliated: 123,950 (11.2%)[272]\n\n\n\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania[273]\n| Year\n | Republican | Democratic | Third party |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No.  | % | No.  | % | No.  | %\n |\n| **2020** | 132,870\n | 17.86%\n | 604,175\n | **81.21%** | 6,921\n | 0.93%\n |\n| **2016** | 108,748\n | 15.32%\n | 584,025\n | **82.30%** | 16,845\n | 2.37%\n |\n| **2012** | 96,467\n | 13.97%\n | 588,806\n | **85.24%** | 5,503\n | 0.80%\n |\n| **2008** | 117,221\n | 16.33%\n | 595,980\n | **83.00%** | 4,824\n | 0.67%\n |\n| **2004** | 130,099\n | 19.30%\n | 542,205\n | **80.44%** | 1,765\n | 0.26%\n |\n| **2000** | 100,959\n | 17.99%\n | 449,182\n | **80.04%** | 11,039\n | 1.97%\n |\n| **1996** | 85,345\n | 16.00%\n | 412,988\n | **77.44%** | 34,944\n | 6.55%\n |\n| **1992** | 133,328\n | 20.90%\n | 434,904\n | **68.16%** | 69,826\n | 10.94%\n |\n| **1988** | 219,053\n | 32.45%\n | 449,566\n | **66.60%** | 6,358\n | 0.94%\n |\n| **1984** | 267,178\n | 34.60%\n | 501,369\n | **64.94%** | 3,555\n | 0.46%\n |\n| **1980** | 244,108\n | 33.99%\n | 421,253\n | **58.66%** | 52,739\n | 7.34%\n |\n| **1976** | 239,000\n | 32.03%\n | 494,579\n | **66.28%** | 12,618\n | 1.69%\n |\n| **1972** | 344,096\n | 43.89%\n | 431,736\n | **55.07%** | 8,138\n | 1.04%\n |\n| **1968** | 254,153\n | 29.90%\n | 525,768\n | **61.85%** | 70,196\n | 8.26%\n |\n| **1964** | 239,733\n | 26.24%\n | 670,645\n | **73.42%** | 3,094\n | 0.34%\n |\n| **1960** | 291,000\n | 31.79%\n | 622,544\n | **68.02%** | 1,733\n | 0.19%\n |\n| **1956** | 383,414\n | 42.97%\n | 507,289\n | **56.85%** | 1,618\n | 0.18%\n |\n| **1952** | 396,874\n | 41.40%\n | 557,352\n | **58.15%** | 4,321\n | 0.45%\n |\n| **1948** | 425,962\n | 48.12%\n | 432,699\n | **48.88%** | 26,636\n | 3.01%\n |\n| **1944** | 346,380\n | 40.96%\n | 496,367\n | **58.70%** | 2,883\n | 0.34%\n |\n| **1940** | 354,878\n | 39.81%\n | 532,149\n | **59.69%** | 4,459\n | 0.50%\n |\n| **1936** | 329,881\n | 36.94%\n | 539,757\n | **60.45%** | 23,310\n | 2.61%\n |\n| **1932** | 331,092\n | **54.54%** | 260,276\n | 42.88%\n | 15,651\n | 2.58%\n |\n| **1928** | 420,320\n | **59.99%** | 276,573\n | 39.48%\n | 3,703\n | 0.53%\n |\n| **1924** | 347,457\n | **77.73%** | 54,213\n | 12.13%\n | 45,352\n | 10.15%\n |\n| **1920** | 307,826\n | **73.43%** | 90,151\n | 21.50%\n | 21,235\n | 5.07%\n |\n| **1916** | 194,163\n | **66.81%** | 90,800\n | 31.25%\n | 5,638\n | 1.94%\n |\n| **1912** | 91,944\n | **36.53%** | 66,308\n | 26.35%\n | 93,438\n | 37.12%\n |\n| **1908** | 185,263\n | **69.09%** | 75,310\n | 28.09%\n | 7,568\n | 2.82%\n |\n| **1904** | 227,709\n | **80.85%** | 48,784\n | 17.32%\n | 5,161\n | 1.83%\n |\n| **1900** | 173,657\n | **73.93%** | 58,179\n | 24.77%\n | 3,053\n | 1.30%\n |\n| **1896** | 176,462\n | **72.06%** | 63,323\n | 25.86%\n | 5,102\n | 2.08%\n |\n| **1892** | 116,685\n | **57.45%** | 84,470\n | 41.59%\n | 1,947\n | 0.96%\n |\n| **1888** | 111,358\n | **54.20%** | 92,786\n | 45.16%\n | 1,300\n | 0.63%\n |\n| **1884** | 101,288\n | **58.00%** | 71,288\n | 40.82%\n | 2,057\n | 1.18%\n |\n| **1880** | 97,220\n | **55.92%** | 76,330\n | 43.91%\n | 294\n | 0.17%\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia had historically been a bastion of the Republican Party from the American Civil War until the mid-1930s.[274][275] The city hosted the first Republican National Convention in 1856.[276] Democratic registrations increased after the Great Depression; however, the city was not carried by Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt in his landslide victory of 1932 as Pennsylvania was one of only six states won by Republican Herbert Hoover. Voter turnout surged from 600,000 in 1932 to nearly 900,000 in 1936 and Roosevelt carried Philadelphia with over 60% of the vote. The city has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1936. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama drew 83% of the city's vote. Obama's win was even greater in 2012, capturing 85% of the vote. In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton won 82% of the vote.[273]\n\n\nAs a result of the previously declining population in the city and state,[277] Philadelphia has only three congressional districts of the 18 districts in Pennsylvania, based on the 2010 census apportionment:[278] the 2nd district, represented by Brendan Boyle; the 3rd, represented by Dwight Evans; and the 5th, represented by Mary Gay Scanlon.[279] All three representatives are Democrats though Republicans still have some support in the city, primarily in the Northeast.[280] Sam Katz ran competitive mayoral races as the Republican nominee in 1999 and 2003, losing to Democrat John Street both times.[281][282]\n\n\nPennsylvania's longest-serving Senator, Arlen Specter,[283] was an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania who opened his first law practice in Philadelphia.[284] Specter served as a Republican from 1981 and as a Democrat from 2009, losing that party's primary in 2010 and leaving office in January 2011.[285] He had also been assistant counsel on the Warren Commission in 1964 and the city's district attorney from 1966 to 1974.[284]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has hosted various national conventions, including in 1848 (Whig), 1856 (Republican), 1872 (Republican), 1900 (Republican), 1936 (Democratic), 1940 (Republican), 1948 (Republican), 1948 (Progressive), 2000 (Republican), and 2016 (Democratic).[286] Philadelphia has been home to one vice president, George M. Dallas,[287] and one general of the American Civil War, George B. McClellan, who won his party's nomination for president but lost in the general election to Abraham Lincoln in 1864.[288] In May 2019, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden chose Philadelphia to be his 2020 U.S. presidential campaign headquarters.[289]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\n\"Green Cities, Clean Water\" is an environmental policy initiative based in Philadelphia that has shown promising results in mitigating the effects of climate change.[290] The researchers on the policy have stated that despite such promising plans of green infrastructure building, \"the city is forecasted to grow warmer, wetter, and more urbanized over the century, runoff and local temperatures will increase on average throughout the city\".[290] Even though landcover predictive models on the effects of the policy initiative have indicated that green infrastructure could be useful at decreasing the amount of runoff in the city over time, the city government would have to expand its current plans and \"consider the cobenefit of climate change adaptation when planning new projects'' in limiting the scope of city-wide temperature increase.[290]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crime in Philadelphia and Philadelphia crime family\n\n#### Police and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Police Department\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Police Department administration building, known as the Roundhouse, in Center City east of Chinatown\n![](image)A Philadelphia police cruiser on Benjamin Franklin Parkway\nAccording to a 2015 report by Pew Charitable Trusts, the police districts with the highest rates of violent crime were Frankford (15th district) and Kensington (24th district) in the Near Northeast, and districts to the North (22nd, 25th, and 35th districts), West (19th district) and Southwest (12th district) of Center City. Each of those seven districts recorded more than a thousand violent crimes in 2014. The lowest rates of violent crime occurred in Center City, South Philadelphia, the Far Northeast, and Roxborough districts, the latter of which includes Manayunk.[150]\n\n\nPhiladelphia had 500 (503 according to some sources) murders in 1990, a rate of 31.5 per 100,000. An average of about 400 murders occurred each year for most of the 1990s. The murder count dropped in 2002 to 288, then rose to 406 by 2006, before dropping slightly to 392 in 2007.[291][292] A few years later, Philadelphia began to see a rapid decline in homicides and violent crime. In 2013, the city had 246 murders, which is a decrease of nearly 40% since 2006.[293] In 2014, 248 homicides were committed. The homicide rate rose to 280 in 2015, then fell slightly to 277 in 2016, before rising again to 317 in 2017.[294] Homicides increased dramatically in the late 2010s/early 2020s, reaching 499 homicides in 2020[291] and surpassing the 1990 \"record\" in 2021, with 501st murder on November 27 and 510 by the end of the month.[295]\n\n\nIn 2006, Philadelphia's homicide rate of 27.7 per 100,000 people was the highest of the country's 10 most populous cities.[296] In 2012, Philadelphia had the fourth-highest homicide rate among the country's most populous cities. The rate dropped to 16 homicides per 100,000 residents by 2014 placing Philadelphia as the sixth-highest city in the country.[150]\n\n\nThe number of shootings in the city has declined significantly since the early years of the 21st century. Shooting incidents peaked at 1,857 in 2006 before declining nearly 44 percent to 1,047 shootings in 2014.[150] Major crimes have decreased gradually since a peak in 2006 when 85,498 major crimes were reported. The number of reported major crimes fell 11 percent in three years to 68,815 occurrences in 2014. Violent crimes, which include homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery, decreased 14 percent in three years to 15,771 occurrences in 2014.[150]\n\n\nIn 2014, Philadelphia enacted an ordinance decriminalizing the possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana or 8 grams of hashish; the ordinance gave police officers the discretion to treat possession of these amounts as a civil infraction punishable by a $25 ticket, rather than a crime.[297][298] Philadelphia was at the time the largest city to decriminalize the possession of marijuana.[298] From 2013 to 2018, marijuana arrests in the city dropped by more than 85%.[297] The purchase or sale of marijuana remains a criminal offense in Philadelphia.[298]\n\n\n\n#### Firefighting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Fire Department\n\nThe Philadelphia Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services (EMS). The department's official mission is to protect public safety by quick and professional response to emergencies and the promotion of sound emergency prevention measures. This mandate encompasses all traditional firefighting functions, including fire suppression, with 60 engine companies and 30 ladder companies[299] as well as specialty and support units deployed throughout the city; specialized firefighting units for Philadelphia International Airport and the Port of Philadelphia; investigations conducted by the fire marshal's office to determine the origins of fires and develop preventive strategies; prevention programs to educate the public; and support services including research and planning, management of the fire communications center within the city's 911 system, and operation of the Philadelphia Fire Academy.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Media in Philadelphia\n\n### Newspapers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Inquirer Building at 400 North Broad Street was home of *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, the nation's third-longest continuously published newspaper, until 2012 when it moved its headquarters to Market Street. The building is currently undergoing renovations to become the new headquarters of the Philadelphia Police Department.\nPhiladelphia's two major daily newspapers are *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, first published in 1829—the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the country—and the *Philadelphia Daily News*, first published in 1925.[300] The *Daily News* has been published as an edition of the *Inquirer* since 2009.[301] Recent owners of the *Inquirer* and *Daily News* have included Knight Ridder, The McClatchy Company, and Philadelphia Media Holdings, with the latter organization declaring bankruptcy in 2010.[302] After two years of financial struggle, the newspapers were sold to Interstate General Media in 2012.[302] The two newspapers had a combined daily circulation of 306,831 and a Sunday circulation of 477,313 in 2013[update], the 18th-largest circulation in the country, and the website of the newspapers, Philly.com,[303] was ranked 13th in popularity among online U.S. newspapers by Alexa Internet that same year.[304]\n\n\nSmaller publications include the *Philadelphia Tribune* published five days each week for the African-American community;[305] *Philadelphia* magazine, a monthly regional magazine;[306] *Philadelphia Weekly*, a weekly alternative newspaper;[307] *Philadelphia Gay News*, a weekly newspaper for the LGBT community;[308] *The Jewish Exponent*, a weekly newspaper for the Jewish community;[309] *Al Día*, a weekly newspaper for the Latino community;[310] and *Philadelphia Metro*, a free daily newspaper.[311]\n\n\nStudent-run newspapers include the University of Pennsylvania's *The Daily Pennsylvanian*,[312] Temple University's *The Temple News*,[313] and Drexel University's *The Triangle*.[314]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nThe first experimental radio license was issued in Philadelphia in August 1912 to St. Joseph's College. The first commercial AM radio stations began broadcasting in 1922: first WIP, then owned by Gimbels department store, followed by WFIL, then owned by Strawbridge & Clothier department store, and WOO, a defunct station owned by Wanamaker's department store, as well as WCAU and WDAS.[315]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the FCC lists 28 FM and 11 AM stations for Philadelphia.[316][317] As of December 2017, the ten highest-rated stations in Philadelphia were adult contemporary WBEB-FM (101.1), sports talk WIP-FM (94.1), classic rock WMGK-FM (102.9), urban adult contemporary WDAS-FM (105.3), classic hits WOGL-FM (98.1), album-oriented rock WMMR-FM (93.3), country music WXTU-FM (92.5), all-news KYW-AM (1060), talk radio WHYY-FM (90.9), and urban adult contemporary WRNB-FM (100.3).[318][319] Philadelphia is served by three non-commercial public radio stations: WHYY-FM (NPR),[320] WRTI-FM (classical and jazz),[321] and WXPN-FM (adult alternative music).[322]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRadio stations in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, metropolitan area\n |\n| --- |\n| By AM frequency | * 560\n* 610\n* 640\n* 690\n* 740\n* 800\n* 860\n* 900\n* 950\n* 990\n* 10601\n* 1180\n* 12101\n* 1310\n* 1340\n* 1370\n* 1420\n* 1440\n* 1460\n* 1480\n* 1490\n* 1520\n* 1540\n* 1570\n* 1590\n* 1640\n* 1680\n |\n| By FM frequency | * 88.1\n\t+ WPEB\n\t+ WTHA\n\t+ WZZD\n* 88.3\n* 88.5\n* 88.7\n* 88.9\n\t+ WBYO\n\t+ WBZC\n* 89.1\n* 89.3\n\t+ WRDV\n\t+ WRTJ\n* 89.5\n* 89.7\n* 90.1\n* 90.9\n* 91.5\n\t+ WDBK\n\t+ WSRN-FM\n* 91.7\n\t+ WBMR\n\t+ WCUR\n\t+ WKDU\n\t+ WLBS\n* 92.5\n* 93.3\n* 93.7\n* 94.1\n* 94.5\n* 94.9\n* 95.7\n* 96.5\n* 97.5\n* 98.1\n* 98.9\n* 99.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.3\n* 101.1\n* 101.5\n* 102.1\n* 102.9\n* 103.9\n* 104.5\n* 105.3\n* 106.1\n* 106.9\n* 107.9\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| LPFM | * 92.9\n\t+ WGGT-LP\n\t+ WOOM-LP\n\t+ WRGU-LP\n\t+ WRLG-LP\n\t+ WZML-LP\n* 98.5\n\t+ WJYN-LP\n\t+ WNUW-LP\n\t+ WQEW-LP\n* 106.5\n |\n| Translators | * 92.9\n* 94.9\n* 95.1\n* 95.3\n* 96.1\n* 97.1\n\t+ W246AR\n\t+ W246AQ\n* 98.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.7\n* 102.5\n* 103.3\n* 103.5\n* 103.9\n* 104.1\n* 105.7\n\t+ W289AZ\n\t+ W289CZ\n* 107.3\n |\n\n |\n| NOAA Weather Radiofrequency | * 162.425\n* 162.475\n |\n| Digital radioby frequency & subchannel | * 1210\n* 88.5-1\n* 88.5-2\n* 89.3-1\n* 89.3-2\n* 89.5-1\n* 89.5-2\n* 90.1-1\n* 90.1-2\n* 90.9-1\n* 92.5-1\n* 92.5-2\n* 93.3-1\n* 93.3-2\n* 93.7-1\n* 93.7-2\n* 93.7-3\n* 94.1-1\n* 94.1-2\n* 94.1-3\n* 95.7-1\n* 95.7-2\n* 96.5-1\n* 96.5-2\n* 97.5-1\n* 97.5-2\n* 97.5-3\n* 98.1-1\n* 98.1-2\n* 98.1-3\n* 98.9-1\n* 99.5-1\n* 100.3-1\n* 100.3-2\n* 100.3-3\n* 101.1-1\n* 101.1-2\n* 101.5-1\n* 101.5-2\n* 102.1-1\n* 102.1-2\n* 102.1-3\n* 102.9-1\n* 102.9-2\n* 102.9-3\n* 104.5-1\n* 104.5-2\n* 105.3-1\n* 105.3-2\n* 106.1-1\n* 106.1-2\n* 106.9-1\n* 106.9-2\n* 106.9-3\n* 107.9-1\n* 107.9-2\n |\n| By call sign | * KIH28\n* KYW1\n* W225DJ\n* W235CE\n* W236CL\n* W237EH\n* W241CH\n* W246AR\n* W246AQ\n* W253CA\n* W260CZ\n* W264BH\n* W273DO\n* W277DL\n* W278AK\n* W280CP\n* W281CL\n* W289AZ\n* W289CZ\n* W297AD\n* WBCB\n* WBEB\n\t+ HD2\n* WBEN-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WBMR\n* WBYO\n* WBZC\n* WCHE\n* WCHR\n* WCOJ\n* WCUR\n* WDAS\n* WDAS-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WDBK\n* WEMG\n* WFIL\n* WFYL\n* WGGT-LP\n* WGLS-FM\n* WHAT\n* WHHS\n* WHYY\n* WIFI\n* WIOQ\n* WIP-FM\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WISP\n* WJFP\n* WJYN-LP\n* WKDN\n* WKDU\n* WKVP\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WKXW\n\t+ HD2\n* WLBS\n* WMGK\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WMMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WNG704\n* WNPV\n* WNTP\n* WNUW-LP\n* WNWR\n* WOGL\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WOOM-LP\n* WPAZ\n* WPEB\n* WPEN\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WPHE\n* WPHI-FM\n* WPHT1\n* WPNX700\n* WPPM-LP\n* WPPZ-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WPST\n* WPWA\n* WQEW-LP\n* WQHS\n* WRDV\n* WRFF\n\t+ HD2\n* WRGU-LP\n* WRLG-LP\n* WRNB\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WRSD\n* WRTI\n\t+ HD2\n* WRTJ\n\t+ HD2\n* WSRN-FM\n* WSTW\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WTDY-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WTEL\n* WTHA\n* WTMR\n* WTTM\n* WUMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WURD\n* WUSL\n* WVCW\n* WWDB\n* WWJZ\n* WWLU\n* WXPN\n\t+ HD2\n* WXTU\n\t+ HD2\n* WXVU\n* WYPA\n\t+ HD2\n* WZML-LP\n* WZXE\n* WZZD\n |\n| Internet | * WEXP\n* WQHS\n* WYBF\n |\n| Defunct | * WDNR (89.5 FM)\n* WEXP (1600 AM)\n* WJJZ (1460 AM)\n* WNAP (1110 AM)\n* WNJC (1360 AM)\n* WOO\n* WQHS\n* WYBF (89.1 FM)\n* WZZE (97.3 FM)\n |\n| Radio stations in the Delaware Valley\nPhiladelphia\nVineland-Millville-Bridgeton\nWilmington\n\nOther nearby regions\nAllentown-Bethlehem\nAtlantic City-Cape May\nDover\nLancaster\nReading\nTrenton\nSee also\nList of radio stations in Pennsylvania\n* Mass media in the Philadelphia Area\n\t+ Radio stations\n\t+ TV stations\n\t+ Newspapers\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nNotes\n1.

The station became NBC's first affiliate in 1939, and later became KYW-TV (currently a CBS affiliate). WCAU-TV, WFIL-TV, and WHYY-TV were all founded by the 1960s.[315] In 1952, WFIL (renamed WPVI) premiered the television show *Bandstand*, which later became the nationally broadcast *American Bandstand* hosted by Dick Clark.[323]\n\n\nEach commercial network has an affiliate in Philadelphia: KYW-TV 3 (CBS), WPVI-TV 6 (ABC), WCAU 10 (NBC), WPHL-TV 17 (The CW with MyNetworkTV on DT2), WFPA-CD 28 (UniMás), WTXF-TV 29 (Fox), WPSG 57 (Independent), WWSI 62 (Telemundo), and WUVP-DT 65 (Univision). The region is served also by public broadcasting stations WPPT-TV (Philadelphia), WHYY-TV (Wilmington, Delaware and Philadelphia), WLVT-TV (Lehigh Valley), and NJTV (New Jersey).[324]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has owned-and-operated stations for five major English-language broadcast networks: NBC – WCAU-TV, CBS – KYW-TV, ABC – WPVI-TV, Fox – WTXF-TV and The CW – WPHL-TV. The major Spanish-language networks are Univision – WUVP-DT, UniMás – WFPA-CD, and Telemundo – WWSI-TV.[324]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city is the nation's fourth-largest consumer in media market, as ranked by the Nielsen Media Research firm, with nearly 2.9 million TV households.[325]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBroadcast television in the Delaware Valley region\n |\n| --- |\n| This region

Philadelphia\n\nSince at least the 1700s, hundreds of books and articles have been written about Philadelphia's history, culture, sports teams, crime, politics, and other themes related to the city's past, present, and future.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: 30th Street Station, List of Philadelphia subway stations, and Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's 30th Street Station serves both SEPTA regional and Amtrak national trains and is Amtrak's third-busiest train station in the nation.\n![](image)A Market–Frankford Line train departing 52nd Street station\nPhiladelphia is served by SEPTA, which operates buses, trains, rapid transit (as both subways and elevated trains), trolleys, and trackless trolleys (electric buses) throughout Philadelphia, the four Pennsylvania suburban counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery, in addition to service to Mercer County, New Jersey (Trenton) and New Castle County, Delaware (Wilmington and Newark, Delaware).[326] The city's subway system consists of two routes: the subway section of the Market–Frankford Line running east–west under Market Street which opened in 1905 to the west and 1908 to the east of City Hall,[327] and the Broad Street Line running north–south beneath Broad Street which opened in stages from 1928 to 1938.[328]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, large sections of the SEPTA Regional Rail service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia were discontinued due to a lack of funding for equipment and infrastructure maintenance.[329][330][331]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 30th Street Station is a major railroad station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor with 4.4 million passengers in 2017 making it the third-busiest station in the country after New York City's Pennsylvania Station and Washington's Union Station.[332] 30th Street Station offers access to Amtrak,[333] SEPTA,[334] and NJ Transit lines.[335] Over 12 million SEPTA and NJ Transit rail commuters use the station each year, and more than 100,000 people on an average weekday.[332]\n\n\nThe PATCO Speedline provides rapid transit service to Camden, Collingswood, Westmont, Haddonfield, Woodcrest (Cherry Hill), Ashland (Voorhees), and Lindenwold, New Jersey, from stations on Locust Street between 16th and 15th, 13th and 12th, and 10th and 9th Streets, and on Market Street at 8th Street.[336]\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Philadelphia International Airport, the busiest airport in Pennsylvania and 21st-busiest in the nation\nTwo airports serve Philadelphia: the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is 7 mi (11 km) south-southwest of Center City on the boundary with Delaware County, providing scheduled domestic and international air service,[337] while Northeast Philadelphia Airport (PNE) is a general aviation relief airport in Northeast Philadelphia serving general and corporate aviation.[338] Philadelphia International Airport is among the busiest airports in the world measured by traffic movements (i.e., takeoffs and landings).[339] More than 30 million passengers pass through the airport annually on 25 airlines, including all major domestic carriers. The airport has nearly 500 daily departures to more than 120 destinations worldwide.[337] SEPTA's Airport Regional Rail Line provides direct service between Center City railroad stations and Philadelphia International Airport.[340]\n\n\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 9,650 feet (2,940 m) long Benjamin Franklin Bridge spans the Delaware River, connecting Philadelphia and South Jersey\n![](image)The Schuylkill Expressway eastbound at I-676 and US 30, also known as the Vine Street Expressway, in Center City\nWilliam Penn planned Philadelphia with numbered streets traversing north and south, and streets named for trees, such as Chestnut, Walnut, and Mulberry (since renamed Arch Street), traversing east and west. The two main streets were named Broad Street (the north–south artery, since designated Pennsylvania Route 611) and High Street (the east–west artery, since renamed Market Street) converging at Centre Square which later became the site of City Hall.[341]\n\n\nInterstate 95 (the Delaware Expressway) traverses the southern and eastern edges of the city along the Delaware River as the main north–south controlled-access highway, connecting Philadelphia with Newark, New Jersey and New York City to the north and with Baltimore and Washington, D.C. southward. The city is also served by Interstate 76 (the Schuylkill Expressway), which runs along the Schuylkill River, intersecting the Pennsylvania Turnpike at King of Prussia and providing access to Harrisburg and points west. Interstate 676 (the Vine Street Expressway) links I-95 and I-76 through Center City by running below street level between the eastbound and westbound lanes of Vine Street. Entrance and exit ramps for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge are near the eastern end of the expressway, just west of the I-95 interchange.[342]\n\n\nThe Roosevelt Boulevard and Expressway (U.S. 1) connect Northeast Philadelphia with Center City via I-76 through Fairmount Park. Woodhaven Road (Route 63) and Cottman Avenue (Route 73) serve the neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia, running between I-95 and the Roosevelt Boulevard. The Fort Washington Expressway (Route 309) extends north from the city's northern border, serving Montgomery County and Bucks County. U.S. Route 30 (Lancaster Avenue) extends westward from West Philadelphia to Lancaster.[342]\n\n\nInterstate 476 (locally referred to as the Blue Route[343]) traverses Delaware County, bypassing the city to the west and serving the city's western suburbs, and provides a direct route to Allentown and points north, including the Poconos. Interstate 276, the Pennsylvania Turnpike's Delaware River extension, is a bypass and commuter route to the north of the city and a link to the New Jersey Turnpike and New York City.[342]\n\n\nThe Delaware River Port Authority operates four bridges in the Philadelphia area across the Delaware River to New Jersey: the Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), the Benjamin Franklin Bridge (I-676 and U.S. 30), the Betsy Ross Bridge (New Jersey Route 90), and the Commodore Barry Bridge (U.S. 322 in Delaware County, south of the city).[344] The Burlington County Bridge Commission maintains two bridges across the Delaware River: the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge which connects PA Route 73 in the Tacony section of Northeast Philadelphia with New Jersey Route 73 in Palmyra, Burlington County, and the Burlington–Bristol Bridge which connects NJ Route 413/U.S. Route 130 in Burlington, New Jersey with PA Route 413/U.S. 13 in Bristol Township, north of Philadelphia.[345]\n\n\n\n#### Bus service[edit]\n\n\nThe Greyhound terminal is at 1001 Filbert Street (at 10th Street) in Center City, southeast of the Pennsylvania Convention Center and south of Chinatown.[346] Several other bus operators provide service at the Greyhound terminal including Fullington Trailways,[347] Martz Trailways,[348] Peter Pan Bus Lines,[349] and NJ Transit buses.[350]\n\n\nOther intercity bus services include Megabus with stops at 30th Street Station and the visitor center for Independence Hall,[351] BoltBus (operated by Greyhound) at 30th Street Station,[352] OurBus at various stops in the city.\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of rail transport in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Suburban Station with art deco architecture at 16th Street and JFK Boulevard\nSince the early days of rail transportation in the United States, Philadelphia has served as a hub for several major rail companies, particularly the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad first operated Broad Street Station, then 30th Street Station and Suburban Station, and the Reading Railroad operated Reading Terminal, now part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area. The two systems now operate as a single system under the control of SEPTA, the regional transit authority. Additionally, the PATCO Speedline subway system and NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line operate successor services to southern New Jersey.[353]\n\n\nIn 1911, Philadelphia had nearly 4,000 electric trolleys running on 86 lines.[354] In 2005, SEPTA reintroduced trolley service to the Girard Avenue Line, Route 15.[355] SEPTA operates six subway-surface trolleys that run on street-level tracks in West Philadelphia and subway tunnels in Center City, along with two surface trolleys in adjacent suburbs.[356]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a regional hub of the federally-owned Amtrak system, with 30th Street Station being a primary stop on the Washington-Boston Northeast Corridor and the Keystone Corridor to Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. 30th Street also serves as a major station for services via the Pennsylvania Railroad's former Pennsylvania Main Line to Chicago. As of 2018[update], 30th Street is Amtrak's third-busiest station in the country, after New York City and Washington.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Walk Score ranks[edit]\n\n\nA 2017 study by Walk Score ranked Philadelphia the fifth-most walkable major city in the United States with a score of 79 out of 100, in the middle of the \"very walkable\" range. The city was just edged out by fourth place Miami (79.2), with the top three cities being New York, San Francisco, and Boston. Philadelphia placed fifth in the public transit friendly category, behind Washington, D.C., with the same three cities for walkability topping this category. The city ranked tenth in the bike friendly cities category, with the top three cities being Minneapolis, San Francisco and Portland.[357]\n\n\n*USA Today* readers voted the Schuylkill River Trail the best urban trail in the nation in 2015.[358]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n#### Water purity and availability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fairmount Water Works, Philadelphia's second municipal waterworks, in December 1984\nIn 1815, Philadelphia began sourcing its water via the Fairmount Water Works on the Schuylkill River, the nation's first major urban water supply system. In 1909, the Water Works was decommissioned as the city transitioned to modern sand filtration methods.[359] Today, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) provides drinking water, wastewater collection, and stormwater services for Philadelphia, as well as surrounding counties. PWD draws about 57 percent of its drinking water from the Delaware River and the balance from the Schuylkill River.[360] The city has two filtration plants on the Schuylkill River and one on the Delaware River. The three plants can treat up to 546 million gallons of water per day, while the total storage capacity of the combined plant and distribution system exceeds one billion gallons. The wastewater system consists of three water pollution control plants, 21 pumping stations, and about 3,657 miles (5,885 km) of sewers.[360]\n\n\n\n#### Electricity[edit]\n\n\nExelon subsidiary PECO Energy Company, founded as the Brush Electric Light Company of Philadelphia in 1881 and renamed Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) in 1902, provides electricity to about 1.6 million customers and more than 500,000 natural gas customers in the southeastern Pennsylvania area including the city of Philadelphia and most of its suburbs.[361] PECO is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state with 472 power substations and nearly 23,000 miles (37,000 km) of electric transmission and distribution lines, along with 12,000 miles (19,000 km) of natural gas transmission, distribution & service lines.[362]\n\n\n\n#### Natural gas[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Philadelphia Gas Works\n\nPhiladelphia Gas Works (PGW), overseen by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, is the nation's largest municipally-owned natural gas utility. PGW serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the Philadelphia area.[363] Founded in 1836, the company came under city ownership in 1987 and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits. In 2014, the City Council refused to conduct hearings on a $1.86 billion sale of PGW, part of a two-year effort that was proposed by the mayor. The refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer.[364][365]\n\n\n\n#### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Area codes 215, 267, and 445\n\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania was assigned the 215 area code in 1947 when the North American Numbering Plan of the Bell System went into effect. The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in half in 1994 when area code 610 was created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215. Overlay area code 267 was added to the 215 service area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas, area code 445 to 215 and area code 835 to 610, was delayed and later rescinded.[366] Area code 445 was implemented as an overlay for area codes 215 and 267 starting on February 3, 2018.[367]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Philadelphia\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Chinatown paifang at 10th and Arch Streets, a symbol of Philadelphia's sister city relationship with Tianjin\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Florence[368] | Italy\n | 1964\n |\n| Tel Aviv[369] | Israel\n | 1966\n |\n| Toruń[370] | Poland\n | 1976\n |\n| Tianjin[371] | China\n | 1979\n |\n| Incheon[372] | South Korea\n | 1984\n |\n| Douala[373] | Cameroon\n | 1986\n |\n| Nizhny Novgorod[374] | Russia\n | 1992\n |\n| Frankfurt[375] | Germany\n | 2015\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia also has three partnership cities or regions:[376]\n\n\n\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Kobe[377] | Japan\n | 1986\n |\n| Abruzzo[378] | Italy\n | 1997\n |\n| Aix-en-Provence[379] | France\n | 1999\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia has eight official sister cities as designated by the Citizen Diplomacy International of Philadelphia:[376] Philadelphia has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. The Sister Cities Park, a site of 0.5 acres (2,400 sq yd) at 18th and Benjamin Franklin Parkway within Logan Square, was dedicated in June 1976. The park was built to commemorate Philadelphia's first two sister city relationships, with Tel Aviv and Florence. The Toruń Triangle, honoring the sister city relationship with Toruń, Poland, was constructed in 1976, west of the United Way building at 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Sister Cities Park was redesigned and reopened in 2012, featuring an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's sister and partnership cities, a café and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, as well as a pavilion built to environmentally friendly standards.[380][381]\n\n\nThe Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans of Tianjin, stands astride 10th Street, on the north side of its intersection with Arch Street, as a symbol of the sister city relationship. The CDI of Philadelphia has participated in the U.S. Department of State's \"Partners for Peace\" project with Mosul, Iraq,[382] as well as accepting visiting delegations from dozens of other countries.[383]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n* ![](image)Philadelphia portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of Pennsylvania state historical markers in Philadelphia County\n* Metropolitan areas in the Americas\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n* USS *Philadelphia*, 6 ships\n* Alaşehir, ancient Philadelphia in Turkey\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Description of the Lenape peoples (Delaware nations) historic territories inside the divides of the frequently mountainous landforms flanking the Delaware River's drainage basin.

The February 2010 storms contributed to a single month record accumulation of 51.5 in (131 cm). If no snow fell outside of February that season, 2009–10 would still rank as 5th-snowiest. See the Franklin Institute for a visual representation of seasonal snowfall.\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Official temperature and precipitation measurements for Philadelphia were taken at the Weather Bureau Office in downtown from January 1872 to 19 June 1940, and at Philadelphia Int'l from 20 June 1940 to the present.[111] Snowfall and snow depth records date to 1 January 1884 and 1 October 1948, respectively.[105] In 2006, snowfall measurements were moved to National Park, New Jersey directly across the Delaware River from the airport.[112]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** From 15% sample\n6. **^** E.g., in the opening chapter of *The Handbook of Language Variation and Change* (ed.

It is one of the most historically significant cities in the United States and served as the nation's capital until 1800.[13] Philadelphia is the nation's sixth-most populous city with a population of 1,603,797 as of the 2020 census. Since 1854, the city has been coextensive with Philadelphia County, the most populous county in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia serves as the urban core of the larger Delaware Valley (or Philadelphia metropolitan area), the nation's seventh-largest and one of the world's largest metropolitan regions consisting of 6.245 million residents in the metropolitan statistical area and 7.366 million residents in its combined statistical area.[14] Philadelphia is known for its extensive contributions to American history, especially the American Revolution, and for its contemporary influence in business and industry, culture, sports, and music.[15][16]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was founded in 1682 by William Penn, an English Quaker and advocate of religious freedom. The city served as the capital of the Pennsylvania Colony during the British colonial era[5][17] and went on to play a historic and vital role as the central meeting place for the nation's founding fathers whose plans and actions in Philadelphia ultimately inspired the American Revolution and the nation's independence following the Revolutionary War. Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress in 1774, preserved the Liberty Bell, and hosted the Second Continental Congress during which the founders signed the Declaration of Independence, which historian Joseph Ellis has described as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history\".[18] Once the Revolutionary War commenced, the Battle of Germantown and the siege of Fort Mifflin were fought within Philadelphia's city limits. The U.S. Constitution was later ratified in Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Convention of 1787. Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until 1790, when it was surpassed by New York City, and it served as the nation's first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions during and following the American Revolution, including from 1790 to 1800 during the construction of the new national capital of Washington, D.C.\n\n\nWith 18 four-year universities and colleges, Philadelphia is one of the nation's leading centers for higher education and academic research.[19][20] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area was the state's largest and nation's ninth-largest metropolitan economy with a gross metropolitan product of US$444.1 billion. The city is home to five Fortune 500 corporate headquarters as of 2022.[21] As of 2023, metropolitan Philadelphia ranks among the top five U.S. venture capital centers, facilitated by its proximity to New York City's entrepreneurial and financial ecosystems.[22] The Philadelphia Stock Exchange, owned by Nasdaq since 2008, is the nation's oldest stock exchange and a global leader in options trading.[23] 30th Street Station, the city's primary rail station, is the third-busiest Amtrak hub in the nation, and the city's multimodal transport and logistics infrastructure, includes Philadelphia International Airport, and the rapidly-growing PhilaPort seaport.[24] A migration pattern has been established from New York City to Philadelphia by residents opting for a large city with relative proximity and a lower cost of living.[25][26]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a national cultural center, hosting more outdoor sculptures and murals than any other city in the nation.[27][28] Fairmount Park, when combined with adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park in the same watershed, is 2,052 acres (830 ha), representing one of the nation's largest and the world's 45th-largest urban park.[29] The city is known for its arts, culture, cuisine, and colonial and Revolution-era history; in 2016, it attracted 42 million domestic tourists who spent $6.8 billion, representing $11 billion in economic impact to the city and its surrounding Pennsylvania counties.[30]\n\n\nWith five professional sports teams and one of the nation's most loyal fan bases, Philadelphia is often ranked as the nation's best city for professional sports fans.[31][32][33][34] The city has a culturally and philanthropically active LGBTQ+ community. Philadelphia also has played an immensely influential historic and ongoing role in the development and evolution of American music, especially R&B, soul, and rock.[35][36]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a city of many firsts, including the nation's first library (1731),[37] hospital (1751),[37] medical school (1765),[38] national capital (1774),[39] university (by some accounts) (1779),[40] stock exchange (1790),[37] zoo (1874),[41] and business school (1881).[42] Philadelphia contains 67 National Historic Landmarks, including Independence Hall.[43][44][20] From the city's 17th century founding through the present, Philadelphia has been the birthplace or home to an extensive number of prominent and influential Americans. In 2021, *Time* magazine named Philadelphia one of the world's greatest 100 places.[45]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Philadelphia\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Philadelphia.\n\nSee also: List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia and National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n\n### Native peoples[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 17th century, the Philadelphia area was home to the Lenape (Delaware) Indians in the village of Shackamaxon. They were also called the Delaware Indians,[46] and their historical territory was along the Delaware River watershed, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley.[a] Most Lenape were pushed out of their Delaware homeland during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts.[46] Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly smallpox, and conflict with Europeans. The Iroquois occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper Ohio River basin. The American Revolutionary War and the United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the eastern United States to the Indian Territory to present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territories under the Indian removal policy.\n\n\n\n### Colonial[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Penn (holding paper) and King Charles II depicted in *The Birth of Pennsylvania*, an 1680 portrait by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris\n![A Portraiture of the City of Philadelphia, by Thomas Holme](image)A 1683 portrait of Philadelphia by Thomas Holme that is believed to be the city's first map\n![](image)William Penn's 1682 Treaty of Shackamaxon with the Lenape tribe depicted in *Penn's Treaty with the Indians*, a 1772 portrait by Benjamin West\nEuropeans came to the Delaware Valley in the early 17th century. The first settlements were founded by Dutch colonists, who built Fort Nassau on the Delaware River in 1623 in what is now Brooklawn, New Jersey. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their New Netherland colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of New Sweden at Fort Christina, located in present-day Wilmington, Delaware, and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the Susquehannocks in their war against Maryland colonists.[47] In 1648, the Dutch built Fort Beversreede on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill River near the present-day Eastwick section of Philadelphia, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building Fort Nya Korsholm, or New Korsholm, named after a town in Finland with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General Peter Stuyvesant took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. An English fleet captured the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682, when the area was included in William Penn's charter for Pennsylvania.[48]\n\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, Charles II of England granted Penn a charter for what would become the Pennsylvania colony. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape in an effort to establish good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for the colony.[49] Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon, in what is now the city's Fishtown neighborhood.[5] Penn named the city Philadelphia, which is Greek for \"brotherly love\", derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος *phílos* (beloved, dear) and ἀδελφός *adelphós* (brother, brotherly). There were a number of cities named *Philadelphia* in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Greek and Roman periods, including modern Alaşehir, mentioned as the site of an early Christian congregation in the Book of Revelation. As a Quaker, Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely. This tolerance, which exceeded that of other colonies, led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city.[50]\n\n\nPenn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a grid plan to keep houses and businesses spread far apart with areas for gardens and orchards.\n\n\nThe city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, and instead crowded the present-day Port of Philadelphia on the Delaware River and subdivided and resold their lots.[51] Before Penn left Philadelphia for the final time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city. Though poor at first, Philadelphia became an important trading center with tolerable living conditions by the 1750s. Benjamin Franklin, a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones that were among the first in the nation, including a fire company, library, and hospital.\n\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life, including the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the Academy of Natural Sciences (1812), and the Franklin Institute (1824).[52] These societies developed and financed new industries that attracted skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n\n\n### American Revolution[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution and Philadelphia campaign\n\n![](image)The Committee of Five presenting their draft of the Declaration of Independence in Independence Hall on June 28, 1776, depicted in an 1818 painting by John Trumbull; historian Joseph Ellis called the Declaration \"the most potent and consequential words in American history.\"[53]\n![](image)President's House on Market Street served as the presidential mansion for the nation's first two presidents, George Washington and John Adams, from 1790 to 1800 prior to the completion of the White House and the development of Washington, D.C. as the nation's new capital\n![](image)Independence Hall on Chestnut Street between 5th and 6th Streets, where the Declaration of Independence was signed and the Constitution was ratified, on July 4, 1776, and June 21, 1788, respectively\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for America's revolutionaries. By the 1750s, Philadelphia surpassed Boston as the largest city and busiest port in British America, and the second-largest city in the entire British Empire after London.[54][55] In 1774, as resentment of British colonial practices and support for independence was burgeoning in the colonies, Philadelphia hosted the First Continental Congress.\n\n\nFrom 1775 to 1781, Philadelphia hosted the Second Continental Congress,[56] which adopted the Declaration of Independence in what was then called the Pennsylvania State House and was later renamed Independence Hall. Historian Joseph Ellis, in 2007, described the Declaration of Independence, written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson, as \"the most potent and consequential words in American history,\"[18] and its adoption represented a declaration of war against the British Army, which was then the world's most powerful military force. Since the Declaration's July 4, 1776, adoption, its signing has been cited globally and repeatedly by various peoples of the world seeking independence and liberty. It also has been, since its adoption, the basis for annual celebration by Americans; in 1938, this celebration of the Declaration was formalized as Independence Day, one of only ten designated U.S. federal holidays.\n\n\nAfter George Washington's defeat at the Battle of Brandywine in Chadds Ford Township, on September 11, 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless and the city prepared for what was perceived to be an inevitable British attack. Because bells could easily be recast into munitions, the Liberty Bell, then known as the Pennsylvania State Bell, and bells from two Philadelphia churches, Christ Church and St. Peter's Church, were hastily taken down and transported by heavily guarded wagon train out of the city. The Liberty Bell was taken to Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, which is present-day Allentown, where it was hidden under the church's floor boards for nine months from September 1777 until the British Army's departure from Philadelphia in June 1778.[57] Two Revolutionary War battles, the Siege of Fort Mifflin, fought between September 26 and November 16, 1777, and the Battle of Germantown, fought on October 4, 1777, took place within Philadelphia's city limits.\n\n\nIn Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation on November 15, 1777, and the city later served as the meeting place for the Constitutional Convention, which ratified the Constitution in Independence Hall in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787.\n\n\nPhiladelphia served as capital of the United States for much of the colonial and early post-colonial periods, including for a decade, from 1790 to 1800, while Washington, D.C., was being constructed and prepared to serve as the new national capital.[58] In 1793, the largest yellow fever epidemic in U.S. history killed approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people in Philadelphia, or about ten percent of the city's population at the time.[59][60] The capital of the United States was moved to Washington, D.C. in 1800 upon completion of the White House and U.S. Capitol buildings.\n\n\nThe state capital was moved from Philadelphia to Lancaster in 1799, then ultimately to Harrisburg in 1812 Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until the late 18th century. It also was the nation's financial and cultural center until ultimately being eclipsed in total population by New York City in 1790. In 1816, the city's free Black community founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first independent Black denomination in the country, and the first Black Episcopal Church. The free Black community also established many schools for its children with the help of Quakers. Large-scale construction projects for new roads, canals, and railroads made Philadelphia the first major industrial city in the United States.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)Loan of the City of Philadelphia, issued March 7, 1866\n![](image)Opening day ceremonies at the Centennial Exposition at Memorial Hall in Fairmount Park in 1876, the first world fair held in the U.S. on the centennial anniversary of the nation's founding\nThroughout the 19th century, Philadelphia hosted a variety of industries and businesses; the largest was the textile industry. Major corporations in the 19th and early 20th centuries included the Baldwin Locomotive Works, William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilding Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad.[61] Established in 1870, the Philadelphia Conveyancers' Association was chartered by the state in 1871. Along with the U.S. Centennial in 1876, the city's industry was celebrated in the Centennial Exposition, the first official World's fair in the U.S.\n\n\nImmigrants, mostly from Ireland and Germany, settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. These immigrants were largely responsible for the first general strike in North America in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the Great Famine in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of South Street and later occupied by succeeding immigrants. They established a network of Catholic churches and schools and dominated the Catholic clergy for decades. Anti-Irish, anti-Catholic nativist riots erupted in Philadelphia in 1844. The rise in population of the surrounding districts helped lead to the Act of Consolidation of 1854, which extended the city limits from the 2 square miles (5.2 km2) of Center City to the roughly 134 square miles (350 km2) of Philadelphia County.[62][63]\nIn the latter half of the 19th century and leading into the 20th century, immigrants from Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy, and African Americans from the southern U.S. settled in the city.[64]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was represented by the Washington Grays in the American Civil War. The African-American population of Philadelphia increased from 31,699 to 219,559 between 1880 and 1930.[65][66] Black newcomers in the 20th century were part of the Great Migration out of the rural south and into northern and midwestern industrial cities.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chestnut Street in Center City at night in February 2016\nBy the 20th century, Philadelphia had an entrenched Republican political machine and a complacent population.[67] In 1910, a general strike shut down the entire city.[68]\n\n\nIn 1917, following outrage over the election-year murder of a Philadelphia police officer, led to the shrinking of the City Council from two houses to just one.[69] In July 1919, Philadelphia was one of more than 36 industrial cities nationally to suffer a race riot during Red Summer in post-World War I unrest as recent immigrants competed with Blacks for jobs. In the 1920s, the public flouting of Prohibition laws, organized crime, mob violence, and corrupt police involvement in illegal activities led to the appointment of Brig. Gen. Smedley Butler of the U.S. Marine Corps as the city's director of public safety, but political pressure still prevented long-term success in fighting crime and corruption.[70]\n\n\nIn 1940, non-Hispanic whites constituted 86.8% of the city's population.[71] In 1950, the population peaked at more than two million residents, then began to decline with the restructuring of industry that led to the loss of many middle-class union jobs. In addition, suburbanization enticed many affluent residents to depart the city for its outlying railroad commuting towns and newer housing. The resulting reduction in Philadelphia's tax base and the resources of local government caused the city to struggle through a long period of adjustment, and it approached bankruptcy by the late 1980s.[72][73]\n\n\nIn 1985, the MOVE Bombing of the Cobbs Creek neighborhood by city helicopters occurred, killing 11 and destroying 61 homes.[74]\n\n\nRevitalization and gentrification of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century with much of the development occurring in the Center City and University City neighborhoods. But this expanded a shortage of affordable housing in the city. After many manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to market itself more aggressively as a tourist destination. Contemporary glass-and-granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the 1980s. Historic areas such as Old City and Society Hill were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s, making both areas among the most desirable Center City neighborhoods. Immigrants from around the world began to enter the U.S. through Philadelphia as their gateway, leading to a reversal of the city's population decline between 1950 and 2000, during which it lost about 25 percent of its residents.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia eventually began experiencing a growth in its population in 2007, which continued with gradual yearly increases through the present.[77][78]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's geographic center is about 40° 0′ 34″ north latitude and 75° 8′ 0″ west longitude. The 40th parallel north passes through neighborhoods in Northeast Philadelphia, North Philadelphia, and West Philadelphia including Fairmount Park. The city encompasses 142.71 square miles (369.62 km2), of which 134.18 square miles (347.52 km2) is land and 8.53 square miles (22.09 km2), or 6%, is water.[79] Natural bodies of water include the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers, lakes in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park, and Cobbs, Wissahickon, and Pennypack creeks. The largest artificial body of water is East Park Reservoir in Fairmount Park.\n\n\nThe lowest point is sea level and the highest point is in Chestnut Hill about 446 feet (136 m) above sea level on Summit Street near the intersection of Germantown Avenue and Bethlehem Pike at: 40.07815 N, 75.20747 W.[80][81] Philadelphia is located on the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line that separates the Atlantic Plain from the Piedmont.[82] The Schuylkill River's rapids at East Falls were inundated by completion of the dam at Fairmount Water Works.[83]\n\n\nThe city is the seat of its own county. The city is bordered by six adjacent counties: Montgomery to the northwest; Bucks to the north and northeast; Burlington County, New Jersey to the east; Camden County, New Jersey to the southeast; Gloucester County, New Jersey to the south; and Delaware County to the southwest.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)\nThe skyline of Philadelphia seen from the northwest on the Spring Garden Street Bridge over the Schuylkill River in April 2018 (annotated version)\n\n![](image)\nPhiladelphia's skyline at twilight from the southwest on the South Street Bridge with the Schuylkill River on the left in July 2016 (annotated version)\n\n#### City planning[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Philadelphia neighborhoods\n\nPhiladelphia was created in the 17th century following the plan by William Penn's surveyor Thomas Holme. Center City is structured with long, straight streets running nearly due east–west and north–south, forming a grid pattern between the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers that is aligned with their courses. The original city plan was designed to allow for easy travel and to keep residences separated by open space that would help prevent the spread of fire.[84] In keeping with the idea of a \"Greene Countrie Towne\", and inspired by the many types of trees that grew in the region, Penn named many of the east–west streets for local trees.[85] Penn planned the creation of five public parks in the city which were renamed in 1824.[84] Centre Square was renamed Penn Square;[86] Northeast Square was renamed Franklin Square; Southeast Square was renamed Washington Square; Southwest Square was renamed Rittenhouse Square; and Northwest Square was renamed Logan Circle/Square.[87] Center City had an estimated 183,240 residents as of 2015[update], making it the second-most populated downtown area in the United States after Midtown Manhattan in New York City.[88]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's neighborhoods are divided into six large sections that surround Center City: North Philadelphia, Northeast Philadelphia, South Philadelphia, Southwest Philadelphia, West Philadelphia, and Northwest Philadelphia. The city's geographic boundaries have been largely unchanged since these neighborhoods were consolidated in 1854. However, each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that constituted Pennsylvania County before their inclusion within the city.[89]\n\n\nThe City Planning Commission, tasked with guiding growth and development of the city, has divided the city into 18 planning districts as part of the *Philadelphia2035* physical development plan.[90][91] Much of the city's 1980 zoning code was overhauled from 2007 to 2012 as part of a joint effort between former mayors John F. Street and Michael Nutter. The zoning changes were intended to rectify incorrect zoning maps to facilitate future community development, as the city forecasts an additional 100,000 residents and 40,000 jobs will be added by 2035.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) is the largest landlord in Pennsylvania. Established in 1937, the PHA is the nation's fourth-largest housing authority, serving about 81,000 people with affordable housing, while employing 1,400 on a budget of $371 million.[92] The Philadelphia Parking Authority is responsible for ensuring adequate parking for city residents, businesses, and visitors.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Architecture of Philadelphia and List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia City Hall at night in December 2012\n![](image)Two of Center City Philadelphia's most prominent high-rise buildings, One Liberty Place, built between 1985 and 1987 (in background), and Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901 (in foreground)\nPhiladelphia's architectural history dates back to colonial times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest structures were constructed with logs, but brick structures were common by 1700. During the 18th century, the cityscape was dominated by Georgian architecture, including Independence Hall and Christ Church.\n\n\nIn the first decades of the 19th century, Federal and Greek Revival architecture were the dominant styles produced by Philadelphia architects such as Benjamin Latrobe, William Strickland, John Haviland, John Notman, Thomas Walter, and Samuel Sloan.[94] Frank Furness is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century. His contemporaries included John McArthur Jr., Addison Hutton, Wilson Eyre, the Wilson Brothers, and Horace Trumbauer. In 1871, construction began on the Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall. The Philadelphia Historical Commission was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places, adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit.[95]\n\n\nIn 1932, Philadelphia became home to the first modern International Style skyscraper in the United States, the PSFS Building, designed by George Howe and William Lescaze. The 548 ft (167 m) City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when One Liberty Place was completed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the late 1980s. In 2007, the Comcast Center surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest building. The Comcast Technology Center was completed in 2018, reaching a height of 1,121 ft (342 m), as the tallest building in the United States outside of Manhattan and Chicago.[96]\n\n\nFor much of Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the row house. The row house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United States were known as \"Philadelphia rows\".[94] A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Federal-style continuous blocks in Old City and Society Hill to Victorian-style homes in North Philadelphia to twin row houses in West Philadelphia. While newer homes have been built recently, much of the housing dates to the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries, which has created problems such as urban decay and vacant lots. Some neighborhoods, including Northern Liberties and Society Hill, have been rehabilitated through gentrification.[97][98]\n\n\n\n* ![Elfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]](image)\n\nElfreth's Alley, first developed in 1703, is the nation's oldest residential street.[99]\n* ![Carpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style](image)\n\nCarpenters' Hall, built between 1770 and 1774 in Georgian architecture style\n* ![The Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture](image)\n\nThe Second Bank of the United States, built between 1818 and 1824, exhibiting Greek Revival architecture\n* ![Second Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street](image)\n\nSecond Empire-style Philadelphia City Hall, built between 1871 and 1901, on South Broad Street\n* ![The Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933](image)\n\nThe Art Deco-style grand concourse at 30th Street Station, one of the nation's busiest passenber train stations, built between 1927 and 1933\n\n\n#### Parks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Drinking fountains in Philadelphia, Fairmount Park, and List of parks in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's Fairmount Park on the Schuylkill River, the city's largest and one of the world's largest public parks\nAs of 2014[update], the city's total park space, including municipal, state, and federal parks in the city, amounts to 11,211 acres (17.5 sq mi).[29] Philadelphia's largest park is Fairmount Park, which includes the Philadelphia Zoo and encompasses 2,052 acres (3.2 sq mi) of the total parkland. Fairmount Park's adjacent Wissahickon Valley Park contains 2,042 acres (3.2 sq mi).[100] Fairmount Park, when combined with Wissahickon Valley Park, is one of the largest contiguous urban park areas in the U.S.[29] The two parks, along with the Colonial Revival, Georgian and Federal-style mansions in them, have been listed as one entity on the National Register of Historic Places since 1972.[101]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3.1\n\n\n\n41\n\n26\n | 2.8\n\n\n\n44\n\n28\n | 4\n\n\n\n53\n\n34\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n65\n\n44\n | 3.3\n\n\n\n74\n\n54\n | 4\n\n\n\n83\n\n64\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n88\n\n70\n | 4.3\n\n\n\n86\n\n68\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n79\n\n61\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n67\n\n49\n | 2.9\n\n\n\n56\n\n39\n | 4\n\n\n\n46\n\n31\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 80\n\n\n\n5\n\n−3\n | 70\n\n\n\n7\n\n−3\n | 101\n\n\n\n12\n\n1\n | 88\n\n\n\n18\n\n7\n | 85\n\n\n\n24\n\n12\n | 103\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 111\n\n\n\n31\n\n21\n | 109\n\n\n\n30\n\n20\n | 112\n\n\n\n26\n\n16\n | 88\n\n\n\n20\n\n10\n | 74\n\n\n\n13\n\n4\n | 101\n\n\n\n8\n\n0\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification, Philadelphia falls under the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen *Cfa*),[102] whereas according to the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (*Do*) limited to the north by the continental climate (*Dc*).[103] Summers are typically hot and muggy, fall and spring are generally mild, and winter is moderately cold. The plant life hardiness zones are 7a and 7b, representing an average annual extreme minimum temperature between 0 and 10 °F (−18 and −12 °C).[104]\n\n\nSnowfall is highly variable, with some winters experiencing only light snow, while others include major snowstorms. The normal seasonal snowfall averages 22.4 in (57 cm), with rare snowfalls in November or April, and rarely any sustained snow cover.[105] Seasonal snowfall accumulation has ranged from trace amounts in 1972–73 to 78.7 inches (200 cm) in the winter of 2009–10.[105][b] The city's heaviest single-storm snowfall was 30.7 in (78 cm) which occurred in January 1996.[106]\n\n\nPrecipitation is generally spread throughout the year, with eight to eleven wet days per month,[107] at an average annual rate of 44.1 inches (1,120 mm), but historically ranging from 29.31 in (744 mm) in 1922 to 64.33 in (1,634 mm) in 2011.[105] The most rain recorded in one day occurred on July 28, 2013, when 8.02 in (204 mm) fell at Philadelphia International Airport.[105] Philadelphia has a moderately sunny climate with an average of 2,498 hours of sunshine annually, and a percentage of sunshine ranging from 47% in December to 61% in June, July, and August.[108]\n\n\nThe January daily average temperature is 33.7 °F (0.9 °C), though the temperature frequently rises to 50 °F (10 °C) during thaws. July averages 78.7 °F (25.9 °C), although heat waves accompanied by high humidity and heat indices are frequent, with highs reaching or exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) on 30 days of the year. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 6 thru April 2,[105] allowing a growing season of 217 days. Early fall and late winter are generally dry with February having the lowest average precipitation at 2.75 inches (70 mm).

Many smaller CSAs were also ranked higher for ozone including Sacramento (8th), Las Vegas (10th), Denver (11th), El Paso (16th), and Salt Lake City (20th); however, only two of those same ten CSAs—San Jose and Los Angeles—were ranked higher than Philadelphia for both year-round and short-term particle pollution.[117]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Chinese in Philadelphia; History of Irish Americans in Philadelphia; History of Italian Americans in Philadelphia; Koreans in Philadelphia; Little Saigon, Philadelphia; History of Jews in Philadelphia; LGBT culture in Philadelphia; and Puerto Ricans in Philadelphia\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1683 | 600 | —     |\n| 1731 | 12,000 | +1900.0% |\n| 1790 | 28,522 | +137.7% |\n| 1800 | 41,220 | +44.5% |\n| 1810 | 53,722 | +30.3% |\n| 1820 | 63,802 | +18.8% |\n| 1830 | 80,462 | +26.1% |\n| 1840 | 93,665 | +16.4% |\n| 1850 | 121,376 | +29.6% |\n| 1860 | 565,529 | +365.9% |\n| 1870 | 674,022 | +19.2% |\n| 1880 | 847,170 | +25.7% |\n| 1890 | 1,046,964 | +23.6% |\n| 1900 | 1,293,697 | +23.6% |\n| 1910 | 1,549,008 | +19.7% |\n| 1920 | 1,823,779 | +17.7% |\n| 1930 | 1,950,961 | +7.0% |\n| 1940 | 1,931,334 | −1.0% |\n| 1950 | 2,071,605 | +7.3% |\n| 1960 | 2,002,512 | −3.3% |\n| 1970 | 1,948,609 | −2.7% |\n| 1980 | 1,688,210 | −13.4% |\n| 1990 | 1,585,577 | −6.1% |\n| 2000 | 1,517,550 | −4.3% |\n| 2010 | 1,526,006 | +0.6% |\n| 2020 | 1,603,797 | +5.1% |\n| 2022 | 1,567,258 | −2.3% |\n| U.S. Decennial Census[118]2010–2020[12]Source: U.S. Decennial Census[119] |\n\n\nAccording to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau's tabulation, there were 1,603,797 people residing in Philadelphia, representing a 1.2% increase from the 2019 census estimate.[78] The racial composition of the city was 39.3% Black alone (42.0% Black alone or in combination), 36.3% White alone (41.9% White alone or in combination), 8.7% Asian alone, 0.4% American Indian and Alaska Native alone, 8.7% some other race, and 6.9% multiracial. 14.9% of residents were Hispanic or Latino. 34.8% had a bachelor's degree or higher. 23.9% spoke a language other than English at home, the most common of which was Spanish (10.8%). 15.0% of the populations foreign born, roughly half of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens. 3.7% of the population are veterans. The median household income was $52,889 and 22.8% of the population lived in poverty. 49.5% of the population drove alone to work, while 23.2% used public transit, 8.2% carpooled, 7.9% walked, and 7.0% worked from home. The average commute is 31 minutes.[120]\n\n\nAfter the 1950 census, when a record high of 2,071,605 was recorded, the city's population began a long decline. The population dropped to a low of 1,488,710 residents in 2006 before beginning to rise again. Between 2006 and 2017, Philadelphia added 92,153 residents. In 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the racial composition of the city was 41.3% Black (non-Hispanic), 34.9% White (non-Hispanic), 14.1% Hispanic or Latino, 7.1% Asian, 0.4% Native American, 0.05% Pacific Islander, and 2.8% multiracial.[121]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Census racial composition | 2020[120] | 2010[122] | 2000 | 1990[123] | 1980[123] | 1970[123] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Black or African American (non-Hispanic) | 38.3% | 42.2% | 42.6% | 39.3% | 37.5% | 33.3%[e] |\n| White (non-Hispanic) | 34.3% | 36.9% | 42.5% | 52.1% | 57.1% | 63.8[e] |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race) | 14.9% | 12.3% | 8.5% | 5.6% | 3.8% | 2.4%[e] |\n| Asian | 8.3% | 6.3% | 4.5% | 2.7% | 1.1% | 0.3%\n |\n| Pacific Islanders | 0.1% | <0.1% | <0.1% | <0.1%\n |\n| Native Americans | 0.4% | 0.5% | 0.3% | 0.2% | 0.1% | 0.1%\n |\n| Two or more races | 6.9% | 2.8% | 2.2% | n/a[124] | n/a | n/a\n |\n\n\n![](image)Ethnic origins in Philadelphia\n### Immigration and cultural diversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's famed Italian Market in South Philadelphia\n![](image)A Gayborhood street sign near Washington Square\nIn addition to the city's economic growth, the city's population has been fueled by foreign immigration. According to The Pew Charitable Trusts, the city's foreign-born population increased by 69% between 2000 and 2016 to constitute nearly 20% of Philadelphia's workforce,[125] and it doubled between 1990 and 2017 to constitute 13.8% of the city's total population, with the top five countries of origin being China by a significant margin followed by the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, India, and Vietnam.[126]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 10 countries of origin for foreign-born Philadelphians, 2017[127]\n| Country | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) China | 22,140\n |\n| ![](image) Dominican Republic | 13,792\n |\n| ![](image) Jamaica | 13,500\n |\n| ![](image) India | 11,382\n |\n| ![](image) Vietnam | 10,132\n |\n| ![](image) Haiti | 9,186\n |\n| ![](image) Mexico | 7,823\n |\n| ![](image) Ukraine | 6,898\n |\n| ![](image) Albania | 5,258\n |\n| ![](image) South Korea/![](image) North Korea | 4,385\n |\n\n\nIrish, Italian, German, Polish, English, Russian, Ukrainian, and French ancestries constitute the largest European ethnic groups in the city.[128] Philadelphia has the second-largest Irish and Italian populations in the United States after New York City. South Philadelphia remains one of the largest Italian neighborhoods in the country and is home to the Italian Market.\n\n\nThe Pennsport neighborhood and Gray's Ferry section of South Philadelphia, home to many Mummer clubs, are well known as Irish neighborhoods. The Kensington, Port Richmond, and Fishtown neighborhoods have historically been heavily Irish and Polish. Port Richmond is a center for the Polish-American community in Philadelphia, and it remains a common destination for Polish immigrants. Northeast Philadelphia, although known for its Irish and Irish-American population, is home to a Jewish and Russian population. Mount Airy in Northwest Philadelphia also contains a Jewish community. Nearby Chestnut Hill is historically known as an Anglo-Saxon Protestant community.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Black American population is the fourth-largest in the country after New York City, Chicago, and Houston. West Philadelphia and North Philadelphia are largely African-American neighborhoods, but many are leaving those areas in favor of the Northeast and Southwest sections of Philadelphia. A higher proportion of African-American Muslims reside in Philadelphia than most other major U.S. cities. West Philadelphia and Southwest Philadelphia are home to various Afro-Caribbean and African immigrant communities.[129]\n\n\nThe Puerto Rican population in Philadelphia is the second-largest on the U.S. mainland after New York City, and the second-fastest growing after Orlando.[130] Eastern North Philadelphia, particularly Fairhill and surrounding areas to the north and east, has one of the highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans outside Puerto Rico, with many large swaths of blocks being close to 100% Puerto Rican.[131][132] Puerto Rican and Dominican populations reside in North Philadelphia and the Northeast, and Mexican and Central American populations exist in South Philadelphia.[133] South American migrants were being transported by bus from Texas to Philadelphia beginning in 2022.[134]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Asian American population includes those of Chinese, Indians, Vietnamese, South Koreans, and Filipinos. Over 35,000 Chinese Americans lived in the city in 2015,[135] including a Fuzhounese population. Center City hosts a Chinatown that is served by Chinatown bus lines with service to/from Chinatown, Manhattan.[136] A Korean community initially settled in the North Philadelphia neighborhood of Olney; however, the primary Koreatown has subsequently shifted further north, straddling the city's border with adjacent Cheltenham in Montgomery County and Cherry Hill in South Jersey. South Philadelphia is home to Vietnamese-Americans in Little Saigon, as well as Cambodian Americans, Thai Americans, and Chinese communities.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's Gay village near Washington Square is home to a concentration of gay and lesbian-friendly businesses, restaurants, and bars.[137][138]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Philadelphia\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 68% of the population of the city identified themselves as Christian.[139] Approximately 41% of Christians in the city and area professed attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, while 26% professed Catholic beliefs.\n\n\nThe Protestant Christian community in Philadelphia is dominated by mainline Protestant denominations including the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church in the United States, Presbyterian Church (USA) and American Baptist Churches USA. One of the most prominent mainline Protestant jurisdictions is the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania. The African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in Philadelphia. Historically, the city has strong connections to the Quakers, Unitarian Universalism, and the Ethical Culture movement, all of which continue to be represented in the city. The Quaker Friends General Conference is based in Philadelphia. Evangelical Protestants making up less than 15% of the population were also prevalent. Evangelical Protestant bodies included the Anglican Church in North America, Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, Presbyterian Church in America, and National Baptist Convention of America.\nThe Catholic community is primarily served by the Latin Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia, and the Syro-Malankara Catholic Eparchy of the United States of America and Canada, though some independent Catholic churches exist throughout Philadelphia and its suburbs. The Latin Church-based jurisdiction is headquartered in the city, and its see is the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul. The Ukrainian Catholic jurisdiction is also headquartered in Philadelphia, and is seated at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.\n\n\nLess than 1% of Philadelphia's Christians were Mormons. The remainder of the Christian demographic is spread among smaller Protestant denominations and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox among others. The Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania (Orthodox Church in America) and Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America (Ecumenical Patriarchate) divide the Eastern Orthodox in Philadelphia. The Russian Orthodox St. Andrew's Cathedral is in the city.\nThe same study says that other religions collectively compose about 8% of the population, including Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, Buddhism, and Sikhism.[140] Philadelphia has the fifth-largest Muslim population among U.S. cities.[141] The remaining 24% claimed no religious affiliation.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metropolitan area's Jewish population was estimated at 206,000 in 2001, which was the sixth-largest in the U.S. at that time.[142] Jewish traders were operating in southeastern Pennsylvania long before William Penn. Furthermore, Jews in Philadelphia took a prominent part in the War of Independence. Although the majority of the early Jewish residents were of Portuguese or Spanish descent, some among them had emigrated from Germany and Poland. About the beginning of the 19th century, a number of Jews from the latter countries, finding the services of the Congregation Mickvé Israel unfamiliar to them, resolved to form a new congregation which would use the ritual to which they had been accustomed.\n\n\nAfrican diasporic religions are practiced in some Latino and Hispanic and Caribbean communities in North and West Philadelphia.[143][144]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], 79.12% (1,112,441) of Philadelphia residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 9.72% (136,688) spoke Spanish, 1.64% (23,075) Chinese, 0.89% (12,499) Vietnamese, 0.77% (10,885) Russian, 0.66% (9,240) French, 0.61% (8,639) other Asian languages, 0.58% (8,217) African languages, 0.56% (7,933) Cambodian (Mon-Khmer), and Italian was spoken as a main language by 0.55% (7,773) of the population over the age of five. In total, 20.88% (293,544) of Philadelphia's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[145]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Philadelphia\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Top publicly traded companiesheadquartered in Philadelphia** |\n| **Corporation** | **2019****rank** | **Revenue****(billions)** |\n| Comcast | 32 | 94.5\n |\n| Aramark | 198 | 15.8\n |\n| FMC | 556 | 4.7\n |\n| Urban Outfitters | 634 | 4.0\n |\n| Carpenter Technology | 940 | 2.2\n |\n| **Source:** *Fortune*[146] |\n\n\nPhiladelphia's close geographical and transportation connections to other large metropolitan economies along the Eastern Seaboard of the United States have been cited as offering a significant competitive advantage for business creation and entrepreneurship.[147] The city is the center of economic activity in both Pennsylvania and the four-state Delaware Valley metropolitan region. Five Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the city. As of 2021[update], the Philadelphia metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of US$479 billion,[148] an increase from the $445 billion calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis for 2017,[149] representing the ninth-largest U.S. metropolitan economy.\n\n\nPhiladelphia's economic sectors include financial services, health care, biotechnology, information technology, trade and transportation, manufacturing, oil refining, food processing, and tourism. Metropolitan Philadelphia is one of the top five American venture capital hubs, credited to its proximity to New York City's financial and tech and biotechnology ecosystems.[22] Financial activities account for the largest economic sector of the metropolitan area, which is also one of the largest health education and research centers in the United States. The city's two largest employers are the federal and city governments.

The city's major art museum, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, is one of the largest art museums in the world. The long flight of steps to the Art Museum's main entrance became famous after the film *Rocky* (1976).[176]\n\n\nAreas such as South Street and Old City have a vibrant night life. The Avenue of the Arts in Center City contains many restaurants and theaters, such as the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, home of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Academy of Music, home of Opera Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Ballet.[176] The Wilma Theatre and the Philadelphia Theatre Company at the Suzanne Roberts Theatre produce a variety of new plays.[177][178] Several blocks to the east are the Lantern Theater Company at St. Stephens Episcopal Church;[179] and the Walnut Street Theatre, a National Historic Landmark stated to be the oldest and most subscribed-to theatre in the English-speaking world, founded in 1809.[180] In May 2019, the Walnut Street Theatre announced a major expansion to begin in 2020.[181] New Freedom Theatre, which is Pennsylvania's oldest African-American theatre, sits on North Broad Street.\n\n\nPhiladelphia has more public art than any other American city.[182] In 1872, the Association for Public Art (formerly the Fairmount Park Art Association) was created as the first private association in the United States dedicated to integrating public art and urban planning.[183] In 1959, lobbying by the Artists Equity Association helped create the Percent for Art ordinance, the first for a U.S. city.[184] The program, which has funded more than 200 pieces of public art, is administered by the Philadelphia Office of Arts and Culture, the city's art agency.[185] The city also has more murals than any other American city, due to the 1984 creation of the Department of Recreation's Mural Arts Program, which seeks to beautify neighborhoods and provide an outlet for graffiti artists. The program has funded more than 2,800 murals by professional, staff and volunteer artists and educated more than 20,000 youth in underserved neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia.[186]\n\n\nThe city is home to a number of art organizations including the regional art advocacy nonprofit Philadelphia Tri-State Artists Equity,[187] the Philadelphia Sketch Club, one of the country's oldest artists' clubs,[188] and The Plastic Club, started by women excluded from the Sketch Club.[189] Many Old City art galleries stay open late on the First Friday event of each month.[190] Annual events include the Philadelphia Film Festival, held annually each October, the 6abc Dunkin' Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade, the nation's longest-running continuously held Thanksgiving Day parade, and the Mummers Parade, the nation's longest continuously held folk parade, which is held every New Year's Day.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Philadelphia\n\n![](image)The Curtis Institute of Music at 1726 Locust Street in Center City, one of the world's premier conservatories\nThe Philadelphia Orchestra is generally considered one of the top five orchestras in the United States. The orchestra performs at the Kimmel Center[191] and has a summer concert series at the Mann Center for the Performing Arts.[192] Opera Philadelphia performs at the nation's oldest continually operating opera house—the Academy of Music.[176] The Philadelphia Boys Choir & Chorale has performed its music all over the world.[193] The Philly Pops plays orchestral versions of popular jazz, swing, Broadway, and blues songs at the Kimmel Center and other venues within the mid-Atlantic region.[194] The Curtis Institute of Music is one of the world's premier conservatories and among the most selective institutes of higher education in the nation.[195]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has played a prominent role in the music of the United States. The culture of American popular music has been influenced by significant contributions of Philadelphia area musicians and producers, in both the recording and broadcasting industries. In 1952, the teen dance party program called *Bandstand* premiered on local television, hosted by Bob Horn. The show was renamed *American Bandstand* in 1957, when it began national syndication on ABC, hosted by Dick Clark and produced in Philadelphia until 1964 when it moved to Los Angeles.[196] Promoters marketed youthful musical artists known as teen idols to appeal to the young audience. Philadelphia-born singers such as Frankie Avalon, James Darren, Eddie Fisher, Fabian Forte, and Bobby Rydell, along with South Philly-raised Chubby Checker, topped the music charts, establishing a clean-cut rock and roll image.\n\n\nPhilly soul music of the late 1960s–1970s is a highly produced version of soul music which led to later forms of popular music such as disco and urban contemporary rhythm and blues.[197] On July 13, 1985, John F. Kennedy Stadium was the American venue for the Live Aid concert.[198] The city also hosted the Live 8 concert, which attracted about 700,000 people to the Benjamin Franklin Parkway on July 2, 2005.[199]\n\n\nNotable rock and pop musicians from Philadelphia and its suburbs include Bill Haley & His Comets, Nazz, Todd Rundgren, Hall & Oates, the Hooters, Cinderella, DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, Ween, Schoolly D, Pink, the Roots, Beanie Sigel, State Property, Lisa \"Left Eye\" Lopes, Meek Mill, Lil Uzi Vert, and others.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuisine of Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Pat's Steaks (foreground) and Geno's Steaks (background) in South Philadelphia\nThe city is known for its hoagies, stromboli, roast pork sandwich, scrapple, soft pretzels, water ice, Irish potato candy, tastykakes, and the cheesesteak sandwich which was developed by Italian immigrants.[200] The Philadelphia area has many establishments that serve cheesesteaks, including restaurants, taverns, delicatessens and pizza parlors.[201][202][203] The originator of the thinly-sliced steak sandwich in the 1930s, initially without cheese, is Pat's King of Steaks, which faces its rival Geno's Steaks, founded in 1966,[204] across the intersection of 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue in the Italian Market of South Philadelphia.[205]\n\n\nMcGillin's Olde Ale House, opened in 1860 on Drury Street in Center City, is the oldest continuously operated tavern in the city.[206] The City Tavern is a replica of a historic 18th-century building first opened in 1773, demolished in 1854 after a fire, and rebuilt in 1975 on the same site as part of Independence National Historical Park.[207] The tavern offers authentic 18th-century recipes, served in seven period dining rooms, three wine cellar rooms and an outdoor garden.[208]\n\n\nThe Reading Terminal Market is a historic food market founded in 1893 in the Reading Terminal building, a designated National Historic Landmark.

Additionally, it shares many similarities with the New York accent. Owing to over a century of linguistic data collected by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania under sociolinguist William Labov, the Philadelphia dialect has been one of the best-studied forms of American English.[211][212][f] The accent is especially found within the Irish American and Italian American working-class neighborhoods.[213] Philadelphia also has its own unique collection of neologisms and slang terms.[214]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Philadelphia 76ers, Philadelphia Flyers, Philadelphia Eagles, Philadelphia Phillies, and Philadelphia Union\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nCitizens Bank Park, home of the Phillies since 2004, and Lincoln Financial Field, home of the Eagles since 2003\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Eagles are presented with the Vince Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018\n![](image)Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia, home of the two-time Stanley Cup champion Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and three-time champion Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA)\n![](image)Historic Boathouse Row at night on the Schuylkill River, a symbol of the city's rich rowing history\nPhiladelphia's first professional sports team was baseball's Athletics, organized in 1860.[215] The Athletics were initially an amateur league team that turned professional in 1871, and then became a founding team of the current National League in 1876.[216] The city is one of 13 U.S. cities to have teams in all four major league sports: the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB), the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL), the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL), and the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA).[217] The Phillies, formed in 1883 as the Quakers and renamed in 1884,[218] are the oldest team continuously playing under the same name in the same city in the history of American professional sports.[219]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia metro area is also home to the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer (MLS). The Union began playing their home games in 2010 at PPL Park, a soccer-specific stadium in Chester, Pennsylvania.[220] The stadium's name was changed to Talen Energy Stadium in 2016[221] and to Subaru Park in 2020.[222]\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the second of eight American cities to have won titles in all four major leagues (MLB, NFL, NHL and NBA), and also has a title in soccer from the now-defunct North American Soccer League in the 1970s. The city's professional teams and their fans endured 25 years without a championship, from the 76ers 1983 NBA Finals win[223] until the Phillies 2008 World Series win.[224][225] The lack of championships was sometimes attributed in jest to the Curse of Billy Penn after One Liberty Place became the first building to surpass the height of the William Penn statue on top of City Hall's tower in 1987.[226] After nine years passed without another championship, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl following the 2017 season.[227] In 2004, ESPN placed Philadelphia second on its list of The Fifteen Most Tortured Sports Cities.[228][229] Fans of the Eagles and Phillies were singled out as the worst fans in the country by *GQ* magazine in 2011, which used the subtitle of \"Meanest Fans in America\" to summarize incidents of drunken behavior and a history of booing.[230][231]\n\n\nMajor professional sports teams that originated in Philadelphia but later moved to other cities include the Golden State Warriors basketball team, which played in Philadelphia from 1946 to 1962[232] and the Oakland Athletics baseball team, which was originally the Philadelphia Athletics and played in Philadelphia from 1901 to 1954.[233]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to professional, semi-professional, and elite amateur teams in cricket, rugby league (Philadelphia Fight), and rugby union. Major running events in the city include the Penn Relays (track and field), the Philadelphia Marathon, and the Broad Street Run. The Collegiate Rugby Championship is played every June at Talen Energy Stadium in Chester.[234]\n\n\nRowing has been popular in Philadelphia since the 18th century.[235] Boathouse Row is a symbol of Philadelphia's rich rowing history, and each Big Five member has its own boathouse.[236] Philadelphia hosts numerous local and collegiate rowing clubs and competitions, including the annual Dad Vail Regatta, which is the largest intercollegiate rowing event in North America with more than 100 U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities participating;[237] the annual Stotesbury Cup Regatta, which is billed as the world's oldest and largest rowing event for high school students;[238][239] and the Head of the Schuylkill Regatta.[240] The regattas are held on the Schuylkill River and organized by the Schuylkill Navy, an association of area rowing clubs that has produced numerous Olympic rowers.[241]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Spinners were a professional ultimate team in Major League Ultimate (MLU) until 2016. The Spinners were one of the original eight teams of the American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL) that began in 2012. They played at Franklin Field and won the inaugural AUDL championship and the final MLU championship in 2016.[242] The MLU was suspended indefinitely by its investors in December 2016.[243] As of 2018[update], the Philadelphia Phoenix continue to play in the AUDL.[244]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is home to the Philadelphia Big 5, a group of five NCAA Division I college basketball programs. The Big 5 include La Salle, Penn, Saint Joseph's, Temple, and Villanova universities.[245] The sixth NCAA Division I school in Philadelphia is Drexel University. Villanova won the 1985,[246] 2016,[247] and 2018[248] championship of the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

All county functions were assumed by the city in 1952.[252] The city has been coterminous with the county since 1854.[63]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 1952 Home Rule Charter was written by the City Charter Commission, which was created by the Pennsylvania General Assembly in an act of April 21, 1949, and a city ordinance of June 15, 1949. The existing city council received a proposed draft on February 14, 1951, and the electors approved it in an election held April 17, 1951.[253] The first elections under the new Home Rule Charter were held in November 1951, and the newly elected officials took office in January 1952.[252]\n\n\nThe city uses the strong-mayor version of the mayor–council form of government, which is led by one mayor in whom executive authority is vested. The mayor has the authority to appoint and dismiss members of all boards and commissions without the approval of the city council. Elected at-large, the mayor is limited to two consecutive four-year terms, but can run for the position again after an intervening term.[253]\n\n\n\n### Courts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: District Attorney of Philadelphia, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia County is coterminous with the First Judicial District of Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas is the trial court of general jurisdiction for the city, hearing felony-level criminal cases and civil suits above the minimum jurisdictional limit of $10,000. The court also has appellate jurisdiction over rulings from the Municipal and Traffic Courts, and some administrative agencies and boards. The trial division has 70 commissioned judges elected by the voters, along with about one thousand other employees.[254] The court also has a family division with 25 judges[255] and an orphans' court with three judges.[256]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city's District Attorney is Larry Krasner, a Democrat.[257] The last Republican to hold the office is Ronald D. Castille, who left in 1991 and later served as the Chief Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court from 2008 to 2014.[258]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Municipal Court handles traffic cases, misdemeanor and felony criminal cases with maximum incarceration of five years, and civil cases involving $12,000 or less ($15,000 in real estate and school tax cases), and all landlord-tenant disputes. The municipal court has 27 judges elected by the voters.[259]\n\n\nPennsylvania's three appellate courts also have sittings in Philadelphia. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the court of last resort in the state, regularly hears arguments in Philadelphia City Hall.[260] The Superior Court of Pennsylvania and the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania also sit in Philadelphia several times a year.[261][262] Judges for these courts are elected at large.[263] The state Supreme Court and Superior Court have deputy prothonotary offices in Philadelphia.[264][265]\n\n\nAdditionally, Philadelphia is home to the federal United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, both of which are housed in the James A.

Roosevelt in his landslide victory of 1932 as Pennsylvania was one of only six states won by Republican Herbert Hoover. Voter turnout surged from 600,000 in 1932 to nearly 900,000 in 1936 and Roosevelt carried Philadelphia with over 60% of the vote. The city has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1936. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama drew 83% of the city's vote. Obama's win was even greater in 2012, capturing 85% of the vote. In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton won 82% of the vote.[273]\n\n\nAs a result of the previously declining population in the city and state,[277] Philadelphia has only three congressional districts of the 18 districts in Pennsylvania, based on the 2010 census apportionment:[278] the 2nd district, represented by Brendan Boyle; the 3rd, represented by Dwight Evans; and the 5th, represented by Mary Gay Scanlon.[279] All three representatives are Democrats though Republicans still have some support in the city, primarily in the Northeast.[280] Sam Katz ran competitive mayoral races as the Republican nominee in 1999 and 2003, losing to Democrat John Street both times.[281][282]\n\n\nPennsylvania's longest-serving Senator, Arlen Specter,[283] was an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania who opened his first law practice in Philadelphia.[284] Specter served as a Republican from 1981 and as a Democrat from 2009, losing that party's primary in 2010 and leaving office in January 2011.[285] He had also been assistant counsel on the Warren Commission in 1964 and the city's district attorney from 1966 to 1974.[284]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has hosted various national conventions, including in 1848 (Whig), 1856 (Republican), 1872 (Republican), 1900 (Republican), 1936 (Democratic), 1940 (Republican), 1948 (Republican), 1948 (Progressive), 2000 (Republican), and 2016 (Democratic).[286] Philadelphia has been home to one vice president, George M. Dallas,[287] and one general of the American Civil War, George B. McClellan, who won his party's nomination for president but lost in the general election to Abraham Lincoln in 1864.[288] In May 2019, former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden chose Philadelphia to be his 2020 U.S. presidential campaign headquarters.[289]\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\n\"Green Cities, Clean Water\" is an environmental policy initiative based in Philadelphia that has shown promising results in mitigating the effects of climate change.[290] The researchers on the policy have stated that despite such promising plans of green infrastructure building, \"the city is forecasted to grow warmer, wetter, and more urbanized over the century, runoff and local temperatures will increase on average throughout the city\".[290] Even though landcover predictive models on the effects of the policy initiative have indicated that green infrastructure could be useful at decreasing the amount of runoff in the city over time, the city government would have to expand its current plans and \"consider the cobenefit of climate change adaptation when planning new projects'' in limiting the scope of city-wide temperature increase.[290]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Crime in Philadelphia and Philadelphia crime family\n\n#### Police and law enforcement[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Police Department\n\n![](image)The Philadelphia Police Department administration building, known as the Roundhouse, in Center City east of Chinatown\n![](image)A Philadelphia police cruiser on Benjamin Franklin Parkway\nAccording to a 2015 report by Pew Charitable Trusts, the police districts with the highest rates of violent crime were Frankford (15th district) and Kensington (24th district) in the Near Northeast, and districts to the North (22nd, 25th, and 35th districts), West (19th district) and Southwest (12th district) of Center City. Each of those seven districts recorded more than a thousand violent crimes in 2014. The lowest rates of violent crime occurred in Center City, South Philadelphia, the Far Northeast, and Roxborough districts, the latter of which includes Manayunk.[150]\n\n\nPhiladelphia had 500 (503 according to some sources) murders in 1990, a rate of 31.5 per 100,000. An average of about 400 murders occurred each year for most of the 1990s. The murder count dropped in 2002 to 288, then rose to 406 by 2006, before dropping slightly to 392 in 2007.[291][292] A few years later, Philadelphia began to see a rapid decline in homicides and violent crime. In 2013, the city had 246 murders, which is a decrease of nearly 40% since 2006.[293] In 2014, 248 homicides were committed. The homicide rate rose to 280 in 2015, then fell slightly to 277 in 2016, before rising again to 317 in 2017.[294] Homicides increased dramatically in the late 2010s/early 2020s, reaching 499 homicides in 2020[291] and surpassing the 1990 \"record\" in 2021, with 501st murder on November 27 and 510 by the end of the month.[295]\n\n\nIn 2006, Philadelphia's homicide rate of 27.7 per 100,000 people was the highest of the country's 10 most populous cities.[296] In 2012, Philadelphia had the fourth-highest homicide rate among the country's most populous cities. The rate dropped to 16 homicides per 100,000 residents by 2014 placing Philadelphia as the sixth-highest city in the country.[150]\n\n\nThe number of shootings in the city has declined significantly since the early years of the 21st century. Shooting incidents peaked at 1,857 in 2006 before declining nearly 44 percent to 1,047 shootings in 2014.[150] Major crimes have decreased gradually since a peak in 2006 when 85,498 major crimes were reported. The number of reported major crimes fell 11 percent in three years to 68,815 occurrences in 2014. Violent crimes, which include homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery, decreased 14 percent in three years to 15,771 occurrences in 2014.[150]\n\n\nIn 2014, Philadelphia enacted an ordinance decriminalizing the possession of less than 30 grams of marijuana or 8 grams of hashish; the ordinance gave police officers the discretion to treat possession of these amounts as a civil infraction punishable by a $25 ticket, rather than a crime.[297][298] Philadelphia was at the time the largest city to decriminalize the possession of marijuana.[298] From 2013 to 2018, marijuana arrests in the city dropped by more than 85%.[297] The purchase or sale of marijuana remains a criminal offense in Philadelphia.[298]\n\n\n\n#### Firefighting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Philadelphia Fire Department\n\nThe Philadelphia Fire Department provides fire protection and emergency medical services (EMS). The department's official mission is to protect public safety by quick and professional response to emergencies and the promotion of sound emergency prevention measures. This mandate encompasses all traditional firefighting functions, including fire suppression, with 60 engine companies and 30 ladder companies[299] as well as specialty and support units deployed throughout the city; specialized firefighting units for Philadelphia International Airport and the Port of Philadelphia; investigations conducted by the fire marshal's office to determine the origins of fires and develop preventive strategies; prevention programs to educate the public; and support services including research and planning, management of the fire communications center within the city's 911 system, and operation of the Philadelphia Fire Academy.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Media in Philadelphia\n\n### Newspapers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Inquirer Building at 400 North Broad Street was home of *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, the nation's third-longest continuously published newspaper, until 2012 when it moved its headquarters to Market Street. The building is currently undergoing renovations to become the new headquarters of the Philadelphia Police Department.\nPhiladelphia's two major daily newspapers are *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, first published in 1829—the third-oldest surviving daily newspaper in the country—and the *Philadelphia Daily News*, first published in 1925.[300] The *Daily News* has been published as an edition of the *Inquirer* since 2009.[301] Recent owners of the *Inquirer* and *Daily News* have included Knight Ridder, The McClatchy Company, and Philadelphia Media Holdings, with the latter organization declaring bankruptcy in 2010.[302] After two years of financial struggle, the newspapers were sold to Interstate General Media in 2012.[302] The two newspapers had a combined daily circulation of 306,831 and a Sunday circulation of 477,313 in 2013[update], the 18th-largest circulation in the country, and the website of the newspapers, Philly.com,[303] was ranked 13th in popularity among online U.S. newspapers by Alexa Internet that same year.[304]\n\n\nSmaller publications include the *Philadelphia Tribune* published five days each week for the African-American community;[305] *Philadelphia* magazine, a monthly regional magazine;[306] *Philadelphia Weekly*, a weekly alternative newspaper;[307] *Philadelphia Gay News*, a weekly newspaper for the LGBT community;[308] *The Jewish Exponent*, a weekly newspaper for the Jewish community;[309] *Al Día*, a weekly newspaper for the Latino community;[310] and *Philadelphia Metro*, a free daily newspaper.[311]\n\n\nStudent-run newspapers include the University of Pennsylvania's *The Daily Pennsylvanian*,[312] Temple University's *The Temple News*,[313] and Drexel University's *The Triangle*.[314]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nThe first experimental radio license was issued in Philadelphia in August 1912 to St. Joseph's College. The first commercial AM radio stations began broadcasting in 1922: first WIP, then owned by Gimbels department store, followed by WFIL, then owned by Strawbridge & Clothier department store, and WOO, a defunct station owned by Wanamaker's department store, as well as WCAU and WDAS.[315]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the FCC lists 28 FM and 11 AM stations for Philadelphia.[316][317] As of December 2017, the ten highest-rated stations in Philadelphia were adult contemporary WBEB-FM (101.1), sports talk WIP-FM (94.1), classic rock WMGK-FM (102.9), urban adult contemporary WDAS-FM (105.3), classic hits WOGL-FM (98.1), album-oriented rock WMMR-FM (93.3), country music WXTU-FM (92.5), all-news KYW-AM (1060), talk radio WHYY-FM (90.9), and urban adult contemporary WRNB-FM (100.3).[318][319] Philadelphia is served by three non-commercial public radio stations: WHYY-FM (NPR),[320] WRTI-FM (classical and jazz),[321] and WXPN-FM (adult alternative music).[322]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRadio stations in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, metropolitan area\n |\n| --- |\n| By AM frequency | * 560\n* 610\n* 640\n* 690\n* 740\n* 800\n* 860\n* 900\n* 950\n* 990\n* 10601\n* 1180\n* 12101\n* 1310\n* 1340\n* 1370\n* 1420\n* 1440\n* 1460\n* 1480\n* 1490\n* 1520\n* 1540\n* 1570\n* 1590\n* 1640\n* 1680\n |\n| By FM frequency | * 88.1\n\t+ WPEB\n\t+ WTHA\n\t+ WZZD\n* 88.3\n* 88.5\n* 88.7\n* 88.9\n\t+ WBYO\n\t+ WBZC\n* 89.1\n* 89.3\n\t+ WRDV\n\t+ WRTJ\n* 89.5\n* 89.7\n* 90.1\n* 90.9\n* 91.5\n\t+ WDBK\n\t+ WSRN-FM\n* 91.7\n\t+ WBMR\n\t+ WCUR\n\t+ WKDU\n\t+ WLBS\n* 92.5\n* 93.3\n* 93.7\n* 94.1\n* 94.5\n* 94.9\n* 95.7\n* 96.5\n* 97.5\n* 98.1\n* 98.9\n* 99.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.3\n* 101.1\n* 101.5\n* 102.1\n* 102.9\n* 103.9\n* 104.5\n* 105.3\n* 106.1\n* 106.9\n* 107.9\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| LPFM | * 92.9\n\t+ WGGT-LP\n\t+ WOOM-LP\n\t+ WRGU-LP\n\t+ WRLG-LP\n\t+ WZML-LP\n* 98.5\n\t+ WJYN-LP\n\t+ WNUW-LP\n\t+ WQEW-LP\n* 106.5\n |\n| Translators | * 92.9\n* 94.9\n* 95.1\n* 95.3\n* 96.1\n* 97.1\n\t+ W246AR\n\t+ W246AQ\n* 98.5\n* 99.9\n* 100.7\n* 102.5\n* 103.3\n* 103.5\n* 103.9\n* 104.1\n* 105.7\n\t+ W289AZ\n\t+ W289CZ\n* 107.3\n |\n\n |\n| NOAA Weather Radiofrequency | * 162.425\n* 162.475\n |\n| Digital radioby frequency & subchannel | * 1210\n* 88.5-1\n* 88.5-2\n* 89.3-1\n* 89.3-2\n* 89.5-1\n* 89.5-2\n* 90.1-1\n* 90.1-2\n* 90.9-1\n* 92.5-1\n* 92.5-2\n* 93.3-1\n* 93.3-2\n* 93.7-1\n* 93.7-2\n* 93.7-3\n* 94.1-1\n* 94.1-2\n* 94.1-3\n* 95.7-1\n* 95.7-2\n* 96.5-1\n* 96.5-2\n* 97.5-1\n* 97.5-2\n* 97.5-3\n* 98.1-1\n* 98.1-2\n* 98.1-3\n* 98.9-1\n* 99.5-1\n* 100.3-1\n* 100.3-2\n* 100.3-3\n* 101.1-1\n* 101.1-2\n* 101.5-1\n* 101.5-2\n* 102.1-1\n* 102.1-2\n* 102.1-3\n* 102.9-1\n* 102.9-2\n* 102.9-3\n* 104.5-1\n* 104.5-2\n* 105.3-1\n* 105.3-2\n* 106.1-1\n* 106.1-2\n* 106.9-1\n* 106.9-2\n* 106.9-3\n* 107.9-1\n* 107.9-2\n |\n| By call sign | * KIH28\n* KYW1\n* W225DJ\n* W235CE\n* W236CL\n* W237EH\n* W241CH\n* W246AR\n* W246AQ\n* W253CA\n* W260CZ\n* W264BH\n* W273DO\n* W277DL\n* W278AK\n* W280CP\n* W281CL\n* W289AZ\n* W289CZ\n* W297AD\n* WBCB\n* WBEB\n\t+ HD2\n* WBEN-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WBMR\n* WBYO\n* WBZC\n* WCHE\n* WCHR\n* WCOJ\n* WCUR\n* WDAS\n* WDAS-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WDBK\n* WEMG\n* WFIL\n* WFYL\n* WGGT-LP\n* WGLS-FM\n* WHAT\n* WHHS\n* WHYY\n* WIFI\n* WIOQ\n* WIP-FM\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WISP\n* WJFP\n* WJYN-LP\n* WKDN\n* WKDU\n* WKVP\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WKXW\n\t+ HD2\n* WLBS\n* WMGK\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WMMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WNG704\n* WNPV\n* WNTP\n* WNUW-LP\n* WNWR\n* WOGL\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WOOM-LP\n* WPAZ\n* WPEB\n* WPEN\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WPHE\n* WPHI-FM\n* WPHT1\n* WPNX700\n* WPPM-LP\n* WPPZ-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WPST\n* WPWA\n* WQEW-LP\n* WQHS\n* WRDV\n* WRFF\n\t+ HD2\n* WRGU-LP\n* WRLG-LP\n* WRNB\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WRSD\n* WRTI\n\t+ HD2\n* WRTJ\n\t+ HD2\n* WSRN-FM\n* WSTW\n\t+ HD2\n\t+ HD3\n* WTDY-FM\n\t+ HD2\n* WTEL\n* WTHA\n* WTMR\n* WTTM\n* WUMR\n\t+ HD2\n* WURD\n* WUSL\n* WVCW\n* WWDB\n* WWJZ\n* WWLU\n* WXPN\n\t+ HD2\n* WXTU\n\t+ HD2\n* WXVU\n* WYPA\n\t+ HD2\n* WZML-LP\n* WZXE\n* WZZD\n |\n| Internet | * WEXP\n* WQHS\n* WYBF\n |\n| Defunct | * WDNR (89.5 FM)\n* WEXP (1600 AM)\n* WJJZ (1460 AM)\n* WNAP (1110 AM)\n* WNJC (1360 AM)\n* WOO\n* WQHS\n* WYBF (89.1 FM)\n* WZZE (97.3 FM)\n |\n| Radio stations in the Delaware Valley\nPhiladelphia\nVineland-Millville-Bridgeton\nWilmington\n\nOther nearby regions\nAllentown-Bethlehem\nAtlantic City-Cape May\nDover\nLancaster\nReading\nTrenton\nSee also\nList of radio stations in Pennsylvania\n* Mass media in the Philadelphia Area\n\t+ Radio stations\n\t+ TV stations\n\t+ Newspapers\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nNotes\n1.

The station became NBC's first affiliate in 1939, and later became KYW-TV (currently a CBS affiliate). WCAU-TV, WFIL-TV, and WHYY-TV were all founded by the 1960s.[315] In 1952, WFIL (renamed WPVI) premiered the television show *Bandstand*, which later became the nationally broadcast *American Bandstand* hosted by Dick Clark.[323]\n\n\nEach commercial network has an affiliate in Philadelphia: KYW-TV 3 (CBS), WPVI-TV 6 (ABC), WCAU 10 (NBC), WPHL-TV 17 (The CW with MyNetworkTV on DT2), WFPA-CD 28 (UniMás), WTXF-TV 29 (Fox), WPSG 57 (Independent), WWSI 62 (Telemundo), and WUVP-DT 65 (Univision). The region is served also by public broadcasting stations WPPT-TV (Philadelphia), WHYY-TV (Wilmington, Delaware and Philadelphia), WLVT-TV (Lehigh Valley), and NJTV (New Jersey).[324]\n\n\nPhiladelphia has owned-and-operated stations for five major English-language broadcast networks: NBC – WCAU-TV, CBS – KYW-TV, ABC – WPVI-TV, Fox – WTXF-TV and The CW – WPHL-TV. The major Spanish-language networks are Univision – WUVP-DT, UniMás – WFPA-CD, and Telemundo – WWSI-TV.[324]\n\n\nAs of 2018[update], the city is the nation's fourth-largest consumer in media market, as ranked by the Nielsen Media Research firm, with nearly 2.9 million TV households.[325]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBroadcast television in the Delaware Valley region\n |\n| --- |\n| This region

Philadelphia\n\nSince at least the 1700s, hundreds of books and articles have been written about Philadelphia's history, culture, sports teams, crime, politics, and other themes related to the city's past, present, and future.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Philadelphia\n\nSee also: 30th Street Station, List of Philadelphia subway stations, and Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Philadelphia's 30th Street Station serves both SEPTA regional and Amtrak national trains and is Amtrak's third-busiest train station in the nation.\n![](image)A Market–Frankford Line train departing 52nd Street station\nPhiladelphia is served by SEPTA, which operates buses, trains, rapid transit (as both subways and elevated trains), trolleys, and trackless trolleys (electric buses) throughout Philadelphia, the four Pennsylvania suburban counties of Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery, in addition to service to Mercer County, New Jersey (Trenton) and New Castle County, Delaware (Wilmington and Newark, Delaware).[326] The city's subway system consists of two routes: the subway section of the Market–Frankford Line running east–west under Market Street which opened in 1905 to the west and 1908 to the east of City Hall,[327] and the Broad Street Line running north–south beneath Broad Street which opened in stages from 1928 to 1938.[328]\n\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, large sections of the SEPTA Regional Rail service to the far suburbs of Philadelphia were discontinued due to a lack of funding for equipment and infrastructure maintenance.[329][330][331]\n\n\nPhiladelphia's 30th Street Station is a major railroad station on Amtrak's Northeast Corridor with 4.4 million passengers in 2017 making it the third-busiest station in the country after New York City's Pennsylvania Station and Washington's Union Station.[332] 30th Street Station offers access to Amtrak,[333] SEPTA,[334] and NJ Transit lines.[335] Over 12 million SEPTA and NJ Transit rail commuters use the station each year, and more than 100,000 people on an average weekday.[332]\n\n\nThe PATCO Speedline provides rapid transit service to Camden, Collingswood, Westmont, Haddonfield, Woodcrest (Cherry Hill), Ashland (Voorhees), and Lindenwold, New Jersey, from stations on Locust Street between 16th and 15th, 13th and 12th, and 10th and 9th Streets, and on Market Street at 8th Street.[336]\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Philadelphia International Airport\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Philadelphia International Airport, the busiest airport in Pennsylvania and 21st-busiest in the nation\nTwo airports serve Philadelphia: the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is 7 mi (11 km) south-southwest of Center City on the boundary with Delaware County, providing scheduled domestic and international air service,[337] while Northeast Philadelphia Airport (PNE) is a general aviation relief airport in Northeast Philadelphia serving general and corporate aviation.[338] Philadelphia International Airport is among the busiest airports in the world measured by traffic movements (i.e., takeoffs and landings).[339] More than 30 million passengers pass through the airport annually on 25 airlines, including all major domestic carriers. The airport has nearly 500 daily departures to more than 120 destinations worldwide.[337] SEPTA's Airport Regional Rail Line provides direct service between Center City railroad stations and Philadelphia International Airport.[340]\n\n\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 9,650 feet (2,940 m) long Benjamin Franklin Bridge spans the Delaware River, connecting Philadelphia and South Jersey\n![](image)The Schuylkill Expressway eastbound at I-676 and US 30, also known as the Vine Street Expressway, in Center City\nWilliam Penn planned Philadelphia with numbered streets traversing north and south, and streets named for trees, such as Chestnut, Walnut, and Mulberry (since renamed Arch Street), traversing east and west. The two main streets were named Broad Street (the north–south artery, since designated Pennsylvania Route 611) and High Street (the east–west artery, since renamed Market Street) converging at Centre Square which later became the site of City Hall.[341]\n\n\nInterstate 95 (the Delaware Expressway) traverses the southern and eastern edges of the city along the Delaware River as the main north–south controlled-access highway, connecting Philadelphia with Newark, New Jersey and New York City to the north and with Baltimore and Washington, D.C. southward. The city is also served by Interstate 76 (the Schuylkill Expressway), which runs along the Schuylkill River, intersecting the Pennsylvania Turnpike at King of Prussia and providing access to Harrisburg and points west. Interstate 676 (the Vine Street Expressway) links I-95 and I-76 through Center City by running below street level between the eastbound and westbound lanes of Vine Street. Entrance and exit ramps for the Benjamin Franklin Bridge are near the eastern end of the expressway, just west of the I-95 interchange.[342]\n\n\nThe Roosevelt Boulevard and Expressway (U.S. 1) connect Northeast Philadelphia with Center City via I-76 through Fairmount Park. Woodhaven Road (Route 63) and Cottman Avenue (Route 73) serve the neighborhoods of Northeast Philadelphia, running between I-95 and the Roosevelt Boulevard. The Fort Washington Expressway (Route 309) extends north from the city's northern border, serving Montgomery County and Bucks County. U.S. Route 30 (Lancaster Avenue) extends westward from West Philadelphia to Lancaster.[342]\n\n\nInterstate 476 (locally referred to as the Blue Route[343]) traverses Delaware County, bypassing the city to the west and serving the city's western suburbs, and provides a direct route to Allentown and points north, including the Poconos. Interstate 276, the Pennsylvania Turnpike's Delaware River extension, is a bypass and commuter route to the north of the city and a link to the New Jersey Turnpike and New York City.[342]\n\n\nThe Delaware River Port Authority operates four bridges in the Philadelphia area across the Delaware River to New Jersey: the Walt Whitman Bridge (I-76), the Benjamin Franklin Bridge (I-676 and U.S. 30), the Betsy Ross Bridge (New Jersey Route 90), and the Commodore Barry Bridge (U.S. 322 in Delaware County, south of the city).[344] The Burlington County Bridge Commission maintains two bridges across the Delaware River: the Tacony–Palmyra Bridge which connects PA Route 73 in the Tacony section of Northeast Philadelphia with New Jersey Route 73 in Palmyra, Burlington County, and the Burlington–Bristol Bridge which connects NJ Route 413/U.S. Route 130 in Burlington, New Jersey with PA Route 413/U.S. 13 in Bristol Township, north of Philadelphia.[345]\n\n\n\n#### Bus service[edit]\n\n\nThe Greyhound terminal is at 1001 Filbert Street (at 10th Street) in Center City, southeast of the Pennsylvania Convention Center and south of Chinatown.[346] Several other bus operators provide service at the Greyhound terminal including Fullington Trailways,[347] Martz Trailways,[348] Peter Pan Bus Lines,[349] and NJ Transit buses.[350]\n\n\nOther intercity bus services include Megabus with stops at 30th Street Station and the visitor center for Independence Hall,[351] BoltBus (operated by Greyhound) at 30th Street Station,[352] OurBus at various stops in the city.\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of rail transport in Philadelphia\n\n![](image)Suburban Station with art deco architecture at 16th Street and JFK Boulevard\nSince the early days of rail transportation in the United States, Philadelphia has served as a hub for several major rail companies, particularly the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad first operated Broad Street Station, then 30th Street Station and Suburban Station, and the Reading Railroad operated Reading Terminal, now part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area. The two systems now operate as a single system under the control of SEPTA, the regional transit authority. Additionally, the PATCO Speedline subway system and NJ Transit's Atlantic City Line operate successor services to southern New Jersey.[353]\n\n\nIn 1911, Philadelphia had nearly 4,000 electric trolleys running on 86 lines.[354] In 2005, SEPTA reintroduced trolley service to the Girard Avenue Line, Route 15.[355] SEPTA operates six subway-surface trolleys that run on street-level tracks in West Philadelphia and subway tunnels in Center City, along with two surface trolleys in adjacent suburbs.[356]\n\n\nPhiladelphia is a regional hub of the federally-owned Amtrak system, with 30th Street Station being a primary stop on the Washington-Boston Northeast Corridor and the Keystone Corridor to Harrisburg and Pittsburgh. 30th Street also serves as a major station for services via the Pennsylvania Railroad's former Pennsylvania Main Line to Chicago. As of 2018[update], 30th Street is Amtrak's third-busiest station in the country, after New York City and Washington.[159]\n\n\n\n#### Walk Score ranks[edit]\n\n\nA 2017 study by Walk Score ranked Philadelphia the fifth-most walkable major city in the United States with a score of 79 out of 100, in the middle of the \"very walkable\" range. The city was just edged out by fourth place Miami (79.2), with the top three cities being New York, San Francisco, and Boston. Philadelphia placed fifth in the public transit friendly category, behind Washington, D.C., with the same three cities for walkability topping this category. The city ranked tenth in the bike friendly cities category, with the top three cities being Minneapolis, San Francisco and Portland.[357]\n\n\n*USA Today* readers voted the Schuylkill River Trail the best urban trail in the nation in 2015.[358]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n#### Water purity and availability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fairmount Water Works, Philadelphia's second municipal waterworks, in December 1984\nIn 1815, Philadelphia began sourcing its water via the Fairmount Water Works on the Schuylkill River, the nation's first major urban water supply system. In 1909, the Water Works was decommissioned as the city transitioned to modern sand filtration methods.[359] Today, the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) provides drinking water, wastewater collection, and stormwater services for Philadelphia, as well as surrounding counties. PWD draws about 57 percent of its drinking water from the Delaware River and the balance from the Schuylkill River.[360] The city has two filtration plants on the Schuylkill River and one on the Delaware River. The three plants can treat up to 546 million gallons of water per day, while the total storage capacity of the combined plant and distribution system exceeds one billion gallons. The wastewater system consists of three water pollution control plants, 21 pumping stations, and about 3,657 miles (5,885 km) of sewers.[360]\n\n\n\n#### Electricity[edit]\n\n\nExelon subsidiary PECO Energy Company, founded as the Brush Electric Light Company of Philadelphia in 1881 and renamed Philadelphia Electric Company (PECO) in 1902, provides electricity to about 1.6 million customers and more than 500,000 natural gas customers in the southeastern Pennsylvania area including the city of Philadelphia and most of its suburbs.[361] PECO is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state with 472 power substations and nearly 23,000 miles (37,000 km) of electric transmission and distribution lines, along with 12,000 miles (19,000 km) of natural gas transmission, distribution & service lines.[362]\n\n\n\n#### Natural gas[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Philadelphia Gas Works\n\nPhiladelphia Gas Works (PGW), overseen by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, is the nation's largest municipally-owned natural gas utility. PGW serves over 500,000 homes and businesses in the Philadelphia area.[363] Founded in 1836, the company came under city ownership in 1987 and has been providing the majority of gas distributed within city limits. In 2014, the City Council refused to conduct hearings on a $1.86 billion sale of PGW, part of a two-year effort that was proposed by the mayor. The refusal led to the prospective buyer terminating its offer.[364][365]\n\n\n\n#### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Area codes 215, 267, and 445\n\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania was assigned the 215 area code in 1947 when the North American Numbering Plan of the Bell System went into effect. The geographic area covered by the code was split nearly in half in 1994 when area code 610 was created, with the city and its northern suburbs retaining 215. Overlay area code 267 was added to the 215 service area in 1997, and 484 was added to the 610 area in 1999. A plan in 2001 to introduce a third overlay code to both service areas, area code 445 to 215 and area code 835 to 610, was delayed and later rescinded.[366] Area code 445 was implemented as an overlay for area codes 215 and 267 starting on February 3, 2018.[367]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Philadelphia\n\n## Sister cities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Chinatown paifang at 10th and Arch Streets, a symbol of Philadelphia's sister city relationship with Tianjin\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Florence[368] | Italy\n | 1964\n |\n| Tel Aviv[369] | Israel\n | 1966\n |\n| Toruń[370] | Poland\n | 1976\n |\n| Tianjin[371] | China\n | 1979\n |\n| Incheon[372] | South Korea\n | 1984\n |\n| Douala[373] | Cameroon\n | 1986\n |\n| Nizhny Novgorod[374] | Russia\n | 1992\n |\n| Frankfurt[375] | Germany\n | 2015\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia also has three partnership cities or regions:[376]\n\n\n\n\n\n| City\n | Country\n | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Kobe[377] | Japan\n | 1986\n |\n| Abruzzo[378] | Italy\n | 1997\n |\n| Aix-en-Provence[379] | France\n | 1999\n |\n\n\nPhiladelphia has eight official sister cities as designated by the Citizen Diplomacy International of Philadelphia:[376] Philadelphia has dedicated landmarks to its sister cities. The Sister Cities Park, a site of 0.5 acres (2,400 sq yd) at 18th and Benjamin Franklin Parkway within Logan Square, was dedicated in June 1976. The park was built to commemorate Philadelphia's first two sister city relationships, with Tel Aviv and Florence. The Toruń Triangle, honoring the sister city relationship with Toruń, Poland, was constructed in 1976, west of the United Way building at 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. Sister Cities Park was redesigned and reopened in 2012, featuring an interactive fountain honoring Philadelphia's sister and partnership cities, a café and visitor's center, children's play area, outdoor garden, and boat pond, as well as a pavilion built to environmentally friendly standards.[380][381]\n\n\nThe Chinatown Gate, erected in 1984 and crafted by artisans of Tianjin, stands astride 10th Street, on the north side of its intersection with Arch Street, as a symbol of the sister city relationship. The CDI of Philadelphia has participated in the U.S. Department of State's \"Partners for Peace\" project with Mosul, Iraq,[382] as well as accepting visiting delegations from dozens of other countries.[383]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![](image)World portal\n* ![](image)Philadelphia portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of Pennsylvania state historical markers in Philadelphia County\n* Metropolitan areas in the Americas\n* National Register of Historic Places listings in Philadelphia\n* USS *Philadelphia*, 6 ships\n* Alaşehir, ancient Philadelphia in Turkey\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Description of the Lenape peoples (Delaware nations) historic territories inside the divides of the frequently mountainous landforms flanking the Delaware River's drainage basin.

The February 2010 storms contributed to a single month record accumulation of 51.5 in (131 cm). If no snow fell outside of February that season, 2009–10 would still rank as 5th-snowiest. See the Franklin Institute for a visual representation of seasonal snowfall.\n3. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n4. **^** Official temperature and precipitation measurements for Philadelphia were taken at the Weather Bureau Office in downtown from January 1872 to 19 June 1940, and at Philadelphia Int'l from 20 June 1940 to the present.[111] Snowfall and snow depth records date to 1 January 1884 and 1 October 1948, respectively.[105] In 2006, snowfall measurements were moved to National Park, New Jersey directly across the Delaware River from the airport.[112]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** From 15% sample\n6. **^** E.g., in the opening chapter of *The Handbook of Language Variation and Change* (ed.
