His mother, Yinka Olatunji (née Atinuke), is from Islington, London.[7] He and his parents are from the Yoruba ethnic group. He was educated at Berkhamsted School in Berkhamsted, where he met future collaborator and Sidemen member Simon Minter.[8]\n\n\nKSI's younger brother, Deji Olatunji, is also a YouTuber and professional boxer. The brothers ranked first and second respectively as the \"UK's Most Influential YouTube Creators\" by *Tubular Labs* in 2015.[9][10]\n\n\n\n## YouTube career[edit]\n\n\n### 2008–2013: Beginnings and *FIFA* videos[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KSI shooting a video for his YouTube channel in 2012\nKSI registered his first account on YouTube under the username \"JideJunior\" in 2008 while in his early teens.[11] He registered his current YouTube account on 24 July 2009 under the name KSI Olajide BT, where he uploaded gaming–commentary videos of the *FIFA* video game series from his bedroom at his parents' house in Watford.[12][13] \"KSI\" stands for Knowledge Strength Integrity.[14]\n\n\nHe dropped out of sixth form college to pursue his YouTube career once he was earning steady monthly revenue from his uploads. In an interview in 2014, he recounted asking his teacher whether he should drop-out. His teacher asked how much KSI was making from YouTube, to which KSI answered, \"around £1,500 a month\", which was more than his teacher earned. His parents initially disapproved, but later became supportive and featured in a number of his videos.[12]\n\n\nKSI later uploaded more vlog-style content and played a variety of games and in 2012, the channel reached a million subscribers.[15][12]\n\n\nKSI's rise to fame was not without controversy, with him being widely criticised for his self-described 'rape-face', a recurring joke on his channel during 2012 and 2013.[12] He was the centre of a controversy following third-party allegations of sexual harassment of female staff at a *Eurogamer* event in 2012, that went so far as accusing him of sexually assaulting a spokesmodel Brandy Brewer, despite her tweeting that she consented to the motorboat, writing, \"it's called comedy……relax\".[16][17] As a result, Microsoft cut ties with KSI and he was banned from *Eurogamer* events.[18] KSI subsequently apologised \"for any offence the video of 15 months ago may have caused in the short time it was on his YouTube channel, references to it since and subsequently used by other people\" and stated his desire to move on from the incident and \"be judged on the great content and value he gives to brands and partners, without controversy.\"[19]\n\n\n\n### 2013–present: Sidemen and expanding content[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2013, KSI signed with Maker Studios' sub-network, Polaris.[20] Since 19 October 2013, KSI has been part of the British YouTube group known as the Sidemen.[21][22][23] The group produces online videos, most often consisting of challenges, sketches and video-game commentary, as well as selling exclusive Sidemen merchandise.[24][25][26]\n\n\nIn 2015, KSI published a biography titled *KSI: I Am a Bellend*.[27] The book was released on 24 September 2015 in the UK and five days later in the United States, and KSI toured to support the book from its release until 4 October 2015.[28]\n\n\nOn 4 August 2017, KSI tweeted that he would be leaving the Sidemen, citing conflicts with fellow member, Ethan Payne.[*citation needed*] Shortly thereafter, he released a number of diss track videos criticising members of his then-former group, to which most of the members responded back with their own.[29] Later that month, KSI released a video in which he claimed that he was being deported from the United States for receiving an incorrect visa.[*citation needed*] In November 2017, KSI released a video discussing whether his supposed falling out with the Sidemen was real or fake, saying, \"[the drama] wasn't entirely real but wasn't entirely fake either.\"[29]\n\n\nIn 2019, he was ranked second by *The Sunday Times* in its list of the top 100 UK influencers.[13] In 2020, *The Times* named KSI to be Britain's biggest influencer.[30]\n\n\nIn March 2021, KSI faced criticism for misgendering a trans person and using a transphobic slur in a Sidemen video. He later apologised, claiming not to have known that the word was offensive.[31][32] In April 2023, KSI used the racial slur \"*Paki* \" in a Sidemen video parodying the British game show *Countdown*. He later apologised on Twitter and announced he was taking a break from social media. The video has since been removed.[33] He then visited the Al-Hikam Institute, a mosque in Bradford, to \"educate himself\" and where he apologised again for the hurt and disappointment he had caused.[34]\n\n\nIn September 2023, *Forbes* ranked KSI as the second top creator of 2023, earning an estimated $24 million.[35]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2015–2016: Early releases[edit]\n\n\nHaving written and produced comedy–rap songs for his YouTube channel in 2011,[13] KSI released his debut single, \"Lamborghini\", featuring British grime MC P Money, on 23 March 2015, with Dcypha Productions.[36] The song charted at number 30 on the UK Singles Chart, and It dropped to number 68 and number 96 over the following two weeks, before dropping out of the top 100.[37]\n\n\n\"Keep Up\", the title song for KSI's debut extended play of the same name, featuring Jme, was released on 13 November 2015,[38] reaching number 45 on the UK Singles Chart.[37] The full EP was released on 8 January 2016, through Island Records, debuting at number 13 on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the UK R&B Albums Chart.[39][37][40]\n\n\nOn 29 April 2016, KSI released \"Goes Off\", featuring Mista Silva, as the first single from his second EP titled *Jump Around*.[41] The EP's second single, \"Friends with Benefits\", featuring MNDM, was released on 29 July 2016,[42][43] reaching number 69 on the UK Singles Chart.[37] The full EP was released on 28 October 2016 through Island Records.[44] One of the EP's songs, \"Touch Down\", featuring rapper and singer Stefflon Don, appeared on the soundtrack of the 2017 film *Baywatch*.[45]\n\n\n\n### 2017–2019: Independent releases[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KSI performing in 2019 on his *New Age* tour\nOn 23 June 2017, KSI independently released \"Creature\",[46] which reached number 100 on the UK Singles Chart.[37] \"Creature\" was the first single from KSI's third EP, *Space,* which was released independently on 30 June 2017.[47] On 6 October that year, KSI released his fourth EP, *Disstracktions,* which includes diss tracks against fellow Sidemen members W2S and Behzinga.[48] The EP reached number 31 on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the UK R&B Albums Chart.[37][49] One week before its release, KSI announced that the EP would be his \"final release\" with Island Records and that he would be releasing music independently.[50]\n\n\nOn 2 February 2018, KSI released \"Uncontrollable\", featuring Big Zuu.[51] The song played during KSI's ring walk for his boxing fight against Joe Weller[52] and charted at number 89 on the UK Singles Chart.[37] KSI released \"On Point\" on 17 August 2018,[53] which was played during his ring walk for his second boxing bout.[54]\n\n\nOn 12 April 2019, KSI released a collaborative album with Randolph titled *New Age*.[55] It debuted at number 17 on the UK Albums Chart and at number one on the UK R&B Albums Chart.[56][57]\n\n\n\n### 2019–2020: New record label signing and *Dissimulation*[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 November 2019, it was announced that KSI had signed with RBC Records and BMG to \"take [his] music to the next level\" and \"further develop his music career in the US and internationally\".

KSI later expressed regret and apologized for his actions, emphasizing his commitment to learning from mistakes.[121] In a closely contested affair that consisted of both boxers clinching excessively, KSI lost the fight and title via unanimous decision.[122] The result was originally announced as a majority decision, with judge Rafael Ramos' scorecard being incorrectly tallied to 57–57.[123] Following Fury's victory, an enraged KSI interrupted Fury's post fight interview in the ring and called his loss \"Outrageous\" and stated “That is a robbery bro. How many jabs did you land? Look at your face, look at your eyes. I’m the YouTuber, you are the boxer so you have to win?\" He further stated that he intends to appeal his loss.[1]\n\n\n\n### Misfits Boxing[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2022 and 2023 in Misfits Boxing\n\n![](image)The logo of Misfits Boxing\nOn 22 June 2021, KSI announced that he and Wasserman Boxing had partnered up to launch a boxing promotional company called 'Misfits Boxing'.[124][125] The first event was scheduled to take place on 27 August 2022 with KSI also set to make his boxing return as the main event.[126] A series of other boxing events titled \"MF & DAZN: X Series\" in collaboration with DAZN, who were the distributors for KSI's previous rematch against Logan Paul, was announced, along with events to follow, marking the KSI vs Swarmz and Luis Alcaraz Pineda event as MF & DAZN: X Series 001.[125]\n\n\nOn 10 January 2023, it was announced that Misfits Boxing and DAZN had signed a 5 year deal to continue distribute events with two pay-per-view each year.[127]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Laid in America\n\nIn 2016 KSI and Caspar Lee starred in the British direct-to-video comedy film *Laid in America.*[128] The film was written and directed by Sam Milman and Peter Vass, and was produced by The Fun Group LLC and Max Gottlieb.[129] The film was released direct-to-video by Universal Pictures on 26 September 2016.[130] Jason Best of *Movie Talk* gave the film 1 out of 5 and called it \"Crass and witless.\"[131]\n\n\nIn 2018 KSI released a documentary film titled *KSI: Can't Lose*.

His mother, Yinka Olatunji (née Atinuke), is from Islington, London.[7] He and his parents are from the Yoruba ethnic group. He was educated at Berkhamsted School in Berkhamsted, where he met future collaborator and Sidemen member Simon Minter.[8]\n\n\nKSI's younger brother, Deji Olatunji, is also a YouTuber and professional boxer. The brothers ranked first and second respectively as the \"UK's Most Influential YouTube Creators\" by *Tubular Labs* in 2015.[9][10]\n\n\n\n## YouTube career[edit]\n\n\n### 2008–2013: Beginnings and *FIFA* videos[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KSI shooting a video for his YouTube channel in 2012\nKSI registered his first account on YouTube under the username \"JideJunior\" in 2008 while in his early teens.[11] He registered his current YouTube account on 24 July 2009 under the name KSI Olajide BT, where he uploaded gaming–commentary videos of the *FIFA* video game series from his bedroom at his parents' house in Watford.[12][13] \"KSI\" stands for Knowledge Strength Integrity.[14]\n\n\nHe dropped out of sixth form college to pursue his YouTube career once he was earning steady monthly revenue from his uploads. In an interview in 2014, he recounted asking his teacher whether he should drop-out. His teacher asked how much KSI was making from YouTube, to which KSI answered, \"around £1,500 a month\", which was more than his teacher earned. His parents initially disapproved, but later became supportive and featured in a number of his videos.[12]\n\n\nKSI later uploaded more vlog-style content and played a variety of games and in 2012, the channel reached a million subscribers.[15][12]\n\n\nKSI's rise to fame was not without controversy, with him being widely criticised for his self-described 'rape-face', a recurring joke on his channel during 2012 and 2013.[12] He was the centre of a controversy following third-party allegations of sexual harassment of female staff at a *Eurogamer* event in 2012, that went so far as accusing him of sexually assaulting a spokesmodel Brandy Brewer, despite her tweeting that she consented to the motorboat, writing, \"it's called comedy……relax\".[16][17] As a result, Microsoft cut ties with KSI and he was banned from *Eurogamer* events.[18] KSI subsequently apologised \"for any offence the video of 15 months ago may have caused in the short time it was on his YouTube channel, references to it since and subsequently used by other people\" and stated his desire to move on from the incident and \"be judged on the great content and value he gives to brands and partners, without controversy.\"[19]\n\n\n\n### 2013–present: Sidemen and expanding content[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2013, KSI signed with Maker Studios' sub-network, Polaris.[20] Since 19 October 2013, KSI has been part of the British YouTube group known as the Sidemen.[21][22][23] The group produces online videos, most often consisting of challenges, sketches and video-game commentary, as well as selling exclusive Sidemen merchandise.[24][25][26]\n\n\nIn 2015, KSI published a biography titled *KSI: I Am a Bellend*.[27] The book was released on 24 September 2015 in the UK and five days later in the United States, and KSI toured to support the book from its release until 4 October 2015.[28]\n\n\nOn 4 August 2017, KSI tweeted that he would be leaving the Sidemen, citing conflicts with fellow member, Ethan Payne.[*citation needed*] Shortly thereafter, he released a number of diss track videos criticising members of his then-former group, to which most of the members responded back with their own.[29] Later that month, KSI released a video in which he claimed that he was being deported from the United States for receiving an incorrect visa.[*citation needed*] In November 2017, KSI released a video discussing whether his supposed falling out with the Sidemen was real or fake, saying, \"[the drama] wasn't entirely real but wasn't entirely fake either.\"[29]\n\n\nIn 2019, he was ranked second by *The Sunday Times* in its list of the top 100 UK influencers.[13] In 2020, *The Times* named KSI to be Britain's biggest influencer.[30]\n\n\nIn March 2021, KSI faced criticism for misgendering a trans person and using a transphobic slur in a Sidemen video. He later apologised, claiming not to have known that the word was offensive.[31][32] In April 2023, KSI used the racial slur \"*Paki* \" in a Sidemen video parodying the British game show *Countdown*. He later apologised on Twitter and announced he was taking a break from social media. The video has since been removed.[33] He then visited the Al-Hikam Institute, a mosque in Bradford, to \"educate himself\" and where he apologised again for the hurt and disappointment he had caused.[34]\n\n\nIn September 2023, *Forbes* ranked KSI as the second top creator of 2023, earning an estimated $24 million.[35]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2015–2016: Early releases[edit]\n\n\nHaving written and produced comedy–rap songs for his YouTube channel in 2011,[13] KSI released his debut single, \"Lamborghini\", featuring British grime MC P Money, on 23 March 2015, with Dcypha Productions.[36] The song charted at number 30 on the UK Singles Chart, and It dropped to number 68 and number 96 over the following two weeks, before dropping out of the top 100.[37]\n\n\n\"Keep Up\", the title song for KSI's debut extended play of the same name, featuring Jme, was released on 13 November 2015,[38] reaching number 45 on the UK Singles Chart.[37] The full EP was released on 8 January 2016, through Island Records, debuting at number 13 on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the UK R&B Albums Chart.[39][37][40]\n\n\nOn 29 April 2016, KSI released \"Goes Off\", featuring Mista Silva, as the first single from his second EP titled *Jump Around*.[41] The EP's second single, \"Friends with Benefits\", featuring MNDM, was released on 29 July 2016,[42][43] reaching number 69 on the UK Singles Chart.[37] The full EP was released on 28 October 2016 through Island Records.[44] One of the EP's songs, \"Touch Down\", featuring rapper and singer Stefflon Don, appeared on the soundtrack of the 2017 film *Baywatch*.[45]\n\n\n\n### 2017–2019: Independent releases[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KSI performing in 2019 on his *New Age* tour\nOn 23 June 2017, KSI independently released \"Creature\",[46] which reached number 100 on the UK Singles Chart.[37] \"Creature\" was the first single from KSI's third EP, *Space,* which was released independently on 30 June 2017.[47] On 6 October that year, KSI released his fourth EP, *Disstracktions,* which includes diss tracks against fellow Sidemen members W2S and Behzinga.[48] The EP reached number 31 on the UK Albums Chart and number one on the UK R&B Albums Chart.[37][49] One week before its release, KSI announced that the EP would be his \"final release\" with Island Records and that he would be releasing music independently.[50]\n\n\nOn 2 February 2018, KSI released \"Uncontrollable\", featuring Big Zuu.[51] The song played during KSI's ring walk for his boxing fight against Joe Weller[52] and charted at number 89 on the UK Singles Chart.[37] KSI released \"On Point\" on 17 August 2018,[53] which was played during his ring walk for his second boxing bout.[54]\n\n\nOn 12 April 2019, KSI released a collaborative album with Randolph titled *New Age*.[55] It debuted at number 17 on the UK Albums Chart and at number one on the UK R&B Albums Chart.[56][57]\n\n\n\n### 2019–2020: New record label signing and *Dissimulation*[edit]\n\n\nOn 4 November 2019, it was announced that KSI had signed with RBC Records and BMG to \"take [his] music to the next level\" and \"further develop his music career in the US and internationally\".

Following public disagreements on Twitter and diss-tracks between the pair, they announced that they would host an amateur boxing match on 3 February 2018 at Copper Box Arena, London, to settle the feud.

KSI later expressed regret and apologized for his actions, emphasizing his commitment to learning from mistakes.[121] In a closely contested affair that consisted of both boxers clinching excessively, KSI lost the fight and title via unanimous decision.[122] The result was originally announced as a majority decision, with judge Rafael Ramos' scorecard being incorrectly tallied to 57–57.[123] Following Fury's victory, an enraged KSI interrupted Fury's post fight interview in the ring and called his loss \"Outrageous\" and stated “That is a robbery bro. How many jabs did you land? Look at your face, look at your eyes. I’m the YouTuber, you are the boxer so you have to win?\" He further stated that he intends to appeal his loss.[1]\n\n\n\n### Misfits Boxing[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2022 and 2023 in Misfits Boxing\n\n![](image)The logo of Misfits Boxing\nOn 22 June 2021, KSI announced that he and Wasserman Boxing had partnered up to launch a boxing promotional company called 'Misfits Boxing'.[124][125] The first event was scheduled to take place on 27 August 2022 with KSI also set to make his boxing return as the main event.[126] A series of other boxing events titled \"MF & DAZN: X Series\" in collaboration with DAZN, who were the distributors for KSI's previous rematch against Logan Paul, was announced, along with events to follow, marking the KSI vs Swarmz and Luis Alcaraz Pineda event as MF & DAZN: X Series 001.[125]\n\n\nOn 10 January 2023, it was announced that Misfits Boxing and DAZN had signed a 5 year deal to continue distribute events with two pay-per-view each year.[127]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Laid in America\n\nIn 2016 KSI and Caspar Lee starred in the British direct-to-video comedy film *Laid in America.*[128] The film was written and directed by Sam Milman and Peter Vass, and was produced by The Fun Group LLC and Max Gottlieb.[129] The film was released direct-to-video by Universal Pictures on 26 September 2016.[130] Jason Best of *Movie Talk* gave the film 1 out of 5 and called it \"Crass and witless.\"[131]\n\n\nIn 2018 KSI released a documentary film titled *KSI: Can't Lose*. The film reveals the behind the scenes of what led KSI to become the YouTube champion of the world after his boxing debut fight against fellow YouTube star Joe Weller, and how KSI will use what he learned to fight Logan Paul.[132] The film was produced by fellow YouTuber Callux's film studio After Party Studios and was distributed by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.[133]\n\n\nKSI makes a brief appearance in the Amazon Original sports docuseries *All or Nothing: Arsenal*, which documented the club by spending time with the coaching staff and players behind the scenes both on and off the field throughout their 2021–22 season.[134]\n\n\nIn 2023 KSI released a documentary called *KSI: In Real Life* produced by Amazon Prime Video and Louis Theroux, focusing on KSI's life and career. Theroux stated that it would be \"an opportunity to see another side of JJ, understanding how he got where he is, the world of a premium online content creator today, and a man who has made it his brand never to lose, as he takes on the music business.\"[135]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016 KSI teamed up with Endemol Shine Group to publish KSI Unleashed, a video game that launched on iOS and Android systems.[136] KSI poked jabs at fellow YouTuber PewDiePie claiming that \"why would I make anyone have to spend money to buy my mobile app game.\" referring to the fact that PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist was not a free application.[137] KSI Unleashed was removed from the Google Play Store and App Store on an unknown date.\n\n\nIn 2018, KSI took part in the promotional efforts for EA Sports UFC 3 by training alongside former UFC middleweight world champion Michael Bisping.[138]\n\n\n\n### Prime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prime (drink)\n\nIn January 2022, KSI announced that he and Logan Paul had founded a drinks company known as Prime.[139] Prime is a range of sports drinks, drink mixes, and energy drinks created and marketed by Prime Hydration, LLC.[140]\n\n\n\n### WWE[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 April 2023, KSI made an appearance at WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania 39, during the match between Logan Paul and Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins. He accompanied Paul during his entrance wearing a Prime bottle costume and interfered in the match, but was frog splashed by Paul after Rollins quickly switched himself with KSI.[141]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKSI is a supporter of Arsenal F.C.[142] In his \"Googling Myself\" video, KSI revealed that he is agnostic.[143]\n\n\n\n### Income and wealth[edit]\n\n\nForbes reported that KSI was contracted to earn a minimum amount of $900,000 from his second fight against Logan Paul in 2019.[144]\n\n\nIn 2015, KSI's earnings were estimated by *Forbes* as being over $4.5 million, ranking him as the fifth-highest-paid YouTuber in the world at the time.[145]\n\n\nIn 2018, *Esquire* magazine reported that, according to Social Blade, KSI can make up to £250,000 in advertising revenue from one video and that product endorsements on his social media cost around £75,000.[146] Heavy reported in the same year that KSI was the director of three UK companies with equity totalling £1.7 million ($2.2 million).[147]\n\n\n*Business Insider* reported that KSI's amateur boxing match versus Logan Paul in 2018 generated around £8.5 million ($11 million) from pay-per-view revenue alone and a further live gate revenue of over £2.7 million ($3.5 million) from ticket sales.[148] Some estimates calculated the potential earnings from the fight at £30 million to £40 million each,[149] but KSI dismissed these claims, stating that his earnings were \"a high amount\", but \"nowhere near £40 million or £20 million\".[150][151]\n\n\nIn an interview with *Men's Health*, KSI confirmed that he also owns over ten properties \"all around England\" with a combined worth of over £10 million.[152][153]\n\n\nIn 2020, *The Sunday Times* estimated KSI's earnings to be £12 million a year; a year later, they believed that his estimated earnings had gone up by another £13 million.[154][155]\n\n\nHe has been open about his investments in cryptocurrency, but he has reportedly lost almost £6 million. Since the losses, he has claimed to be done with crypto.[156]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, KSI donated $10,000 to an online charity stream done by YouTuber Castro1021, and he participated in the Race Against Slime event, raising money for SpecialEffect, a foundation developing technology to aid people with physical disabilities to play video games.[147] Between 2016 and 2022, KSI and the rest of the Sidemen hosted and participated in four charity football events, raising just shy of £400,000 for various charities, including the Saint's Foundation, Childline, Young Minds and the Charlton Athletic Community Trust.[157]\n\n\nOn 8 May 2020, KSI helped out at a food bank to support *The Independent*'s Help the Hungry campaign.[158] On 18 December 2020, KSI prepared meals to support the *Evening Standard*'s Food for London Now campaign.[159] KSI donated £10,000 to BBC Radio 1's \"Lol-a-thon\" fundraiser for Comic Relief on 11 March 2021.[160] On 30 March 2021, it was announced that KSI had signed an open letter, written by Lenny Henry, to urge Black British people to take the COVID-19 vaccine.[161]\n\n\n\n## Boxing record[edit]\n\n\n### Professional[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 6 fights\n | 4 wins\n | 1 loss\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| By knockout\n | 3\n | 0\n |\n| By decision\n | 1\n | 1\n |\n| No contests\n | 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Result\n | Record\n | Opponent\n | Type\n | Round, time\n | Date\n | Location\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | Loss\n | 4–1 (1) | Tommy Fury | UD | 6\n | 14 Oct 2023 | Manchester Arena, Manchester, England | Lost MFB Cruiserweight Title  Originally scored MD win for Fury. |\n| 5\n | NC | 4–0 (1) | Joe Fournier | NC | 2 (6), 1:26 | 13 May 2023 | Wembley Arena, London, England | MF–Professional bout  Retained MFB cruiserweight title  Originally a KO win for KSI;

He is a member and co-founder of the Sidemen, a British YouTube group.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBarn is of Indian descent[3] and was born on 2 August 1995[4] in Guildford, Surrey, England,[5] where he lived until eight years of age.[6] He later lived in Sheffield where he attended Silverdale School.[7] He is the youngest of three children.[8] Barn was offered a place to study natural sciences at University College London, but he ended up declining the offer in order to pursue his YouTube career full-time.[9]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nBarn joined YouTube in 2010; having played games with his friends he got into watching YouTubers and making videos of their own. Eventually he decided to launch his own channel, stating:[10]\n\n\n\n\n> I got involved thinking I might be able to do a little bit better than they were doing, and get involved and have some fun with it. I started recording myself playing *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2*. I started making tutorial videos that people could watch – some of them were for knives and how you could throw them across the map. I made videos showing places where you could throw a knife or tomahawk and get a kill. I thought it would be cool to show off these ridiculous kills.\n> \n> \n\n\nAs his popularity increased, he began to take it more seriously, branching out into *Minecraft*.[10]\n\n\nIn 2013, he joined the Sidemen, which caused his popularity to rise further.[11] He would later move in with three other members, sharing a house with them from 2014 to 2018, when he announced he was moving out of the Sidemen House.[12][13] He is also part of the Dream SMP server.[14]\n\n\nIn January 2021, he announced on his channel that he was quitting playing *Call of Duty: Warzone* due to a proliferation of cheating,[15] saying hackers would be \"the death of the game\" if it went unfixed.[16] Along with criticism from several other high-profile streamers, the resulting uproar caused Activision to update the game's anti-cheat software.[17]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nBarn is an investor in esports teams and has spoken about how he has invested in London Royal Ravens, a *Call of Duty* team, speaking of his desire to 'build a blueprint' for the wider popularisation of the sport.[18]\n\n\nOn 28 September 2023, Barn released a single with Alan Walker and Dash Berlin titled \"Better Off (Alone, Pt. III)\" on digital platforms.[19]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Barn announced his engagement to his longtime girlfriend.[20] They got married in 2023.[21]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023\n | *KSI: In Real Life* | Himself\n | Documentary; Cameo\n |  |\n\n\n\n\nWeb roles\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *The Sidemen Experience* | Himself\n | Comedy Central UK | Main role; 5 episodes\n | [22] |\n| 2018\n | *The Sidemen Show* | YouTube Premium | Main role; 7 episodes\n | [23] |\n| 2020\n | *How To Be Behzinga* | YouTube | 1 episode\n | [24] |\n\n\n\n\nTelevision roles\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | *The Wheel* | Himself / Celebrity expert (Gaming)\n | BBC One | Series 1, episode 6\n | [25] |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Singles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Title\n | Year\n | Album\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \"Better Off (Alone, Pt.

He produces videos on gaming, football, comedy, and fitness, and is a co-founder and member of the British YouTube group Sidemen. In 2019, Payne was listed as the 31st most influential online creator in the United Kingdom by *The Sunday Times*.[5] As of September 2021[update], his main YouTube channel has over 4 million subscribers and 500 million video views.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nPayne was born on 20 June 1995 in London and was raised almost entirely by his mother Ruth, who battled with cancer during his childhood. His biological father left before he was born and his stepfather, whom he had met when he was six months old and believed was his actual father, left when he was thirteen, due to drug addiction and debt.[1][6] Payne attended Marshalls Park School,[7] and then studied video games development at South Essex College.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nPayne registered the \"Behzinga\" YouTube channel on 24 February 2012 while he was still in school.[3][8] He explained that the name comes from one of his favourite television series *The Big Bang Theory* in which Sheldon Cooper often uses the catchphrase \"Bazinga!\"; Payne altered the spelling.[1] His early content primarily featured video game commentaries of the *Call of Duty* and *FIFA* video game series.[8] Over time, his style of content diversified to include football, comedy, and fitness videos.[5][9][10]\n\n\nOn 19 October 2013, Payne and four other British YouTubers formed the entertainment collective Ultimate Sidemen, later shortened to simply Sidemen. Since 2014, the group has consisted of seven British YouTubers: Vikram Barn (Vikkstar123), Joshua Bradley (Zerkaa), Tobi Brown (TBJZL), Harry Lewis (W2S), Simon Minter (Miniminter), JJ Olatunji (KSI), and Payne.[11] The group produces online videos, most often consisting of challenges, sketches and video-game commentary, as well as selling exclusive Sidemen merchandise.[12][13]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Payne was listed as the 31st most influential online creator in the United Kingdom by *The Sunday Times*.[5] That November, he provided commentary for KSI vs. Logan Paul II for Sky Sports Box Office.[14]\n\n\nIn October 2020, he starred in the three-episode YouTube Originals documentary series *How to Be Behzinga* about his struggle with depression and his path towards running the London Marathon to raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust.[15][16] He revealed that he had previously been suffering from alcoholism and wanted to take his own life, but with support from his fellow Sidemen members, he was able to overcome his challenges. Also during a stretch of time between 2018 and 2019, he had lost 36 kilograms (79 lb).[16][17][18]\n\n\nHe has become an advocate for mental health and has talked about the importance of sharing feelings and breaking down the stigma surrounding mental illness in men.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nPayne is a supporter of West Ham United F.C.[8] He and his girlfriend, Faith Louisa Kelly, have a child together, born in September 2022.[21]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018\n | *KSI: Can't Lose* | Himself\n | Documentary | [22] |\n\n\n\n\nWeb roles\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *The Sidemen Experience* | Himself\n | Comedy Central UK | Main role; 5 episodes\n | [23] |\n| 2018\n | *The Sidemen Show* | YouTube Premium | Main role; 7 episodes\n | [24] |\n| 2020\n | *MOTDx* | BBC Three | Episode: \"05/11/2020\"\n | [25] |\n| *How to Be Behzinga* | YouTube | Lead role; 3 episodes\n | [26] |\n| *Hello 2021: UK* | YouTube | Guest\n | [27] |\n| 2021\n | *What Should I Watch?* | YouTube | Guest presenter\n | [28] |\n\n\n\n\nTelevision roles\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2020\n | *Fighting Fit* | Himself\n | Sky Sports | Episode: \"Behzinga\"\n | [29][30] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** The Sidemen (18 October 2016). *Sidemen: The Book*.
