It is also the language spoken at home by the great majority of the U.S. population (approximately 78.5%).[6] Many other languages are also spoken at home, especially Spanish (13.3% of the population), according to the American Community Survey (ACS) of the U.S. Census Bureau; these include indigenous languages originally spoken by Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and native populations in the U.S. unincorporated territories. Other languages were brought in by people from Europe, Africa, Asia, other parts of the Americas, and Oceania, including multiple dialects, creole languages, pidgin languages, and sign languages originating in what is now the United States. Interlingua, an international auxiliary language, was also created in the U.S.\n\n\nThe majority of foreign language speakers in the U.S. are bilingual or multilingual, and they commonly speak English. Although 21.7% of U.S. residents report that they speak a language other than English at home, only 8.2% speak English less than \"very well.\"[7] Approximately 430 languages are spoken or signed by the population, of which 177 are indigenous to the U.S. or its territories.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Most common languages[edit]\n\n\nBased on annual data from the American Community Survey, the United States Census Bureau regularly publishes information on the most common languages spoken at home. It also reports the English-speaking ability of people who speak a language other than English at home.[9] In 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau published information on the number of speakers of over 350 languages as surveyed by the ACS from 2009 to 2013,[10][11] but it does not regularly tabulate and report data for that many languages.\n\n\nAccording to the ACS, the most common languages spoken at home by people aged five years of age or older in the period from 2017 to 2021 were:[9]\n\n\n\n1. English – 245 million (78.5%)\n2. Spanish – 41.3 million (13.2%)\n3. Chinese (including Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien and all other varieties) – 3.40 million (1.1%)\n4. Tagalog (including Filipino) – 1.72 million (0.5%)\n5. Vietnamese – 1.52 million (0.5%)\n6. Arabic – 1.39 million\n7. French – 1.18 million\n8. Korean – 1.07 million\n9. Russian – 1.04 million\n10.

Persian (including Farsi, Dari and Tajik) – 472 thousand\n18. Telugu – 460 thousand\n19. Japanese – 455 thousand\n20. Gujarati – 437 thousand\n21. Bengali – 403 thousand\n22. Tamil – 341 thousand\n23. Punjabi – 319 thousand\n24. Tai–Kadai (including Thai and Lao) – 284 thousand\n25. Serbo-Croatian (including Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian) – 266 thousand\n26. Armenian – 256 thousand\n27. Greek – 253 thousand\n28. Hmong – 240 thousand\n29. Hebrew – 215 thousand\n30. Khmer – 193 thousand\n31. Navajo – 155 thousand\n32. other Indo-European languages – 662 thousand\n33. Yoruba, Twi, Igbo and other languages of West Africa – 640 thousand\n34. Amharic, Somali, and other Afro-Asiatic languages – 596 thousand\n35. Yiddish, Pennsylvania Dutch, and other West Germanic languages – 574 thousand\n36. Ilocano, Samoan, Hawaiian, and other Austronesian languages – 486 thousand\n37. Other languages of Asia – 460 thousand\n38. Nepali, Marathi, and other Indic languages – 448 thousand\n39. Ukrainian and other Slavic languages – 385 thousand\n40. Swahili and other languages of Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa – 288 thousand\n41. Malayalam, Kannada, and other other Dravidian languages – 280 thousand\n42. Other Native languages of North America – 169 thousand\n43. other and unspecified languages – 327 thousand\n\nThe ACS is not a full census but an annual sample-based survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The language statistics are based on responses to a three-part question asked about all members of a target U.S. household who are at least five years old. The first part asks if they \"speak a language other than English at home.\" If so, the head of the household or main respondent is asked to report which language each member speaks in the home, and how well each individual speaks English. It does not ask how well individuals speak any other language of the household. Thus, some respondents might have only limited speaking ability in those languages.[12] In addition, it is difficult to make historical comparisons of the numbers of speakers because language questions used by the U.S. Census changed numerous times before 1980.[13]\n\n\nThe ACS does not tabulate the number of people who report the use of American Sign Language at home, so such data must come from other sources. While modern estimates indicate that American Sign Language was signed by as many as 500,000 Americans in 1972 (the last official survey of sign language), estimates as recently as 2011 were closer to 100,000. Various cultural factors, such as the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, have resulted in far greater educational opportunities for hearing-impaired children, which could double or triple the number of current users of American Sign Language.\n\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of Americans aged 5+ speaking English at home in each Public Usage Microdata Area (PUMA) of the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico according to the 2016–2021 five-year American Community Survey\n\nEnglish is the most common language spoken in the United States with approximately 239 million speakers. Spanish is spoken by approximately 35 million people.[14] The United States has the world's fourth largest Spanish-speaking population, outnumbered only by Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina; other estimates[*which?*] put the United States at over 50 million, second only to Mexico. Throughout the Southwestern United States and Puerto Rico, long-established Spanish-speaking communities coexist with large numbers of more recent Hispanophone immigrants. Although many new Latin American immigrants are less than fluent in English, nearly all second-generation Hispanic Americans speak English fluently, while only about half still speak Spanish.[15]\n\n\nAccording to the 2000 U.S. Census, people of German ancestry made up the largest single ethnic group in the United States, but German language ranked fifth.[16][17] Italian, Polish, and French are still widely spoken among populations descending from immigrants from those countries in the early 20th century, but the use of these languages is dwindling as the older generations die. Russian is also spoken by immigrant populations.\n\n\nTagalog and Vietnamese have over one million speakers each in the United States, almost entirely within recent immigrant populations. Both languages, along with the varieties of Chinese (mostly Cantonese, Taishanese, and Standard Mandarin), Japanese, and Korean, are now used in elections in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Illinois, New York, Texas, and Washington.[18]\n\n\nNative American languages are spoken in smaller pockets of the country, but these populations are decreasing, and the languages are seldom widely used outside of reservations. Besides English, Spanish, French, German, Navajo and other Native American languages, all other languages are usually learned from immigrant ancestors that came after the time of independence or learned through some form of education.\n\n\nAmerican Sign Language is the most common sign language in the United States, although there are unrelated sign languages that have also been developed in the States and territories—mostly in the Pacific. No concrete numbers exist for signers but something upwards of 250,000 is common.\nThe most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate education, are Spanish, French, and German. Other commonly taught languages include Latin, Japanese, American Sign Language, Italian, and Chinese.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Official languages[edit]\n\n\n![Map of United States Official Language Status By State](image)Map of U.S. official language status by state. English declared the official language\n Multiple official languages, including English (Alaska, Hawaii, South Dakota), or languages with special status (New Mexico)\n No official language specified.\n\nThe United States has never had an official language at the federal level,[21] but English is typically used at the federal level and in states without an official language. Outside of Puerto Rico, English is the primary language used for legislation, regulations, executive orders, treaties, federal court rulings, and all other official pronouncements. Nonetheless, laws require documents such as ballots to be printed in multiple languages when there are large numbers of non-English speakers in an area.\n\n\nThirty-two states, in some cases as part of what has been called the English-only movement, have adopted legislation granting official status to English.[22][23][24] Typically only \"English\" is specified, not a particular variety like American English. (From 1923 to 1969, the state of Illinois recognized its official language as \"American\".)[25][26] Hawaiian, although having few native speakers, is an official language along with English of the state of Hawaii. Alaska has made some 20 native languages official, along with English;[27][28] for example, Alaska provides voting information in Iñupiaq, Central Yup'ik, Gwich'in, Siberian Yupik, and Koyukon among others.[29] On July 1, 2019, a law went into effect making Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota the official indigenous languages of South Dakota.[30]\nFrench is a *de facto*, but unofficial, language in Maine and Louisiana, while New Mexico law grants Spanish a special status. The government of Louisiana offers services and most documents in both English and French, and New Mexico does so in English and Spanish.\n\n\nEnglish is at least one of the official languages in all five permanently inhabited U.S. territories. In Puerto Rico both English and Spanish are official, although Spanish has been declared the principal official language. The school system and the government operate almost entirely in Spanish, but federal law requires the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to use English,[31] like the rest of the federal court system. Guam recognizes English and Chamorro. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, English is the only official language. In American Samoa, both English and Samoan are officially recognized; English is common but Samoan is also seen in some official communications. In the Northern Mariana Islands, English, Chamorro, and Carolinian are official.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn New Mexico, although the state constitution does not specify an official language, laws are published in English and Spanish, and government materials and services are legally required (by Act) to be made accessible to speakers of both languages as well as Navajo and various Pueblo languages. New Mexico also has its own dialect of Spanish, which differs from Spanish spoken in the rest of Latin America.\n\n\nAlgonquian, Cherokee, and Sioux are among many other Native American languages which are official or co-official on many U.S. Indian reservations and Pueblos. In Oklahoma before statehood in 1907, territory officials debated whether or not to have Cherokee, Choctaw, and Muscogee languages as co-official, but the idea never gained ground. Cherokee is officially recognized by the Cherokee Nation within the Cherokee tribal jurisdiction area in eastern Oklahoma.[32]\n\n\nAfter New Amsterdam (formerly a Dutch colony) was transferred to English administration (becoming the Province of New York) in the late 17th century, English supplanted Dutch as the official language. However, \"Dutch remained the primary language for many civil and ecclesiastical functions and most private affairs for the next century.\"[33] The Jersey Dutch dialect is now extinct.\n\n\nCalifornia has agreed to allow the publication of state documents in other languages to represent minority groups and immigrant communities. Languages such as Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Tagalog, Persian, Russian, Vietnamese, and Thai appear in official state documents, and the Department of Motor Vehicles publishes in nine languages.[34]\n\n\nThe issue of multilingualism also applies in the states of Arizona and Texas. While the constitution of Texas has no official language policy, Arizona passed a proposition in 2006 declaring English as the official language.[35] Nonetheless, Arizona law requires the distribution of voting ballots in Spanish, as well as indigenous languages such as Navajo, O'odham and Hopi, in counties where they are spoken.[36]\n\n\nA popular urban legend called the Muhlenberg legend claims that German was almost made an official language of the United States but lost by one vote. In reality, it was a request by a group of German immigrants to have an official translation of laws into German. House speaker Frederick Muhlenberg has since become associated with the legend.[37][38][39]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Place | English official | Other official language(s) | Note\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama | Yes | None | since 1990[40] |\n| Alaska | Yes | Inupiaq,Siberian Yupik,Central Alaskan Yup'ik,Alutiiq,Unangax,Dena'ina,Deg Xinag,Holikachuk,Koyukon,Upper Kuskokwim,Gwich'in,Tanana,Upper Tanana,Tanacross,Hän,Ahtna,Eyak,Tlingit,Haida,Tsimshian[41] | since 2015[41] |\n| Arizona | Yes | None | since 2006, 1988 law ruled unconstitutional[42] |\n| Arkansas | Yes | None | since 1987[40] |\n| California | Yes | None | since 1986 with Proposition 63.[40] Proposition 63 is unenforceable due to the lack of appropriate legislation,[43] and the Bilingual Services Act provides for the use of other languages in public outreach.[44] |\n| Colorado | Yes | None | since 1988;[40] from 1876–1990 the Colorado Constitution required laws to be published in English, Spanish, and German[45] |\n| Connecticut | No | None[40] |  |\n| Delaware | No | None[40] |  |\n| Florida | Yes | None | since 1988[40] |\n| Georgia | Yes | None | since 1996[40] |\n| Hawaii | Yes | Hawaiian | since 1978[40] |\n| Idaho | Yes | None | since 2007[40] |\n| Illinois | Yes | None | since 1969; \"American\" was the official language 1923–1969.[40] |\n| Indiana | Yes | None | since 1984[40] |\n| Iowa | Yes | None | since 2002[40] |\n| Kansas | Yes | None | since 2007[40] |\n| Kentucky | Yes | None | since 1984[40] |\n| Louisiana | No | None | French has had special status since 1968 founding of CODOFIL.[40][46] |\n| Maine | No | None[40] |  |\n| Maryland | No | None[40] |  |\n| Massachusetts | Yes | None[40] | since 2002; 1975 law ruled unconstitutional\n |\n| Michigan | No | None[40] |  |\n| Minnesota | No | None[40] |  |\n| Mississippi | Yes | None | since 1987[40] |\n| Missouri | Yes | None[40] | since 1998; state constitution amended accordingly in 2008[47] |\n| Montana | Yes | None | since 1995[40] |\n| Nebraska | Yes | None | since 1920[48] |\n| Nevada | No | None[40] |  |\n| New Hampshire | Yes | None | since 1995[40] |\n| New Jersey | No | None[40] |  |\n| New Mexico | No | None | Spanish has had special recognition since 1912 passage of state constitution.

In standard bilingual classes, the non-English language (typically Spanish or Chinese) is utilized over a period of time when students' English-language proficiency is lacking. Otherwise the medium of instruction at almost all U.S. schools, at all levels, is English. The exceptions are in language classes such as French or German, or in general education in the territory of Puerto Rico, where Spanish is standard. English is the language of instruction in the territory of American Samoa, despite most students speaking Samoan as their native language.[65]\n\n\nThere are also hundreds of language immersion and dual-language schools across the United States that teach in a variety of languages, including Spanish, Hawaiian, Chamorro, French, and Mandarin Chinese (for example, the Mandarin Immersion Magnet School in Texas). However, English is a mandatory class in all these schools.\n\n\n\n## African, Asian and European languages[edit]\n\n\n| Main languages spoken at home in the United States[66] |\n| --- |\n| Language |  | percent |\n| English |  | 78.1% |\n| Spanish |  | 13.5% |\n| Other Indo-European |  | 3.7% |\n| Asian and Pacific island |  | 3.6% |\n| Other  |  | 1.2% |\n\n![](image)\nA trash can in Seattle labeled in four languages: English, Chinese, Vietnamese (written as \"ràc\" instead of \"rác\"), and Spanish. *Basura* also exists as a loanword in Tagalog, spoken in the city.\n\nSome of the first European languages to be spoken in the U.S. were English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and Swedish.\n\n\nFrom the mid-19th century, the nation had large numbers of immigrants who spoke little or no English. The laws, constitutions, and legislative proceedings of some states and territories appeared in the languages of politically important immigrant groups. There have been bilingual schools and local newspapers in such languages as German, Ukrainian, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Greek, Polish, Swedish, Romanian, Czech, Japanese, Yiddish, Hebrew, Lithuanian, Welsh, Cantonese, Bulgarian, Dutch, Portuguese and others. These flourished despite English-only laws in some jurisdictions prohibiting church services, telephone conversations, and even conversations in the street or on railway platforms in a language other than English, up until the first of these laws was ruled unconstitutional in 1923 (*Meyer v. Nebraska*).\n\n\nTypically, immigrant languages tend to be lost through assimilation within two or three generations[*citation needed*].\n\n\nSeveral states and territories have native populations who spoke their own language prior to joining the United States, and have maintained their original languages for centuries. The languages include Alaskan Russian, Louisiana French, Pennsylvania Dutch, and Puerto Rican Spanish.\n\n\n\n## Historic languages[edit]\n\n\n### English (245 million speakers)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)English language distribution in the United States.\nMain articles: American English and List of dialects of English § United States\n\nEnglish was inherited from British colonization, and it is spoken by the majority of the population. English has become increasingly common; when the United States was founded, 40% of Americans spoke English[67][*better source needed*]. In 2002, 87% of Americans spoke English as their first language.[68][69] It serves as the de facto national language, the language in which government business is carried out. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 80% spoke only English at home and all but approximately 13,600,000 U.S. residents age 5 and over speak English \"well\" or \"very well\".[70]\n\n\nAmerican English is different from British English in terms of spelling (one example being the dropped \"u\" in words such as color/colour), grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and slang usage. The differences are not usually a barrier to effective communication between an American English and a British English speaker.\n\n\nSome states, like California, have amended their constitutions to make English the only official language, but in practice, this only means that official government documents must *at least* be in English, and *does not* mean that they should be exclusively available only in English. For example, the standard California Class C driver's license examination is available in 32 different languages.[71]\n\n\n\n### Spanish (41.3 million speakers)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Spanish language distribution in the United States.\nMain article: Spanish language in the United States\n\nSpanish was also inherited from colonization and is sanctioned as official in the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, where it is the general language of instruction in schools and universities. In the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all territories except Puerto Rico, Spanish is taught as a foreign or second language. It is spoken at home in areas with large Hispanic populations: the Southwestern United States along the border with Mexico, as well as in Florida, parts of California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York. In Hispanic communities across the country, bilingual signs in both Spanish and English may be quite common. Furthermore, numerous neighborhoods exist (such as Washington Heights in New York City or Little Havana in Miami) in which entire city blocks will have only Spanish-language signs and Spanish-speaking people.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish speakers in the United States\n| Year\n | Number of Spanish speakers\n | Percent ofUS population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980\n | 11 million\n | 5%\n |\n| 1990\n | 17.3 million\n | 7%\n |\n| 2000\n | 28.1 million\n | 10%\n |\n| 2010\n | 37 million\n | 13%\n |\n| 2012\n | 38.3 million\n | 13%\n |\n| 2015\n | 41 million\n | 14%\n |\n| Sources:[17][72][73][74] |\n\n\nYounger generations of non-Hispanics in the United States choose to study Spanish as a foreign or second language in far greater numbers than other second-language options. This might be due in part to the growing Hispanic population and the increasing popularity of Latin American movies and music performed in the Spanish language. A 2009 American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the United States Census Bureau, showed that Spanish was spoken at home by over 35 million people aged 5 or older,[75] making the United States the world's fifth-largest Spanish-speaking community, outnumbered only by Mexico, Colombia, Spain, and Argentina.[76][77] Since then, the number of persons reported on the ACS to speak Spanish at home has increased (see table).\n\n\n\n#### New Mexican Spanish[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Mexican Spanish\n\n![](image)The State of New Mexico.\nIn northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, Spanish speakers have been isolated for centuries in the southern Rockies, and developed a distinct dialect of Spanish spoken nowhere else: New Mexican Spanish. The dialect features a mix of Castilian, Galician and, more recently, Mexican Spanish, as well as Pueblo loan words. New Mexican Spanish also contains a large proportion of English loan words, particularly for technological words (e.g. *bos*, *troca*, and *telefón*).\n\n\nSpeakers of New Mexican Spanish are mainly descendants of Spanish colonists who arrived in New Mexico in the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries. During this time, contact with the rest of Spanish America was limited, and New Mexican Spanish developed on its own course. In the meantime, Spanish colonists coexisted with and intermarried with Puebloan peoples and Navajos. After the Mexican–American War, New Mexico and all its inhabitants came under the governance of the English-speaking United States, and for the next hundred years, English-speakers increased in number.\n\n\n\n#### Puerto Rican Spanish[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Puerto Rican Spanish\n\n![](image)The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\nPuerto Rican Spanish is the main language and dialect of the people of Puerto Rico, as well as many people descended from Puerto Ricans elsewhere throughout the United States.\n\n\n\n#### Spanglish[edit]\n\n\n**Spanglish** is a code-switching variant of Spanish and English and is spoken in areas with large bilingual populations of Spanish and English speakers, such as along the Mexico–United States border (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas), Florida, and New York City.\n\n\n\n### French (2.08 million speakers)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French language in the United States\n\n![](image)French language distribution in the United States.\nFrench, the fourth-most-common language (when all varieties of French are combined and separate yet related languages such as Haitian Creole are counted as French), is spoken mainly by the Louisiana Creole, native French, Cajun, Haitian, and French-Canadian populations. It is widely spoken in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and in Louisiana, with notable Francophone enclaves in St. Clair County, Michigan, many rural areas of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the northern San Francisco Bay area. [*citation needed*] Because of its legacy in Louisiana, that state is served by the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), the only state agency in the United States whose mission is to serve a linguistic population. In October 2018, Louisiana became the first U.S. state to join the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.[78]\n\n\nThree varieties of French developed within what is now the United States in colonial times including Louisiana French, Missouri French, and New England French (essentially a variant of Canadian French).[79] French is the second-most-spoken language in the states of Louisiana and Maine. The largest French-speaking communities in the United States reside in Northeast Maine; Hollywood and Miami, Florida; New York City;[*citation needed*] certain areas of rural Louisiana; and small minorities in Vermont and New Hampshire. Many of the New England communities are connected to the dialect found across the border in Quebec or New Brunswick. More than 13 million Americans possess primary French heritage, but only 2 million speak French, or any regional creoles and variations language at home. The largest concentration of French speakers in the country is in Louisiana.\n\n\n\n#### Louisiana French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Louisiana French and Louisiana Creole\n\n![](image)Cajun language distribution in the United States.\nLouisiana French (Cajun French: *français de la Louisiane*; Louisiana Creole: *françé la lwizyàn*) is an umbrella term for the dialects and varieties of the French language spoken traditionally in colonial Lower Louisiana. As of today Louisiana French is primarily used in the U.S. state of Louisiana, specifically in the southern parishes.\n\n\nFrench is spoken across ethnic and racial lines by Louisiana French people who may identify as Cajuns or Creoles as well as Chitimacha, Houma, Biloxi, Tunica, Choctaw, Acadians, and French Indian among others.[80][81] For these reasons, as well as the relatively small influence Acadian French has had on the region, the label Louisiana French or Louisiana Regional French (French: *français régional louisianais*) is generally regarded as more accurate and inclusive than \"Cajun French\" and is the preferred term by linguists and anthropologists.[82][83][84][85] However, \"Cajun French\" is commonly used in lay discourse by speakers of the language and other inhabitants of Louisiana.[86]\n\n\n\n### German (1.29 million speakers)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: German language in the United States\n\n![](image)German American states.\nGerman was a widely spoken language in some of the colonies, especially Pennsylvania, where a number of German-speaking Protestants and other religious minorities settled to escape persecution in Europe. Another wave of settlement occurred when Germans fleeing the failure of 19th Century German revolutions emigrated to the United States. A large number of these German immigrants settled in the urban areas, with neighborhoods in many cities being German-speaking and numerous local German language newspapers and periodicals established. German farmers also took up farming around the country, including the Texas Hill Country, at this time. The language was widely spoken until the United States entered World War I.\n\n\nIn the early twentieth century, German was the most widely studied foreign language in the United States, and prior to World War I, more than 6%[*citation needed*] of American schoolchildren received their primary education exclusively in German, though some of these Germans came from areas outside of Germany proper. Currently, more than 49 million Americans claim German ancestry, the largest self-described ethnic group in the U.S., but less than 4% of them speak a language other than English at home, according to the 2005 American Community Survey.[87] The Amish speak a dialect of German known as Pennsylvania Dutch. One reason for this decline of German language was the perception during both World Wars that speaking the language of the enemy was unpatriotic; foreign language instruction was banned in places during the First World War. Unlike earlier waves, they were more concentrated in cities and integrated quickly. Another reason for the decline in German was the lack of first-generation immigrants, as immigration to the United States from Western Europe slowed following the World Wars.\n\n\nWaves of colonial Palatines from the Rhenish Palatinate, one of the Holy Roman states, settled in the Province of New York and the Province of Pennsylvania. The first Palatines arrived in the late 1600s but the majority came throughout the 1700s; they were known collectively as the Palatine Dutch. The Pennsylvania Dutch settled other states, including Indiana and Ohio.[88][89] For many years, the term \"Palatine\" meant German American.[90]\n\n\nThere is a myth (known as the Muhlenberg Vote) that German was to be the official language of the U.S., but this is inaccurate and based on a failed early attempt to have government documents translated into German.[91] The myth also extends to German being the second official language of Pennsylvania; however, Pennsylvania has no official language. Although more than 49 million Americans claim they have German ancestors, only 1.24 million Americans speak German at home. Many of these people are either Amish and Mennonites or Germans having newly immigrated (e.g. for professional reasons).\n\n\n\n#### Pennsylvania Dutch[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pennsylvania Dutch language distribution in the United States.\nMain article: Pennsylvania Dutch language\n\nPennsylvania Dutch or Pennsylvania German is a dialect of Palatine German that is traditionally spoken by the Pennsylvania Dutch, and has settled the Midwest, in places such as Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states, where many of the speakers live today. It evolved from the German dialect of the Palatinate brought over to America by the Palatine Dutch in the 1700s. The Pennsylvania Dutch speak Pennsylvania Dutch, and adhere to different Christian denominations: Lutherans, German Reformed, Mennonites, Amish, German Baptist Brethren, Roman Catholics; today Pennsylvania Dutch is mainly spoken by Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites.\n\n\n\n#### Texas German[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The State of Texas\nMain article: Texas German\n\nTexas German is a group of High German dialects spoken by German Texans, descendants of German immigrants who settled in Texas in the mid-19th century.\n\n\n\n#### New York Yiddish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yiddish language distribution in the United States.\nYiddish has a much longer history in the United States than Hebrew.[92] It has been present since at least the late 19th century and continues to have roughly 148,000 speakers as of the 2009 American Community Survey. Though they came from varying geographic backgrounds and nuanced approaches to worship, immigrant Jews of Central Europe, Germany and Russia were often united under a common understanding of the Yiddish language once they settled in America, and at one point dozens of publications were available in most East Coast cities. Though it has declined by quite a bit since the end of WWII, it has by no means disappeared. Many Israeli immigrants and expatriates have at least some understanding of the language in addition to Hebrew, and many of the descendants of the great migration of Ashkenazi Jews of the past century pepper their mostly English vocabulary with some loan words. Furthermore, it is a lingua franca among American Jews (particularly Hasidic Jewry), concentrated in Los Angeles, Miami, and New York.[93] A significant diffusion of Yiddish loan words into the non-Jewish population continues to be a distinguishing feature of New York City English. Some of these words include glitch, chutzpah, mensch, kvetch, klutz, etc.\n\n\n\n### Russian (1.04 million speakers)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Russian language in the United States\n\n![](image)Russian language distribution in the United States.\nThe Russian language is spoken in areas of some states, including New York, California, Washington, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Alaska. It is especially spoken in immigrant neighborhoods of some cities: New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Seattle, Sacramento, Spokane, Miami, Vancouver, Washington, Portland, Oregon, and Woodburn, Oregon. The Russian-American Company owned most all of what became Alaska Territory until its sale right after the Crimean War. The presence of Russian speakers in the United States had always been limited, especially after the assassination of the Romanov dynasty of tsars. Starting in the 1970s and continuing until the mid-1990s, however, many Russian-speaking people from the Soviet Union and later its constituent republics such as Russia, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, and Uzbekistan have immigrated to the United States, increasing the use of Russian in the country.\n\n\nThe largest Russian-speaking neighborhoods in the United States are found in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island in New York City (specifically the Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn); parts of Los Angeles, particularly West Los Angeles and West Hollywood; parts of Philadelphia, particularly the Far Northeast; and parts of Miami like Sunny Isles Beach.\n\n\nThe Russian-language media group Slavic Voice of America, based in Dallas, Texas, serves Russian-speaking Americans.\n\n\n\n#### Alaskan Russian[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alaskan Russian\n\n![](image)The State of Alaska\nAlaskan Russian, known locally as Old Russian, is a dialect of Russian influenced by the Alutiiq language spoken by Alaskan Creoles. Most of its speakers live on Kodiak Island and in the Ninilchik (Kenai Peninsula). It has been isolated from other varieties of Russian for over a century.[94]\n\n\nKodiak Russian was natively spoken along the Afognak Strait until the Great Alaskan earthquake and tsunami of 1964. It has become moribund, spoken by only a handful of elderly people, and is virtually undocumented.[95]\n\n\nNinilchik Russian has been better studied and is more vibrant. It developed from the Russian colonial settlement of the village of Ninilchik in 1847.[96][97]\n\n\nNinilchik Russian vocabulary is clearly Russian, with a few borrowings from English and Alaskan native languages.\n\n\nIn Nikolaevsk, Alaska, 66.57% of the population still spoke Russian at home as late as 2017.[98]\n\n\n\n### Dutch (142 thousand speakers)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Distribution of U.S. households that speak Dutch at home in 2000\nThere has been a Dutch presence in America since 1602 when the government of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands chartered the Dutch East India Company (*Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie*, or VOC) with the mission of exploring for a passage to the Indies and claiming any uncharted territories for the Dutch republic. In 1664, English troops under the command of the Duke of York (later James II of England) attacked the New Netherland colony. Being greatly outnumbered, director general Peter Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam, with Fort Orange following soon. New Amsterdam was renamed New York, Fort Orange was renamed Fort Albany. Dutch city names can still be found in New York's neighbourhoods. Harlem is named after Haarlem, Staten Island is named after Staten Eiland, and Brooklyn is named after Breukelen.\n\n\nIn a 1990 demographic consensus, 3% of surveyed citizens claimed descent from Dutch settlers. Modern estimates place the Dutch American population (with total or partial Dutch heritage) at 3.1 million, or 0.93%,[99] lagging just a bit behind Norwegian Americans and Swedish Americans,[99] while 885,000[100] Americans claimed total Dutch heritage.\n\n\nAn estimated 141,580 people, or 0.0486%,[101] in the United States still speak the Dutch language at home as of 2013, in addition to 23,010 and 510 speakers of the closely related Afrikaans and West-Frisian.[101] They are concentrated mainly in California (23,500), Florida (10,900), Pennsylvania (9,900), Ohio (9,600), New York (8,700) and Michigan (6,600; i.e. almost entirely in the city of Holland).[102] In 2021, 95.3% of the total Dutch American population of 5 years and over only spoke English at home.[103]\n\n\nNot included among Dutch American speakers are the Pennsylvania Dutch, a group of mainly German Americans who settled in Pennsylvania in the colonial era and whose name is a derivation of the Pennsylvania Dutch endonym **Deitsch**, which means \"Pennsylvania Dutch\" or \"German\".[104][105][106][107]\n\n\n\n#### New York Dutch[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: New York Dutch and Jersey Dutch language\n\n![](image)New York Dutch language area\nA vernacular dialect of Dutch known as New York Dutch was spoken by the Holland Dutch of New York and New Jersey between the start of the 17th century to the mid-20th century. With the beginning of the 20th century, usage of the language became restricted to internal family circles, with an ever-growing number of people abandoning the language in favor of English. It suffered gradual decline throughout the 20th century, and it ultimately dissipated from casual usage.\n\n\nDutch was still spoken in many parts of New York at the time of the Revolution. For example, Alexander Hamilton's wife Eliza Hamilton attended a Dutch-language church during their marriage.\n\n\nAfrican-American abolitionist and women's rights activist Sojourner Truth (born \"Isabella Baumfree\") was a native speaker of Dutch.\n\n\nMartin Van Buren, the first President born in the United States following its independence, spoke Dutch as his native language, making him the only President whose first language was not English.\n\n\nNotable Dutch Americans include the Roosevelts (Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Eleanor Roosevelt), Marlon Brando, Thomas Alva Edison, Martin Van Buren and the Vanderbilts. The Roosevelts are direct descendants of Dutch settlers of the New Netherland colony in the 17th century.\n\n\n\n## Indigenous languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map showing language families of the US prior to European settlement.\n### Native American languages[edit]\n\n\nNative American languages predate European settlement of the New World. In a few parts of the U.S. (mostly on Indian reservations), they continue to be spoken fluently. Most of these languages are endangered, although there are efforts to revive them. Normally the fewer the speakers of a language the greater the degree of endangerment, but there are many small Native American language communities in the Southwest (Arizona and New Mexico) which continue to thrive despite their small size.\n\n\nIn 1929, speaking of indigenous Native American languages, linguist Edward Sapir observed:[108]\n\n\n\n\n> Few people realize that within the confines of the United States there is spoken today a far greater variety of languages ... than in the whole of Europe. We may go further. We may say, quite literally and safely, that in the state of California alone there are greater and more numerous linguistic extremes than can be illustrated in all the length and breadth of Europe.\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Navajo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Navajo language\n\nAccording to the 2000 Census and other language surveys, the largest Native American language-speaking community by far is the Navajo. Navajo is an Athabaskan language of the Na-Dené family, with 178,000 speakers, primarily in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Altogether, Navajo speakers make up more than 50% of all Native American language speakers in the United States. Western Apache, with 12,500 speakers, also mostly in Arizona, is closely related to Navajo but not mutually intelligible with it. Navajo and other Athabaskan languages in the Southwest are relative outliers; most other Athabascan languages are spoken in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. Navajo has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs on the Navajo Nation, including a Navajo language immersion school in Fort Defiance, Arizona.\n\n\n\n#### Cherokee[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cherokee language\n\n![](image)Cherokee language distribution of the United States\nCherokee is the Iroquoian language spoken by the Cherokee people, and the official language of the Cherokee Nation.[109] Significant numbers of Cherokee speakers of all ages[110] still populate the Qualla Boundary in Cherokee, North Carolina and several counties within the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, significantly Cherokee, Sequoyah, Mayes, Adair, and Delaware. Increasing numbers of Cherokee youth are renewing interest in the traditions, history, and language of their ancestors.[110] Cherokee-speaking communities stand at the forefront of language preservation, and at local schools, all lessons are taught in Cherokee and thus it serves as the medium of instruction from pre-school on up.[109] Also, church services and traditional ceremonial stomp dances are held in the language in Oklahoma and on the Qualla Boundary in North Carolina.[109]\n\n\nCherokee is one of the few, or perhaps the only, Native American language with an increasing population of speakers,[111] and along with Navajo it is the only indigenous American language with more than 50,000 speakers,[112] a figure most likely achieved through the tribe's 10-year long language preservation plan involving growing new speakers through immersion schools for children,[113][114] developing new words for modern phrases, teaching the language to non-Cherokees in schools and universities,[115] fostering the language among young adults so their children can use that language at home, developing iPhone and iPad apps for language education, the development of Cherokee language radio stations including Cherokee Voices, Cherokee Sounds,[116] and promoting the writing system through public signage, products like the Apple iPhone, internet use through Google including Gmail, and others so the language remains relevant in the 21st century.\n\n\n\n#### Other Native American languages[edit]\n\n\nDakota is a Siouan language with 18,000 speakers in the US alone (22,000 including speakers in Canada), not counting 6,000 speakers of the closely related Lakota. Most speakers live in the states of North Dakota and South Dakota. Other Siouan languages include the closely related Winnebago, and the more distant Crow, among others.\n\n\nCentral Alaskan Yup'ik is an Eskimo–Aleut language with 16,000 speakers, most of whom live in Alaska. The term \"Yupik\" is applied to its relatives, which are not necessarily mutually intelligible with Central Alaskan, including Naukan and Central Siberian, among others.\n\n\nThe O'odham language, spoken by the Pima and the Tohono O'odham, is a Uto-Aztecan language with more than 12,000 speakers, most of whom live in central and southern Arizona and northern Sonora. Other Uto-Aztecan languages include Hopi, Shoshone, and the Pai-Ute languages.\n\n\nChoctaw has 11,000 speakers. Choctaw is part of the Muskogean family, like Seminole and Alabama.\n\n\nThe Algonquian language family includes languages like Chippewa/Ojibwe, Cheyenne, and Cree.\n\n\nKeres has 11,000 speakers in New Mexico and is a language isolate. The Keres pueblo people are the largest of the Pueblo nations. The Keres pueblo of Acoma is the oldest continually inhabited community in the United States. Zuni, another isolate, has around 10,000 speakers, most of whom reside within the Zuni pueblo.\n\n\nBecause of immigration from Mexico, there are Mexican native American languages speakers in the US. There are thousands of Nahuatl, Mixtec, Zapotec and Trique speakers in communities established mainly in the southern states.\n\n\nAlthough the languages of the Americas have a history stretching back about 17,000 to 12,000 years, current knowledge of them is limited. There are doubtlessly a number of undocumented languages that were once spoken in the United States that are missing from historical record.\n\n\n\n#### List of Native American languages[edit]\n\n\nBelow is an estimate of Native American languages \"spoken at home\" in the United States (American Community Survey 2006–2008).[117] This is not an exhaustive list of Native American languages in the US. Because the distinction between dialect and language is not always clear, multiple dialects of varying mutual intelligibility may be classified as a single language, while a group of effectively identical dialects may be classified separately for historical or cultural reasons. Languages included here may be classified as \"extinct\" (having no living native speakers), but many extinct or moribund Native American languages are the subjects of ongoing language revitalization efforts; other extinct languages undergoing revitalization might not be listed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Language | Endonym[118] | Family | Speakers(% of total) | Does not speak English\"Very Well\"[119] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Total** | — | — | **444,124 (100)** | **19.22%** |\n| Total (excl.

known as Plains Indian Sign Language, Plains Standard or Plains Sign Talk, arose among the Native Americans of the plains. Each signing nation had a separate signed version of their oral language, that was used by the hearing, and these were not mutually intelligible. Plains Standard was used to communicate between these nations. It seems to have started in Texas and then spread north, through the Great Plains, as far as British Columbia. There are still a few users today, especially among the Crow, Cheyenne, and Arapaho. Unlike other sign languages developed by hearing people, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages. Through intergenerational transmission, Plains Sign Talk became a working language still in use today in some Deaf First Nations or Native American communities.\n\n\nAs Plains Sign Talk was so widespread and was a spectrum of dialects and accents, it probably hosted several languages under its umbrella. One is potentially Navajo Sign Language which is in use by a sole Navajo clan.\n\n\nAdditionally, Plateau Sign Language existed alongside Plains Sign Talk as either a trade pidgin or another language around the Columbia Plateau and surrounding regions.\n\n\n\n### Austronesian languages[edit]\n\n\n#### Hawaiian[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hawaiian language distribution in the United States.\nHawaiian is an official state language of Hawaii as prescribed in the Constitution of Hawaii. Hawaiian has 1,000 native speakers. Formerly considered critically endangered, Hawaiian is showing signs of language renaissance. The recent trend is based on new Hawaiian language immersion programs of the Hawaii State Department of Education and the University of Hawaii, as well as efforts by the Hawaii State Legislature and county governments to preserve Hawaiian place names. In 1993, about 8,000 could speak and understand it; today estimates range up to 27,000. Hawaiian is related to the Māori language spoken by around 150,000 New Zealanders and Cook Islanders as well as the Tahitian language which is spoken by another 120,000 people of Tahiti.\n\n\n\n#### Samoan[edit]\n\n\nSamoan is an official territorial language of American Samoa. Samoans make up 90% of the population, and most people are bilingual.\n\n\n\n#### Chamorro[edit]\n\n\nChamorro is co-official in the Mariana Islands, both in the territory of Guam and in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In Guam, the indigenous Chamorro people make up about 60% of the population.\n\n\n\n#### Carolinian[edit]\n\n\nCarolinian is also co-official in the Northern Marianas, where only 14% of people speak English at home.\n\n\n\n## Creole languages[edit]\n\n\nSeveral distinct natural languages and pidgins have developed on American soil, including full languages like creole and sign languages.\n\n\n\n### Angloromani[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Angloromani language\n\nAngloromani is an English creole or mixed language spoken by Romani Americans.[120]\n\n\n\n### Chinuk Wawa or Chinook Jargon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chinook Jargon\n\nA pidgin of 700–800 words of French, English, Cree and other Native origins is the old trade language of the Pacific Northwest. It was used extensively among both European and Native peoples of the Oregon Territory, even used instead of English at home by many pioneer families. It is estimated that around 100,000 people spoke it at its peak, between 1858 and 1900, and it was last widely used in Seattle just before World War II.[121]\n\n\n\n### Gullah[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gullah language\n\nAn English creole language with African influence spoken on the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia retains strong influences of West African languages. The language is sometimes referred to as \"Geechee\".\n\n\n\n### Hawaii Creole English[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hawaiian Pidgin\n\nThe Hawaiian English creole language, locally known as Hawaiian Pidgin, is used by locals and is considered an unofficial language of the state of Hawaii.[122]\n\n\n\n### Louisiana Creole French[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Louisiana Creole\n\nA French Creole language spoken by the Louisiana Creole people of the state of Louisiana, close to Haitian Creole, Colonial French, and Cajun French (language of Acadians deported from New France after 1755 and the Grand Dérangement).\nFrench Creole languages are spoken by millions of people worldwide, mainly in the United States, Caribbean, and Indian Ocean areas.\n\n\n\n### U.S. Virgin Islands Creole Dutch (extinct)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Negerhollands\n\n![](image)U.S. Virgin Islands\nNegerhollands ('Negro-Dutch') was a Dutch-based creole language that was spoken in the Danish West Indies, now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands. Dutch was its superstrate language with Danish, English, French, Spanish, and African elements incorporated. Notwithstanding its name, Negerhollands drew primarily from the Zeelandic rather than the Hollandic dialect of Dutch.[123]\n\n\n\n## Sign languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Attested historical ranges of sign languages of the US and Canada excluding ASL and LSQ.  \n |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Plains Sign Talk\n Inuiuuk (ᐃᓄᐃᐆᒃ)\n Hawai'i Sign Language\n Maritime Sign Language\n | *Plateau Sign Language*\n *Martha's Vineyard Sign Language*\n *Henniker Sign Language*\n *Sandy River Valley Sign Language*\n |\n\nSee also: Native American sign languages\n\nAlongside the numerous and varied oral languages, the United States also boasts several sign languages. Historically, the US was home to some six or more sign languages (that number rising with the probability that Plains Sign Talk is actually a language family with several languages under its umbrella) which has fallen with the death of several of these.\n\n\nAs with all sign languages around the world that developed organically, these are full languages distinct from any oral language. American Sign Language (unlike Signed English) is not a derivation of English.[124] Some languages present here were trade pidgins which were used first as a system of communication across national and linguistic boundaries of the Native Americans, however, they have since developed into mature languages as children learned them as a first language.\n\n\n\n### American Sign Language[edit]\n\n\n**American Sign Language** (ASL) is the native language of a number of deaf and hearing people in America (roughly 100,000 to 500,000). While some sources have stated that ASL is the third most frequently used language in the United States, after English and Spanish,[125] recent scholarship has pointed out that most of these estimates are based on numbers conflating deafness with ASL use, and that the last actual study of this (in 1972) seems to indicate an upper bound of 500,000 ASL speakers at the time.[126]\n\n\n\n* Black American Sign Language (BASL) developed in the southeastern US, where separate residential schools were maintained for white and black deaf children. BASL shares much of the same vocabulary and grammatical structure as ASL and is generally considered one of its dialects.[124][125][127]\n\n\n### Hawai'i Sign Language[edit]\n\n\n**Hawaii Sign Language** is moribund with only a handful of speakers on O'ahu, Lana'i, Kaua'i and possibly Ni'ihau. Some of these speakers may actually be speaking a creolized version of HSL and ASL, however; research is slow-going. The language was once called Hawai'i Pidgin Sign Language, as many people thought it was a derivative of ASL, but it was discovered to be a separate language altogether.[128]\n\n\n\n### Plains Sign Talk[edit]\n\n\nOnce a trade pidgin and the most far-reaching sign language in North America, **Plains Sign Talk** or **Plains Sign Language** is now critically endangered with an unknown number of speakers.\n\n\n\n* Navajo Sign Language has been found to be in use in one clan of Navajo; however, whether it is a dialect of Plains Sign Talk or a separate language remains unknown.[129]\n* Plateau Sign Language is another trade pidgin that may have become a separate language, **Plateau Sign Language** replaced Plains Sign Talk in the Columbia Plateau and surrounding regions of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It is now extinct.\n\n\n### Martha's Vineyard Sign Language[edit]\n\n\n**Martha's Vineyard Sign Language** is now extinct. Along with French Sign Language, it was one of several main contributors to American Sign Language.\n\n\n\n### Henniker Sign Language[edit]\n\n\n**Henniker Sign Language** is now extinct but was once found around the Henniker region of New Hampshire and formed a basis for American Sign Language.\n\n\n\n### Sandy River Valley Sign Language[edit]\n\n\n**Sandy River Valley Sign Language** is now extinct but once could be found around the Sandy River Valley in Maine. It was one of several main contributors to American Sign Language.\n\n\n\n## Immigrant languages[edit]\n\n\n### Arabic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arabic language in the United States\n\nVarieties of Arabic are spoken by immigrants from the Middle East as well as many Muslim Americans. The highest concentrations of native Arabic speakers reside in heavily urban areas like Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles. Detroit and the surrounding areas of Michigan boast a significant Arabic-speaking population including many Arab Christians of Lebanese, Syrian, and Palestinian descent.\n\n\nArabic is used for religious purposes by Muslim Americans and by some Arab Christians (notably Catholics of the Melkite and Maronite Churches as well as Rum Orthodox, i.e. Antiochian Orthodox Christians and Coptic churches.). A significant number of educated Arab professionals who immigrate often already know English quite well, as it is widely used in the Middle East. Lebanese immigrants also have a broader understanding of French as do many Arabic-speaking immigrants from North Africa. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Chinese[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chinese language and varieties in the United States\n\nThe population of Chinese speakers in the United States was increasing rapidly in the 20th century because the number of Chinese immigrants has increased at a rate of more than 50% since 1940.[130] 2.8 million Americans speak some variety of Chinese, which combined are counted by the federal census as the third most-spoken language in the country. Until the late 20th century, Yue dialects, including Taishanese and Cantonese, were the most common dialects among immigrants and the descendants of immigrants, especially in California. Since the opening of the People's Republic of China, Mandarin, the official language in the PRC and Republic of China (Taiwan), has become increasingly prevalent.[131] Many Americans of all ethnic backgrounds are also learning Mandarin and, to a far lesser extent, Cantonese.[131]\n\n\nIn New York City in 2002, Mandarin was spoken as a native language among only 10% of Chinese speakers but was predicted to replace Cantonese as the lingua franca among Chinese speakers.[132]\n\n\n\n### Czech[edit]\n\n\n#### Texas Czech[edit]\n\n\n12,805 Texans can speak the Czech language.[133]\n\n\nDrawing on Boas's model for interviewing speakers of the language and digitally cataloging the dialects, John Tomecek founded and Lida Cope of East Carolina University developed the Texas Czech Legacy Project at the University of Texas at Austin to document and preserve the dwindling language.[134][135][136]\nBecause the majority of Texas immigrants came from Moravia, the Czech spoken in Texas is largely characterized by Moravian dialects (Lachian and Moravian Wallachian) which vary to some extent from the Bohemian dialects spoken by most Czech-Americans. Czech-language journalism has been very active in the state over the years. Thirty-three newspapers and periodicals have been published. As of 1993 one weekly newspaper, *Našinec*, published at Granger, and one monthly, *Hospodář*, published at West, were still being published entirely in Czech. Other periodicals such as *Věstník* and the *Brethren Journal* contained sections printed in Czech.[137]\n\n\n\n### Finnish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Finnish language distribution in the United States.\nThe first Finnish settlers in America were amongst the settlers who came from Sweden and Finland to the New Sweden colony. Most colonists were Finnish. However, the Finnish language was not preserved as well among subsequent generations as Swedish.\n\n\nBetween the 1890s and the outbreak of the first World War, an estimated quarter million Finnish citizens immigrated to the United States, mainly in rural areas of the Midwest and more specifically in the mining regions of Northeastern Minnesota, Northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Hancock, Michigan, as of 2005, still incorporates bi-lingual street signs written in both English and Finnish.[138][139] Americans of Finnish origin yield at 800,000 individuals, though only 26,000 speak the language at home. There is a distinctive dialect of English to be found in the Upper Peninsula, known as Yooper. Yooper often has a Finnish cadence and uses Finnish sentence structure with modified English, German, Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish vocabulary.[*citation needed*]\nNotable Finnish Americans include U.S. Communist Party leader Gus Hall, film director Renny Harlin, and the Canadian-born actress Pamela Anderson.\n\n\nNorthern Clark County, Washington (encompassing Yacolt, Amboy, Battle Ground and Chelatchie) contains a large exclave of Old Apostolic Lutherans who originally immigrated from Finland. Many families in this portion of the county speak fluent Finnish at home before learning English.[*citation needed*] Another noteworthy Finnish community in the United States is found in Lake Worth, Florida, north of Miami.\n\n\n\n### Hebrew[edit]\n\n\nModern Hebrew is spoken by Israeli immigrants. Liturgical Hebrew is used as a religious or liturgical language[140] by many of the United States' approximately 7 million[141] Jews.\n\n\n\n### Gaelic Languages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Goidelic languages\n\nAbout 40 million Americans have Irish ancestry, many of whose ancestors would have spoken Irish Gaelic. In 2013, around 20,600 Americans spoke Irish at home and As of 2008[update] it was the 76th most spoken language in the United States.[142] An additional 1,600 spoke Scottish Gaelic.[143]\n\n\n\n### Italian, Sicilian and Neapolitan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian language in the United States\n\n![](image)Current distribution of the Italian language in the United States.\nThe Italian language and other Italo-Dalmatian languages have been widely spoken in the United States for more than one hundred years, primarily due to large-scale immigration from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century.\n\n\nIn addition to Italian learned by most people today, there has been a strong representation of the languages of Southern Italy amongst the immigrant population (Sicilian and Neapolitan in particular). As of 2009, though 15,638,348 American citizens report themselves as Italian-Americans, only 753,992 of these report speaking the Italian language at home (0.3264% of the US population).\n\n\n\n### Khmer (Cambodian)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambodian Americans\n\nBetween 1981 and 1985 about 150,000 Cambodians resettled in the United States.[144] Before 1975 very few Cambodians came to the United States. Those who did were children of upper-class families sent abroad to attend school. After the fall of Phnom Penh to the communist Khmer Rouge in 1975, some Cambodians managed to escape. In 2007 the American Community Survey reported that there were approximately 200,000 Cambodians living in the United States, making up about 2% percent of the Asian population. This population is, however, heavily concentrated in two areas: the Los Angeles metropolitan area in California, especially the city of Long Beach; and Greater Boston in New England, especially Lowell, Massachusetts. These two areas hold a majority of the Cambodians living in the US.\n\n\n\n### Korean[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Korean language\n\nIn 2011 over 1.1 million Americans spoke Korean at home. This number increased greatly at the end of the 20th century, increasing 327% from the 300,000 speakers in 1980. The greatest concentration of these speakers was in the Los Angeles, New York, and Washington D.C. metro areas.[145] Speakers of Korean are found in the Koreatowns.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Polish and Silesian[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2013, around 580,000 Americans spoke Polish at home.[143] The Polish language is very common in the Chicago metropolitan area. Chicago's third largest white ethnic groups are those of Polish descent, after German and Irish.[146] The Polish people and the Polish language in Chicago were very prevalent in the early years of the city, and today the 650,000 Poles in Chicago make up one of the largest ethnically Polish populations in the world, comparable to the city of Wrocław, the fourth largest city in Poland. That makes it one of the most important centers of Polonia and the Polish language in the United States, a fact that the city celebrates every Labor Day weekend at the Taste of Polonia Festival in Jefferson Park.[147]\n\n\n\n#### Texas Silesian[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Texas Silesian\n\nTexas Silesian, a dialect of the Silesian language (itself controversially considered a branch of Polish by some linguists), has been used by Texas Silesians in American settlements from 1852 to the present.\n\n\n\n### Portuguese[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Portuguese Americans, Brazilian Americans, and Cape Verdean Americans\n\nThe first Portuguese speakers in America were Portuguese Jews who had fled the Portuguese Inquisition. They spoke Judeo-Portuguese and founded the earliest Jewish communities in the Thirteen Colonies, two of which still exist: Congregation Shearith Israel in New York and Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia. However, by the end of the 18th century, their use of Portuguese had been replaced by English.\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, many Portuguese, mainly Azoreans, Madeirans and Cape Verdeans (who prior to independence in 1975 were Portuguese citizens), immigrated to the United States, settling in cities like Providence, Rhode Island, New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Santa Cruz, California. There was also a substantial Portuguese immigration to Hawaii, which at the time was not yet part of the United States.\n\n\nIn the mid-late 20th century there was another wave of Portuguese immigration to the US, mainly the Northeast (New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts), and for a time Portuguese became a major language in Newark, New Jersey. Many Portuguese Americans may include descendants of Portuguese settlers born in Portuguese Africa (known as Portuguese Africans, or, in Portugal, as *retornados*) and Asia (mostly Macau). There were around 1 million Portuguese Americans in the United States by 2000. Portuguese (European Portuguese) has been spoken in the United States by small communities of immigrants, mainly in the metropolitan New York City area, like Newark, New Jersey.\n\n\nThe Portuguese language is also spoken widely by Brazilian Americans, concentrated in Miami, New York City, and Boston.\n\n\n\n### Swedish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Swedish language distribution in the United States.\nThere has been a Swedish presence in America since the New Sweden colony came into existence in March 1638.\n\n\nWidespread diaspora of Swedish immigration did not occur until the latter half of the 19th century, bringing in a total of a million Swedes. No other country had a higher percentage of its people leave for the United States except Ireland and Norway. At the beginning of the 20th century, Minnesota had the highest ethnic Swedish population in the world after the city of Stockholm.\n\n\n3.7% of US residents claim descent from Scandinavian ancestors, amounting to roughly 11–12 million people. According to SIL's Ethnologue, over half a million ethnic Swedes still speak the language, though according to the 2007 American Community Survey only 56,715 speak it at home. Cultural assimilation has contributed to the gradual and steady decline of the language in the US. After the independence of the US from the Kingdom of Great Britain, the government encouraged colonists to adopt the English language as a common medium of communication, and in some cases, imposed it upon them. Subsequent generations of Swedish Americans received education in English and spoke it as their first language. Lutheran churches scattered across the Midwest started abandoning Swedish in favor of English as their language of worship. Swedish newspapers and publications alike slowly faded away.\n\n\nThere are sizable Swedish communities in Minnesota, Ohio, Maryland, Philadelphia, and Delaware, along with small isolated pockets in Pennsylvania, San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, and New York. Chicago once contained a large Swedish enclave called Andersonville on the city's north side.\n\n\nJohn Morton, the person who cast the decisive vote leading to Pennsylvania's support for the United States Declaration of Independence, was of Finnish descent. Finland was part of the Kingdom of Sweden in the 18th century.\n\n\n\n### Walloon[edit]\n\n\n#### Wisconsin Walloon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wisconsin Walloon\n\nWisconsin Walloon is a dialect of the Walloon language descendant from central Walloon. It is spoken in the Door Peninsula in Wisconsin, United States.[148]\n\n\nThe speakers of Wisconsin Walloon are descendants of the Belgian immigrants that came from the wave of immigration lasting from 1853 to 1857 that was recorded to have brought around 2,000 Belgians to Wisconsin.[149] It is sometimes referred to by its speakers in English as \"Belgian\".[150] Descendants of native Walloon speakers have since switched to English, and as of 2021, it has fewer than 50 speakers.[148]\n\n\n\n### Welsh[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Welsh language\n\n![](image)Welsh language distribution in the United States.\nUp to two million Americans are thought to have Welsh ancestry. However, there is very little Welsh being used commonly in the United States. According to the 2007 American Community Survey, 2,285 people speak Welsh at home; primarily spoken in California (415), Florida (225), New York (204), Ohio (135), and New Jersey (130).[151] Some place names, such as Bryn Mawr in Chicago and Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania (English: Big Hill) are Welsh. Several towns in Pennsylvania, mostly in the Welsh Tract, have Welsh namesakes, including Uwchlan, Bala Cynwyd, Gwynedd, and Tredyffrin.\n\n\n\n### Tagalog[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Distribution of U.S. households that speak Tagalog at home\nTagalog speakers were already present in the United States as early as the late sixteenth century as sailors contracted by the Spanish colonial government. In the eighteenth century, they established settlements in Louisiana, such as Saint Malo. After the American annexation of the Philippines, the number of Tagalog speakers steadily increased, as Filipinos began to migrate to the U.S. as students or contract laborers. Their numbers, however, decreased upon Philippine independence, as some Filipinos were repatriated.\n\n\nToday, Tagalog, together with its standardized form Filipino, is spoken by over a million and a half Filipino Americans and is promoted by Filipino American civic organizations and Philippine consulates. As Filipinos are the second largest Asian ethnic group in the United States, Tagalog is the second most spoken Asian language in the country, after Chinese. Taglish, a form of code-switching between Tagalog and English, is also spoken by a number of Filipino Americans.\n\n\nTagalog is also taught at some universities where a significant number of Filipinos exist. As it is the national and most spoken language of the Philippines, most Filipinos in the United States are proficient in Tagalog in addition to their local regional language.\n\n\n\n### Vietnamese[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vietnamese language in the United States\n\n![](image)Vietnamese language distribution in the United States\nAccording to the 2010 Census, there are over 1.5 million Americans who identify themselves as Vietnamese in origin, ranking fourth among the Asian American groups and forming the largest Overseas Vietnamese population.\n\n\nOrange County, California, is home to the largest concentration of ethnic Vietnamese outside Vietnam, especially in its Little Saigon area. Other significant Vietnamese communities are found in the metropolitan areas of San Jose, Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Seattle, Northern Virginia, and New Orleans. Similarly to other overseas Vietnamese communities in Western countries (except France), the Vietnamese population in the United States was established following the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and communist takeover of South Vietnam following the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\n### South Asian languages[edit]\n\n\nThere are many South Asians in the United States. These include Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis, who speak various South Asian languages. Major South Asian languages spoken in the US include Telugu (see \"Telugu\" below), Malayalam, Kannada, Tamil (see \"Tamil\" below), Gujarati, Hindi and Urdu (see 'Hindi-Urdu\" below), Bengali, Punjabi, Sinhala, Nepali (see \"Nepali\" below), and Marathi.\n\n\n\n#### Hindi and Urdu[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hindustani language\n\nHindi and Urdu are the two standard registers of the Hindustani language, an Indo-Aryan language native to North India, Central India, and Pakistan. While the formal registers draw vocabulary from Sanskrit and Arabic & Persian respectively, the colloquial forms are indistinguishable. Hindi and Urdu are widely spoken among the Hindustanis and Pakistani communities in the United States as a first or second language. Speakers are concentrated in states with large South Asian populations, including California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Virginia.[152]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hindi-Urdu (Hindustani) is a cultural language for many South Asians (mostly from Hindi-belt states of India) who have different mother tongues and dialects. Bollywood in particular, as well as film music, is an important cultural product that influences many South Asian youth. Some Marathas, Bangladeshis, and Indian Bengalis learn the language or its dialects through films.[153][154]\n\n\n\n#### Nepali[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(August 2017)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe first Nepalese to enter the United States were classified as \"other Asian\". Immigration records show that between 1881 and 1890, 1,910 \"other Asians\" were admitted to the United States. However, Nepal did not open its borders until 1950, and most Nepalis who left the country during that time went primarily to India to study. Nepalese Americans were first classified as a separate ethnic group in 1974 when 56 Nepalese immigrated to the United States. New York City, Boston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Columbus, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Erie, Harrisburg, Chicago, Denver, Gainesville, Portland, and Saint Paul have the largest number of Nepalese. There are some Nepalese community or cultural events in every American state, including Dashain, Tihar, Losar, Holi, Teej Special, and Nepali New Year.\n\n\n\n#### Tamil[edit]\n\n\nThe Tamil community in the United States is largely bilingual. Tamil is taught in weekly classes in many Hindu temples and by associations such as the American Tamil Academy in South Brunswick, Tamil Jersey School in Jersey City, New Jersey,[155]\n\n\nThe written form of the language is highly formal and quite distinct from the spoken form. A few universities, such as the University of Chicago and the University of California Berkeley, have graduate programs in the language.[156]\n\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Tamils from India migrated as skilled professionals to the United States, Canada, Europe, and Southeast Asia. The Tamil American population numbers over 195,685 individuals,[157] and the Federation of Tamil Sangams of North America functions as an umbrella organization for the growing community.[158]\n\n\nThe New York City and Los Angeles metropolitan areas are home to the largest concentrations of Tamil-speaking Sri Lankan Americans.[159][160][161] New York City's Staten Island alone is estimated to be home to more than 5,000 Sri Lankan Americans,[162] one of the largest Sri Lankan populations outside Sri Lanka itself,[163] and a significant proportion of whom speak Tamil.\n\n\n\n![](image)The New York City Metropolitan Area, including Central New Jersey as well as Long Island and Staten Island in New York, is home to the largest Tamil American population.\nCentral New Jersey is home to the largest population concentration of Tamils. New Jersey houses its own Tamil Sangam.[164] Sizeable populations of Indian American Tamils have also settled in the New York City and Washington metropolitan areas, as well as on the West Coast in Silicon Valley, where there are Tamil associations such as the Bay Area Tamil Mandram.[165] The New York City and Los Angeles metropolitan areas are home to the largest concentrations of Tamil-speaking Sri Lankan Americans,[166][167][168] with New York City's Staten Island alone estimated to be home to more than 5,000 Sri Lankan Americans,[162] one of the largest Sri Lankan populations outside Sri Lanka itself,[169] and a significant proportion of whom speak Tamil.\n\n\n\n#### Telugu[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telugu Americans\n\nThere were 171,000 speakers of Telugu in 2006–2008.[170]\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Telugu people from India (especially from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) migrated as professionals to the United States. Central New Jersey is home to the largest population concentration of Telugu people. Telugu people have also settled in New York City and the DC metropolitan area, as well as on the West Coast in Silicon Valley. The New York City and Los Angeles metropolitan areas are home to the largest concentrations of Telugu-speakers.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)Languages portal\n\n\n* American English\n* Language education in the United States\n* Language Spoken at Home (U.S. Census)\n* List of multilingual presidents of the United States\n* Muhlenberg legend\n* List of U.S. communities where English is not the majority language spoken at home\n* Modern Language Association\n\n\n**General:**\n\n\n\n* Bilingual education\n* Culture of the United States\n* Languages of Canada\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The United States does have an official designated language.

It is also the language spoken at home by the great majority of the U.S. population (approximately 78.5%).[6] Many other languages are also spoken at home, especially Spanish (13.3% of the population), according to the American Community Survey (ACS) of the U.S. Census Bureau; these include indigenous languages originally spoken by Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and native populations in the U.S. unincorporated territories. Other languages were brought in by people from Europe, Africa, Asia, other parts of the Americas, and Oceania, including multiple dialects, creole languages, pidgin languages, and sign languages originating in what is now the United States. Interlingua, an international auxiliary language, was also created in the U.S.\n\n\nThe majority of foreign language speakers in the U.S. are bilingual or multilingual, and they commonly speak English. Although 21.7% of U.S. residents report that they speak a language other than English at home, only 8.2% speak English less than \"very well.\"[7] Approximately 430 languages are spoken or signed by the population, of which 177 are indigenous to the U.S. or its territories.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Most common languages[edit]\n\n\nBased on annual data from the American Community Survey, the United States Census Bureau regularly publishes information on the most common languages spoken at home. It also reports the English-speaking ability of people who speak a language other than English at home.[9] In 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau published information on the number of speakers of over 350 languages as surveyed by the ACS from 2009 to 2013,[10][11] but it does not regularly tabulate and report data for that many languages.\n\n\nAccording to the ACS, the most common languages spoken at home by people aged five years of age or older in the period from 2017 to 2021 were:[9]\n\n\n\n1. English – 245 million (78.5%)\n2. Spanish – 41.3 million (13.2%)\n3. Chinese (including Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien and all other varieties) – 3.40 million (1.1%)\n4. Tagalog (including Filipino) – 1.72 million (0.5%)\n5. Vietnamese – 1.52 million (0.5%)\n6. Arabic – 1.39 million\n7. French – 1.18 million\n8. Korean – 1.07 million\n9. Russian – 1.04 million\n10.

Navajo – 155 thousand\n32. other Indo-European languages – 662 thousand\n33. Yoruba, Twi, Igbo and other languages of West Africa – 640 thousand\n34. Amharic, Somali, and other Afro-Asiatic languages – 596 thousand\n35. Yiddish, Pennsylvania Dutch, and other West Germanic languages – 574 thousand\n36. Ilocano, Samoan, Hawaiian, and other Austronesian languages – 486 thousand\n37. Other languages of Asia – 460 thousand\n38. Nepali, Marathi, and other Indic languages – 448 thousand\n39. Ukrainian and other Slavic languages – 385 thousand\n40. Swahili and other languages of Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa – 288 thousand\n41. Malayalam, Kannada, and other other Dravidian languages – 280 thousand\n42. Other Native languages of North America – 169 thousand\n43. other and unspecified languages – 327 thousand\n\nThe ACS is not a full census but an annual sample-based survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The language statistics are based on responses to a three-part question asked about all members of a target U.S. household who are at least five years old. The first part asks if they \"speak a language other than English at home.\" If so, the head of the household or main respondent is asked to report which language each member speaks in the home, and how well each individual speaks English. It does not ask how well individuals speak any other language of the household. Thus, some respondents might have only limited speaking ability in those languages.[12] In addition, it is difficult to make historical comparisons of the numbers of speakers because language questions used by the U.S. Census changed numerous times before 1980.[13]\n\n\nThe ACS does not tabulate the number of people who report the use of American Sign Language at home, so such data must come from other sources. While modern estimates indicate that American Sign Language was signed by as many as 500,000 Americans in 1972 (the last official survey of sign language), estimates as recently as 2011 were closer to 100,000. Various cultural factors, such as the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, have resulted in far greater educational opportunities for hearing-impaired children, which could double or triple the number of current users of American Sign Language.\n\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of Americans aged 5+ speaking English at home in each Public Usage Microdata Area (PUMA) of the fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico according to the 2016–2021 five-year American Community Survey\n\nEnglish is the most common language spoken in the United States with approximately 239 million speakers. Spanish is spoken by approximately 35 million people.[14] The United States has the world's fourth largest Spanish-speaking population, outnumbered only by Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina; other estimates[*which?*] put the United States at over 50 million, second only to Mexico. Throughout the Southwestern United States and Puerto Rico, long-established Spanish-speaking communities coexist with large numbers of more recent Hispanophone immigrants. Although many new Latin American immigrants are less than fluent in English, nearly all second-generation Hispanic Americans speak English fluently, while only about half still speak Spanish.[15]\n\n\nAccording to the 2000 U.S. Census, people of German ancestry made up the largest single ethnic group in the United States, but German language ranked fifth.[16][17] Italian, Polish, and French are still widely spoken among populations descending from immigrants from those countries in the early 20th century, but the use of these languages is dwindling as the older generations die. Russian is also spoken by immigrant populations.\n\n\nTagalog and Vietnamese have over one million speakers each in the United States, almost entirely within recent immigrant populations. Both languages, along with the varieties of Chinese (mostly Cantonese, Taishanese, and Standard Mandarin), Japanese, and Korean, are now used in elections in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Illinois, New York, Texas, and Washington.[18]\n\n\nNative American languages are spoken in smaller pockets of the country, but these populations are decreasing, and the languages are seldom widely used outside of reservations. Besides English, Spanish, French, German, Navajo and other Native American languages, all other languages are usually learned from immigrant ancestors that came after the time of independence or learned through some form of education.\n\n\nAmerican Sign Language is the most common sign language in the United States, although there are unrelated sign languages that have also been developed in the States and territories—mostly in the Pacific. No concrete numbers exist for signers but something upwards of 250,000 is common.\nThe most widely taught foreign languages in the United States, in terms of enrollment numbers from kindergarten through university undergraduate education, are Spanish, French, and German. Other commonly taught languages include Latin, Japanese, American Sign Language, Italian, and Chinese.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Official languages[edit]\n\n\n![Map of United States Official Language Status By State](image)Map of U.S. official language status by state. English declared the official language\n Multiple official languages, including English (Alaska, Hawaii, South Dakota), or languages with special status (New Mexico)\n No official language specified.\n\nThe United States has never had an official language at the federal level,[21] but English is typically used at the federal level and in states without an official language. Outside of Puerto Rico, English is the primary language used for legislation, regulations, executive orders, treaties, federal court rulings, and all other official pronouncements. Nonetheless, laws require documents such as ballots to be printed in multiple languages when there are large numbers of non-English speakers in an area.\n\n\nThirty-two states, in some cases as part of what has been called the English-only movement, have adopted legislation granting official status to English.[22][23][24] Typically only \"English\" is specified, not a particular variety like American English. (From 1923 to 1969, the state of Illinois recognized its official language as \"American\".)[25][26] Hawaiian, although having few native speakers, is an official language along with English of the state of Hawaii. Alaska has made some 20 native languages official, along with English;[27][28] for example, Alaska provides voting information in Iñupiaq, Central Yup'ik, Gwich'in, Siberian Yupik, and Koyukon among others.[29] On July 1, 2019, a law went into effect making Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota the official indigenous languages of South Dakota.[30]\nFrench is a *de facto*, but unofficial, language in Maine and Louisiana, while New Mexico law grants Spanish a special status. The government of Louisiana offers services and most documents in both English and French, and New Mexico does so in English and Spanish.\n\n\nEnglish is at least one of the official languages in all five permanently inhabited U.S. territories. In Puerto Rico both English and Spanish are official, although Spanish has been declared the principal official language. The school system and the government operate almost entirely in Spanish, but federal law requires the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico to use English,[31] like the rest of the federal court system. Guam recognizes English and Chamorro. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, English is the only official language. In American Samoa, both English and Samoan are officially recognized; English is common but Samoan is also seen in some official communications. In the Northern Mariana Islands, English, Chamorro, and Carolinian are official.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn New Mexico, although the state constitution does not specify an official language, laws are published in English and Spanish, and government materials and services are legally required (by Act) to be made accessible to speakers of both languages as well as Navajo and various Pueblo languages. New Mexico also has its own dialect of Spanish, which differs from Spanish spoken in the rest of Latin America.\n\n\nAlgonquian, Cherokee, and Sioux are among many other Native American languages which are official or co-official on many U.S. Indian reservations and Pueblos. In Oklahoma before statehood in 1907, territory officials debated whether or not to have Cherokee, Choctaw, and Muscogee languages as co-official, but the idea never gained ground. Cherokee is officially recognized by the Cherokee Nation within the Cherokee tribal jurisdiction area in eastern Oklahoma.[32]\n\n\nAfter New Amsterdam (formerly a Dutch colony) was transferred to English administration (becoming the Province of New York) in the late 17th century, English supplanted Dutch as the official language. However, \"Dutch remained the primary language for many civil and ecclesiastical functions and most private affairs for the next century.\"[33] The Jersey Dutch dialect is now extinct.\n\n\nCalifornia has agreed to allow the publication of state documents in other languages to represent minority groups and immigrant communities. Languages such as Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Tagalog, Persian, Russian, Vietnamese, and Thai appear in official state documents, and the Department of Motor Vehicles publishes in nine languages.[34]\n\n\nThe issue of multilingualism also applies in the states of Arizona and Texas. While the constitution of Texas has no official language policy, Arizona passed a proposition in 2006 declaring English as the official language.[35] Nonetheless, Arizona law requires the distribution of voting ballots in Spanish, as well as indigenous languages such as Navajo, O'odham and Hopi, in counties where they are spoken.[36]\n\n\nA popular urban legend called the Muhlenberg legend claims that German was almost made an official language of the United States but lost by one vote. In reality, it was a request by a group of German immigrants to have an official translation of laws into German. House speaker Frederick Muhlenberg has since become associated with the legend.[37][38][39]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Place | English official | Other official language(s) | Note\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama | Yes | None | since 1990[40] |\n| Alaska | Yes | Inupiaq,Siberian Yupik,Central Alaskan Yup'ik,Alutiiq,Unangax,Dena'ina,Deg Xinag,Holikachuk,Koyukon,Upper Kuskokwim,Gwich'in,Tanana,Upper Tanana,Tanacross,Hän,Ahtna,Eyak,Tlingit,Haida,Tsimshian[41] | since 2015[41] |\n| Arizona | Yes | None | since 2006, 1988 law ruled unconstitutional[42] |\n| Arkansas | Yes | None | since 1987[40] |\n| California | Yes | None | since 1986 with Proposition 63.[40] Proposition 63 is unenforceable due to the lack of appropriate legislation,[43] and the Bilingual Services Act provides for the use of other languages in public outreach.[44] |\n| Colorado | Yes | None | since 1988;[40] from 1876–1990 the Colorado Constitution required laws to be published in English, Spanish, and German[45] |\n| Connecticut | No | None[40] |  |\n| Delaware | No | None[40] |  |\n| Florida | Yes | None | since 1988[40] |\n| Georgia | Yes | None | since 1996[40] |\n| Hawaii | Yes | Hawaiian | since 1978[40] |\n| Idaho | Yes | None | since 2007[40] |\n| Illinois | Yes | None | since 1969; \"American\" was the official language 1923–1969.[40] |\n| Indiana | Yes | None | since 1984[40] |\n| Iowa | Yes | None | since 2002[40] |\n| Kansas | Yes | None | since 2007[40] |\n| Kentucky | Yes | None | since 1984[40] |\n| Louisiana | No | None | French has had special status since 1968 founding of CODOFIL.[40][46] |\n| Maine | No | None[40] |  |\n| Maryland | No | None[40] |  |\n| Massachusetts | Yes | None[40] | since 2002; 1975 law ruled unconstitutional\n |\n| Michigan | No | None[40] |  |\n| Minnesota | No | None[40] |  |\n| Mississippi | Yes | None | since 1987[40] |\n| Missouri | Yes | None[40] | since 1998; state constitution amended accordingly in 2008[47] |\n| Montana | Yes | None | since 1995[40] |\n| Nebraska | Yes | None | since 1920[48] |\n| Nevada | No | None[40] |  |\n| New Hampshire | Yes | None | since 1995[40] |\n| New Jersey | No | None[40] |  |\n| New Mexico | No | None | Spanish has had special recognition since 1912 passage of state constitution.

In standard bilingual classes, the non-English language (typically Spanish or Chinese) is utilized over a period of time when students' English-language proficiency is lacking. Otherwise the medium of instruction at almost all U.S. schools, at all levels, is English. The exceptions are in language classes such as French or German, or in general education in the territory of Puerto Rico, where Spanish is standard. English is the language of instruction in the territory of American Samoa, despite most students speaking Samoan as their native language.[65]\n\n\nThere are also hundreds of language immersion and dual-language schools across the United States that teach in a variety of languages, including Spanish, Hawaiian, Chamorro, French, and Mandarin Chinese (for example, the Mandarin Immersion Magnet School in Texas). However, English is a mandatory class in all these schools.\n\n\n\n## African, Asian and European languages[edit]\n\n\n| Main languages spoken at home in the United States[66] |\n| --- |\n| Language |  | percent |\n| English |  | 78.1% |\n| Spanish |  | 13.5% |\n| Other Indo-European |  | 3.7% |\n| Asian and Pacific island |  | 3.6% |\n| Other  |  | 1.2% |\n\n![](image)\nA trash can in Seattle labeled in four languages: English, Chinese, Vietnamese (written as \"ràc\" instead of \"rác\"), and Spanish. *Basura* also exists as a loanword in Tagalog, spoken in the city.\n\nSome of the first European languages to be spoken in the U.S. were English, Dutch, French, Spanish, and Swedish.\n\n\nFrom the mid-19th century, the nation had large numbers of immigrants who spoke little or no English. The laws, constitutions, and legislative proceedings of some states and territories appeared in the languages of politically important immigrant groups. There have been bilingual schools and local newspapers in such languages as German, Ukrainian, Hungarian, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Greek, Polish, Swedish, Romanian, Czech, Japanese, Yiddish, Hebrew, Lithuanian, Welsh, Cantonese, Bulgarian, Dutch, Portuguese and others. These flourished despite English-only laws in some jurisdictions prohibiting church services, telephone conversations, and even conversations in the street or on railway platforms in a language other than English, up until the first of these laws was ruled unconstitutional in 1923 (*Meyer v. Nebraska*).\n\n\nTypically, immigrant languages tend to be lost through assimilation within two or three generations[*citation needed*].\n\n\nSeveral states and territories have native populations who spoke their own language prior to joining the United States, and have maintained their original languages for centuries. The languages include Alaskan Russian, Louisiana French, Pennsylvania Dutch, and Puerto Rican Spanish.\n\n\n\n## Historic languages[edit]\n\n\n### English (245 million speakers)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)English language distribution in the United States.\nMain articles: American English and List of dialects of English § United States\n\nEnglish was inherited from British colonization, and it is spoken by the majority of the population. English has become increasingly common; when the United States was founded, 40% of Americans spoke English[67][*better source needed*]. In 2002, 87% of Americans spoke English as their first language.[68][69] It serves as the de facto national language, the language in which government business is carried out. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 80% spoke only English at home and all but approximately 13,600,000 U.S. residents age 5 and over speak English \"well\" or \"very well\".[70]\n\n\nAmerican English is different from British English in terms of spelling (one example being the dropped \"u\" in words such as color/colour), grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and slang usage. The differences are not usually a barrier to effective communication between an American English and a British English speaker.\n\n\nSome states, like California, have amended their constitutions to make English the only official language, but in practice, this only means that official government documents must *at least* be in English, and *does not* mean that they should be exclusively available only in English. For example, the standard California Class C driver's license examination is available in 32 different languages.[71]\n\n\n\n### Spanish (41.3 million speakers)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Spanish language distribution in the United States.\nMain article: Spanish language in the United States\n\nSpanish was also inherited from colonization and is sanctioned as official in the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, where it is the general language of instruction in schools and universities. In the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all territories except Puerto Rico, Spanish is taught as a foreign or second language. It is spoken at home in areas with large Hispanic populations: the Southwestern United States along the border with Mexico, as well as in Florida, parts of California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York. In Hispanic communities across the country, bilingual signs in both Spanish and English may be quite common. Furthermore, numerous neighborhoods exist (such as Washington Heights in New York City or Little Havana in Miami) in which entire city blocks will have only Spanish-language signs and Spanish-speaking people.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanish speakers in the United States\n| Year\n | Number of Spanish speakers\n | Percent ofUS population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980\n | 11 million\n | 5%\n |\n| 1990\n | 17.3 million\n | 7%\n |\n| 2000\n | 28.1 million\n | 10%\n |\n| 2010\n | 37 million\n | 13%\n |\n| 2012\n | 38.3 million\n | 13%\n |\n| 2015\n | 41 million\n | 14%\n |\n| Sources:[17][72][73][74] |\n\n\nYounger generations of non-Hispanics in the United States choose to study Spanish as a foreign or second language in far greater numbers than other second-language options. This might be due in part to the growing Hispanic population and the increasing popularity of Latin American movies and music performed in the Spanish language. A 2009 American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the United States Census Bureau, showed that Spanish was spoken at home by over 35 million people aged 5 or older,[75] making the United States the world's fifth-largest Spanish-speaking community, outnumbered only by Mexico, Colombia, Spain, and Argentina.[76][77] Since then, the number of persons reported on the ACS to speak Spanish at home has increased (see table).\n\n\n\n#### New Mexican Spanish[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Mexican Spanish\n\n![](image)The State of New Mexico.\nIn northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, Spanish speakers have been isolated for centuries in the southern Rockies, and developed a distinct dialect of Spanish spoken nowhere else: New Mexican Spanish. The dialect features a mix of Castilian, Galician and, more recently, Mexican Spanish, as well as Pueblo loan words. New Mexican Spanish also contains a large proportion of English loan words, particularly for technological words (e.g. *bos*, *troca*, and *telefón*).\n\n\nSpeakers of New Mexican Spanish are mainly descendants of Spanish colonists who arrived in New Mexico in the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries. During this time, contact with the rest of Spanish America was limited, and New Mexican Spanish developed on its own course. In the meantime, Spanish colonists coexisted with and intermarried with Puebloan peoples and Navajos. After the Mexican–American War, New Mexico and all its inhabitants came under the governance of the English-speaking United States, and for the next hundred years, English-speakers increased in number.\n\n\n\n#### Puerto Rican Spanish[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Puerto Rican Spanish\n\n![](image)The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\nPuerto Rican Spanish is the main language and dialect of the people of Puerto Rico, as well as many people descended from Puerto Ricans elsewhere throughout the United States.\n\n\n\n#### Spanglish[edit]\n\n\n**Spanglish** is a code-switching variant of Spanish and English and is spoken in areas with large bilingual populations of Spanish and English speakers, such as along the Mexico–United States border (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas), Florida, and New York City.\n\n\n\n### French (2.08 million speakers)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French language in the United States\n\n![](image)French language distribution in the United States.\nFrench, the fourth-most-common language (when all varieties of French are combined and separate yet related languages such as Haitian Creole are counted as French), is spoken mainly by the Louisiana Creole, native French, Cajun, Haitian, and French-Canadian populations. It is widely spoken in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and in Louisiana, with notable Francophone enclaves in St. Clair County, Michigan, many rural areas of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the northern San Francisco Bay area. [*citation needed*] Because of its legacy in Louisiana, that state is served by the Council for the Development of French in Louisiana (CODOFIL), the only state agency in the United States whose mission is to serve a linguistic population. In October 2018, Louisiana became the first U.S. state to join the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie.[78]\n\n\nThree varieties of French developed within what is now the United States in colonial times including Louisiana French, Missouri French, and New England French (essentially a variant of Canadian French).[79] French is the second-most-spoken language in the states of Louisiana and Maine. The largest French-speaking communities in the United States reside in Northeast Maine; Hollywood and Miami, Florida; New York City;[*citation needed*] certain areas of rural Louisiana; and small minorities in Vermont and New Hampshire. Many of the New England communities are connected to the dialect found across the border in Quebec or New Brunswick. More than 13 million Americans possess primary French heritage, but only 2 million speak French, or any regional creoles and variations language at home. The largest concentration of French speakers in the country is in Louisiana.\n\n\n\n#### Louisiana French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Louisiana French and Louisiana Creole\n\n![](image)Cajun language distribution in the United States.\nLouisiana French (Cajun French: *français de la Louisiane*; Louisiana Creole: *françé la lwizyàn*) is an umbrella term for the dialects and varieties of the French language spoken traditionally in colonial Lower Louisiana. As of today Louisiana French is primarily used in the U.S. state of Louisiana, specifically in the southern parishes.\n\n\nFrench is spoken across ethnic and racial lines by Louisiana French people who may identify as Cajuns or Creoles as well as Chitimacha, Houma, Biloxi, Tunica, Choctaw, Acadians, and French Indian among others.[80][81] For these reasons, as well as the relatively small influence Acadian French has had on the region, the label Louisiana French or Louisiana Regional French (French: *français régional louisianais*) is generally regarded as more accurate and inclusive than \"Cajun French\" and is the preferred term by linguists and anthropologists.[82][83][84][85] However, \"Cajun French\" is commonly used in lay discourse by speakers of the language and other inhabitants of Louisiana.[86]\n\n\n\n### German (1.29 million speakers)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: German language in the United States\n\n![](image)German American states.\nGerman was a widely spoken language in some of the colonies, especially Pennsylvania, where a number of German-speaking Protestants and other religious minorities settled to escape persecution in Europe. Another wave of settlement occurred when Germans fleeing the failure of 19th Century German revolutions emigrated to the United States. A large number of these German immigrants settled in the urban areas, with neighborhoods in many cities being German-speaking and numerous local German language newspapers and periodicals established. German farmers also took up farming around the country, including the Texas Hill Country, at this time. The language was widely spoken until the United States entered World War I.\n\n\nIn the early twentieth century, German was the most widely studied foreign language in the United States, and prior to World War I, more than 6%[*citation needed*] of American schoolchildren received their primary education exclusively in German, though some of these Germans came from areas outside of Germany proper. Currently, more than 49 million Americans claim German ancestry, the largest self-described ethnic group in the U.S., but less than 4% of them speak a language other than English at home, according to the 2005 American Community Survey.[87] The Amish speak a dialect of German known as Pennsylvania Dutch. One reason for this decline of German language was the perception during both World Wars that speaking the language of the enemy was unpatriotic; foreign language instruction was banned in places during the First World War. Unlike earlier waves, they were more concentrated in cities and integrated quickly. Another reason for the decline in German was the lack of first-generation immigrants, as immigration to the United States from Western Europe slowed following the World Wars.\n\n\nWaves of colonial Palatines from the Rhenish Palatinate, one of the Holy Roman states, settled in the Province of New York and the Province of Pennsylvania. The first Palatines arrived in the late 1600s but the majority came throughout the 1700s; they were known collectively as the Palatine Dutch. The Pennsylvania Dutch settled other states, including Indiana and Ohio.[88][89] For many years, the term \"Palatine\" meant German American.[90]\n\n\nThere is a myth (known as the Muhlenberg Vote) that German was to be the official language of the U.S., but this is inaccurate and based on a failed early attempt to have government documents translated into German.[91] The myth also extends to German being the second official language of Pennsylvania; however, Pennsylvania has no official language. Although more than 49 million Americans claim they have German ancestors, only 1.24 million Americans speak German at home. Many of these people are either Amish and Mennonites or Germans having newly immigrated (e.g. for professional reasons).\n\n\n\n#### Pennsylvania Dutch[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pennsylvania Dutch language distribution in the United States.\nMain article: Pennsylvania Dutch language\n\nPennsylvania Dutch or Pennsylvania German is a dialect of Palatine German that is traditionally spoken by the Pennsylvania Dutch, and has settled the Midwest, in places such as Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states, where many of the speakers live today. It evolved from the German dialect of the Palatinate brought over to America by the Palatine Dutch in the 1700s. The Pennsylvania Dutch speak Pennsylvania Dutch, and adhere to different Christian denominations: Lutherans, German Reformed, Mennonites, Amish, German Baptist Brethren, Roman Catholics; today Pennsylvania Dutch is mainly spoken by Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites.\n\n\n\n#### Texas German[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The State of Texas\nMain article: Texas German\n\nTexas German is a group of High German dialects spoken by German Texans, descendants of German immigrants who settled in Texas in the mid-19th century.\n\n\n\n#### New York Yiddish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yiddish language distribution in the United States.\nYiddish has a much longer history in the United States than Hebrew.[92] It has been present since at least the late 19th century and continues to have roughly 148,000 speakers as of the 2009 American Community Survey. Though they came from varying geographic backgrounds and nuanced approaches to worship, immigrant Jews of Central Europe, Germany and Russia were often united under a common understanding of the Yiddish language once they settled in America, and at one point dozens of publications were available in most East Coast cities. Though it has declined by quite a bit since the end of WWII, it has by no means disappeared. Many Israeli immigrants and expatriates have at least some understanding of the language in addition to Hebrew, and many of the descendants of the great migration of Ashkenazi Jews of the past century pepper their mostly English vocabulary with some loan words. Furthermore, it is a lingua franca among American Jews (particularly Hasidic Jewry), concentrated in Los Angeles, Miami, and New York.[93] A significant diffusion of Yiddish loan words into the non-Jewish population continues to be a distinguishing feature of New York City English. Some of these words include glitch, chutzpah, mensch, kvetch, klutz, etc.\n\n\n\n### Russian (1.04 million speakers)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Russian language in the United States\n\n![](image)Russian language distribution in the United States.\nThe Russian language is spoken in areas of some states, including New York, California, Washington, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Alaska. It is especially spoken in immigrant neighborhoods of some cities: New York City, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago, Seattle, Sacramento, Spokane, Miami, Vancouver, Washington, Portland, Oregon, and Woodburn, Oregon. The Russian-American Company owned most all of what became Alaska Territory until its sale right after the Crimean War. The presence of Russian speakers in the United States had always been limited, especially after the assassination of the Romanov dynasty of tsars. Starting in the 1970s and continuing until the mid-1990s, however, many Russian-speaking people from the Soviet Union and later its constituent republics such as Russia, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, and Uzbekistan have immigrated to the United States, increasing the use of Russian in the country.\n\n\nThe largest Russian-speaking neighborhoods in the United States are found in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island in New York City (specifically the Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn); parts of Los Angeles, particularly West Los Angeles and West Hollywood; parts of Philadelphia, particularly the Far Northeast; and parts of Miami like Sunny Isles Beach.\n\n\nThe Russian-language media group Slavic Voice of America, based in Dallas, Texas, serves Russian-speaking Americans.\n\n\n\n#### Alaskan Russian[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alaskan Russian\n\n![](image)The State of Alaska\nAlaskan Russian, known locally as Old Russian, is a dialect of Russian influenced by the Alutiiq language spoken by Alaskan Creoles. Most of its speakers live on Kodiak Island and in the Ninilchik (Kenai Peninsula). It has been isolated from other varieties of Russian for over a century.[94]\n\n\nKodiak Russian was natively spoken along the Afognak Strait until the Great Alaskan earthquake and tsunami of 1964. It has become moribund, spoken by only a handful of elderly people, and is virtually undocumented.[95]\n\n\nNinilchik Russian has been better studied and is more vibrant. It developed from the Russian colonial settlement of the village of Ninilchik in 1847.[96][97]\n\n\nNinilchik Russian vocabulary is clearly Russian, with a few borrowings from English and Alaskan native languages.\n\n\nIn Nikolaevsk, Alaska, 66.57% of the population still spoke Russian at home as late as 2017.[98]\n\n\n\n### Dutch (142 thousand speakers)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Distribution of U.S. households that speak Dutch at home in 2000\nThere has been a Dutch presence in America since 1602 when the government of the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands chartered the Dutch East India Company (*Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie*, or VOC) with the mission of exploring for a passage to the Indies and claiming any uncharted territories for the Dutch republic. In 1664, English troops under the command of the Duke of York (later James II of England) attacked the New Netherland colony. Being greatly outnumbered, director general Peter Stuyvesant surrendered New Amsterdam, with Fort Orange following soon. New Amsterdam was renamed New York, Fort Orange was renamed Fort Albany. Dutch city names can still be found in New York's neighbourhoods. Harlem is named after Haarlem, Staten Island is named after Staten Eiland, and Brooklyn is named after Breukelen.\n\n\nIn a 1990 demographic consensus, 3% of surveyed citizens claimed descent from Dutch settlers. Modern estimates place the Dutch American population (with total or partial Dutch heritage) at 3.1 million, or 0.93%,[99] lagging just a bit behind Norwegian Americans and Swedish Americans,[99] while 885,000[100] Americans claimed total Dutch heritage.\n\n\nAn estimated 141,580 people, or 0.0486%,[101] in the United States still speak the Dutch language at home as of 2013, in addition to 23,010 and 510 speakers of the closely related Afrikaans and West-Frisian.[101] They are concentrated mainly in California (23,500), Florida (10,900), Pennsylvania (9,900), Ohio (9,600), New York (8,700) and Michigan (6,600; i.e. almost entirely in the city of Holland).[102] In 2021, 95.3% of the total Dutch American population of 5 years and over only spoke English at home.[103]\n\n\nNot included among Dutch American speakers are the Pennsylvania Dutch, a group of mainly German Americans who settled in Pennsylvania in the colonial era and whose name is a derivation of the Pennsylvania Dutch endonym **Deitsch**, which means \"Pennsylvania Dutch\" or \"German\".[104][105][106][107]\n\n\n\n#### New York Dutch[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: New York Dutch and Jersey Dutch language\n\n![](image)New York Dutch language area\nA vernacular dialect of Dutch known as New York Dutch was spoken by the Holland Dutch of New York and New Jersey between the start of the 17th century to the mid-20th century. With the beginning of the 20th century, usage of the language became restricted to internal family circles, with an ever-growing number of people abandoning the language in favor of English. It suffered gradual decline throughout the 20th century, and it ultimately dissipated from casual usage.\n\n\nDutch was still spoken in many parts of New York at the time of the Revolution. For example, Alexander Hamilton's wife Eliza Hamilton attended a Dutch-language church during their marriage.\n\n\nAfrican-American abolitionist and women's rights activist Sojourner Truth (born \"Isabella Baumfree\") was a native speaker of Dutch.\n\n\nMartin Van Buren, the first President born in the United States following its independence, spoke Dutch as his native language, making him the only President whose first language was not English.\n\n\nNotable Dutch Americans include the Roosevelts (Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and Eleanor Roosevelt), Marlon Brando, Thomas Alva Edison, Martin Van Buren and the Vanderbilts. The Roosevelts are direct descendants of Dutch settlers of the New Netherland colony in the 17th century.\n\n\n\n## Indigenous languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map showing language families of the US prior to European settlement.\n### Native American languages[edit]\n\n\nNative American languages predate European settlement of the New World. In a few parts of the U.S. (mostly on Indian reservations), they continue to be spoken fluently. Most of these languages are endangered, although there are efforts to revive them. Normally the fewer the speakers of a language the greater the degree of endangerment, but there are many small Native American language communities in the Southwest (Arizona and New Mexico) which continue to thrive despite their small size.\n\n\nIn 1929, speaking of indigenous Native American languages, linguist Edward Sapir observed:[108]\n\n\n\n\n> Few people realize that within the confines of the United States there is spoken today a far greater variety of languages ... than in the whole of Europe. We may go further. We may say, quite literally and safely, that in the state of California alone there are greater and more numerous linguistic extremes than can be illustrated in all the length and breadth of Europe.\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Navajo[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Navajo language\n\nAccording to the 2000 Census and other language surveys, the largest Native American language-speaking community by far is the Navajo. Navajo is an Athabaskan language of the Na-Dené family, with 178,000 speakers, primarily in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. Altogether, Navajo speakers make up more than 50% of all Native American language speakers in the United States. Western Apache, with 12,500 speakers, also mostly in Arizona, is closely related to Navajo but not mutually intelligible with it. Navajo and other Athabaskan languages in the Southwest are relative outliers; most other Athabascan languages are spoken in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. Navajo has struggled to keep a healthy speaker base, although this problem has been alleviated to some extent by extensive education programs on the Navajo Nation, including a Navajo language immersion school in Fort Defiance, Arizona.\n\n\n\n#### Cherokee[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cherokee language\n\n![](image)Cherokee language distribution of the United States\nCherokee is the Iroquoian language spoken by the Cherokee people, and the official language of the Cherokee Nation.[109] Significant numbers of Cherokee speakers of all ages[110] still populate the Qualla Boundary in Cherokee, North Carolina and several counties within the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, significantly Cherokee, Sequoyah, Mayes, Adair, and Delaware. Increasing numbers of Cherokee youth are renewing interest in the traditions, history, and language of their ancestors.[110] Cherokee-speaking communities stand at the forefront of language preservation, and at local schools, all lessons are taught in Cherokee and thus it serves as the medium of instruction from pre-school on up.[109] Also, church services and traditional ceremonial stomp dances are held in the language in Oklahoma and on the Qualla Boundary in North Carolina.[109]\n\n\nCherokee is one of the few, or perhaps the only, Native American language with an increasing population of speakers,[111] and along with Navajo it is the only indigenous American language with more than 50,000 speakers,[112] a figure most likely achieved through the tribe's 10-year long language preservation plan involving growing new speakers through immersion schools for children,[113][114] developing new words for modern phrases, teaching the language to non-Cherokees in schools and universities,[115] fostering the language among young adults so their children can use that language at home, developing iPhone and iPad apps for language education, the development of Cherokee language radio stations including Cherokee Voices, Cherokee Sounds,[116] and promoting the writing system through public signage, products like the Apple iPhone, internet use through Google including Gmail, and others so the language remains relevant in the 21st century.\n\n\n\n#### Other Native American languages[edit]\n\n\nDakota is a Siouan language with 18,000 speakers in the US alone (22,000 including speakers in Canada), not counting 6,000 speakers of the closely related Lakota. Most speakers live in the states of North Dakota and South Dakota. Other Siouan languages include the closely related Winnebago, and the more distant Crow, among others.\n\n\nCentral Alaskan Yup'ik is an Eskimo–Aleut language with 16,000 speakers, most of whom live in Alaska. The term \"Yupik\" is applied to its relatives, which are not necessarily mutually intelligible with Central Alaskan, including Naukan and Central Siberian, among others.\n\n\nThe O'odham language, spoken by the Pima and the Tohono O'odham, is a Uto-Aztecan language with more than 12,000 speakers, most of whom live in central and southern Arizona and northern Sonora. Other Uto-Aztecan languages include Hopi, Shoshone, and the Pai-Ute languages.\n\n\nChoctaw has 11,000 speakers. Choctaw is part of the Muskogean family, like Seminole and Alabama.\n\n\nThe Algonquian language family includes languages like Chippewa/Ojibwe, Cheyenne, and Cree.\n\n\nKeres has 11,000 speakers in New Mexico and is a language isolate. The Keres pueblo people are the largest of the Pueblo nations. The Keres pueblo of Acoma is the oldest continually inhabited community in the United States. Zuni, another isolate, has around 10,000 speakers, most of whom reside within the Zuni pueblo.\n\n\nBecause of immigration from Mexico, there are Mexican native American languages speakers in the US. There are thousands of Nahuatl, Mixtec, Zapotec and Trique speakers in communities established mainly in the southern states.\n\n\nAlthough the languages of the Americas have a history stretching back about 17,000 to 12,000 years, current knowledge of them is limited. There are doubtlessly a number of undocumented languages that were once spoken in the United States that are missing from historical record.\n\n\n\n#### List of Native American languages[edit]\n\n\nBelow is an estimate of Native American languages \"spoken at home\" in the United States (American Community Survey 2006–2008).[117] This is not an exhaustive list of Native American languages in the US. Because the distinction between dialect and language is not always clear, multiple dialects of varying mutual intelligibility may be classified as a single language, while a group of effectively identical dialects may be classified separately for historical or cultural reasons. Languages included here may be classified as \"extinct\" (having no living native speakers), but many extinct or moribund Native American languages are the subjects of ongoing language revitalization efforts; other extinct languages undergoing revitalization might not be listed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Language | Endonym[118] | Family | Speakers(% of total) | Does not speak English\"Very Well\"[119] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Total** | — | — | **444,124 (100)** | **19.22%** |\n| Total (excl.

known as Plains Indian Sign Language, Plains Standard or Plains Sign Talk, arose among the Native Americans of the plains. Each signing nation had a separate signed version of their oral language, that was used by the hearing, and these were not mutually intelligible. Plains Standard was used to communicate between these nations. It seems to have started in Texas and then spread north, through the Great Plains, as far as British Columbia. There are still a few users today, especially among the Crow, Cheyenne, and Arapaho. Unlike other sign languages developed by hearing people, it shares the spatial grammar of deaf sign languages. Through intergenerational transmission, Plains Sign Talk became a working language still in use today in some Deaf First Nations or Native American communities.\n\n\nAs Plains Sign Talk was so widespread and was a spectrum of dialects and accents, it probably hosted several languages under its umbrella. One is potentially Navajo Sign Language which is in use by a sole Navajo clan.\n\n\nAdditionally, Plateau Sign Language existed alongside Plains Sign Talk as either a trade pidgin or another language around the Columbia Plateau and surrounding regions.\n\n\n\n### Austronesian languages[edit]\n\n\n#### Hawaiian[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hawaiian language distribution in the United States.\nHawaiian is an official state language of Hawaii as prescribed in the Constitution of Hawaii. Hawaiian has 1,000 native speakers. Formerly considered critically endangered, Hawaiian is showing signs of language renaissance. The recent trend is based on new Hawaiian language immersion programs of the Hawaii State Department of Education and the University of Hawaii, as well as efforts by the Hawaii State Legislature and county governments to preserve Hawaiian place names. In 1993, about 8,000 could speak and understand it; today estimates range up to 27,000. Hawaiian is related to the Māori language spoken by around 150,000 New Zealanders and Cook Islanders as well as the Tahitian language which is spoken by another 120,000 people of Tahiti.\n\n\n\n#### Samoan[edit]\n\n\nSamoan is an official territorial language of American Samoa. Samoans make up 90% of the population, and most people are bilingual.\n\n\n\n#### Chamorro[edit]\n\n\nChamorro is co-official in the Mariana Islands, both in the territory of Guam and in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In Guam, the indigenous Chamorro people make up about 60% of the population.\n\n\n\n#### Carolinian[edit]\n\n\nCarolinian is also co-official in the Northern Marianas, where only 14% of people speak English at home.\n\n\n\n## Creole languages[edit]\n\n\nSeveral distinct natural languages and pidgins have developed on American soil, including full languages like creole and sign languages.\n\n\n\n### Angloromani[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Angloromani language\n\nAngloromani is an English creole or mixed language spoken by Romani Americans.[120]\n\n\n\n### Chinuk Wawa or Chinook Jargon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chinook Jargon\n\nA pidgin of 700–800 words of French, English, Cree and other Native origins is the old trade language of the Pacific Northwest. It was used extensively among both European and Native peoples of the Oregon Territory, even used instead of English at home by many pioneer families. It is estimated that around 100,000 people spoke it at its peak, between 1858 and 1900, and it was last widely used in Seattle just before World War II.[121]\n\n\n\n### Gullah[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gullah language\n\nAn English creole language with African influence spoken on the Sea Islands of South Carolina and Georgia retains strong influences of West African languages. The language is sometimes referred to as \"Geechee\".\n\n\n\n### Hawaii Creole English[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hawaiian Pidgin\n\nThe Hawaiian English creole language, locally known as Hawaiian Pidgin, is used by locals and is considered an unofficial language of the state of Hawaii.[122]\n\n\n\n### Louisiana Creole French[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Louisiana Creole\n\nA French Creole language spoken by the Louisiana Creole people of the state of Louisiana, close to Haitian Creole, Colonial French, and Cajun French (language of Acadians deported from New France after 1755 and the Grand Dérangement).\nFrench Creole languages are spoken by millions of people worldwide, mainly in the United States, Caribbean, and Indian Ocean areas.\n\n\n\n### U.S. Virgin Islands Creole Dutch (extinct)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Negerhollands\n\n![](image)U.S. Virgin Islands\nNegerhollands ('Negro-Dutch') was a Dutch-based creole language that was spoken in the Danish West Indies, now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands. Dutch was its superstrate language with Danish, English, French, Spanish, and African elements incorporated. Notwithstanding its name, Negerhollands drew primarily from the Zeelandic rather than the Hollandic dialect of Dutch.[123]\n\n\n\n## Sign languages[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Attested historical ranges of sign languages of the US and Canada excluding ASL and LSQ.  \n |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Plains Sign Talk\n Inuiuuk (ᐃᓄᐃᐆᒃ)\n Hawai'i Sign Language\n Maritime Sign Language\n | *Plateau Sign Language*\n *Martha's Vineyard Sign Language*\n *Henniker Sign Language*\n *Sandy River Valley Sign Language*\n |\n\nSee also: Native American sign languages\n\nAlongside the numerous and varied oral languages, the United States also boasts several sign languages. Historically, the US was home to some six or more sign languages (that number rising with the probability that Plains Sign Talk is actually a language family with several languages under its umbrella) which has fallen with the death of several of these.\n\n\nAs with all sign languages around the world that developed organically, these are full languages distinct from any oral language. American Sign Language (unlike Signed English) is not a derivation of English.[124] Some languages present here were trade pidgins which were used first as a system of communication across national and linguistic boundaries of the Native Americans, however, they have since developed into mature languages as children learned them as a first language.\n\n\n\n### American Sign Language[edit]\n\n\n**American Sign Language** (ASL) is the native language of a number of deaf and hearing people in America (roughly 100,000 to 500,000). While some sources have stated that ASL is the third most frequently used language in the United States, after English and Spanish,[125] recent scholarship has pointed out that most of these estimates are based on numbers conflating deafness with ASL use, and that the last actual study of this (in 1972) seems to indicate an upper bound of 500,000 ASL speakers at the time.[126]\n\n\n\n* Black American Sign Language (BASL) developed in the southeastern US, where separate residential schools were maintained for white and black deaf children. BASL shares much of the same vocabulary and grammatical structure as ASL and is generally considered one of its dialects.[124][125][127]\n\n\n### Hawai'i Sign Language[edit]\n\n\n**Hawaii Sign Language** is moribund with only a handful of speakers on O'ahu, Lana'i, Kaua'i and possibly Ni'ihau. Some of these speakers may actually be speaking a creolized version of HSL and ASL, however; research is slow-going. The language was once called Hawai'i Pidgin Sign Language, as many people thought it was a derivative of ASL, but it was discovered to be a separate language altogether.[128]\n\n\n\n### Plains Sign Talk[edit]\n\n\nOnce a trade pidgin and the most far-reaching sign language in North America, **Plains Sign Talk** or **Plains Sign Language** is now critically endangered with an unknown number of speakers.\n\n\n\n* Navajo Sign Language has been found to be in use in one clan of Navajo; however, whether it is a dialect of Plains Sign Talk or a separate language remains unknown.[129]\n* Plateau Sign Language is another trade pidgin that may have become a separate language, **Plateau Sign Language** replaced Plains Sign Talk in the Columbia Plateau and surrounding regions of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It is now extinct.\n\n\n### Martha's Vineyard Sign Language[edit]\n\n\n**Martha's Vineyard Sign Language** is now extinct. Along with French Sign Language, it was one of several main contributors to American Sign Language.\n\n\n\n### Henniker Sign Language[edit]\n\n\n**Henniker Sign Language** is now extinct but was once found around the Henniker region of New Hampshire and formed a basis for American Sign Language.\n\n\n\n### Sandy River Valley Sign Language[edit]\n\n\n**Sandy River Valley Sign Language** is now extinct but once could be found around the Sandy River Valley in Maine. It was one of several main contributors to American Sign Language.\n\n\n\n## Immigrant languages[edit]\n\n\n### Arabic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arabic language in the United States\n\nVarieties of Arabic are spoken by immigrants from the Middle East as well as many Muslim Americans. The highest concentrations of native Arabic speakers reside in heavily urban areas like Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles. Detroit and the surrounding areas of Michigan boast a significant Arabic-speaking population including many Arab Christians of Lebanese, Syrian, and Palestinian descent.\n\n\nArabic is used for religious purposes by Muslim Americans and by some Arab Christians (notably Catholics of the Melkite and Maronite Churches as well as Rum Orthodox, i.e. Antiochian Orthodox Christians and Coptic churches.). A significant number of educated Arab professionals who immigrate often already know English quite well, as it is widely used in the Middle East. Lebanese immigrants also have a broader understanding of French as do many Arabic-speaking immigrants from North Africa. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Chinese[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chinese language and varieties in the United States\n\nThe population of Chinese speakers in the United States was increasing rapidly in the 20th century because the number of Chinese immigrants has increased at a rate of more than 50% since 1940.[130] 2.8 million Americans speak some variety of Chinese, which combined are counted by the federal census as the third most-spoken language in the country. Until the late 20th century, Yue dialects, including Taishanese and Cantonese, were the most common dialects among immigrants and the descendants of immigrants, especially in California. Since the opening of the People's Republic of China, Mandarin, the official language in the PRC and Republic of China (Taiwan), has become increasingly prevalent.[131] Many Americans of all ethnic backgrounds are also learning Mandarin and, to a far lesser extent, Cantonese.[131]\n\n\nIn New York City in 2002, Mandarin was spoken as a native language among only 10% of Chinese speakers but was predicted to replace Cantonese as the lingua franca among Chinese speakers.[132]\n\n\n\n### Czech[edit]\n\n\n#### Texas Czech[edit]\n\n\n12,805 Texans can speak the Czech language.[133]\n\n\nDrawing on Boas's model for interviewing speakers of the language and digitally cataloging the dialects, John Tomecek founded and Lida Cope of East Carolina University developed the Texas Czech Legacy Project at the University of Texas at Austin to document and preserve the dwindling language.[134][135][136]\nBecause the majority of Texas immigrants came from Moravia, the Czech spoken in Texas is largely characterized by Moravian dialects (Lachian and Moravian Wallachian) which vary to some extent from the Bohemian dialects spoken by most Czech-Americans. Czech-language journalism has been very active in the state over the years. Thirty-three newspapers and periodicals have been published. As of 1993 one weekly newspaper, *Našinec*, published at Granger, and one monthly, *Hospodář*, published at West, were still being published entirely in Czech. Other periodicals such as *Věstník* and the *Brethren Journal* contained sections printed in Czech.[137]\n\n\n\n### Finnish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Finnish language distribution in the United States.\nThe first Finnish settlers in America were amongst the settlers who came from Sweden and Finland to the New Sweden colony. Most colonists were Finnish. However, the Finnish language was not preserved as well among subsequent generations as Swedish.\n\n\nBetween the 1890s and the outbreak of the first World War, an estimated quarter million Finnish citizens immigrated to the United States, mainly in rural areas of the Midwest and more specifically in the mining regions of Northeastern Minnesota, Northern Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Hancock, Michigan, as of 2005, still incorporates bi-lingual street signs written in both English and Finnish.[138][139] Americans of Finnish origin yield at 800,000 individuals, though only 26,000 speak the language at home. There is a distinctive dialect of English to be found in the Upper Peninsula, known as Yooper. Yooper often has a Finnish cadence and uses Finnish sentence structure with modified English, German, Swedish, Norwegian, and Finnish vocabulary.[*citation needed*]\nNotable Finnish Americans include U.S. Communist Party leader Gus Hall, film director Renny Harlin, and the Canadian-born actress Pamela Anderson.\n\n\nNorthern Clark County, Washington (encompassing Yacolt, Amboy, Battle Ground and Chelatchie) contains a large exclave of Old Apostolic Lutherans who originally immigrated from Finland. Many families in this portion of the county speak fluent Finnish at home before learning English.[*citation needed*] Another noteworthy Finnish community in the United States is found in Lake Worth, Florida, north of Miami.\n\n\n\n### Hebrew[edit]\n\n\nModern Hebrew is spoken by Israeli immigrants. Liturgical Hebrew is used as a religious or liturgical language[140] by many of the United States' approximately 7 million[141] Jews.\n\n\n\n### Gaelic Languages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Goidelic languages\n\nAbout 40 million Americans have Irish ancestry, many of whose ancestors would have spoken Irish Gaelic. In 2013, around 20,600 Americans spoke Irish at home and As of 2008[update] it was the 76th most spoken language in the United States.[142] An additional 1,600 spoke Scottish Gaelic.[143]\n\n\n\n### Italian, Sicilian and Neapolitan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian language in the United States\n\n![](image)Current distribution of the Italian language in the United States.\nThe Italian language and other Italo-Dalmatian languages have been widely spoken in the United States for more than one hundred years, primarily due to large-scale immigration from the late 19th century to the mid 20th century.\n\n\nIn addition to Italian learned by most people today, there has been a strong representation of the languages of Southern Italy amongst the immigrant population (Sicilian and Neapolitan in particular). As of 2009, though 15,638,348 American citizens report themselves as Italian-Americans, only 753,992 of these report speaking the Italian language at home (0.3264% of the US population).\n\n\n\n### Khmer (Cambodian)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambodian Americans\n\nBetween 1981 and 1985 about 150,000 Cambodians resettled in the United States.[144] Before 1975 very few Cambodians came to the United States. Those who did were children of upper-class families sent abroad to attend school. After the fall of Phnom Penh to the communist Khmer Rouge in 1975, some Cambodians managed to escape. In 2007 the American Community Survey reported that there were approximately 200,000 Cambodians living in the United States, making up about 2% percent of the Asian population. This population is, however, heavily concentrated in two areas: the Los Angeles metropolitan area in California, especially the city of Long Beach; and Greater Boston in New England, especially Lowell, Massachusetts. These two areas hold a majority of the Cambodians living in the US.\n\n\n\n### Korean[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Korean language\n\nIn 2011 over 1.1 million Americans spoke Korean at home. This number increased greatly at the end of the 20th century, increasing 327% from the 300,000 speakers in 1980. The greatest concentration of these speakers was in the Los Angeles, New York, and Washington D.C. metro areas.[145] Speakers of Korean are found in the Koreatowns.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Polish and Silesian[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2013, around 580,000 Americans spoke Polish at home.[143] The Polish language is very common in the Chicago metropolitan area. Chicago's third largest white ethnic groups are those of Polish descent, after German and Irish.[146] The Polish people and the Polish language in Chicago were very prevalent in the early years of the city, and today the 650,000 Poles in Chicago make up one of the largest ethnically Polish populations in the world, comparable to the city of Wrocław, the fourth largest city in Poland. That makes it one of the most important centers of Polonia and the Polish language in the United States, a fact that the city celebrates every Labor Day weekend at the Taste of Polonia Festival in Jefferson Park.[147]\n\n\n\n#### Texas Silesian[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Texas Silesian\n\nTexas Silesian, a dialect of the Silesian language (itself controversially considered a branch of Polish by some linguists), has been used by Texas Silesians in American settlements from 1852 to the present.\n\n\n\n### Portuguese[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Portuguese Americans, Brazilian Americans, and Cape Verdean Americans\n\nThe first Portuguese speakers in America were Portuguese Jews who had fled the Portuguese Inquisition. They spoke Judeo-Portuguese and founded the earliest Jewish communities in the Thirteen Colonies, two of which still exist: Congregation Shearith Israel in New York and Congregation Mikveh Israel in Philadelphia. However, by the end of the 18th century, their use of Portuguese had been replaced by English.\n\n\nIn the late 19th century, many Portuguese, mainly Azoreans, Madeirans and Cape Verdeans (who prior to independence in 1975 were Portuguese citizens), immigrated to the United States, settling in cities like Providence, Rhode Island, New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Santa Cruz, California. There was also a substantial Portuguese immigration to Hawaii, which at the time was not yet part of the United States.\n\n\nIn the mid-late 20th century there was another wave of Portuguese immigration to the US, mainly the Northeast (New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts), and for a time Portuguese became a major language in Newark, New Jersey. Many Portuguese Americans may include descendants of Portuguese settlers born in Portuguese Africa (known as Portuguese Africans, or, in Portugal, as *retornados*) and Asia (mostly Macau). There were around 1 million Portuguese Americans in the United States by 2000. Portuguese (European Portuguese) has been spoken in the United States by small communities of immigrants, mainly in the metropolitan New York City area, like Newark, New Jersey.\n\n\nThe Portuguese language is also spoken widely by Brazilian Americans, concentrated in Miami, New York City, and Boston.\n\n\n\n### Swedish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Swedish language distribution in the United States.\nThere has been a Swedish presence in America since the New Sweden colony came into existence in March 1638.\n\n\nWidespread diaspora of Swedish immigration did not occur until the latter half of the 19th century, bringing in a total of a million Swedes. No other country had a higher percentage of its people leave for the United States except Ireland and Norway. At the beginning of the 20th century, Minnesota had the highest ethnic Swedish population in the world after the city of Stockholm.\n\n\n3.7% of US residents claim descent from Scandinavian ancestors, amounting to roughly 11–12 million people. According to SIL's Ethnologue, over half a million ethnic Swedes still speak the language, though according to the 2007 American Community Survey only 56,715 speak it at home. Cultural assimilation has contributed to the gradual and steady decline of the language in the US. After the independence of the US from the Kingdom of Great Britain, the government encouraged colonists to adopt the English language as a common medium of communication, and in some cases, imposed it upon them. Subsequent generations of Swedish Americans received education in English and spoke it as their first language. Lutheran churches scattered across the Midwest started abandoning Swedish in favor of English as their language of worship. Swedish newspapers and publications alike slowly faded away.\n\n\nThere are sizable Swedish communities in Minnesota, Ohio, Maryland, Philadelphia, and Delaware, along with small isolated pockets in Pennsylvania, San Francisco, Fort Lauderdale, and New York. Chicago once contained a large Swedish enclave called Andersonville on the city's north side.\n\n\nJohn Morton, the person who cast the decisive vote leading to Pennsylvania's support for the United States Declaration of Independence, was of Finnish descent. Finland was part of the Kingdom of Sweden in the 18th century.\n\n\n\n### Walloon[edit]\n\n\n#### Wisconsin Walloon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wisconsin Walloon\n\nWisconsin Walloon is a dialect of the Walloon language descendant from central Walloon. It is spoken in the Door Peninsula in Wisconsin, United States.[148]\n\n\nThe speakers of Wisconsin Walloon are descendants of the Belgian immigrants that came from the wave of immigration lasting from 1853 to 1857 that was recorded to have brought around 2,000 Belgians to Wisconsin.[149] It is sometimes referred to by its speakers in English as \"Belgian\".[150] Descendants of native Walloon speakers have since switched to English, and as of 2021, it has fewer than 50 speakers.[148]\n\n\n\n### Welsh[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Welsh language\n\n![](image)Welsh language distribution in the United States.\nUp to two million Americans are thought to have Welsh ancestry. However, there is very little Welsh being used commonly in the United States. According to the 2007 American Community Survey, 2,285 people speak Welsh at home; primarily spoken in California (415), Florida (225), New York (204), Ohio (135), and New Jersey (130).[151] Some place names, such as Bryn Mawr in Chicago and Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania (English: Big Hill) are Welsh. Several towns in Pennsylvania, mostly in the Welsh Tract, have Welsh namesakes, including Uwchlan, Bala Cynwyd, Gwynedd, and Tredyffrin.\n\n\n\n### Tagalog[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Distribution of U.S. households that speak Tagalog at home\nTagalog speakers were already present in the United States as early as the late sixteenth century as sailors contracted by the Spanish colonial government. In the eighteenth century, they established settlements in Louisiana, such as Saint Malo. After the American annexation of the Philippines, the number of Tagalog speakers steadily increased, as Filipinos began to migrate to the U.S. as students or contract laborers. Their numbers, however, decreased upon Philippine independence, as some Filipinos were repatriated.\n\n\nToday, Tagalog, together with its standardized form Filipino, is spoken by over a million and a half Filipino Americans and is promoted by Filipino American civic organizations and Philippine consulates. As Filipinos are the second largest Asian ethnic group in the United States, Tagalog is the second most spoken Asian language in the country, after Chinese. Taglish, a form of code-switching between Tagalog and English, is also spoken by a number of Filipino Americans.\n\n\nTagalog is also taught at some universities where a significant number of Filipinos exist. As it is the national and most spoken language of the Philippines, most Filipinos in the United States are proficient in Tagalog in addition to their local regional language.\n\n\n\n### Vietnamese[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vietnamese language in the United States\n\n![](image)Vietnamese language distribution in the United States\nAccording to the 2010 Census, there are over 1.5 million Americans who identify themselves as Vietnamese in origin, ranking fourth among the Asian American groups and forming the largest Overseas Vietnamese population.\n\n\nOrange County, California, is home to the largest concentration of ethnic Vietnamese outside Vietnam, especially in its Little Saigon area. Other significant Vietnamese communities are found in the metropolitan areas of San Jose, Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Seattle, Northern Virginia, and New Orleans. Similarly to other overseas Vietnamese communities in Western countries (except France), the Vietnamese population in the United States was established following the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and communist takeover of South Vietnam following the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\n### South Asian languages[edit]\n\n\nThere are many South Asians in the United States. These include Indians, Pakistanis, and Bangladeshis, who speak various South Asian languages. Major South Asian languages spoken in the US include Telugu (see \"Telugu\" below), Malayalam, Kannada, Tamil (see \"Tamil\" below), Gujarati, Hindi and Urdu (see 'Hindi-Urdu\" below), Bengali, Punjabi, Sinhala, Nepali (see \"Nepali\" below), and Marathi.\n\n\n\n#### Hindi and Urdu[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hindustani language\n\nHindi and Urdu are the two standard registers of the Hindustani language, an Indo-Aryan language native to North India, Central India, and Pakistan. While the formal registers draw vocabulary from Sanskrit and Arabic & Persian respectively, the colloquial forms are indistinguishable. Hindi and Urdu are widely spoken among the Hindustanis and Pakistani communities in the United States as a first or second language. Speakers are concentrated in states with large South Asian populations, including California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Texas, and Virginia.[152]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hindi-Urdu (Hindustani) is a cultural language for many South Asians (mostly from Hindi-belt states of India) who have different mother tongues and dialects. Bollywood in particular, as well as film music, is an important cultural product that influences many South Asian youth. Some Marathas, Bangladeshis, and Indian Bengalis learn the language or its dialects through films.[153][154]\n\n\n\n#### Nepali[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(August 2017)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe first Nepalese to enter the United States were classified as \"other Asian\". Immigration records show that between 1881 and 1890, 1,910 \"other Asians\" were admitted to the United States. However, Nepal did not open its borders until 1950, and most Nepalis who left the country during that time went primarily to India to study. Nepalese Americans were first classified as a separate ethnic group in 1974 when 56 Nepalese immigrated to the United States. New York City, Boston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Columbus, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, Erie, Harrisburg, Chicago, Denver, Gainesville, Portland, and Saint Paul have the largest number of Nepalese. There are some Nepalese community or cultural events in every American state, including Dashain, Tihar, Losar, Holi, Teej Special, and Nepali New Year.\n\n\n\n#### Tamil[edit]\n\n\nThe Tamil community in the United States is largely bilingual. Tamil is taught in weekly classes in many Hindu temples and by associations such as the American Tamil Academy in South Brunswick, Tamil Jersey School in Jersey City, New Jersey,[155]\n\n\nThe written form of the language is highly formal and quite distinct from the spoken form. A few universities, such as the University of Chicago and the University of California Berkeley, have graduate programs in the language.[156]\n\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Tamils from India migrated as skilled professionals to the United States, Canada, Europe, and Southeast Asia. The Tamil American population numbers over 195,685 individuals,[157] and the Federation of Tamil Sangams of North America functions as an umbrella organization for the growing community.[158]\n\n\nThe New York City and Los Angeles metropolitan areas are home to the largest concentrations of Tamil-speaking Sri Lankan Americans.[159][160][161] New York City's Staten Island alone is estimated to be home to more than 5,000 Sri Lankan Americans,[162] one of the largest Sri Lankan populations outside Sri Lanka itself,[163] and a significant proportion of whom speak Tamil.\n\n\n\n![](image)The New York City Metropolitan Area, including Central New Jersey as well as Long Island and Staten Island in New York, is home to the largest Tamil American population.\nCentral New Jersey is home to the largest population concentration of Tamils. New Jersey houses its own Tamil Sangam.[164] Sizeable populations of Indian American Tamils have also settled in the New York City and Washington metropolitan areas, as well as on the West Coast in Silicon Valley, where there are Tamil associations such as the Bay Area Tamil Mandram.[165] The New York City and Los Angeles metropolitan areas are home to the largest concentrations of Tamil-speaking Sri Lankan Americans,[166][167][168] with New York City's Staten Island alone estimated to be home to more than 5,000 Sri Lankan Americans,[162] one of the largest Sri Lankan populations outside Sri Lanka itself,[169] and a significant proportion of whom speak Tamil.\n\n\n\n#### Telugu[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telugu Americans\n\nThere were 171,000 speakers of Telugu in 2006–2008.[170]\nIn the second half of the 20th century, Telugu people from India (especially from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu) migrated as professionals to the United States. Central New Jersey is home to the largest population concentration of Telugu people. Telugu people have also settled in New York City and the DC metropolitan area, as well as on the West Coast in Silicon Valley. The New York City and Los Angeles metropolitan areas are home to the largest concentrations of Telugu-speakers.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)Languages portal\n\n\n* American English\n* Language education in the United States\n* Language Spoken at Home (U.S. Census)\n* List of multilingual presidents of the United States\n* Muhlenberg legend\n* List of U.S. communities where English is not the majority language spoken at home\n* Modern Language Association\n\n\n**General:**\n\n\n\n* Bilingual education\n* Culture of the United States\n* Languages of Canada\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The United States does have an official designated language.

Prior to Confederation, the territories that would become Canada were home to over 70 distinct languages across 12 or so language families. Today, a majority of those indigenous languages are still spoken; however, most are endangered and only about 0.6% of the Canadian population report an Indigenous language as their mother tongue.[nb 3] Since the establishment of the Canadian state, English and French have been the co-official languages and are, by far, the most-spoken languages in the country.\n\n\nAccording to the 2016 census, English and French are the mother tongues of 56.0% and 21.4% of Canadians respectively.[4] In total, 86.2% of Canadians have a working knowledge of English, while 29.8% have a working knowledge of French.[5] Under the *Official Languages Act* of 1969, both English and French have official status throughout Canada in respect of federal government services and most courts. All federal legislation is enacted bilingually. Provincially, only in New Brunswick are both English and French official to the same extent. French is Quebec's official language,[6] although legislation is enacted in both French and English and court proceedings may be conducted in either language. English is the official language of Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta, but government services are available in French in many regions of each, particularly in regions and cities where Francophones form the majority. Legislation is enacted in both languages and courts conduct cases in both. In 2022, Nova Scotia recognized Mi'kmawi'simk as the first language of the province,[1][2] and maintains two provincial language secretariats: the Office of Acadian Affairs and Francophonie (French language) and the Office of Gaelic Affairs (Canadian Gaelic). The remaining provinces (British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador) do not have an official provincial language *per se* but government is primarily English-speaking. Territorially, both the Northwest Territories and Nunavut have official Indigenous languages alongside French and English: Inuktut (Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun) in Nunavut[7] and, in the NWT, nine others (Cree, Dënësųłıné, Dene Yatıé/Zhatıé,[nb 1] Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́,[nb 1] and Tłįchǫ Yatıì).[9]\n\n\nCanada's official languages commissioner (the federal government official charged with monitoring the two languages) said in 2009, \"[I]n the same way that race is at the core of what it means to be American and at the core of an American experience and class is at the core of British experience, I think that language is at the core of Canadian experience.\"[10] To assist in more accurately monitoring the two official languages, Canada's census collects a number of demolinguistic descriptors not enumerated in the censuses of most other countries, including home language, mother tongue, first official language, and language of work.\n\n\nCanada's linguistic diversity extends beyond English, French and numerous Indigenous languages. \"In Canada, 4.7 million people (14.2% of the population) reported speaking a language other than English or French most often at home and 1.9 million people (5.8%) reported speaking such a language on a regular basis as a second language (in addition to their main home language, English or French). In all, 20.0% of Canada's population reported speaking a language other than English or French at home. For roughly 6.4 million people, the other language was an immigrant language, spoken most often or on a regular basis at home, alone or together with English or French whereas for more than 213,000 people, the other language was an Indigenous language. Finally, the number of people reporting sign languages as the languages spoken at home was nearly 25,000 people (15,000 most often and 9,800 on a regular basis).\"[nb 4]\n\n\n\n\n## The two official languages[edit]\n\n\n### Home language: rates of language use 1971–2011[edit]\n\n\nThe percentage of the population speaking English, French or both languages most often at home has declined since 1986; the decline has been greatest for French. The proportion of the population who speak neither English nor French in the home has increased. Geographically, this trend remains constant, as usage of English and French have declined in both English and French speaking regions of the country, but French has declined more rapidly both inside and outside Quebec. The table below shows the percentage of the total Canadian population who speak Canada's official languages most often at home from 1971 to 2006.[12] Note that there are nuances between \"language most spoken at home\", \"mother-language\" and \"first official language\": data is collected for all three, which together provide a more detailed and complete picture of language-use in Canada.\n\n\n\n![](image)*Languages – Statistics Canada.*[13]\n### Use of English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Canadian English\n\nIn 2011, just under 21.5 million Canadians, representing 65% of the population, spoke English most of the time at home, while 58% declared it their mother language.[14] English is the major language everywhere in Canada except Quebec and Nunavut, and most Canadians (85%) can speak English.[15] While English is not the preferred language in Quebec, 36.1% of Québécois can speak English.[16] Nationally, Francophones are five times more likely to speak English than Anglophones are to speak French – 44% and 9% respectively.[17] Only 3.2% of Canada's English-speaking population resides in Quebec—mostly in Montreal.[nb 5]\n\n\nIn 2011, 28.4 million Canadians had knowledge of English while only 21.6 million Canadians spoke it most often at home.[18][19]\n\n\n\n### Use of French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Canadian French and French language in Canada\n\nIn 2011, just over 7.1 million Canadians spoke French most often at home, this was a rise of 4.2%, although the proportion of people in Canada who spoke French \"most often\" at home fell slightly from 21.7% to 21.5% . Of these, about 6.1 million or 85% resided in Quebec.[20] Outside Quebec, the largest French-speaking populations are found in New Brunswick (which is home to 3.1% of Canada's Francophones) and Ontario (4.2%, residing primarily in the eastern and northeastern parts of the province and in Toronto and Ottawa). Overall, 22% of people in Canada declare French to be their mother language, while one in three Canadians speak French and 70% are unilingual Anglophones.[nb 6] Smaller indigenous French-speaking communities exist in some other provinces.[21] For example, a vestigial community exists on Newfoundland's Port au Port Peninsula; a remnant of the \"French Shore\" along the island's west coast.\n\n\nThe percentage of the population who speak French both by mother tongue and home language has decreased over the past three decades. Whereas the number of those who speak English at home is higher than the number of people whose mother tongue is English, the opposite is true for Francophones. There are fewer people who speak French at home, than learned French after birth.[22]\n\n\nEthnic diversity is growing in French Canada but still lags behind the English-speaking parts of the country. In 2006, 91.5% of Quebecers considered themselves to be of either \"French\" or \"Canadian\" origin. As a result of the growth in immigration, since the 1970s, from countries in which French is a widely used language, 3.4% of Quebecers indicated that they were of Haitian, Belgian, Swiss, Lebanese or Moroccan origin.[23] Other groups of non-francophone immigrants (Irish Catholics, Italian, Portuguese, etc.) have also assimilated into French over the generations. The Irish, who started arriving in large numbers in Quebec in the 1830s, were the first such group, which explains why it has been possible for Quebec to have had five premiers of Irish ethnic origin: John Jones Ross (1884–87), Edmund James Flynn (1896–97), Daniel Johnson Sr. (1966–68), Pierre-Marc Johnson (1985), and Daniel Johnson Jr. (1994).\n\n\nIn 1991, due to linguistic assimilation of Francophones outside Quebec, over one million Canadians who claimed English as their mother tongue were of French ethnic origin (1991 Census).\n\n\n\n### Bilingualism and multilingualism versus English–French bilingualism[edit]\n\n\n* ![Ability of Canadians to speak English and French 1931–2001.[24]](image)\n\nAbility of Canadians to speak English and French 1931–2001.[24]\n* ![Rate of bilingualism (French and English) in Quebec and the rest of Canada, 1941–2006.[25]](image)\n\nRate of bilingualism (French and English) in Quebec and the rest of Canada, 1941–2006.[25]\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 98.2% of Canadian residents have knowledge of one or both of the country's two official languages,[15] Between 2006 and 2011, the number of persons who reported being able to conduct a conversation in both of Canada's official languages increased by nearly 350,000 to 5.8 million. The bilingualism rate of the Canadian population edged up from 17.4% in 2006 to 17.5% in 2011.[11] This growth of English-French bilingualism in Canada was mainly due to the increased number of Quebecers who reported being able to conduct a conversation in English and French.[11]\n\n\nBilingualism with regard to nonofficial languages also increased, most individuals speaking English plus an immigrant language such as Punjabi or Mandarin.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Geographic distribution of English–French bilingualism[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Bilingual belt\n\n* ![Geographical distribution of bilingual Canadians as compared to total Canadian population 1941–2006.

In Quebec, the rate of bilingualism has increased from 26% of the population being able to speak English and French in 1951 to 42.5% in 2011.[15] As of 2011, in the rest of Canada (excluding Quebec) the rate of bilingualism was 7.5%.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of French-English bilingualism by province/territory (2016 census)\n| Province/territory\n | % of population\n | Total number\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Quebec\n | 44.5%\n | 3,586,410\n | [39] |\n| New Brunswick\n | 34%\n | 249,950\n | [40] |\n| Northwest Territories\n | 14%\n | 4,900\n | [41] |\n| Prince Edward Island\n | 13%\n | 17,840\n | [42] |\n| Ontario\n | 11.2%\n | 1,490,390\n | [43] |\n| Nova Scotia\n | 10.5%\n | 95,380\n | [44] |\n| Yukon\n | 10.3%\n | 4,275\n | [45] |\n| Manitoba\n | 9%\n | 108,460\n | [46] |\n| Alberta\n | 7%\n | 264,720\n | [47] |\n| British Columbia\n | 7%\n | 314,925\n | [48] |\n| Saskatchewan\n | 5%\n | 51,560\n | [49] |\n| Newfoundland and Labrador\n | 5%\n | 25,940\n | [50] |\n| Nunavut\n | 4.3%\n | 1,525\n | [51] |\n| **Canada**—*Total* | 17.9%\n | 6,216,065\n | [39] |\n\n\n#### English–French bilingualism rates[edit]\n\n\nEnglish–French bilingualism is highest among members of local linguistic minorities. It is very uncommon for Canadians to be capable of speaking only the minority official language of their region (French outside Quebec or English in Quebec). Only 1.5% of Canadians are able to speak only the minority official language, and of these most (90%) live in the bilingual belt.[52]\n\n\nAs the table below shows, rates of bilingualism are much higher among individuals who belong to the linguistic minority group for their region of Canada, than among members of the local linguistic majority. For example, within Quebec around 37% of bilingual Canadians are Francophones, whereas Francophones only represent 4.5% of the population outside Quebec.[53]\n\n\n\n\n\nRates of French-English bilingualism among linguistic groups.[54]\n|  | Anglophones | Francophones | Allophones |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Quebec | 66.1%\n | 36.6%\n | 50.4%\n |\n| Rest of Canada | 7.1%\n | 85.1%\n | 5.7%\n |\n\n\n### Official language minority communities[edit]\n\n\nFrench-speaking Canadians from outside Quebec and English-speaking Quebecers are, together, the official language minority communities.

A continuity index of less than one indicates that French has more losses than gains – that more people with French as a mother tongue speak another language at home. Outside Quebec, New Brunswick has the highest French language continuity ratio. British Columbia and Saskatchewan have the lowest French language continuity ratio and thus the lowest retention of French. From 1971 to 2011, the overall ratio for French language continuity outside Quebec declined from 0.73 to 0.45. Declines were the greatest for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench language continuity ratio 1971–2011[61][62]\n| Province/Territory\n | 1971\n | 1981\n | 1991\n | 1996\n | 2001\n | 2006\n | 2011\n | 2021\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New Brunswick | 0.92\n | 0.93\n | 0.93\n | 0.92\n | 0.91\n | 0.91\n | 0.89\n | 0.89\n |\n| Quebec | -\n | -\n | 1.01\n | 1.01\n | 1.02\n | 1.03\n | 1.03\n | 1.03\n |\n| Nunavut | -\n | -\n | -\n | -\n | 0.54\n | 0.57\n | 0.58\n | 0.65\n |\n| Canada | -\n | -\n | 0.96\n | 0.96\n | 0.96\n | 0.97\n | 0.97\n | 0.98\n |\n| Ontario | 0.73\n | 0.72\n | 0.63\n | 0.61\n | 0.60\n | 0.60\n | 0.57\n | 0.55\n |\n| Nova Scotia | 0.69\n | 0.69\n | 0.59\n | 0.57\n | 0.56\n | 0.53\n | 0.51\n | 0.46\n |\n| Prince Edward Island | 0.60\n | 0.64\n | 0.53\n | 0.53\n | 0.48\n | 0.49\n | 0.47\n | 0.45\n |\n| Manitoba | 0.65\n | 0.60\n | 0.49\n | 0.47\n | 0.46\n | 0.45\n | 0.42\n | 0.40\n |\n| Yukon | 0.30\n | 0.45\n | 0.43\n | 0.46\n | 0.46\n | 0.49\n | 0.57\n | 0.58\n |\n| Northwest Territories | 0.50\n | 0.51\n | 0.47\n | 0.43\n | 0.39\n | 0.46\n | 0.51\n | 0.54\n |\n| Newfoundland and Labrador | 0.63\n | 0.72\n | 0.47\n | 0.42\n | 0.42\n | 0.36\n | 0.46\n | 0.39\n |\n| Alberta | 0.49\n | 0.49\n | 0.36\n | 0.32\n | 0.33\n | 0.33\n | 0.36\n | 0.35\n |\n| Saskatchewan | 0.50\n | 0.41\n | 0.33\n | 0.29\n | 0.26\n | 0.26\n | 0.26\n | 0.25\n |\n| British Columbia | 0.30\n | 0.35\n | 0.28\n | 0.29\n | 0.29\n | 0.30\n | 0.29\n | 0.30\n |\n\n\n## Non-official languages spoken in Canada[edit]\n\n\n### Indigenous languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indigenous languages of the Americas and List of endangered languages in Canada\n\nSee also: Canadian Aboriginal syllabics\n\nCanada is home to a rich variety of Indigenous languages, most of which are spoken nowhere else. There are 14 Indigenous language groups in Canada with about 100 distinct languages and dialects, including many sign languages.[63] Almost all Indigenous languages in Canada are considered endangered, with the exception of Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun, and the Cree varieties Naskapi, Atikamekw, East Cree, and Plains Cree.[64] Prior to colonization, multilingualism was common across Indigenous nations, many of whom often seasonally migrated. However, the reserve system created more permanent stationary bands, which have generally selected only one of their various ancestral languages to try to preserve in the face of increasing Anglicization, Francization,[65] or Amslanization (the process by which American Sign Language replaces local sign languages).[66] In addition, the residential school system attempted to institutionally exterminate languages and cultures from coast to coast to coast. The genocidal methods (such as physical and sexual abuse, as well as death rates as high as one in twenty children[67]) resulted in a sharp declines in language use across all nations,[68] including amongst deaf and signing communities.[69]\n\n\nTwo of Canada's territories give official status to native languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun, known collectively as Inuktut, are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government.[70][71] In the Northwest Territories, the *Official Languages Act* declares that there are eleven different languages: Cree, Dënësųłıné, Dene Yatıé / Dene Zhatıé,[nb 1] English, French, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́ / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́,[nb 1] and Tłįchǫ.[9] Besides English and French, these languages are not vehicular in government; official status entitles citizens to receive services in them on request and to deal with the government in them.[72]\n\n\nAwaiting royal assent in October 2022 on Treaty Day, Nova Scotia has affirmed Mi'kmawi'simk as the \"First Language\" of the province through a bill titled the \"Mi'kmaw Language Act\" (No. 148). The Act establishes a language committee co-developed and co-run by Miꞌkmaw Kinaꞌmatnewey as well as ensuring \"government support for the preservation, revitalization, promotion and protection of the Mi’kmaw language for generations to come,\" collaboratively developing strategy between the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia and the Government of Nova Scotia.[2]\n\n\nAccording to the 2016 census, less than one per cent of Canadians (213,225) reported an Indigenous language as their mother tongue, and less than one per cent of Canadians (137,515) reported an Indigenous language as the language spoken most often at home.[73] Whilst most Canadian Indigenous languages are endangered and their current speaker numbers are frequently low, the number of speakers has grown and even outpaced the number with an indigenous mother tongue, indicating that many people continue to learn the languages even if not initially raised with them.[74]\n\n\nGiven the destruction of Indigenous state structures, academics usually classify Indigenous peoples of Canada by region into \"culture areas\", or by their language family.[75]\n\n\n\n* Arctic cultural area (Inuit languages, including Inuit Sign Language)\n* Subarctic culture area (Na-Dene and Algonquian languages)\n* Eastern Woodlands (Northeast) cultural area (Algonquian and Iroquoian languages)\n* Plains cultural area (Algonquian, Plains Sign, and Siouan languages)\n* Northwest Plateau cultural area (Ktunaxa, Na-Dene, and Salishan languages, including Secwepemcékst[76] and *Plateau Sign Language*)\n* Northwest Coast cultural area (Haida, Salishan, Tsimshianic, and Wakashan languages, possibly including Coast Salish Sign Language[76])\n\n\n\n\n| Indigenous languages\n | No. of speakers\n | Mother tongue | Home language\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cree (n.o.s.)[nb 7][a] | 99,950\n | 78,855\n | 47,190\n |\n| Inuktitut | 35,690\n | 32,010\n | 25,290\n |\n| Ojibwemowin | 32,460\n | 11,115\n | 11,115\n |\n| Innu–Naskapi | 11,815\n | 10,970\n | 9,720\n |\n| Denesuline | 11,130\n | 9,750\n | 7,490\n |\n| Oji-Cree (Anishininimowin) | 12,605\n | 8,480\n | 8,480\n |\n| Mi'kmawi'simk | 8,750\n | 7,365\n | 3,985\n |\n| Siouan languages (Dakota/Nakota) | 6,495\n | 5,585\n | 3,780\n |\n| Atikamekw | 5,645\n | 5,245\n | 4,745\n |\n| Blackfoot | 4,915\n | 3,085\n | 3,085\n |\n| Tłįchǫ | 2,645\n | 2,015\n | 1,110\n |\n| Algonquin (Omàmìwininìmowin) | 2,685\n | 1,920\n | 385\n |\n| Dakelh | 2,495\n | 1,560\n | 605\n |\n| Gitxsanimaax | 1,575\n | 1,175\n | 320\n |\n| Tsilhqot'in | 1,400\n | 1,070\n | 435\n |\n| Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́ /Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́[nb 1] | 1,235\n | 650\n | 650\n |\n| Dené Dháh / Dene Yatıé / Dene Zhatıé[nb 1] | 2,315\n | 600\n | 600\n |\n| Wəlastəkey latowewakən | 790\n | 535\n | 140\n |\n| Inuinnaqtun | 580\n | 370\n | 70\n |\n| Gwich’in | 570\n | 355\n | 25\n |\n| Kanienʼkéha | 615\n | 290\n | 20\n |\n| Secwepemctsín | 1,650\n | 250\n | 250\n |\n| Nisg̱a'a | 1,090\n | 250\n | 250\n |\n| Tlingit | 175\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Atgangmuurngniq | 47[77] | Unknown\n | Unknown\n |\n| Onʌyota'a:ká Sign Language[b] | Unknown\n | Unknown\n | Unknown\n |\n| Plains Sign Talk[b] | Unknown\n | Unknown\n | Unknown\n |\n| Secwepemcékst[b] | Unknown\n | Unknown\n | Unknown\n |\n\n\nSource: Statistics Canada, *2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship* Ottawa, 2007, pp. 2, 6, 10.[63]  \n**a** There exist numerous Cree languages, such as Plains Cree (*nêhiyawêwin* ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ), Woods Cree (*nīhithawīwin* ᓃᐦᐃᖬᐑᐏᐣ), Swampy Cree (E: *nêhinawêwin* ᓀᐦᐃᓇᐌᐎᐣ, W: *ininîmowin* ᐃᓂᓃᒧᐎᓐ), Moose Cree (*ililîmowin* ᐃᓕᓖᒧᐎᓐ), and East Cree (N: *Iyiniu-Ayamiwin* ᐄᓅ ᐊᔨᒨᓐ S: *Iyiyiu-Ayamiwin* ᐄᔨᔫ ᐊᔨᒨᓐ).  \n**b** Although small in number,[76] these languages have been included without data to show the disparity in information between oral and sign languages.

The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade and (in some cases) intermarriage led to the development of hybrid languages. These languages tended to be highly localized, were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language, and often persisted only briefly, before being wiped out by the arrival of a large population of permanent settlers, speaking either English or French.\n\n\n\n#### Belle Isle Pidgin[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Labrador Inuit Pidgin French\n\nSpoken until about 1760, this pidgin was spoken between Breton and Basque fishermen and NunatuKavummiut of NunatuKavut (Labrador).\n\n\n\n#### Bungee[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Bungi Creole\n\nNamed from the Ojibwe word *bangii* meaning \"a little bit,\"[80][81] the meagrely documented Bungi Creole (also known as Bungee, Bungy, Bungie, Bungay, and as the Red River Dialect) is a mixed language predominantly anchored in English that evolved within the Prairie Métis community, specifically the Countryborn or Anglo-Métis. Due to the multicultural nature of the Red River Settlement, Bungi was influenced by Scottish English, Nehiyawewin, Nakawemowin, the Orcadian dialect of Scots, Norn, Scottish Gaelic, and Canadian French.[82][83][84] The vocabulary and word order were primarily English, but the speech was lilting like that of Gaelic speakers, with pronunciation and structural shifts coming from the Cree languages, such as: *shawl* becoming *sawl*, *she* becoming *see*, and the popular greeting *I’m well, you but?*.[85] Bungi reached its peak in the nineteenth century, with about 5,000 Countryborn native speakers of the dialect in 1870. However, over the next century, standard Canadian English gradually replaced it; and by the late 1980s, only a handful of elderly speakers remained. It is generally considered to be asleep today.[85]\n\n\n\n#### Chiac[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chiac\n\nSpoken in the Maritime provinces (mostly in New Brunswick), Chiac is a creole language with a linguistic base in Acadian French and Maritime English with significant contributions from Mi'kmawi'simk and the Maliseet language.[86] Notable for its code-switching between English and French, it is often popularly considered a variant of Franglais, with examples such as: *Espère-moi su'l'corner, j'traverse le ch'min pi j'viens right back* (Wait for me at the corner, I'm crossing the road and I'll be right back) and *On va amarrer ça d'même pour faire sûr que ça tchenne*[87] (We will tie it like this to make sure it stays).[87] However, Chiac is not simply a *Franglais*/*Frenglish* mix of French and English, as it differs distinctly from other French-English mixed-use cases such as those found amongst Fransaskois or Ontarois.[88][89]\n\n\n\n#### Chinook Jargon[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chinook Wawa\n\nIn British Columbia, Yukon and throughout the Pacific Northwest, a pidgin language known as the Chinook Jargon (also rendered \"Chinook Wawa\") emerged in the early 19th century that was a combination of Chinookan, Nootka, Chehalis, French and English, with a smattering of words from other languages including Hawaiian and Spanish.[90] Later in that century, it had creolized in the Pacific Northwest. Certain words and expressions remain current in local use, such as skookum, tyee, and saltchuck, while a few have become part of worldwide English (\"high mucketymuck\" or \"high muckamuck\" for a high-ranking and perhaps self-important official).\n\n\n\n#### Franglais[edit]\n\n\nA portmanteau language which is said to combine English and French syntax, grammar and lexicons to form a unique interlanguage, is sometimes ascribed to mandatory basic French education in the Canadian anglophone school systems. Many unilingual anglophone Canadians, for instance, will borrow French words into their sentences. Simple words and phrases like \"*C'est quoi ça?*\" (what is that?) or words like \"*arrête*\" (stop) can alternate with their English counterparts. This phenomenon is more common in the eastern half of the country where there is a greater density of Francophone populations. Franglais can also refer to the supposed degradation of the French language thanks to the overwhelming impact Canadian English has on the country's Francophone inhabitants, though many linguists would argue that while English vocabulary can be freely borrowed as a stylistic device, the grammar of French has been resistant to influences from English[91] and the same conservatism holds true in Canadian English grammar,[92] even in Quebec City.\n\n\n\n#### Haida Jargon[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Haida Jargon\n\nA pidgin trade language based on Haida, known as Haida Jargon, was used in the 1830s in and around Haida Gwaii. It was used by speakers of English, Haida, Coast Tsimshian, Heiltsuk, and other languages.\n\n\n\n#### Loucheux Jargon[edit]\n\n\nAs a result of cultural contact between the Gwich'in (formerly called \"Loucheaux\") and Europeans (predominately French coureurs des bois and voyageurs), a pidgin language was historically used across Gwich'in Nành, Denendeh.[93] The language is often called in English \"Jargon Loucheux\" using the traditional French syntax.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Michif[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Michif\n\nMichif (also known as Mitchif, Mechif, Michif-Cree, Métif, Métchif, and French Cree) is a mixed language which evolved within the Prairie Métis community that was oriented towards Cree and Franco-Catholic culture. It is based on elements of Cree and French along with elements of Ojibwa, Assiniboine. Michif is today spoken by less than 1,000 individuals in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and North Dakota. At its peak, around 1900, Michif was understood by perhaps three times this number.\n\n\n\n#### Nootka Jargon[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Nootka Jargon\n\nBased in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and likely one precursor to Chinook Wawa, Nootka Jargon was a trade language derived from Nuučaan̓uł, English, Spanish, and Russian, as well as other local languages.\n\n\n\n#### Slavey Jargon[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Slavey Jargon\n\nAlso known as \"Broken Slavey,\" this language was spoken until the mid-1900s, abruptly diminishing due to the influx of English into Denendeh and Inuit Nunangat.[95] Documentation has also shown that the language was spoken by a range of fur traders, postmasters, and their wives, sisters, and daughters, who were often of Métis descent.[95] The native languages of speakers who used Slavey Jargon were Denesuline, French, Gwich'in, Inuktitut, and the languages collectively known as \"Slavey\" (North: Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́, K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́, and Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́; South: Dene Yatıé or Dene Zhatıé and Dené Dháh). The Dene, Inuit, French, British, and Métis who spoke the language did so predominately for preaching the gospel, teasing and harassing clergymen, and for interpersonal relationships.[95] The use of Slavey Jargon can be characterized as an innovation employed by speakers in order to meet several linguistic goals, such as introductions, advice, and disputes.[95] Mishler specified, \"For all these reasons, Slavey Jargon seems inaccurate to characterize it strictly as a trade jargon\" (p. 277).[95]\n\n\nSpoken predominately in the Liard and Dehcho Countries of Denendeh, the nouns of the language generally consisted of English, Dënësųłınë́ Yatıé, Sahtúgot’įné / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́, and Dene Yatıé/Zhatıé, whereas the verbs and pronouns are derived from French. Adverbs are typically pulled from Dënësųłınë́ and Gwich’in. There is, however, a lot of variation in Slavey Jargon. Gwich’in verbs can be mixed with French nouns or phonemically modified French sentences exist.[95]\n\n\n\n#### Souriquois[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Algonquian–Basque pidgin\n\nSpoken alongside the Basque/Breton–Inuit Belle Isle pidgin was another pidgin language that developed in the 16th century amongst the Basque in coastal areas along the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Strait of Belle Isle as the result of contact between Basque whalers and local Algonquian peoples, notably the Mi'kmaq.[96] The name \"Souriquois\" has an obscure history and most likely refers to region around Souris and the Basque suffix *koa*, perhaps from *zurikoa* “that of the whites.\"[97]\n\n\n\n### Sign languages[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Deaf life for Indigenous peoples in Canada\n![](image)Attested historical ranges of sign languages of the US and Canada excluding ASL and LSQ.  \n |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Plains Sign Talk\n Atgangmuurngniq\n Hawai'i Sign Language\n Maritime Sign Language\n | Plateau Sign Language\n Martha's Vineyard Sign Language\n Henniker Sign Language\n Sandy River Valley Sign Language\n |\n\nAlongside the numerous and varied oral languages, Canada also boasts several sign languages. Currently, Canada is home to some five or more sign languages (that number rising with the probability that Plains Sign Talk is actually a language family with several languages under its umbrella), belonging to four to six distinct language families, those being: French Sign Language family, BANZSL family, the Plains Sign family, the Inuit Sign isolate, perhaps the Coast Salish Sign isolate, and perhaps a Plateau Sign family composed of Secwepemcékst and Ktunaxa Sign Language.\n\n\nAs with all sign languages around the world that developed naturally, these are natural, human languages distinct from any oral language. As such, American Sign Language (unlike Signed English) is no more a derivation of English than Russian is,[98] all being distinct languages from one another. Some languages present here were trade pidgins which were used first as a system of communication across national and linguistic boundaries of First Nations, however, they have since developed into mature languages as children learned them as a first language.\n\n\nThe sign languages of Canada share extremely limited rights within the country in large due to the general population's misinformation on the subject. Ontario is the only province or territory to formally make legal any sign language, enabling the use of American Sign Language, Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) and \"First Nation Sign Language\" (which could refer to Plains Sign Talk, Oneida Sign Language, or any other language) in only the domains of education, legislation and judiciary proceedings.[99] The only other language afforded any other rights is Inuiuuk, which sees interpretation in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut.[100] There have been efforts to make LSQ an official language of Quebec, but all efforts have failed.[101]\n\n\n\n#### American Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nThe most spoken sign language in Canada, American Sign Language or ASL, can be found across the country in mostly anglophone regions. The ties with anglophone Canada are not due to ASL and English's similarity, but to cultural similarities and linguistic history (as several ASL words are borrowed from English). As such, ASL can be found in areas where English is not the primary language, such as Montreal or Nunavut. ASL is part of the French Sign Language (Francosign) family, originating on the East Coast of the United States from a mix of *Langue des signes françaises* (LSF) and other local languages.\n\n\n\n#### Coast Salish Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nThere is evidence that Coast Salish citizens speak a distinct language.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Hand Talk[edit]\n\n\nOriginally a trade pidgin, Plains Sign Talk, also known as Plains Standard or Prairie Sign Language, became a full language after children began to learn the language as a first language across many Nations.[*citation needed*] From \"HANDS\" and \"TO TALK TO,\" Hand Talk was used as a *lingua franca* across linguistic and national boundaries[102] across the continent and the language stretched across the provinces down through Mexico.[103] As Plains Sign Talk was so widespread and was a spectrum of dialects and accents, it probably hosted several languages under its umbrella. One is potentially Navajo Sign Language which is in use by a sole Navajo clan.[104]\n\n\n\n##### Oneida Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nBorn out of the Oneida Nation, OSL is a mixed language, descended primarily from both Prairie Sign Language (or Hand Talk) and the oral Oneida language, with some additions from ASL.[105] Onʌyota'a:ká (or Oneida) Sign Language is a young and growing language, spreading especially amongst deaf Oneida citizens.[106][76]\n\n\n\n#### Inuit Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nInuit Sign Language, also known as Atgangmuurngniq or Uukturausingit, is a critically endangered language with some 50 speakers remaining. It is a language isolate and has only be found by researchers in Nunavut; however, there are theories it extends across the Arctic Circle.[77] Little is known about its history, but efforts are being made to document and revitalize the language.[107]\n\n\n\n#### Maritime Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nMaritime Sign Language is a BANZSL language. It was used as the language of education for Deaf populations in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island before ASL became available in the mid-20th century. It is still remembered by some elderly people but is moribund. The language, living alongside ASL, has produced a unique dialect of ASL in The Maritimes due to mixing of the languages. The exact number of speakers is unknown.\n\n\n\n#### Plateau Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nAnother trade pidgin that may have become a separate language, Plateau Sign Language replaced Plains Sign Talk in the Columbia Plateau and surrounding regions of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It is now extinct.\n\n\n\n##### Ktunaxa Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nCalled *ʾa·qanⱡiⱡⱡitnam* in the Ktunaxa language,[108] Ktunaxa Sign Language has historically been spoken in Ktunaxa ɁamakaɁis (Ktunaxa Country).[109]\n\n\n\n##### Secwépemc Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nPerhaps related to or descended from the old Plateau Sign Language, Secwepemcékst or Secwépemc Sign Language is spoken by a small number of Secwépemc citizens.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Quebec Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nAlongside ASL, Quebec Sign Language or LSQ (*Langue des signes québécoise*) is the second most spoken sign language in the country. Centred mainly around and within Quebec, LSQ can also be found in Ontario, New Brunswick and various other parts of the country, generally around francophone communities due to historical ties to the French language. Although approximately 10% of the population of Quebec is deaf or hard-of-hearing, it is estimated that only 50,000 to 60,000 children use LSQ as their native language. LSQ is part of the Francosign family with ASL. As such, both languages are mutually intelligible.\n\n\n\n### Canadian dialects of European languages[edit]\n\n\n#### Acadian French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Acadian French\n\nAcadian French is a unique form of Canadian French which incorporates not only distinctly Canadian phrases but also nautical terms, English loanwords, linguistic features found only in older forms of French as well as ones found in the Maritimer English dialect.\n\n\n\n##### Brayon French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Brayon\n\nA sub-dialect of Acadian French, Brayon French is spoken by those in Madawaska County of New Brunswick. The language is a mix of Acadian and Quebec French with influence from the local Mi'kmaw and Maliseet languages, with only slight differentiation from the more standard Acadian French.[110][111][112]\n\n\n\n#### Québec French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Québec French\n\nAs the most spoken variety of French in Canada, Québec French contains a significant number of dialects, generally grouped in two: the \"old\" dialects of the territories at the time of the British conquest and the \"new\" dialects that arose post-conquest.\n\n\n\n##### Chaouin French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chaouin\n\nAround 1615 as the coureurs des bois moved past the city of Quebec, those who settled in *Ndakinna* (Abenaki land) developed unique features still found today, especially in the Bois-Francs region South of the St. Lawrence.\n\n\n\n##### Joual French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Joual\n\nOriginally the dialect of the French-speaking working class in Montréal, the cultural renaissance connected to the Quiet Revolution have resulted in Joual being spoken by people across the educational and economic spectrum.\n\n\n\n##### Màgoua French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Magoua dialect\n\nPossibly deriving from the Atikamekw word for \"loon\" (*makwa*; standard French: *huard*), the French spoken by the Magoua community is one of the most conservative French dialects in North America. This basilectal dialect is found in Nitaskinan as the Trois-Rivières region became the first stronghold of the coureurs des bois outside the city of Quebec in 1615. Magoua French preserves the sontaient (\"étaient\") characteristic of Métis French and Cajun French, has a creole-like past tense particle tà, and has old present-tense contraction of a former verb \"to be\" that behave in the same manner as subject clitics.\n\n\n\n#### Métis French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Métis French\n\nAlongside Michif and Bungi, the Métis dialect of French is one of the traditional languages of the Métis people, and the French-dialect source of the Michif language.[113] Métis French is a variety of Canadian French with some added characters Ññ, Áá, Óó, and Ææ (from older French spellings), such as: *il ñá ócun nævus sur ce garçon* English: \"there is no birthmark on this boy.\"[56] There are also significant amounts of words loaned from Indigenous languages such as Ojibwemowin, Dane-zaa Ẕáágéʔ (Beaver), and several Cree languages.[57] Like Michif, Métis French is spoken predominantly in Manitoba as well as adjacent provinces and US states.[114] As a general rule, Métis individuals tend to speak one or the other, rarely both.[55]\n\n\n\n#### Newfoundland French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Newfoundland French\n\nTracing their origins to Continental French fishermen who settled in the late 1800s and early 1900s, rather than the Québécois, Newfoundland French (or *français terre-neuvien*) refers to the French spoken on the Port au Port Peninsula (part of the so-called “French Shore”) of Newfoundland. Some Acadians of the Maritimes also settled in the area. For this reason, Newfoundland French is most closely related to the Breton and Norman French of nearby St-Pierre-et-Miquelon. Today, heavy contact with Acadian French—and especially widespread bilingualism with Newfoundland English—have taken their toll, and the community is in decline. The degree to which lexical features of Newfoundland French constitute a distinct dialect is not presently known. It is uncertain how many speakers survive; the dialect could be moribund. There is a provincial advocacy organisation *Fédération des Francophones de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador*, representing both the Peninsular French and Acadian French communities.\n\n\n\n#### Ontarois French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Franco-Ontarian § Franco-Ontarian French\n\nAlthough quite similar to Quebec French, the dialect of the Ontarois or Franco-Ontarians maintains distinctive features. These include the progressive disappearance of the subjunctive, the use of the possessive *á*, the transfer of rules from English to French, e.g., \"*J’ai vu un film sur/à la télévision*\" which comes from \"I saw a film on television\", or \"*Je vais à la maison/chez moi*\" coming from \"I'm going home,\" and the loaning of English conjunctions such as \"so\" for *ça fait que* or *alors*.\n\n\n\n#### Black English[edit]\n\n\nIn what is also called Black Canadian, Afro-Canadian, or African Canadian English, there exist several varieties of English spoken by Black Canadians. The most well-established is the dialect spoken by Afro-Nova Scotians.[115] In places like Toronto where there is a large population of Afro-Caribbean descendants and newcomers, localized varieties of Black English take on elements of Caribbean English, as well as mixing with African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). Although AAVE is not nearly as widespread in Canada as it is across the United States, Black Canadians have various lines of connection to the dialect. Sometimes that connection is historical, such as with Black Nova Scotians; sometimes it is hegemonic, where Afro-Canadians adopt speech mannerisms from the larger United States; sometimes it is diasporic, where communities of African-American newcomers or African-American descendants coalesce, especially in larger cities.\n\n\n\n##### Afro-Nova Scotian English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: African-American English § African Nova Scotian English\n\nAfrican Nova Scotian English is spoken by descendants of Black Nova Scotians, black immigrants from the United States. Though most African American freedom seekers in Canada ended up in Ontario through the Underground Railroad, only the dialect of African Nova Scotians retains the influence of West African pidgin.[116] In the 19th century, African Nova Scotian English would have been indistinguishable from English spoken in Jamaica or Suriname.[117] However, it has been increasingly de-creolized since this time, due to interaction and influence from the white Nova Scotian population. Desegregation of the province's school boards in 1964 further accelerated the process of de-creolization. The language is a relative of the African-American Vernacular English, with significant variations unique to the group's history in the area.[118][119] There are noted differences in the dialects of those from Guysborough County (Black Loyalists), and those from North Preston (Black Refugees), the Guysborough group having been in the province three generations earlier.[119]\n\n\nHowe and Walker use data from early recordings of African Nova Scotian English, Samaná English, and the recordings of former slaves to demonstrate that speech patterns were inherited from nonstandard colonial English.[120] The dialect was extensively studied in 1992 by Shana Poplack and Sali Tagliamonte from the University of Ottawa.[119]\n\n\nA commonality between African Nova Scotian English and African-American Vernacular English is (r)-deletion. This rate of deletion is 57% among Black Nova Scotians, and 60% among African Americans in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, in the surrounding mostly white communities of Nova Scotia, (r)-deletion does not occur.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Cascadian English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pacific Northwest English\n\nThe English language in British Columbia shares numerous features with the neighbouring states of Washington and Oregon, such as the /æɡ/ raising (found words such as bag, vague and bagel). Boreal Cascadian English speakers exhibit more vowel retraction of /æ/ before nasals than people from Toronto, and younger speakers in the Greater Vancouver area do not raise /aʊ/ as much, but keep the drop in intonation, causing \"about\" to sound slightly like \"a baht.\" The \"o\" in such words as holy, goal, load, know, etc. is pronounced as a close-mid back rounded vowel, [o], but not as rounded as in the Prairies where there are strong Scandinavian, Slavic and German influences, which can lend to a more stereotypical \"Canadian\" accent.\n\n\n\n#### Indigenous English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Aboriginal English in Canada\n\nThe varieties of English spoken by Indigenous people are phonologically influenced by their first or traditional languages. This has resulted in an identifiable dialect spectrum distinct from other Canadian English dialects. Due to the ongoing stigmatization of Indigenous cultures, Indigenous children could be wrongly diagnosed as having a speech impairment or a learning disability, when what is identified by medical professionals are simply the dialectal features.[122]\n\n\nSome written works use Indigenous English dialects. For example, Maria Campbell's book *Stories of the Road Allowance People* is a collection of Métis folktales. An excerpt from that work illustrates the type of speech used by Elders in rural Métis communities during her research, but some stories were collected in Cree or other languages and translated into dialectical English by Campbell:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Dere wasen very much he can steal from dah table anyways  \n> 'cept da knives and forks.  \n> An Margareet he knowed he wouldn dare take dem  \n> cause dat woman you know  \n> hees gots a hell of a repetation for being a hardheaded woman  \n> when he gets mad.  \n> Dat man he have to be a damn fool to steal from hees table. - *Dah Teef*[123]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Lunenburg English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lunenburg English\n\nSpoken in Lunenburg and Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia, this moribund dialect is sometimes called \"Lunenburg Dutch\" due to its rooting in the large Kurpfalzisch and Württembergisch population who settled the town. Although the German language subsided significantly, the English of the town and county continue to be marked by its influence. Indeed, the pronunciation in Lunenburg county is the only Canadian community to be non-rhotic. The accent features Canadian raising and so flight [ˈflʌɪt] has a different vowel from fly [ˈflɑɪ], and the noun house [ˈhoʊs] has a different vowel from the verb house [ˈhɑʊz]. In Lunenburg, the phrase about a boat contains two identical stressed and two identical unstressed vowels: /əˌboʊt ə ˈboʊt/, rather than the Standard Canadian English /əˌbaʊt ə ˈboʊt/, with distinct stressed vowels. Due to German influence, there is the tendency to pronounce /w/ in **w**itch the same as /v/ as in **v**an. Another example is the lack of the dental fricatives /θ/ and /ð/, which are replaced by the alveolar stops /t/ and /d/ (rendering \"thank\" and \"tank\" homophonous as /ˈtæŋk/), and the \"t\" at the end of words is usually silent: \"get\" becomes \"ge.\"\n\n\nFor example, here is a sample of a conversation between two people: \n\n\n\n\n> \n> \"De kids vere over der in da woods, gettin inda dis an dat.\"  \n> \"Dey never did?\"  \n> \"Yeah, an now dey gone da get some of dem der apples you see.\"  \n> \"You don't say?\"  \n> \"No foolin, dey over der now.\"  \n> \"Dey brung some of dem apples over heera da day before.\"  \n> \"Oh, dey vere some good eatin I bet.\"  \n> \"Now look, you make no nevermind, dose vere da best apples I ever did have, dey vas some good.\"  \n> \"Oh, here dey come now, dey bedda know da wash der feet off.\"\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Maritime English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Atlantic Canadian English\n\nSpoken across the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and PEI, this English dialect has been influenced by British and Irish English, Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and some Acadian French, as well as by Mi'kmawi'simk.\n\n\n\n#### Newfoundland English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Newfoundland English\n\nThe initial European settlers to Newfoundland were fishermen from the various coastal villages of the English West Country of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Bristol, and Wiltshire beginning in the 1500s (previously they visited in summer and returned). This set the basic speech patterns for those settlers who fanned out into isolated coves and bays along the island's 9,700 km (6,000 mi) of coastline to take advantage of the scattered off-shore fishing areas. Labrador, today the greater part of \"Newfoundland\", was then sparsely settled. The West Country dialects continued to be spoken in isolated coves and fjords of the island thus preserving varied dialects of what is today referred to as Newfoundland English.\n\n\nIt was not until the 1700s that social disruptions in Ireland sent thousands of Irish from the southeastern counties of Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, and Cork and to the Avalon peninsula in the eastern part of Newfoundland where significant Irish influence on the Newfoundland dialects may still be heard.\n\n\nSome of the Irish immigrants to Newfoundland were native speakers of Irish making Newfoundland the only place outside Europe to have its own Irish dialect. Newfoundland was also the only place outside Europe to have its own distinct name in Irish: *Talamh an Éisc*, which means 'land of the fish'. The Irish language is now extinct in Newfoundland.\n\n\nAfter 400 years, much of the dialectal differences between the isolated settlements has levelled out beginning in the 20th century when faster boats (using gas engines instead of oars or sails), and improved road connections provided easier social contact. As well, influences from mainland North America began to affect the local dialects beginning during WWII when US and Canadian servicemen were stationed in Newfoundland and accelerating after Newfoundland became a Canadian province in 1949. Lack of an official orthography, publications in dialect, speaker attrition and official disinterest in promoting the language has been contributing factors towards a decline of speakers of the older, traditional Newfoundland English in the original settlements.\n\n\n\n#### Ottawa Valley Twang[edit]\n\n\nOttawa Valley Twang is the accent, sometimes referred to as a dialect of English, that is spoken in the Ottawa Valley, in Ontario.[124] The Ottawa Valley is considered to be a linguistic enclave within Ontario.[125]\n\n\n\n#### Quebec English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Quebec English\n\nThe language of English-speaking Quebecers generally aligns to Standard Canadian English, however established ethnic groups retain certain, distinctive lexical features, such as the dialects spoken by Mohawk, Cree, Inuit, Irish, Jewish, Italian, and Greek communities. Isolated fishing villages on the Basse-Côte-Nord speak Newfoundland English, and many Gaspesian English-speakers use Maritime English.\n\n\n\n#### Toronto slang[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Toronto slang\n\nSpoken within the Greater Toronto Area, Toronto slang is the nuanced, multicultural English spoken in the city. This dialect is heavily influenced by the different communities present, most notably the Jamaican, Trinidadian, Guyanese, and other Caribbean communities and their ways of speaking. There is also influence from West African, East African, and South Asian communities.\n\n\n\n#### Canadian Gaelic[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Canadian Gaelic\n\nCanadian Gaelic was spoken by many immigrants who settled in Glengarry County (Ontario) and the Maritimes—predominantly in New Brunswick's Restigouche River valley, central and southeastern Prince Edward Island, and across the whole of northern Nova Scotia—particularly Cape Breton. While the Canadian Gaelic dialect has mostly disappeared, regional pockets persist. These are mostly centred on families deeply committed to their Celtic traditions. Nova Scotia currently has 500–1,000 fluent speakers, mostly in northwestern Cape Breton. There have been attempts in Nova Scotia to institute Gaelic immersion on the model of French immersion. As well, formal post-secondary studies in Gaelic language and culture are available through St. Francis Xavier University, Saint Mary's University, and Cape Breton University\n\n\nIn 1890, a private member's bill was tabled in the Canadian Senate, calling for Gaelic to be made Canada's third official language. However, the bill was defeated 42–7.\n\n\n\n#### Newfoundland Irish[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Irish language in Newfoundland\n\nNewfoundland is home to the largest population of Irish-descendants in Canada and once hosted a thriving Irish Gaelic linguistic community. Although steep declines around the 20th century meant that the Irish language on the Island hardly remains, there exists today strong interest with consistent efforts to revive the language.\n\n\nNewfoundland Irish has left an impact on the English spoken on the Island, including terms like *scrob* \"scratch\" (Irish *scríob*), *sleveen* \"rascal\" (Irish *slíbhín*) and *streel* \"slovenly person\" (Irish *sraoill*), along with grammatical features like the \"after\" perfect as in \"she's already after leavin'\" (Irish *tá sí tar éis imeacht*).[126] As well, both Newfoundland (*Talamh an Éisc*, *Land of the Fish*)[127] and St. John's (*Baile Sheáin*)[128] have distinct names in the Irish-language. The dialect of Irish spoken in Newfoundland is said to resemble the Munster Irish of the 18th century.\n\n\nEvents and institutions are increasingly supporting the language with ever larger Céilithe móra, students participating in Conradh na Gaeilge events, people playing Gaelic sports, and Irish film festivals attracting English- and Irish-speakers alike. There is also an Irish language instructor, appointed every year by the Ireland Canada University Foundation, who works at Memorial University in St. John's,[129] where the university's Digital Learning Centre provides resources for learning the Irish language.[130]\n\n\n\n#### Newfoundland Welsh[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Welsh language § Canada\n\nSome Welsh is found in Newfoundland. In part, this is as a result of Welsh settlement since the 17th century. Also, there was an influx of about 1,000 Patagonian Welsh, who migrated to Canada from Argentina after the 1982 Falklands War. Welsh-Argentines are fluent in Spanish as well as English and Welsh.\n\n\n\n#### Canadian Ukrainian[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Canadian Ukrainian\n\nCanada is also home to Canadian Ukrainian, a distinct dialect of the Ukrainian language, spoken mostly in Western Canada by the descendants of first two waves of Ukrainian settlement in Canada who developed in a degree of isolation from their cousins in what was then Austria-Hungary, the Russian Empire, Poland, and the Soviet Union.\n\n\n\n#### Doukhobor Russian[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Doukhobor Russian\n\nCanada's Doukhobor community, especially in Grand Forks and Castlegar, British Columbia, has kept its distinct dialect of Russian. It has a lot in common with South Russian dialects, showing some common features with Ukrainian. This dialect's versions are becoming extinct in their home regions of Georgia and Russia where the Doukhobors have split into smaller groups.\n\n\n\n#### Deitsch[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania Dutch language\n\nA variety of West Central German spoken by the Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonites and other descendants of German immigrants in Canada, Pennsylvania Dutch or Deitsch is closely related to the Palatine dialects of the Upper Rhine Valley.[131] Of the estimated 300,000 speakers, most are found across several US states, whilst there is a sizable community within Ontario.[132]\n\n\n\n#### Hutterisch[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Hutterite German\n\nCentred in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, the Hutterite communities maintain a distinct form of the German language descended from Bavarian dialects spoken in Tyrol (by founder Jacob Hutter). The language shifted in the mid-18th century toward a more Carinthian linguistic base upon the deportation of Landler from Austria to Transylvania. There is only about a 50% intelligibility between Pennsylvania Dutch speakers and Hutterisch.[133] Its speaker base belongs to the *Schmiedleit*, *Lehrerleit*, and *Dariusleit* groups with a few speakers among the older generations of *Prairieleit* (the descendants of those Hutterites who chose not to settle in colonies). Hutterite children who grow up in the colonies first learn and speak Hutterisch before learning English. Of the estimated 34,000 speakers in the world (as of 2003), 85% of them live in 370 communities in Canada.[134] Canadian adults are generally literate in Early New High German (also called \"Biblical German\", the predecessor to Standard German used by Martin Luther) that they employ as the written form for Scriptures, however Hutterisch is, for the most part, an unwritten language.[135]\n\n\n\n#### Plautdietsch[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Plautdietsch language\n\nPlautdietsch is predominantly found in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario where Mennonite communities settled. The Mennonites, or Russian Mennonites as they are sometimes called, descend from Low country Anabaptists who fled from what is today the Netherlands and Belgium in the 16th century to escape persecution and resettled in the Vistula delta.[136] Their language is a fusion of Dutch, West Frisian and Dutch Low Saxon dialects which over time mixed with the East Low German dialects of Werdersch, Nehrungisch and Weichselisch.[137]\n\n\n\n## Official multilingualism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Official bilingualism in Canada and Official bilingualism in the public service of Canada\n\n### Language policy of the federal government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Montreal\nEnglish and French have equal status in federal courts, the Parliament of Canada, as well as in all federal institutions.\n\n\nThe public has the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French. Immigrants who are applying for Canadian citizenship must normally be able to speak either English or French.\n\n\nThe principles of bilingualism in Canada are protected in sections 16 to 23 of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* of 1982 which establishes that:\n\n\n\n* French and English are equal to each other as federal official languages;\n* Debate in Parliament may take place in either official language;\n* Federal laws shall be printed in both official languages, with equal authority;\n* Anyone may deal with any court established by Parliament, in either official language;\n* Everyone has the right to receive services from the federal government in his or her choice of official language;\n* Members of a minority language group of one of the official languages if learned and still understood (i.e., French speakers in a majority English-speaking province, or vice versa) or received primary school education in that language has the right to have their children receive a public education in their language, where numbers warrant.\n\n\nCanada's *Official Languages Act,* first adopted in 1969 and updated in 1988, gives English and French equal status throughout federal institutions.\n\n\n\n### Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories\n\n#### Officially bilingual or multilingual: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the three territories[edit]\n\n\nNew Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Canada's three territories have all given official status to more than one language. In the case of New Brunswick, this means perfect equality. In the other cases, the recognition sometimes amounts to a formal recognition of official languages, but limited services in official languages other than English.\n\n\nThe official languages are:\n\n\n\n* New Brunswick: English and French. New Brunswick has been officially bilingual since the 1960s. The province's officially bilingual status has been entrenched in the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* since 1982.\n* Nova Scotia: Mi'kmawi'simk is considered the province's official \"first language.\"\n* Northwest Territories: Cree, Dënësųłıné, Dene Yatıé / Dene Zhatıé,[nb 1] English, French, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́ / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́,[nb 1] and Tłįchǫ.[9]\n* Nunavut: English, Inuktut (Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun), and French.[138]\n* Yukon: English and French.\n\n\n#### Officially French-only: Quebec[edit]\n\n\nUntil 1969, Quebec was the only officially bilingual province in Canada and most public institutions functioned in both languages. English was also used in the legislature, government commissions and courts. With the adoption of the *Charter of the French Language* (also known as \"Bill 101\") by Quebec's National Assembly in August 1977, however, French became Quebec's sole official language. However, the *Charter of the French Language* enumerates a defined set of language rights for the English language and for Aboriginal languages, and government services are available, to certain citizens and in certain regions, in English. As well, a series of court decisions have forced the Quebec government to increase its English-language services beyond those provided for under the original terms of the *Charter of the French Language*. Regional institutions in the Nunavik region of northern Quebec offer services in Inuktitut and Cree.\n\n\n\n#### *De facto* English only, or limited French-language services: the other eight provinces[edit]\n\n\nMost provinces have laws that make either English or both English and French the official language(s) of the legislature and the courts but may also have separate policies in regards to education and the bureaucracy.\n\n\nFor example, in Alberta, English and French are both official languages of debate in the Legislative Assembly, but laws may be drafted solely in English and there is no legal requirement that they be translated into French. French can be used in some lower courts and education is offered in both languages, but the bureaucracy functions almost solely in English. Therefore, although Alberta is not officially an English-only province, English has a higher *de facto* status than French. Ontario and Manitoba are similar but allow for more services in French at the local level.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geographic distribution[edit]\n\n\nThe following table details the population of

Prior to Confederation, the territories that would become Canada were home to over 70 distinct languages across 12 or so language families. Today, a majority of those indigenous languages are still spoken; however, most are endangered and only about 0.6% of the Canadian population report an Indigenous language as their mother tongue.[nb 3] Since the establishment of the Canadian state, English and French have been the co-official languages and are, by far, the most-spoken languages in the country.\n\n\nAccording to the 2016 census, English and French are the mother tongues of 56.0% and 21.4% of Canadians respectively.[4] In total, 86.2% of Canadians have a working knowledge of English, while 29.8% have a working knowledge of French.[5] Under the *Official Languages Act* of 1969, both English and French have official status throughout Canada in respect of federal government services and most courts. All federal legislation is enacted bilingually. Provincially, only in New Brunswick are both English and French official to the same extent. French is Quebec's official language,[6] although legislation is enacted in both French and English and court proceedings may be conducted in either language. English is the official language of Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta, but government services are available in French in many regions of each, particularly in regions and cities where Francophones form the majority. Legislation is enacted in both languages and courts conduct cases in both. In 2022, Nova Scotia recognized Mi'kmawi'simk as the first language of the province,[1][2] and maintains two provincial language secretariats: the Office of Acadian Affairs and Francophonie (French language) and the Office of Gaelic Affairs (Canadian Gaelic). The remaining provinces (British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland and Labrador) do not have an official provincial language *per se* but government is primarily English-speaking. Territorially, both the Northwest Territories and Nunavut have official Indigenous languages alongside French and English: Inuktut (Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun) in Nunavut[7] and, in the NWT, nine others (Cree, Dënësųłıné, Dene Yatıé/Zhatıé,[nb 1] Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́,[nb 1] and Tłįchǫ Yatıì).[9]\n\n\nCanada's official languages commissioner (the federal government official charged with monitoring the two languages) said in 2009, \"[I]n the same way that race is at the core of what it means to be American and at the core of an American experience and class is at the core of British experience, I think that language is at the core of Canadian experience.\"[10] To assist in more accurately monitoring the two official languages, Canada's census collects a number of demolinguistic descriptors not enumerated in the censuses of most other countries, including home language, mother tongue, first official language, and language of work.\n\n\nCanada's linguistic diversity extends beyond English, French and numerous Indigenous languages. \"In Canada, 4.7 million people (14.2% of the population) reported speaking a language other than English or French most often at home and 1.9 million people (5.8%) reported speaking such a language on a regular basis as a second language (in addition to their main home language, English or French). In all, 20.0% of Canada's population reported speaking a language other than English or French at home. For roughly 6.4 million people, the other language was an immigrant language, spoken most often or on a regular basis at home, alone or together with English or French whereas for more than 213,000 people, the other language was an Indigenous language. Finally, the number of people reporting sign languages as the languages spoken at home was nearly 25,000 people (15,000 most often and 9,800 on a regular basis).\"[nb 4]\n\n\n\n\n## The two official languages[edit]\n\n\n### Home language: rates of language use 1971–2011[edit]\n\n\nThe percentage of the population speaking English, French or both languages most often at home has declined since 1986; the decline has been greatest for French. The proportion of the population who speak neither English nor French in the home has increased. Geographically, this trend remains constant, as usage of English and French have declined in both English and French speaking regions of the country, but French has declined more rapidly both inside and outside Quebec. The table below shows the percentage of the total Canadian population who speak Canada's official languages most often at home from 1971 to 2006.[12] Note that there are nuances between \"language most spoken at home\", \"mother-language\" and \"first official language\": data is collected for all three, which together provide a more detailed and complete picture of language-use in Canada.\n\n\n\n![](image)*Languages – Statistics Canada.*[13]\n### Use of English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Canadian English\n\nIn 2011, just under 21.5 million Canadians, representing 65% of the population, spoke English most of the time at home, while 58% declared it their mother language.[14] English is the major language everywhere in Canada except Quebec and Nunavut, and most Canadians (85%) can speak English.[15] While English is not the preferred language in Quebec, 36.1% of Québécois can speak English.[16] Nationally, Francophones are five times more likely to speak English than Anglophones are to speak French – 44% and 9% respectively.[17] Only 3.2% of Canada's English-speaking population resides in Quebec—mostly in Montreal.[nb 5]\n\n\nIn 2011, 28.4 million Canadians had knowledge of English while only 21.6 million Canadians spoke it most often at home.[18][19]\n\n\n\n### Use of French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Canadian French and French language in Canada\n\nIn 2011, just over 7.1 million Canadians spoke French most often at home, this was a rise of 4.2%, although the proportion of people in Canada who spoke French \"most often\" at home fell slightly from 21.7% to 21.5% . Of these, about 6.1 million or 85% resided in Quebec.[20] Outside Quebec, the largest French-speaking populations are found in New Brunswick (which is home to 3.1% of Canada's Francophones) and Ontario (4.2%, residing primarily in the eastern and northeastern parts of the province and in Toronto and Ottawa). Overall, 22% of people in Canada declare French to be their mother language, while one in three Canadians speak French and 70% are unilingual Anglophones.[nb 6] Smaller indigenous French-speaking communities exist in some other provinces.[21] For example, a vestigial community exists on Newfoundland's Port au Port Peninsula; a remnant of the \"French Shore\" along the island's west coast.\n\n\nThe percentage of the population who speak French both by mother tongue and home language has decreased over the past three decades. Whereas the number of those who speak English at home is higher than the number of people whose mother tongue is English, the opposite is true for Francophones. There are fewer people who speak French at home, than learned French after birth.[22]\n\n\nEthnic diversity is growing in French Canada but still lags behind the English-speaking parts of the country. In 2006, 91.5% of Quebecers considered themselves to be of either \"French\" or \"Canadian\" origin. As a result of the growth in immigration, since the 1970s, from countries in which French is a widely used language, 3.4% of Quebecers indicated that they were of Haitian, Belgian, Swiss, Lebanese or Moroccan origin.[23] Other groups of non-francophone immigrants (Irish Catholics, Italian, Portuguese, etc.) have also assimilated into French over the generations. The Irish, who started arriving in large numbers in Quebec in the 1830s, were the first such group, which explains why it has been possible for Quebec to have had five premiers of Irish ethnic origin: John Jones Ross (1884–87), Edmund James Flynn (1896–97), Daniel Johnson Sr. (1966–68), Pierre-Marc Johnson (1985), and Daniel Johnson Jr. (1994).\n\n\nIn 1991, due to linguistic assimilation of Francophones outside Quebec, over one million Canadians who claimed English as their mother tongue were of French ethnic origin (1991 Census).\n\n\n\n### Bilingualism and multilingualism versus English–French bilingualism[edit]\n\n\n* ![Ability of Canadians to speak English and French 1931–2001.[24]](image)\n\nAbility of Canadians to speak English and French 1931–2001.[24]\n* ![Rate of bilingualism (French and English) in Quebec and the rest of Canada, 1941–2006.[25]](image)\n\nRate of bilingualism (French and English) in Quebec and the rest of Canada, 1941–2006.[25]\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 98.2% of Canadian residents have knowledge of one or both of the country's two official languages,[15] Between 2006 and 2011, the number of persons who reported being able to conduct a conversation in both of Canada's official languages increased by nearly 350,000 to 5.8 million. The bilingualism rate of the Canadian population edged up from 17.4% in 2006 to 17.5% in 2011.[11] This growth of English-French bilingualism in Canada was mainly due to the increased number of Quebecers who reported being able to conduct a conversation in English and French.[11]\n\n\nBilingualism with regard to nonofficial languages also increased, most individuals speaking English plus an immigrant language such as Punjabi or Mandarin.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Geographic distribution of English–French bilingualism[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Bilingual belt\n\n* ![Geographical distribution of bilingual Canadians as compared to total Canadian population 1941–2006.

In Quebec, the rate of bilingualism has increased from 26% of the population being able to speak English and French in 1951 to 42.5% in 2011.[15] As of 2011, in the rest of Canada (excluding Quebec) the rate of bilingualism was 7.5%.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of French-English bilingualism by province/territory (2016 census)\n| Province/territory\n | % of population\n | Total number\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Quebec\n | 44.5%\n | 3,586,410\n | [39] |\n| New Brunswick\n | 34%\n | 249,950\n | [40] |\n| Northwest Territories\n | 14%\n | 4,900\n | [41] |\n| Prince Edward Island\n | 13%\n | 17,840\n | [42] |\n| Ontario\n | 11.2%\n | 1,490,390\n | [43] |\n| Nova Scotia\n | 10.5%\n | 95,380\n | [44] |\n| Yukon\n | 10.3%\n | 4,275\n | [45] |\n| Manitoba\n | 9%\n | 108,460\n | [46] |\n| Alberta\n | 7%\n | 264,720\n | [47] |\n| British Columbia\n | 7%\n | 314,925\n | [48] |\n| Saskatchewan\n | 5%\n | 51,560\n | [49] |\n| Newfoundland and Labrador\n | 5%\n | 25,940\n | [50] |\n| Nunavut\n | 4.3%\n | 1,525\n | [51] |\n| **Canada**—*Total* | 17.9%\n | 6,216,065\n | [39] |\n\n\n#### English–French bilingualism rates[edit]\n\n\nEnglish–French bilingualism is highest among members of local linguistic minorities. It is very uncommon for Canadians to be capable of speaking only the minority official language of their region (French outside Quebec or English in Quebec). Only 1.5% of Canadians are able to speak only the minority official language, and of these most (90%) live in the bilingual belt.[52]\n\n\nAs the table below shows, rates of bilingualism are much higher among individuals who belong to the linguistic minority group for their region of Canada, than among members of the local linguistic majority. For example, within Quebec around 37% of bilingual Canadians are Francophones, whereas Francophones only represent 4.5% of the population outside Quebec.[53]\n\n\n\n\n\nRates of French-English bilingualism among linguistic groups.[54]\n|  | Anglophones | Francophones | Allophones |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Quebec | 66.1%\n | 36.6%\n | 50.4%\n |\n| Rest of Canada | 7.1%\n | 85.1%\n | 5.7%\n |\n\n\n### Official language minority communities[edit]\n\n\nFrench-speaking Canadians from outside Quebec and English-speaking Quebecers are, together, the official language minority communities.

A continuity index of less than one indicates that French has more losses than gains – that more people with French as a mother tongue speak another language at home. Outside Quebec, New Brunswick has the highest French language continuity ratio. British Columbia and Saskatchewan have the lowest French language continuity ratio and thus the lowest retention of French. From 1971 to 2011, the overall ratio for French language continuity outside Quebec declined from 0.73 to 0.45.

There are 14 Indigenous language groups in Canada with about 100 distinct languages and dialects, including many sign languages.[63] Almost all Indigenous languages in Canada are considered endangered, with the exception of Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun, and the Cree varieties Naskapi, Atikamekw, East Cree, and Plains Cree.[64] Prior to colonization, multilingualism was common across Indigenous nations, many of whom often seasonally migrated. However, the reserve system created more permanent stationary bands, which have generally selected only one of their various ancestral languages to try to preserve in the face of increasing Anglicization, Francization,[65] or Amslanization (the process by which American Sign Language replaces local sign languages).[66] In addition, the residential school system attempted to institutionally exterminate languages and cultures from coast to coast to coast. The genocidal methods (such as physical and sexual abuse, as well as death rates as high as one in twenty children[67]) resulted in a sharp declines in language use across all nations,[68] including amongst deaf and signing communities.[69]\n\n\nTwo of Canada's territories give official status to native languages. In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun, known collectively as Inuktut, are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government.[70][71] In the Northwest Territories, the *Official Languages Act* declares that there are eleven different languages: Cree, Dënësųłıné, Dene Yatıé / Dene Zhatıé,[nb 1] English, French, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́ / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́,[nb 1] and Tłįchǫ.[9] Besides English and French, these languages are not vehicular in government; official status entitles citizens to receive services in them on request and to deal with the government in them.[72]\n\n\nAwaiting royal assent in October 2022 on Treaty Day, Nova Scotia has affirmed Mi'kmawi'simk as the \"First Language\" of the province through a bill titled the \"Mi'kmaw Language Act\" (No. 148). The Act establishes a language committee co-developed and co-run by Miꞌkmaw Kinaꞌmatnewey as well as ensuring \"government support for the preservation, revitalization, promotion and protection of the Mi’kmaw language for generations to come,\" collaboratively developing strategy between the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia and the Government of Nova Scotia.[2]\n\n\nAccording to the 2016 census, less than one per cent of Canadians (213,225) reported an Indigenous language as their mother tongue, and less than one per cent of Canadians (137,515) reported an Indigenous language as the language spoken most often at home.[73] Whilst most Canadian Indigenous languages are endangered and their current speaker numbers are frequently low, the number of speakers has grown and even outpaced the number with an indigenous mother tongue, indicating that many people continue to learn the languages even if not initially raised with them.[74]\n\n\nGiven the destruction of Indigenous state structures, academics usually classify Indigenous peoples of Canada by region into \"culture areas\", or by their language family.[75]\n\n\n\n* Arctic cultural area (Inuit languages, including Inuit Sign Language)\n* Subarctic culture area (Na-Dene and Algonquian languages)\n* Eastern Woodlands (Northeast) cultural area (Algonquian and Iroquoian languages)\n* Plains cultural area (Algonquian, Plains Sign, and Siouan languages)\n* Northwest Plateau cultural area (Ktunaxa, Na-Dene, and Salishan languages, including Secwepemcékst[76] and *Plateau Sign Language*)\n* Northwest Coast cultural area (Haida, Salishan, Tsimshianic, and Wakashan languages, possibly including Coast Salish Sign Language[76])\n\n\n\n\n| Indigenous languages\n | No. of speakers\n | Mother tongue | Home language\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cree (n.o.s.)[nb 7][a] | 99,950\n | 78,855\n | 47,190\n |\n| Inuktitut | 35,690\n | 32,010\n | 25,290\n |\n| Ojibwemowin | 32,460\n | 11,115\n | 11,115\n |\n| Innu–Naskapi | 11,815\n | 10,970\n | 9,720\n |\n| Denesuline | 11,130\n | 9,750\n | 7,490\n |\n| Oji-Cree (Anishininimowin) | 12,605\n | 8,480\n | 8,480\n |\n| Mi'kmawi'simk | 8,750\n | 7,365\n | 3,985\n |\n| Siouan languages (Dakota/Nakota) | 6,495\n | 5,585\n | 3,780\n |\n| Atikamekw | 5,645\n | 5,245\n | 4,745\n |\n| Blackfoot | 4,915\n | 3,085\n | 3,085\n |\n| Tłįchǫ | 2,645\n | 2,015\n | 1,110\n |\n| Algonquin (Omàmìwininìmowin) | 2,685\n | 1,920\n | 385\n |\n| Dakelh | 2,495\n | 1,560\n | 605\n |\n| Gitxsanimaax | 1,575\n | 1,175\n | 320\n |\n| Tsilhqot'in | 1,400\n | 1,070\n | 435\n |\n| Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́ /Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́[nb 1] | 1,235\n | 650\n | 650\n |\n| Dené Dháh / Dene Yatıé / Dene Zhatıé[nb 1] | 2,315\n | 600\n | 600\n |\n| Wəlastəkey latowewakən | 790\n | 535\n | 140\n |\n| Inuinnaqtun | 580\n | 370\n | 70\n |\n| Gwich’in | 570\n | 355\n | 25\n |\n| Kanienʼkéha | 615\n | 290\n | 20\n |\n| Secwepemctsín | 1,650\n | 250\n | 250\n |\n| Nisg̱a'a | 1,090\n | 250\n | 250\n |\n| Tlingit | 175\n | 0\n | 0\n |\n| Atgangmuurngniq | 47[77] | Unknown\n | Unknown\n |\n| Onʌyota'a:ká Sign Language[b] | Unknown\n | Unknown\n | Unknown\n |\n| Plains Sign Talk[b] | Unknown\n | Unknown\n | Unknown\n |\n| Secwepemcékst[b] | Unknown\n | Unknown\n | Unknown\n |\n\n\nSource: Statistics Canada, *2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship* Ottawa, 2007, pp. 2, 6, 10.[63]  \n**a** There exist numerous Cree languages, such as Plains Cree (*nêhiyawêwin* ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ), Woods Cree (*nīhithawīwin* ᓃᐦᐃᖬᐑᐏᐣ), Swampy Cree (E: *nêhinawêwin* ᓀᐦᐃᓇᐌᐎᐣ, W: *ininîmowin* ᐃᓂᓃᒧᐎᓐ), Moose Cree (*ililîmowin* ᐃᓕᓖᒧᐎᓐ), and East Cree (N: *Iyiniu-Ayamiwin* ᐄᓅ ᐊᔨᒨᓐ S: *Iyiyiu-Ayamiwin* ᐄᔨᔫ ᐊᔨᒨᓐ).  \n**b** Although small in number,[76] these languages have been included without data to show the disparity in information between oral and sign languages.

The need for a common means of communication between the indigenous inhabitants and new arrivals for the purposes of trade and (in some cases) intermarriage led to the development of hybrid languages. These languages tended to be highly localized, were often spoken by only a small number of individuals who were frequently capable of speaking another language, and often persisted only briefly, before being wiped out by the arrival of a large population of permanent settlers, speaking either English or French.\n\n\n\n#### Belle Isle Pidgin[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Labrador Inuit Pidgin French\n\nSpoken until about 1760, this pidgin was spoken between Breton and Basque fishermen and NunatuKavummiut of NunatuKavut (Labrador).\n\n\n\n#### Bungee[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Bungi Creole\n\nNamed from the Ojibwe word *bangii* meaning \"a little bit,\"[80][81] the meagrely documented Bungi Creole (also known as Bungee, Bungy, Bungie, Bungay, and as the Red River Dialect) is a mixed language predominantly anchored in English that evolved within the Prairie Métis community, specifically the Countryborn or Anglo-Métis. Due to the multicultural nature of the Red River Settlement, Bungi was influenced by Scottish English, Nehiyawewin, Nakawemowin, the Orcadian dialect of Scots, Norn, Scottish Gaelic, and Canadian French.[82][83][84] The vocabulary and word order were primarily English, but the speech was lilting like that of Gaelic speakers, with pronunciation and structural shifts coming from the Cree languages, such as: *shawl* becoming *sawl*, *she* becoming *see*, and the popular greeting *I’m well, you but?*.[85] Bungi reached its peak in the nineteenth century, with about 5,000 Countryborn native speakers of the dialect in 1870. However, over the next century, standard Canadian English gradually replaced it; and by the late 1980s, only a handful of elderly speakers remained. It is generally considered to be asleep today.[85]\n\n\n\n#### Chiac[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chiac\n\nSpoken in the Maritime provinces (mostly in New Brunswick), Chiac is a creole language with a linguistic base in Acadian French and Maritime English with significant contributions from Mi'kmawi'simk and the Maliseet language.[86] Notable for its code-switching between English and French, it is often popularly considered a variant of Franglais, with examples such as: *Espère-moi su'l'corner, j'traverse le ch'min pi j'viens right back* (Wait for me at the corner, I'm crossing the road and I'll be right back) and *On va amarrer ça d'même pour faire sûr que ça tchenne*[87] (We will tie it like this to make sure it stays).[87] However, Chiac is not simply a *Franglais*/*Frenglish* mix of French and English, as it differs distinctly from other French-English mixed-use cases such as those found amongst Fransaskois or Ontarois.[88][89]\n\n\n\n#### Chinook Jargon[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chinook Wawa\n\nIn British Columbia, Yukon and throughout the Pacific Northwest, a pidgin language known as the Chinook Jargon (also rendered \"Chinook Wawa\") emerged in the early 19th century that was a combination of Chinookan, Nootka, Chehalis, French and English, with a smattering of words from other languages including Hawaiian and Spanish.[90] Later in that century, it had creolized in the Pacific Northwest. Certain words and expressions remain current in local use, such as skookum, tyee, and saltchuck, while a few have become part of worldwide English (\"high mucketymuck\" or \"high muckamuck\" for a high-ranking and perhaps self-important official).\n\n\n\n#### Franglais[edit]\n\n\nA portmanteau language which is said to combine English and French syntax, grammar and lexicons to form a unique interlanguage, is sometimes ascribed to mandatory basic French education in the Canadian anglophone school systems. Many unilingual anglophone Canadians, for instance, will borrow French words into their sentences. Simple words and phrases like \"*C'est quoi ça?*\" (what is that?) or words like \"*arrête*\" (stop) can alternate with their English counterparts. This phenomenon is more common in the eastern half of the country where there is a greater density of Francophone populations. Franglais can also refer to the supposed degradation of the French language thanks to the overwhelming impact Canadian English has on the country's Francophone inhabitants, though many linguists would argue that while English vocabulary can be freely borrowed as a stylistic device, the grammar of French has been resistant to influences from English[91] and the same conservatism holds true in Canadian English grammar,[92] even in Quebec City.\n\n\n\n#### Haida Jargon[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Haida Jargon\n\nA pidgin trade language based on Haida, known as Haida Jargon, was used in the 1830s in and around Haida Gwaii. It was used by speakers of English, Haida, Coast Tsimshian, Heiltsuk, and other languages.\n\n\n\n#### Loucheux Jargon[edit]\n\n\nAs a result of cultural contact between the Gwich'in (formerly called \"Loucheaux\") and Europeans (predominately French coureurs des bois and voyageurs), a pidgin language was historically used across Gwich'in Nành, Denendeh.[93] The language is often called in English \"Jargon Loucheux\" using the traditional French syntax.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Michif[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Michif\n\nMichif (also known as Mitchif, Mechif, Michif-Cree, Métif, Métchif, and French Cree) is a mixed language which evolved within the Prairie Métis community that was oriented towards Cree and Franco-Catholic culture. It is based on elements of Cree and French along with elements of Ojibwa, Assiniboine. Michif is today spoken by less than 1,000 individuals in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and North Dakota. At its peak, around 1900, Michif was understood by perhaps three times this number.\n\n\n\n#### Nootka Jargon[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Nootka Jargon\n\nBased in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and likely one precursor to Chinook Wawa, Nootka Jargon was a trade language derived from Nuučaan̓uł, English, Spanish, and Russian, as well as other local languages.\n\n\n\n#### Slavey Jargon[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Slavey Jargon\n\nAlso known as \"Broken Slavey,\" this language was spoken until the mid-1900s, abruptly diminishing due to the influx of English into Denendeh and Inuit Nunangat.[95] Documentation has also shown that the language was spoken by a range of fur traders, postmasters, and their wives, sisters, and daughters, who were often of Métis descent.[95] The native languages of speakers who used Slavey Jargon were Denesuline, French, Gwich'in, Inuktitut, and the languages collectively known as \"Slavey\" (North: Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́, K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́, and Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́; South: Dene Yatıé or Dene Zhatıé and Dené Dháh). The Dene, Inuit, French, British, and Métis who spoke the language did so predominately for preaching the gospel, teasing and harassing clergymen, and for interpersonal relationships.[95] The use of Slavey Jargon can be characterized as an innovation employed by speakers in order to meet several linguistic goals, such as introductions, advice, and disputes.[95] Mishler specified, \"For all these reasons, Slavey Jargon seems inaccurate to characterize it strictly as a trade jargon\" (p. 277).[95]\n\n\nSpoken predominately in the Liard and Dehcho Countries of Denendeh, the nouns of the language generally consisted of English, Dënësųłınë́ Yatıé, Sahtúgot’įné / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́, and Dene Yatıé/Zhatıé, whereas the verbs and pronouns are derived from French. Adverbs are typically pulled from Dënësųłınë́ and Gwich’in. There is, however, a lot of variation in Slavey Jargon. Gwich’in verbs can be mixed with French nouns or phonemically modified French sentences exist.[95]\n\n\n\n#### Souriquois[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Algonquian–Basque pidgin\n\nSpoken alongside the Basque/Breton–Inuit Belle Isle pidgin was another pidgin language that developed in the 16th century amongst the Basque in coastal areas along the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Strait of Belle Isle as the result of contact between Basque whalers and local Algonquian peoples, notably the Mi'kmaq.[96] The name \"Souriquois\" has an obscure history and most likely refers to region around Souris and the Basque suffix *koa*, perhaps from *zurikoa* “that of the whites.\"[97]\n\n\n\n### Sign languages[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Deaf life for Indigenous peoples in Canada\n![](image)Attested historical ranges of sign languages of the US and Canada excluding ASL and LSQ.  \n |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Plains Sign Talk\n Atgangmuurngniq\n Hawai'i Sign Language\n Maritime Sign Language\n | Plateau Sign Language\n Martha's Vineyard Sign Language\n Henniker Sign Language\n Sandy River Valley Sign Language\n |\n\nAlongside the numerous and varied oral languages, Canada also boasts several sign languages. Currently, Canada is home to some five or more sign languages (that number rising with the probability that Plains Sign Talk is actually a language family with several languages under its umbrella), belonging to four to six distinct language families, those being: French Sign Language family, BANZSL family, the Plains Sign family, the Inuit Sign isolate, perhaps the Coast Salish Sign isolate, and perhaps a Plateau Sign family composed of Secwepemcékst and Ktunaxa Sign Language.\n\n\nAs with all sign languages around the world that developed naturally, these are natural, human languages distinct from any oral language. As such, American Sign Language (unlike Signed English) is no more a derivation of English than Russian is,[98] all being distinct languages from one another. Some languages present here were trade pidgins which were used first as a system of communication across national and linguistic boundaries of First Nations, however, they have since developed into mature languages as children learned them as a first language.\n\n\nThe sign languages of Canada share extremely limited rights within the country in large due to the general population's misinformation on the subject. Ontario is the only province or territory to formally make legal any sign language, enabling the use of American Sign Language, Quebec Sign Language (LSQ) and \"First Nation Sign Language\" (which could refer to Plains Sign Talk, Oneida Sign Language, or any other language) in only the domains of education, legislation and judiciary proceedings.[99] The only other language afforded any other rights is Inuiuuk, which sees interpretation in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut.[100] There have been efforts to make LSQ an official language of Quebec, but all efforts have failed.[101]\n\n\n\n#### American Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nThe most spoken sign language in Canada, American Sign Language or ASL, can be found across the country in mostly anglophone regions. The ties with anglophone Canada are not due to ASL and English's similarity, but to cultural similarities and linguistic history (as several ASL words are borrowed from English). As such, ASL can be found in areas where English is not the primary language, such as Montreal or Nunavut. ASL is part of the French Sign Language (Francosign) family, originating on the East Coast of the United States from a mix of *Langue des signes françaises* (LSF) and other local languages.\n\n\n\n#### Coast Salish Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nThere is evidence that Coast Salish citizens speak a distinct language.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Hand Talk[edit]\n\n\nOriginally a trade pidgin, Plains Sign Talk, also known as Plains Standard or Prairie Sign Language, became a full language after children began to learn the language as a first language across many Nations.[*citation needed*] From \"HANDS\" and \"TO TALK TO,\" Hand Talk was used as a *lingua franca* across linguistic and national boundaries[102] across the continent and the language stretched across the provinces down through Mexico.[103] As Plains Sign Talk was so widespread and was a spectrum of dialects and accents, it probably hosted several languages under its umbrella. One is potentially Navajo Sign Language which is in use by a sole Navajo clan.[104]\n\n\n\n##### Oneida Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nBorn out of the Oneida Nation, OSL is a mixed language, descended primarily from both Prairie Sign Language (or Hand Talk) and the oral Oneida language, with some additions from ASL.[105] Onʌyota'a:ká (or Oneida) Sign Language is a young and growing language, spreading especially amongst deaf Oneida citizens.[106][76]\n\n\n\n#### Inuit Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nInuit Sign Language, also known as Atgangmuurngniq or Uukturausingit, is a critically endangered language with some 50 speakers remaining. It is a language isolate and has only be found by researchers in Nunavut; however, there are theories it extends across the Arctic Circle.[77] Little is known about its history, but efforts are being made to document and revitalize the language.[107]\n\n\n\n#### Maritime Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nMaritime Sign Language is a BANZSL language. It was used as the language of education for Deaf populations in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island before ASL became available in the mid-20th century. It is still remembered by some elderly people but is moribund. The language, living alongside ASL, has produced a unique dialect of ASL in The Maritimes due to mixing of the languages. The exact number of speakers is unknown.\n\n\n\n#### Plateau Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nAnother trade pidgin that may have become a separate language, Plateau Sign Language replaced Plains Sign Talk in the Columbia Plateau and surrounding regions of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. It is now extinct.\n\n\n\n##### Ktunaxa Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nCalled *ʾa·qanⱡiⱡⱡitnam* in the Ktunaxa language,[108] Ktunaxa Sign Language has historically been spoken in Ktunaxa ɁamakaɁis (Ktunaxa Country).[109]\n\n\n\n##### Secwépemc Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nPerhaps related to or descended from the old Plateau Sign Language, Secwepemcékst or Secwépemc Sign Language is spoken by a small number of Secwépemc citizens.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Quebec Sign Language[edit]\n\n\nAlongside ASL, Quebec Sign Language or LSQ (*Langue des signes québécoise*) is the second most spoken sign language in the country. Centred mainly around and within Quebec, LSQ can also be found in Ontario, New Brunswick and various other parts of the country, generally around francophone communities due to historical ties to the French language. Although approximately 10% of the population of Quebec is deaf or hard-of-hearing, it is estimated that only 50,000 to 60,000 children use LSQ as their native language. LSQ is part of the Francosign family with ASL. As such, both languages are mutually intelligible.\n\n\n\n### Canadian dialects of European languages[edit]\n\n\n#### Acadian French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Acadian French\n\nAcadian French is a unique form of Canadian French which incorporates not only distinctly Canadian phrases but also nautical terms, English loanwords, linguistic features found only in older forms of French as well as ones found in the Maritimer English dialect.\n\n\n\n##### Brayon French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Brayon\n\nA sub-dialect of Acadian French, Brayon French is spoken by those in Madawaska County of New Brunswick. The language is a mix of Acadian and Quebec French with influence from the local Mi'kmaw and Maliseet languages, with only slight differentiation from the more standard Acadian French.[110][111][112]\n\n\n\n#### Québec French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Québec French\n\nAs the most spoken variety of French in Canada, Québec French contains a significant number of dialects, generally grouped in two: the \"old\" dialects of the territories at the time of the British conquest and the \"new\" dialects that arose post-conquest.\n\n\n\n##### Chaouin French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chaouin\n\nAround 1615 as the coureurs des bois moved past the city of Quebec, those who settled in *Ndakinna* (Abenaki land) developed unique features still found today, especially in the Bois-Francs region South of the St. Lawrence.\n\n\n\n##### Joual French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Joual\n\nOriginally the dialect of the French-speaking working class in Montréal, the cultural renaissance connected to the Quiet Revolution have resulted in Joual being spoken by people across the educational and economic spectrum.\n\n\n\n##### Màgoua French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Magoua dialect\n\nPossibly deriving from the Atikamekw word for \"loon\" (*makwa*; standard French: *huard*), the French spoken by the Magoua community is one of the most conservative French dialects in North America. This basilectal dialect is found in Nitaskinan as the Trois-Rivières region became the first stronghold of the coureurs des bois outside the city of Quebec in 1615. Magoua French preserves the sontaient (\"étaient\") characteristic of Métis French and Cajun French, has a creole-like past tense particle tà, and has old present-tense contraction of a former verb \"to be\" that behave in the same manner as subject clitics.\n\n\n\n#### Métis French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Métis French\n\nAlongside Michif and Bungi, the Métis dialect of French is one of the traditional languages of the Métis people, and the French-dialect source of the Michif language.[113] Métis French is a variety of Canadian French with some added characters Ññ, Áá, Óó, and Ææ (from older French spellings), such as: *il ñá ócun nævus sur ce garçon* English: \"there is no birthmark on this boy.\"[56] There are also significant amounts of words loaned from Indigenous languages such as Ojibwemowin, Dane-zaa Ẕáágéʔ (Beaver), and several Cree languages.[57] Like Michif, Métis French is spoken predominantly in Manitoba as well as adjacent provinces and US states.[114] As a general rule, Métis individuals tend to speak one or the other, rarely both.[55]\n\n\n\n#### Newfoundland French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Newfoundland French\n\nTracing their origins to Continental French fishermen who settled in the late 1800s and early 1900s, rather than the Québécois, Newfoundland French (or *français terre-neuvien*) refers to the French spoken on the Port au Port Peninsula (part of the so-called “French Shore”) of Newfoundland. Some Acadians of the Maritimes also settled in the area. For this reason, Newfoundland French is most closely related to the Breton and Norman French of nearby St-Pierre-et-Miquelon. Today, heavy contact with Acadian French—and especially widespread bilingualism with Newfoundland English—have taken their toll, and the community is in decline. The degree to which lexical features of Newfoundland French constitute a distinct dialect is not presently known. It is uncertain how many speakers survive; the dialect could be moribund. There is a provincial advocacy organisation *Fédération des Francophones de Terre-Neuve et du Labrador*, representing both the Peninsular French and Acadian French communities.\n\n\n\n#### Ontarois French[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Franco-Ontarian § Franco-Ontarian French\n\nAlthough quite similar to Quebec French, the dialect of the Ontarois or Franco-Ontarians maintains distinctive features. These include the progressive disappearance of the subjunctive, the use of the possessive *á*, the transfer of rules from English to French, e.g., \"*J’ai vu un film sur/à la télévision*\" which comes from \"I saw a film on television\", or \"*Je vais à la maison/chez moi*\" coming from \"I'm going home,\" and the loaning of English conjunctions such as \"so\" for *ça fait que* or *alors*.\n\n\n\n#### Black English[edit]\n\n\nIn what is also called Black Canadian, Afro-Canadian, or African Canadian English, there exist several varieties of English spoken by Black Canadians. The most well-established is the dialect spoken by Afro-Nova Scotians.[115] In places like Toronto where there is a large population of Afro-Caribbean descendants and newcomers, localized varieties of Black English take on elements of Caribbean English, as well as mixing with African-American Vernacular English (AAVE). Although AAVE is not nearly as widespread in Canada as it is across the United States, Black Canadians have various lines of connection to the dialect. Sometimes that connection is historical, such as with Black Nova Scotians; sometimes it is hegemonic, where Afro-Canadians adopt speech mannerisms from the larger United States; sometimes it is diasporic, where communities of African-American newcomers or African-American descendants coalesce, especially in larger cities.\n\n\n\n##### Afro-Nova Scotian English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: African-American English § African Nova Scotian English\n\nAfrican Nova Scotian English is spoken by descendants of Black Nova Scotians, black immigrants from the United States. Though most African American freedom seekers in Canada ended up in Ontario through the Underground Railroad, only the dialect of African Nova Scotians retains the influence of West African pidgin.[116] In the 19th century, African Nova Scotian English would have been indistinguishable from English spoken in Jamaica or Suriname.[117] However, it has been increasingly de-creolized since this time, due to interaction and influence from the white Nova Scotian population. Desegregation of the province's school boards in 1964 further accelerated the process of de-creolization. The language is a relative of the African-American Vernacular English, with significant variations unique to the group's history in the area.[118][119] There are noted differences in the dialects of those from Guysborough County (Black Loyalists), and those from North Preston (Black Refugees), the Guysborough group having been in the province three generations earlier.[119]\n\n\nHowe and Walker use data from early recordings of African Nova Scotian English, Samaná English, and the recordings of former slaves to demonstrate that speech patterns were inherited from nonstandard colonial English.[120] The dialect was extensively studied in 1992 by Shana Poplack and Sali Tagliamonte from the University of Ottawa.[119]\n\n\nA commonality between African Nova Scotian English and African-American Vernacular English is (r)-deletion. This rate of deletion is 57% among Black Nova Scotians, and 60% among African Americans in Philadelphia. Meanwhile, in the surrounding mostly white communities of Nova Scotia, (r)-deletion does not occur.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Cascadian English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pacific Northwest English\n\nThe English language in British Columbia shares numerous features with the neighbouring states of Washington and Oregon, such as the /æɡ/ raising (found words such as bag, vague and bagel). Boreal Cascadian English speakers exhibit more vowel retraction of /æ/ before nasals than people from Toronto, and younger speakers in the Greater Vancouver area do not raise /aʊ/ as much, but keep the drop in intonation, causing \"about\" to sound slightly like \"a baht.\" The \"o\" in such words as holy, goal, load, know, etc. is pronounced as a close-mid back rounded vowel, [o], but not as rounded as in the Prairies where there are strong Scandinavian, Slavic and German influences, which can lend to a more stereotypical \"Canadian\" accent.\n\n\n\n#### Indigenous English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Aboriginal English in Canada\n\nThe varieties of English spoken by Indigenous people are phonologically influenced by their first or traditional languages. This has resulted in an identifiable dialect spectrum distinct from other Canadian English dialects. Due to the ongoing stigmatization of Indigenous cultures, Indigenous children could be wrongly diagnosed as having a speech impairment or a learning disability, when what is identified by medical professionals are simply the dialectal features.[122]\n\n\nSome written works use Indigenous English dialects. For example, Maria Campbell's book *Stories of the Road Allowance People* is a collection of Métis folktales. An excerpt from that work illustrates the type of speech used by Elders in rural Métis communities during her research, but some stories were collected in Cree or other languages and translated into dialectical English by Campbell:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Dere wasen very much he can steal from dah table anyways  \n> 'cept da knives and forks.  \n> An Margareet he knowed he wouldn dare take dem  \n> cause dat woman you know  \n> hees gots a hell of a repetation for being a hardheaded woman  \n> when he gets mad.  \n> Dat man he have to be a damn fool to steal from hees table. - *Dah Teef*[123]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Lunenburg English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lunenburg English\n\nSpoken in Lunenburg and Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia, this moribund dialect is sometimes called \"Lunenburg Dutch\" due to its rooting in the large Kurpfalzisch and Württembergisch population who settled the town. Although the German language subsided significantly, the English of the town and county continue to be marked by its influence. Indeed, the pronunciation in Lunenburg county is the only Canadian community to be non-rhotic. The accent features Canadian raising and so flight [ˈflʌɪt] has a different vowel from fly [ˈflɑɪ], and the noun house [ˈhoʊs] has a different vowel from the verb house [ˈhɑʊz]. In Lunenburg, the phrase about a boat contains two identical stressed and two identical unstressed vowels: /əˌboʊt ə ˈboʊt/, rather than the Standard Canadian English /əˌbaʊt ə ˈboʊt/, with distinct stressed vowels. Due to German influence, there is the tendency to pronounce /w/ in **w**itch the same as /v/ as in **v**an. Another example is the lack of the dental fricatives /θ/ and /ð/, which are replaced by the alveolar stops /t/ and /d/ (rendering \"thank\" and \"tank\" homophonous as /ˈtæŋk/), and the \"t\" at the end of words is usually silent: \"get\" becomes \"ge.\"\n\n\nFor example, here is a sample of a conversation between two people: \n\n\n\n\n> \n> \"De kids vere over der in da woods, gettin inda dis an dat.\"  \n> \"Dey never did?\"  \n> \"Yeah, an now dey gone da get some of dem der apples you see.\"  \n> \"You don't say?\"  \n> \"No foolin, dey over der now.\"  \n> \"Dey brung some of dem apples over heera da day before.\"  \n> \"Oh, dey vere some good eatin I bet.\"  \n> \"Now look, you make no nevermind, dose vere da best apples I ever did have, dey vas some good.\"  \n> \"Oh, here dey come now, dey bedda know da wash der feet off.\"\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Maritime English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Atlantic Canadian English\n\nSpoken across the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and PEI, this English dialect has been influenced by British and Irish English, Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and some Acadian French, as well as by Mi'kmawi'simk.\n\n\n\n#### Newfoundland English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Newfoundland English\n\nThe initial European settlers to Newfoundland were fishermen from the various coastal villages of the English West Country of Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Bristol, and Wiltshire beginning in the 1500s (previously they visited in summer and returned). This set the basic speech patterns for those settlers who fanned out into isolated coves and bays along the island's 9,700 km (6,000 mi) of coastline to take advantage of the scattered off-shore fishing areas. Labrador, today the greater part of \"Newfoundland\", was then sparsely settled. The West Country dialects continued to be spoken in isolated coves and fjords of the island thus preserving varied dialects of what is today referred to as Newfoundland English.\n\n\nIt was not until the 1700s that social disruptions in Ireland sent thousands of Irish from the southeastern counties of Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, and Cork and to the Avalon peninsula in the eastern part of Newfoundland where significant Irish influence on the Newfoundland dialects may still be heard.\n\n\nSome of the Irish immigrants to Newfoundland were native speakers of Irish making Newfoundland the only place outside Europe to have its own Irish dialect. Newfoundland was also the only place outside Europe to have its own distinct name in Irish: *Talamh an Éisc*, which means 'land of the fish'. The Irish language is now extinct in Newfoundland.\n\n\nAfter 400 years, much of the dialectal differences between the isolated settlements has levelled out beginning in the 20th century when faster boats (using gas engines instead of oars or sails), and improved road connections provided easier social contact. As well, influences from mainland North America began to affect the local dialects beginning during WWII when US and Canadian servicemen were stationed in Newfoundland and accelerating after Newfoundland became a Canadian province in 1949. Lack of an official orthography, publications in dialect, speaker attrition and official disinterest in promoting the language has been contributing factors towards a decline of speakers of the older, traditional Newfoundland English in the original settlements.\n\n\n\n#### Ottawa Valley Twang[edit]\n\n\nOttawa Valley Twang is the accent, sometimes referred to as a dialect of English, that is spoken in the Ottawa Valley, in Ontario.[124] The Ottawa Valley is considered to be a linguistic enclave within Ontario.[125]\n\n\n\n#### Quebec English[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Quebec English\n\nThe language of English-speaking Quebecers generally aligns to Standard Canadian English, however established ethnic groups retain certain, distinctive lexical features, such as the dialects spoken by Mohawk, Cree, Inuit, Irish, Jewish, Italian, and Greek communities. Isolated fishing villages on the Basse-Côte-Nord speak Newfoundland English, and many Gaspesian English-speakers use Maritime English.\n\n\n\n#### Toronto slang[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Toronto slang\n\nSpoken within the Greater Toronto Area, Toronto slang is the nuanced, multicultural English spoken in the city. This dialect is heavily influenced by the different communities present, most notably the Jamaican, Trinidadian, Guyanese, and other Caribbean communities and their ways of speaking. There is also influence from West African, East African, and South Asian communities.\n\n\n\n#### Canadian Gaelic[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Canadian Gaelic\n\nCanadian Gaelic was spoken by many immigrants who settled in Glengarry County (Ontario) and the Maritimes—predominantly in New Brunswick's Restigouche River valley, central and southeastern Prince Edward Island, and across the whole of northern Nova Scotia—particularly Cape Breton. While the Canadian Gaelic dialect has mostly disappeared, regional pockets persist. These are mostly centred on families deeply committed to their Celtic traditions. Nova Scotia currently has 500–1,000 fluent speakers, mostly in northwestern Cape Breton. There have been attempts in Nova Scotia to institute Gaelic immersion on the model of French immersion. As well, formal post-secondary studies in Gaelic language and culture are available through St. Francis Xavier University, Saint Mary's University, and Cape Breton University\n\n\nIn 1890, a private member's bill was tabled in the Canadian Senate, calling for Gaelic to be made Canada's third official language. However, the bill was defeated 42–7.\n\n\n\n#### Newfoundland Irish[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Irish language in Newfoundland\n\nNewfoundland is home to the largest population of Irish-descendants in Canada and once hosted a thriving Irish Gaelic linguistic community. Although steep declines around the 20th century meant that the Irish language on the Island hardly remains, there exists today strong interest with consistent efforts to revive the language.\n\n\nNewfoundland Irish has left an impact on the English spoken on the Island, including terms like *scrob* \"scratch\" (Irish *scríob*), *sleveen* \"rascal\" (Irish *slíbhín*) and *streel* \"slovenly person\" (Irish *sraoill*), along with grammatical features like the \"after\" perfect as in \"she's already after leavin'\" (Irish *tá sí tar éis imeacht*).[126] As well, both Newfoundland (*Talamh an Éisc*, *Land of the Fish*)[127] and St. John's (*Baile Sheáin*)[128] have distinct names in the Irish-language. The dialect of Irish spoken in Newfoundland is said to resemble the Munster Irish of the 18th century.\n\n\nEvents and institutions are increasingly supporting the language with ever larger Céilithe móra, students participating in Conradh na Gaeilge events, people playing Gaelic sports, and Irish film festivals attracting English- and Irish-speakers alike. There is also an Irish language instructor, appointed every year by the Ireland Canada University Foundation, who works at Memorial University in St. John's,[129] where the university's Digital Learning Centre provides resources for learning the Irish language.[130]\n\n\n\n#### Newfoundland Welsh[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Welsh language § Canada\n\nSome Welsh is found in Newfoundland. In part, this is as a result of Welsh settlement since the 17th century. Also, there was an influx of about 1,000 Patagonian Welsh, who migrated to Canada from Argentina after the 1982 Falklands War. Welsh-Argentines are fluent in Spanish as well as English and Welsh.\n\n\n\n#### Canadian Ukrainian[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Canadian Ukrainian\n\nCanada is also home to Canadian Ukrainian, a distinct dialect of the Ukrainian language, spoken mostly in Western Canada by the descendants of first two waves of Ukrainian settlement in Canada who developed in a degree of isolation from their cousins in what was then Austria-Hungary, the Russian Empire, Poland, and the Soviet Union.\n\n\n\n#### Doukhobor Russian[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Doukhobor Russian\n\nCanada's Doukhobor community, especially in Grand Forks and Castlegar, British Columbia, has kept its distinct dialect of Russian. It has a lot in common with South Russian dialects, showing some common features with Ukrainian. This dialect's versions are becoming extinct in their home regions of Georgia and Russia where the Doukhobors have split into smaller groups.\n\n\n\n#### Deitsch[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania Dutch language\n\nA variety of West Central German spoken by the Old Order Amish, Old Order Mennonites and other descendants of German immigrants in Canada, Pennsylvania Dutch or Deitsch is closely related to the Palatine dialects of the Upper Rhine Valley.[131] Of the estimated 300,000 speakers, most are found across several US states, whilst there is a sizable community within Ontario.[132]\n\n\n\n#### Hutterisch[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Hutterite German\n\nCentred in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, the Hutterite communities maintain a distinct form of the German language descended from Bavarian dialects spoken in Tyrol (by founder Jacob Hutter). The language shifted in the mid-18th century toward a more Carinthian linguistic base upon the deportation of Landler from Austria to Transylvania. There is only about a 50% intelligibility between Pennsylvania Dutch speakers and Hutterisch.[133] Its speaker base belongs to the *Schmiedleit*, *Lehrerleit*, and *Dariusleit* groups with a few speakers among the older generations of *Prairieleit* (the descendants of those Hutterites who chose not to settle in colonies). Hutterite children who grow up in the colonies first learn and speak Hutterisch before learning English. Of the estimated 34,000 speakers in the world (as of 2003), 85% of them live in 370 communities in Canada.[134] Canadian adults are generally literate in Early New High German (also called \"Biblical German\", the predecessor to Standard German used by Martin Luther) that they employ as the written form for Scriptures, however Hutterisch is, for the most part, an unwritten language.[135]\n\n\n\n#### Plautdietsch[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Plautdietsch language\n\nPlautdietsch is predominantly found in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario where Mennonite communities settled. The Mennonites, or Russian Mennonites as they are sometimes called, descend from Low country Anabaptists who fled from what is today the Netherlands and Belgium in the 16th century to escape persecution and resettled in the Vistula delta.[136] Their language is a fusion of Dutch, West Frisian and Dutch Low Saxon dialects which over time mixed with the East Low German dialects of Werdersch, Nehrungisch and Weichselisch.[137]\n\n\n\n## Official multilingualism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Official bilingualism in Canada and Official bilingualism in the public service of Canada\n\n### Language policy of the federal government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Montreal\nEnglish and French have equal status in federal courts, the Parliament of Canada, as well as in all federal institutions.\n\n\nThe public has the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French. Immigrants who are applying for Canadian citizenship must normally be able to speak either English or French.\n\n\nThe principles of bilingualism in Canada are protected in sections 16 to 23 of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* of 1982 which establishes that:\n\n\n\n* French and English are equal to each other as federal official languages;\n* Debate in Parliament may take place in either official language;\n* Federal laws shall be printed in both official languages, with equal authority;\n* Anyone may deal with any court established by Parliament, in either official language;\n* Everyone has the right to receive services from the federal government in his or her choice of official language;\n* Members of a minority language group of one of the official languages if learned and still understood (i.e., French speakers in a majority English-speaking province, or vice versa) or received primary school education in that language has the right to have their children receive a public education in their language, where numbers warrant.\n\n\nCanada's *Official Languages Act,* first adopted in 1969 and updated in 1988, gives English and French equal status throughout federal institutions.\n\n\n\n### Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories\n\n#### Officially bilingual or multilingual: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and the three territories[edit]\n\n\nNew Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Canada's three territories have all given official status to more than one language. In the case of New Brunswick, this means perfect equality. In the other cases, the recognition sometimes amounts to a formal recognition of official languages, but limited services in official languages other than English.\n\n\nThe official languages are:\n\n\n\n* New Brunswick: English and French. New Brunswick has been officially bilingual since the 1960s. The province's officially bilingual status has been entrenched in the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* since 1982.\n* Nova Scotia: Mi'kmawi'simk is considered the province's official \"first language.\"\n* Northwest Territories: Cree, Dënësųłıné, Dene Yatıé / Dene Zhatıé,[nb 1] English, French, Gwich’in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, Sahtúgot’įné Yatı̨́ / K’ashógot’įne Goxedǝ́ / Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́,[nb 1] and Tłįchǫ.[9]\n* Nunavut: English, Inuktut (Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun), and French.[138]\n* Yukon: English and French.\n\n\n#### Officially French-only: Quebec[edit]\n\n\nUntil 1969, Quebec was the only officially bilingual province in Canada and most public institutions functioned in both languages. English was also used in the legislature, government commissions and courts. With the adoption of the *Charter of the French Language* (also known as \"Bill 101\") by Quebec's National Assembly in August 1977, however, French became Quebec's sole official language. However, the *Charter of the French Language* enumerates a defined set of language rights for the English language and for Aboriginal languages, and government services are available, to certain citizens and in certain regions, in English. As well, a series of court decisions have forced the Quebec government to increase its English-language services beyond those provided for under the original terms of the *Charter of the French Language*. Regional institutions in the Nunavik region of northern Quebec offer services in Inuktitut and Cree.\n\n\n\n#### *De facto* English only, or limited French-language services: the other eight provinces[edit]\n\n\nMost provinces have laws that make either English or both English and French the official language(s) of the legislature and the courts but may also have separate policies in regards to education and the bureaucracy.\n\n\nFor example, in Alberta, English and French are both official languages of debate in the Legislative Assembly, but laws may be drafted solely in English and there is no legal requirement that they be translated into French. French can be used in some lower courts and education is offered in both languages, but the bureaucracy functions almost solely in English. Therefore, although Alberta is not officially an English-only province, English has a higher *de facto* status than French. Ontario and Manitoba are similar but allow for more services in French at the local level.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geographic distribution[edit]\n\n\nThe following table details the population of

the northern mountain dialect of Shíhgot’įne Yatı̨́) and South (Dene Yatıé or Dene Zhatıé, and Dené Dháh used predominately by the Dene Tha' in Alberta).

The term \"immigrant languages\" refers to languages (other than English, French and Aboriginal languages) whose presence in Canada is originally due to immigration.
