The only tool I have access to is Wikipedia search, which while useful, wouldn't give us a systematic way to compile and analyze medal counts across all countries.\n\nTo properly answer your question, we would need:\n1. Access to a comprehensive Olympic/sports database\n2. The ability to query and aggregate medal counts by country\n3. The ability to break down medals by sport for each country\n\nWould you like me to search for information about a specific country's Olympic performance instead? Or would you prefer to rephrase your question to focus on a particular aspect that we can research through Wikipedia?",
