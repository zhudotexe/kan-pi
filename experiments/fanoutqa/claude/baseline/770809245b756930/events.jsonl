For women's champions, see List of English women's football champions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| English League (1st tier)\n |\n| --- |\n| Football League (1888–1892)Football League First Division (1892–1992)Premier League (1992–present)\n |\n| **Country** |\n| ![](image) England\n |\n| **Founded** |\n| 1888\n |\n| **Number of teams** |\n| 20 (since 1995–96 season)\n |\n| **Current champions** |\n| Manchester City (2022–23)\n |\n| **Most successful club** |\n| Manchester United (20 championships)\n |\n\n\n![](image)Leicester City celebrate winning the Premier League in the 2015–16 season.\nThe **English football champions** are the winners of the highest league in English men's football, which since 1992–93 is the Premier League. Since the creation of the Premier League, the winners of The Football League were no longer English champions as the Premier League is a separate league.\n\n\nFollowing the codification of professional football by the Football Association in 1885,[1] the Football League was established in 1888, after meetings initiated by Aston Villa director William McGregor.[2] At the end of the 1888–89 season, Preston North End were the first club to be crowned champions after completing their fixtures unbeaten.[3]\n\n\nThe league's early years were dominated by teams from the North and Midlands, where professionalism had been embraced more readily than in the South of England.[4] Its status as the country's pre-eminent league was strengthened in 1892, when the rival Football Alliance was absorbed into the Football League.[5] Former Alliance clubs comprised the bulk of a new Second Division, from which promotion to the top level could be gained. It was not until 1931 that a Southern club were crowned champions, when Herbert Chapman's Arsenal secured the title.[6]\n\n\nRules stipulating a maximum wage for players were abolished in 1961. This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs.[7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England,[8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs.[9] The first five champions in the Premier League era – Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United – had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt.[10]\n\n\nAll the clubs which have ever been champions are still in existence today and all take part in the top four tiers of the English football league system. Sheffield Wednesday are the only club who have ever changed their name after winning a league title having been known as The Wednesday for the first three of their four titles.\n\n\nManchester United have won twenty titles,[11] the most of any club.[12] United's rivals Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Sir Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993\nand 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Everton and Manchester City are joint-fourth with nine titles, of which seven of City's have been won in the 2010s and 2020s. Aston Villa (seven) and Sunderland (six) secured the majority of their titles before the 1920s. Chelsea (six) won the majority of their titles in the 21st century (between 2005 and 2017).\n\n\nHuddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are the only sides to have won the league title in three consecutive seasons; no team has been crowned champion four seasons in a row.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## List of champions[edit]\n\n\n### Football League

won[edit]\n\n\nThere are 24 clubs who have won the English title, including 7 who have won the Premier League (1992–present). The most recent to join the list were Leicester City (2015–16 champions) and before that, Nottingham Forest (1977–78) and Derby County (1971–72).\n\n\nFive teams have won the league title three seasons in a row: Huddersfield Town (1924–1926), Arsenal (1933–1935), Liverpool (1982–1984), Manchester United twice (1999–2001 & 2007–2009) and Manchester City (2021–2023).\n\n\nSeven teams have at some point held first or joint first place in the number of titles won: Preston North End (1889–1895), Sunderland (1893–1899 and 1936–1953), Aston Villa (1897–1953), Arsenal (1948–1976), Liverpool (1966–1971 and 1973–2011), Manchester United (1967–1971 and 2009–) and Everton (1970–1971).\n\n\nEight teams have finished as runners up without ever finishing top: Bristol City (1906–07), Oldham Athletic (1914–15), Cardiff City (1923–24), Charlton Athletic (1936–37), Blackpool (1955–56), Queens Park Rangers (1975–76), Watford (1982–83) and Southampton (1983–84). Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference.\n\n\nTeams in **bold** compete in the Premier League as of the 2023–24 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Club\n | Winners\n | Runners-up | Winning seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

Since the creation of the Premier League, the winners of The Football League were no longer English champions as the Premier League is a separate league.\n\n\nFollowing the codification of professional football by the Football Association in 1885,[1] the Football League was established in 1888, after meetings initiated by Aston Villa director William McGregor.[2] At the end of the 1888–89 season, Preston North End were the first club to be crowned champions after completing their fixtures unbeaten.[3]\n\n\nThe league's early years were dominated by teams from the North and Midlands, where professionalism had been embraced more readily than in the South of England.[4] Its status as the country's pre-eminent league was strengthened in 1892, when the rival Football Alliance was absorbed into the Football League.[5] Former Alliance clubs comprised the bulk of a new Second Division, from which promotion to the top level could be gained. It was not until 1931 that a Southern club were crowned champions, when Herbert Chapman's Arsenal secured the title.[6]\n\n\nRules stipulating a maximum wage for players were abolished in 1961. This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs.[7] Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England,[8] and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs.[9] The first five champions in the Premier League era – Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United – had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first ever attempt.[10]\n\n\nAll the clubs which have ever been champions are still in existence today and all take part in the top four tiers of the English football league system. Sheffield Wednesday are the only club who have ever changed their name after winning a league title having been known as The Wednesday for the first three of their four titles.\n\n\nManchester United have won twenty titles,[11] the most of any club.[12] United's rivals Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Sir Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993\nand 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Everton and Manchester City are joint-fourth with nine titles, of which seven of City's have been won in the 2010s and 2020s. Aston Villa (seven) and Sunderland (six) secured the majority of their titles before the 1920s. Chelsea (six) won the majority of their titles in the 21st century (between 2005 and 2017).\n\n\nHuddersfield Town, Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City are the only sides to have won the league title in three consecutive seasons; no team has been crowned champion four seasons in a row.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## List of champions[edit]\n\n\n### Football League

won[edit]\n\n\nThere are 24 clubs who have won the English title, including 7 who have won the Premier League (1992–present). The most recent to join the list were Leicester City (2015–16 champions) and before that, Nottingham Forest (1977–78) and Derby County (1971–72).\n\n\nFive teams have won the league title three seasons in a row: Huddersfield Town (1924–1926), Arsenal (1933–1935), Liverpool (1982–1984), Manchester United twice (1999–2001 & 2007–2009) and Manchester City (2021–2023).\n\n\nSeven teams have at some point held first or joint first place in the number of titles won: Preston North End (1889–1895), Sunderland (1893–1899 and 1936–1953), Aston Villa (1897–1953), Arsenal (1948–1976), Liverpool (1966–1971 and 1973–2011), Manchester United (1967–1971 and 2009–) and Everton (1970–1971).\n\n\nEight teams have finished as runners up without ever finishing top: Bristol City (1906–07), Oldham Athletic (1914–15), Cardiff City (1923–24), Charlton Athletic (1936–37), Blackpool (1955–56), Queens Park Rangers (1975–76), Watford (1982–83) and Southampton (1983–84). Of these, Cardiff City came closest to winning the league, matching champions Huddersfield Town in points but losing out on goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded), the precursor to goal difference.\n\n\nTeams in **bold** compete in the Premier League as of the 2023–24 season.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Club\n | Winners\n | Runners-up | Winning seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, before joining the Football League in 1892. After a brush with bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not been out of the top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier.[1] They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.[2]\n\n\nThis list encompasses the major honours won by Manchester United and records set by the club, their managers and their players. The player records section includes details of the club's leading goalscorers and those who have made most appearances in first-team competitions. It also records notable achievements by Manchester United players on the international stage, and the highest transfer fees paid and received by the club. The club's attendance records, both at Old Trafford, their home since 1910, and Maine Road, their temporary home from 1946 to 1949, are also included in the list.\n\n\nThe club currently holds the record for the most Premier League titles with 13, and the highest number of English top-flight titles with 20. The club's record appearance maker is Ryan Giggs, who made 963 appearances between 1991 and 2014, and the club's record goalscorer is Wayne Rooney, who scored 253 goals in 559 appearances between 2004 and 2017.\n\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of three medals sitting on a stand. One medal is gold and two are silver.](image)Winners' and runners-up medals from Manchester United's UEFA Champions League final appearances in 2008, 2009 and 2011\n![](image)Trophy cabinet of United on display in the Old Trafford museum\nManchester United's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886.[3] Their first national senior honour came in 1908, when they won the 1907–08 Football League First Division title. The club also won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. In terms of the number of trophies won, the 1990s were Manchester United's most successful decade, during which they won five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared)[A], one Champions League, one Cup Winners' Cup, one Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup.\n\n\nThe club currently holds the record for most top-division titles, with 20. They were also the first team to win the Premier League, as well as holding the record for the most Premier League titles (13), and became the first English team to win the European Cup when they won it in 1968. Their most recent trophy came in February 2023, when they won the EFL Cup.[4]\n\n\n\n### Domestic[edit]\n\n\n#### League[edit]\n\n\n* **First Division / Premier League (Level 1)[B]: 20 – record**\n\t+ 1907–08, 1910–11, 1951–52, 1955–56, 1956–57, 1964–65, 1966–67, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1996–97, 1998–99, 1999–2000, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2012–13\n* **Second Division (Level 2)[B]: 2**\n\t+ 1935–36, 1974–75\n\n\n#### Cups[edit]\n\n\n* **FA Cup: 12**\n\t+ 1908–09, 1947–48, 1962–63, 1976–77, 1982–83, 1984–85, 1989–90, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1998–99, 2003–04, 2015–16\n* **League/EFL Cup: 6**\n\t+ 1991–92, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2016–17, 2022–23\n* **FA Charity/Community Shield[A]: 21 (17 outright, 4 shared) – record**\n\t+ 1908, 1911, 1952, 1956, 1957, 1965\\*, 1967\\*, 1977\\*, 1983, 1990\\*, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016 (\\* joint holders)\n\n\n### European[edit]\n\n\n* **European Cup / UEFA Champions League: 3**\n\t+ 1967–68, 1998–99, 2007–08\n* **European Cup Winners' Cup: 1**\n\t+ 1990–91\n* **UEFA Europa League: 1**\n\t+ 2016–17\n* **European Super Cup: 1**\n\t+ 1991\n\n\n### Worldwide[edit]\n\n\n* **Intercontinental Cup: 1**\n\t+ 1999\n* **FIFA Club World Cup: 1**\n\t+ 2008\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n* **Laureus World Team of the Year**\n\t+ **Winner:** 2000[5]\n\n\n* **IFFHS World Club Team of the Year**\n\t+ **Winner:** 1999, 2008[6]\n\n\n* **PFA Merit Award**\n\t+ **Winner:** 1993, 2013\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\n![A side-on photograph of a man with red hair.

However, Matt Busby did not want to burden the young player with the \"£30,000-man\" tag, and Barnsley agreed for the fee to be reduced by £1 to £29,999. Busby then took the extra pound from his wallet and gave it to the lady who had been serving the teas.[50]\n\n\nManchester United made their first six-figure signing in August 1962 with the transfer of Denis Law from Torino for £110,000,[*citation needed*] a new British record.[51] The club broke the British transfer record again in 1981 with the £1.5 million signing of Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion.[52] When Andy Cole signed for United in January 1995, the club paid £7 million, almost double their previous record of £3.75 million, which they paid for Roy Keane 18 months earlier.[*citation needed*] In the summer of 2001, the club broke their transfer record twice in the space of a month, first paying PSV Eindhoven £19 million for Ruud van Nistelrooy, and then £28.1 million to Lazio for Juan Sebastián Verón.

That same month, Manchester City paid five times more for Scottish forward Joe Cassidy. The club's first £1,000 sale came 12 years later with the sale of Harold Halse to Aston Villa.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe club's first British record sale came in March 1949, when Derby County paid £24,500 for Johnny Morris. However, 35 years passed before Manchester United next broke the record for the biggest sale by a British club; the sale of Ray Wilkins to Milan for £1.5 million in June 1984 was also the club's first million-pound sale.

The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, before joining the Football League in 1892. After a brush with bankruptcy in 1901, the club reformed as Manchester United in 1902. Manchester United currently play in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. They have not been out of the top tier since 1975, and they have never been lower than the second tier.[1] They have also been involved in European football ever since they became the first English club to enter the European Cup in 1956.[2]\n\n\nThis list encompasses the major honours won by Manchester United and records set by the club, their managers and their players. The player records section includes details of the club's leading goalscorers and those who have made most appearances in first-team competitions. It also records notable achievements by Manchester United players on the international stage, and the highest transfer fees paid and received by the club. The club's attendance records, both at Old Trafford, their home since 1910, and Maine Road, their temporary home from 1946 to 1949, are also included in the list.\n\n\nThe club currently holds the record for the most Premier League titles with 13, and the highest number of English top-flight titles with 20. The club's record appearance maker is Ryan Giggs, who made 963 appearances between 1991 and 2014, and the club's record goalscorer is Wayne Rooney, who scored 253 goals in 559 appearances between 2004 and 2017.\n\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of three medals sitting on a stand. One medal is gold and two are silver.](image)Winners' and runners-up medals from Manchester United's UEFA Champions League final appearances in 2008, 2009 and 2011\n![](image)Trophy cabinet of United on display in the Old Trafford museum\nManchester United's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886.[3] Their first national senior honour came in 1908, when they won the 1907–08 Football League First Division title. The club also won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. In terms of the number of trophies won, the 1990s were Manchester United's most successful decade, during which they won five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared)[A], one Champions League, one Cup Winners' Cup, one Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup.\n\n\nThe club currently holds the record for most top-division titles, with 20. They were also the first team to win the Premier League, as well as holding the record for the most Premier League titles (13), and became the first English team to win the European Cup when they won it in 1968. Their most recent trophy came in February 2023, when they won the EFL Cup.[4]\n\n\n\n### Domestic[edit]\n\n\n#### League[edit]\n\n\n* **First Division / Premier League (Level 1)[B]: 20 – record**\n\t+ 1907–08, 1910–11, 1951–52, 1955–56, 1956–57, 1964–65, 1966–67, 1992–93, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1996–97, 1998–99, 1999–2000, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2006–07, 2007–08, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2012–13\n* **Second Division (Level 2)[B]: 2**\n\t+ 1935–36, 1974–75\n\n\n#### Cups[edit]\n\n\n* **FA Cup: 12**\n\t+ 1908–09, 1947–48, 1962–63, 1976–77, 1982–83, 1984–85, 1989–90, 1993–94, 1995–96, 1998–99, 2003–04, 2015–16\n* **League/EFL Cup: 6**\n\t+ 1991–92, 2005–06, 2008–09, 2009–10, 2016–17, 2022–23\n* **FA Charity/Community Shield[A]: 21 (17 outright, 4 shared) – record**\n\t+ 1908, 1911, 1952, 1956, 1957, 1965\\*, 1967\\*, 1977\\*, 1983, 1990\\*, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016 (\\* joint holders)\n\n\n### European[edit]\n\n\n* **European Cup / UEFA Champions League: 3**\n\t+ 1967–68, 1998–99, 2007–08\n* **European Cup Winners' Cup: 1**\n\t+ 1990–91\n* **UEFA Europa League: 1**\n\t+ 2016–17\n* **European Super Cup: 1**\n\t+ 1991\n\n\n### Worldwide[edit]\n\n\n* **Intercontinental Cup: 1**\n\t+ 1999\n* **FIFA Club World Cup: 1**\n\t+ 2008\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n* **Laureus World Team of the Year**\n\t+ **Winner:** 2000[5]\n\n\n* **IFFHS World Club Team of the Year**\n\t+ **Winner:** 1999, 2008[6]\n\n\n* **PFA Merit Award**\n\t+ **Winner:** 1993, 2013\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\n![A side-on photograph of a man with red hair.

However, Matt Busby did not want to burden the young player with the \"£30,000-man\" tag, and Barnsley agreed for the fee to be reduced by £1 to £29,999. Busby then took the extra pound from his wallet and gave it to the lady who had been serving the teas.[50]\n\n\nManchester United made their first six-figure signing in August 1962 with the transfer of Denis Law from Torino for £110,000,[*citation needed*] a new British record.[51] The club broke the British transfer record again in 1981 with the £1.5 million signing of Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion.[52] When Andy Cole signed for United in January 1995, the club paid £7 million, almost double their previous record of £3.75 million, which they paid for Roy Keane 18 months earlier.[*citation needed*] In the summer of 2001, the club broke their transfer record twice in the space of a month, first paying PSV Eindhoven £19 million for Ruud van Nistelrooy, and then £28.1 million to Lazio for Juan Sebastián Verón.

That same month, Manchester City paid five times more for Scottish forward Joe Cassidy. The club's first £1,000 sale came 12 years later with the sale of Harold Halse to Aston Villa.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe club's first British record sale came in March 1949, when Derby County paid £24,500 for Johnny Morris. However, 35 years passed before Manchester United next broke the record for the biggest sale by a British club; the sale of Ray Wilkins to Milan for £1.5 million in June 1984 was also the club's first million-pound sale.

For a season-by-season statistical breakdown, see List of Arsenal F.C. seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n![Freddie Ljunberg, wearing gloves and a redcurrant football shirt applauds the crowd. A stand full with people and man wearing a football shirt are visible in the background.](image)Thierry Henry became Arsenal's record goalscorer in October 2005.\nArsenal Football Club is an English professional association football club based in Islington, London. The club was formed in Woolwich in 1886 as Dial Square before being renamed as Royal Arsenal, and then Woolwich Arsenal in 1893.[1] In 1914, the club's name was shortened to Arsenal F.C. after moving to Highbury a year earlier.[2] After spending their first four seasons solely participating in cup tournaments and friendlies, Arsenal became the first southern member admitted into the Football League in 1893.[3] In spite of finishing fifth in the Second Division in 1919, the club was voted to rejoin the First Division at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur.[4] Since that time, they have not fallen below the first tier of the English football league system and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight.[5] The club remained in the Football League until 1992, when its First Division was superseded as English football's top level by the newly formed Premier League, of which they were an inaugural member.[6]\n\n\nThe list encompasses the honours won by Arsenal at national, regional, county and friendly level, records set by the club, their managers and their players. The player records section itemises the club's leading goalscorers and those who have made most appearances in first-team competitions. It also records notable achievements by Arsenal players on the international stage, and the highest transfer fees paid and received by the club. Attendance records at Highbury, the Emirates Stadium, the club's home ground since 2006, and Wembley Stadium, their temporary home for UEFA Champions League games between 1998 and 1999, are also included.\n\n\nArsenal have won 13 top-flight titles, and hold the record for the most FA Cup wins, with 14. The club's record appearance maker is David O'Leary, who made 722 appearances between 1975 and 1993. Thierry Henry is Arsenal's record goalscorer, scoring 228 goals in total.\n\n\nAll figures are correct as of *26 December 2020*.\n\n\n\n\n## Honours and achievements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Premier League commissioned a unique gold trophy to commemorate Arsenal's unbeaten season of 2003–04.\nArsenal's first ever silverware was won as the Royal Arsenal in 1890. The Kent Junior Cup, won by Royal Arsenal's reserves, was the club's first trophy, while the first team's first trophy came three weeks later when they won the Kent Senior Cup.[7][8] Their first national major honour came in 1930, when they won the FA Cup.[9] The club enjoyed further success in the 1930s, winning another FA Cup and five Football League First Division titles.[10][11] Arsenal won their first league and cup double in the 1970–71 season and twice repeated the feat, in 1997–98 and 2001–02, as well as winning a cup double of the FA Cup and League Cup in 1992–93.[12] In 2003–04, Arsenal recorded an unbeaten top-flight league season, something achieved only once before by Preston North End in 1888–89, who only had to play 22 games.[13] To mark the achievement, a special gold version of the Premier League trophy was commissioned and presented to the club the following season.[14] Their most recent success came in 2023, when they defeated Manchester City 4–1 on penalties to secure their 17th Community Shield title.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Arsenal F.C. timeline\n |\n| This box: * view\n* talk\n* edit\n |\n|

Chapman remained sober while the Bolton representatives got very drunk, and managed to haggle down the fee to a price he considered a bargain.[96] Jack's transfer to Arsenal was the second time Jack broke the world football transfer record, the first time being his £3,500 move from Plymouth Argyle to Bolton Wanderers in 1920.[97]\n\n\nFor consistency, fees in the record transfer tables below are all sourced from BBC Sport's contemporary reports of each transfer. Where the report mentions an initial fee potentially rising to a higher figure depending on contractual clauses being satisfied in the future, only the initial fee is listed in the tables.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecord transfer fees paid by Arsenal\n| Rank\n | Player\n | Fee (min.)\n | Date\n | Club transferred from\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Declan Rice (ENG) | £100m[A] | 15 July 2023\n | ![England](image) West Ham United | [94] |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Nicolas Pépé (CIV) | £72m\n | 1 August 2019\n | ![France](image) Lille | [98] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Kai Havertz (GER) | £65m\n | 28 June 2023\n | ![England](image) Chelsea | [99] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (GAB) | £56m\n | 31 January 2018\n | ![Germany](image) Borussia Dortmund | [100] |\n| 5\n | ![](image) Ben White (ENG) | £50m\n | 30 July 2021\n | ![England](image) Brighton & Hove Albion | [101] |\n| 6\n | ![](image) Alexandre Lacazette (FRA) | £46.5m[B] | 5 July 2017\n | ![France](image) Lyon | [102] |\n| 7\n | ![](image) Thomas Partey (GHA) | £45.3m\n | 5 October 2020\n | ![Spain](image) Atlético Madrid | [103] |\n| 8\n | ![](image) Gabriel Jesus (BRA) | £45m\n | 4 July 2022\n | ![England](image) Manchester City | [104] |\n| 9\n | ![](image) Mesut Özil (GER) | £42.4m\n | 2 September 2013\n | ![Spain](image) Real Madrid | [91] |\n| 10\n | ![](image) Shkodran Mustafi (GER) | £35m\n | 30 August 2016\n | ![Spain](image) Valencia | [105] |\n| ![](image) Alexis Sánchez (CHI) | £35m\n | 10 July 2014\n | ![Spain](image) Barcelona | [106] |\n| ![](image) Granit Xhaka (SUI) | £35m\n | 25 May 2016\n | ![Germany](image) Borussia Mönchengladbach | [107] |\n\n\n1. **^** plus another £5 million in additional bonuses\n2. **^** plus another £6.1 million in additional bonuses\n\n\n\nRecord transfer fees that Arsenal have received\n| Rank\n | Player\n | Fee (min.)\n | Date\n | Club transferred to\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Folarin Balogun (USA) | £35m\n | 30 August 2023\n | ![France](image) Monaco | [93] |\n| ![](image) Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (ENG) | £35m\n | 31 August 2017\n | ![England](image) Liverpool | [92] |\n| 3\n | ![](image) Alex Iwobi (NGA) | £28m[A] | 8 August 2019\n | ![England](image) Everton | [108] |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Cesc Fàbregas (ESP) | £25.4m[B] | 15 August 2011\n | ![Spain](image) Barcelona | [109] |\n| 5\n | ![](image) Emmanuel Adebayor (TGO) | £25m\n | 19 July 2009\n | ![England](image) Manchester City | [110] |\n| ![](image) Samir Nasri (FRA) | £25m\n | 24 August 2011\n | ![England](image) Manchester City | [111] |\n| ![](image) Marc Overmars (NED) | £25m\n | 28 July 2000\n | ![Spain](image) Barcelona | [112] |\n| 8\n | ![](image) Nicolas Anelka (FRA) | £23.5m\n | 2 August 1999\n | ![Spain](image) Real Madrid | [113] |\n| 9\n | ![](image) Robin van Persie (NED) | £22.5m[C] | 15 August 2012\n | ![England](image) Manchester United | [114] |\n| 10\n | ![](image) Granit Xhaka (SUI) | £21.4m\n | 6 July 2023\n | ![Germany](image) Bayer Leverkusen | [115] |\n\n\n1. **^** plus another £6 million in additional bonuses\n2. **^** plus another £4.4 million in additional bonuses\n3. **^** plus another £1.5 million in additional bonuses\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dennis Bergkamp was inducted into the English Hall of Fame in 2007.

They also reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 2000 and the Europa League in 2019, and became the first London team to appear in a UEFA Champions League final in 2006.[162][163] Despite having never won the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal have set numerous records in the competition. Between the 1998–99 and 2016–17 seasons, they participated in nineteen successive editions, a record only surpassed in Europe by Real Madrid.[164] Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten consecutive clean sheets in the run-in to Arsenal's first UEFA Champions League final and the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal.[165] Arsenal were also the first British side to defeat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund away from home, and both Milanese teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro. They were also the first British side to win away to Juventus.[166]\n\n\n\n## Global records[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1928, Arsenal, alongside Chelsea, made history by becoming the first football clubs to wear numbered shirts.[167] A year earlier the first ever live radio commentary of a football match took place, between Arsenal and Sheffield United.[168] Arsenal played in the first match broadcast live on television, against their reserve counterparts in 1937 and have since participated in the world's first live 3D and interactive football matches, both with Manchester United.[169][170][171]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Football records and statistics in England\n* Premier League records and statistics\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** For a record of all matches participated in by Arsenal, see the AISA Arsenal History Society's line-ups database.[8] For corroboration, multiple other sources exist.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]\n2. **^** Although not organised by UEFA, it is considered to be a major honor by FIFA and UEFA took over the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1971 and reformed it into the UEFA Cup. As the official precursor to the UEFA Europa League, it is included here under UEFA.\n3. **^** The Sheriff of London Charity Shield was replaced by the FA Charity Shield (now FA Community Shield) in 1908. Although it is the official precursor to the FA Community Shield, it is not included here under The Football Association because Arsenal only won the fundraising matches that followed the Sheriff of London Charity Shield's 1931 revival.\n4. **^** Laurie Scott and George Eastham were called up to England squads (1950, and 1962 and 1966, respectively), but did not play.[83]\n5. **^** George Eastham was retrospectively awarded a medal for being a non-playing member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning side.[87]\n6. **^** Unusually, Arsenal were forced to play two matches on the same day on 12 December 1896; while the first team took on Loughborough in the League, the reserves played Leyton in the FA Cup. The irony is that the reserves won handsomely, 5–0, whilst the seniors suffered Arsenal's record league defeat.[145][146] Additionally, Arsenal lost 0–9 to Chelsea in a wartime London Combination match on 21 April 1916,[147] but this is not counted as an official first-class match.[148]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* Harris, Jeff (1995).

For a season-by-season statistical breakdown, see List of Arsenal F.C. seasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n![Freddie Ljunberg, wearing gloves and a redcurrant football shirt applauds the crowd. A stand full with people and man wearing a football shirt are visible in the background.](image)Thierry Henry became Arsenal's record goalscorer in October 2005.\nArsenal Football Club is an English professional association football club based in Islington, London. The club was formed in Woolwich in 1886 as Dial Square before being renamed as Royal Arsenal, and then Woolwich Arsenal in 1893.[1] In 1914, the club's name was shortened to Arsenal F.C. after moving to Highbury a year earlier.[2] After spending their first four seasons solely participating in cup tournaments and friendlies, Arsenal became the first southern member admitted into the Football League in 1893.[3] In spite of finishing fifth in the Second Division in 1919, the club was voted to rejoin the First Division at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur.[4] Since that time, they have not fallen below the first tier of the English football league system and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight.[5] The club remained in the Football League until 1992, when its First Division was superseded as English football's top level by the newly formed Premier League, of which they were an inaugural member.[6]\n\n\nThe list encompasses the honours won by Arsenal at national, regional, county and friendly level, records set by the club, their managers and their players. The player records section itemises the club's leading goalscorers and those who have made most appearances in first-team competitions. It also records notable achievements by Arsenal players on the international stage, and the highest transfer fees paid and received by the club. Attendance records at Highbury, the Emirates Stadium, the club's home ground since 2006, and Wembley Stadium, their temporary home for UEFA Champions League games between 1998 and 1999, are also included.\n\n\nArsenal have won 13 top-flight titles, and hold the record for the most FA Cup wins, with 14. The club's record appearance maker is David O'Leary, who made 722 appearances between 1975 and 1993. Thierry Henry is Arsenal's record goalscorer, scoring 228 goals in total.\n\n\nAll figures are correct as of *26 December 2020*.\n\n\n\n\n## Honours and achievements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Premier League commissioned a unique gold trophy to commemorate Arsenal's unbeaten season of 2003–04.\nArsenal's first ever silverware was won as the Royal Arsenal in 1890. The Kent Junior Cup, won by Royal Arsenal's reserves, was the club's first trophy, while the first team's first trophy came three weeks later when they won the Kent Senior Cup.[7][8] Their first national major honour came in 1930, when they won the FA Cup.[9] The club enjoyed further success in the 1930s, winning another FA Cup and five Football League First Division titles.[10][11] Arsenal won their first league and cup double in the 1970–71 season and twice repeated the feat, in 1997–98 and 2001–02, as well as winning a cup double of the FA Cup and League Cup in 1992–93.[12] In 2003–04, Arsenal recorded an unbeaten top-flight league season, something achieved only once before by Preston North End in 1888–89, who only had to play 22 games.[13] To mark the achievement, a special gold version of the Premier League trophy was commissioned and presented to the club the following season.[14] Their most recent success came in 2023, when they defeated Manchester City 4–1 on penalties to secure their 17th Community Shield title.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Arsenal F.C. timeline\n |\n| This box: * view\n* talk\n* edit\n |\n|

Chapman remained sober while the Bolton representatives got very drunk, and managed to haggle down the fee to a price he considered a bargain.[96] Jack's transfer to Arsenal was the second time Jack broke the world football transfer record, the first time being his £3,500 move from Plymouth Argyle to Bolton Wanderers in 1920.[97]\n\n\nFor consistency, fees in the record transfer tables below are all sourced from BBC Sport's contemporary reports of each transfer.

They also reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 2000 and the Europa League in 2019, and became the first London team to appear in a UEFA Champions League final in 2006.[162][163] Despite having never won the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal have set numerous records in the competition. Between the 1998–99 and 2016–17 seasons, they participated in nineteen successive editions, a record only surpassed in Europe by Real Madrid.[164] Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten consecutive clean sheets in the run-in to Arsenal's first UEFA Champions League final and the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal.[165] Arsenal were also the first British side to defeat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund away from home, and both Milanese teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro. They were also the first British side to win away to Juventus.[166]\n\n\n\n## Global records[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1928, Arsenal, alongside Chelsea, made history by becoming the first football clubs to wear numbered shirts.[167] A year earlier the first ever live radio commentary of a football match took place, between Arsenal and Sheffield United.[168] Arsenal played in the first match broadcast live on television, against their reserve counterparts in 1937 and have since participated in the world's first live 3D and interactive football matches, both with Manchester United.[169][170][171]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Football records and statistics in England\n* Premier League records and statistics\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** For a record of all matches participated in by Arsenal, see the AISA Arsenal History Society's line-ups database.[8] For corroboration, multiple other sources exist.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23]\n2. **^** Although not organised by UEFA, it is considered to be a major honor by FIFA and UEFA took over the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1971 and reformed it into the UEFA Cup.

Although it is the official precursor to the FA Community Shield, it is not included here under The Football Association because Arsenal only won the fundraising matches that followed the Sheriff of London Charity Shield's 1931 revival.\n4. **^** Laurie Scott and George Eastham were called up to England squads (1950, and 1962 and 1966, respectively), but did not play.[83]\n5. **^** George Eastham was retrospectively awarded a medal for being a non-playing member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning side.[87]\n6. **^** Unusually, Arsenal were forced to play two matches on the same day on 12 December 1896; while the first team took on Loughborough in the League, the reserves played Leyton in the FA Cup. The irony is that the reserves won handsomely, 5–0, whilst the seniors suffered Arsenal's record league defeat.[145][146] Additionally, Arsenal lost 0–9 to Chelsea in a wartime London Combination match on 21 April 1916,[147] but this is not counted as an official first-class match.[148]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* Harris, Jeff (1995).
