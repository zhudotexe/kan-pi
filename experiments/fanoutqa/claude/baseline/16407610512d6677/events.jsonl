Having first joined the company as a summer associate in high school, he became the company's fifth CEO in 2014. He previously led the company's Sam's Club division, from 2005 to 2009, and Walmart International, from 2009 to 2013.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMcMillon was born in Memphis, Tennessee,[2] and grew up in Jonesboro, Arkansas,[3] the eldest of three children born to Laura and Morris McMillon, a dentist who served in Vietnam.[4] His parents moved the family to Bentonville, Arkansas, the home of Walmart headquarters, when McMillon was 16.[4] A sports enthusiast, McMillon played point guard on the Bentonville High School basketball team.[4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nMcMillon has worked for Walmart throughout his career.[5] He took on his first role with the company as a teenager in 1984.[4][5] He later became a buyer, then moved into management roles before becoming CEO in 2014.[3][5]\n\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nWhen he was a teenager, McMillon began his first job with Walmart as a summer associate. He worked during the summer[4] unloading trucks in a distribution center. After high school, McMillon attended University of Arkansas, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1989.[6]\n\n\nThe next year, as McMillon studied for a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from University of Tulsa, he called Walmart and told an executive he was interested in training to become a buyer when he completed his studies.[4] Soon thereafter, McMillon rejoined Walmart as an assistant manager at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, store.[4] After completing his MBA in 1991,[6] McMillon moved to Walmart's Bentonville headquarters to join the buyer-training program.[7][8] Originally in charge of buying fishing tackle,[4] he later took on various roles as a buyer and a merchandiser, dealing in food, clothes, crafts and furnishings.[9] He later worked as a general merchandise manager for Walmart's wholesale store division Sam's Club before taking an executive role at Walmart, overseeing toys, electronics, and sporting goods, among other areas.[9]\n\n\n\n### Sam's Club (2005–2009)[edit]\n\n\nWalmart promoted McMillon to president and CEO of Sam's Club on August 4, 2005.[7][10] Under McMillon, the wholesaler emphasized marketing to small business customers.[3] Additionally, McMillon incorporated what *The Wall Street Journal* called \"treasure hunt\" items that are limited-selection expensive premium items, such as diamond necklaces and wine vacations, for sale next to cheap bulk goods in an attempt to compete with Costco.[3]\n\n\n\n### Walmart International (2009–2013)[edit]\n\n\nWalmart officials moved McMillon from his role at Sam's Club to lead Walmart's international division in February 2009,[11] replacing Mike Duke, who was promoted to CEO of Walmart Stores, Inc.[9] Under McMillon, Walmart International focused on improving in existing markets, such as Canada, China, United Kingdom and the Americas.[12] One area of particular importance to McMillon was integrating Walmart's \"everyday low prices\" model to these international markets.[12] Under McMillon, the international division acquired a majority stake in South Africa's Massmart Holdings Ltd. for US$2.4 billion.[4][13]\n\n\nDuring McMillon's tenure, Walmart International's sales growth outpaced Walmart US[14] and grew to 29 percent of total sales company-wide.[9] When McMillon first became head of the division, it comprised more than 3,300 stores in 14 countries.[15] When Walmart announced it would move him to head Walmart Stores, Inc. in late 2013, Walmart International operated 6,300 stores in 26 countries.[16][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### CEO of Walmart, Inc. (2014–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McMillon speaks from the White House Rose Garden on the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020\nWalmart announced on November 25, 2013, that McMillon would immediately join the company's board of directors,[17] and would replace Mike Duke as Walmart CEO effective on February 1, 2014, becoming the company's fifth chief executive.[4]\n\n\nMcMillon took over the company at a time of slowing growth and increased competition from rivals, such as Costco, Amazon.com, grocery store chains Kroger and Safeway, and discount chains of small stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General.[4] Within his first two years as chief executive, McMillon raised wages for hourly workers in the US, boosted the company's commitment to e-commerce and revamped Walmart's executive team. While increased spending on labor and Walmart's digital offerings lowered short-term profits, McMillon argued that the moves would lead to happier workers and better customer service,[18] as well as a better footing in a changing retail market.[19]\n\n\nIn February 2015, McMillon announced Walmart would invest an additional US$2.7 billion in higher associate wages, benefits and training, including raising its lowest wage to US$9 an hour in 2015 and US$10 an hour for 2016.[20][21] The action affected 40 percent of the company's 1.4 million US workers.[22] In January 2016, McMillon announced raises for the majority of its workers, free basic short-term disability for full-time workers and a revised paid time off program.[18]\n\n\nMcMillon made it a long-term goal of Walmart to increase investments in e-commerce, stressing a need to create a \"seamless shopping experience\".[23] As such he announced in 2015 that Walmart would invest US$1 billion on its online operations.[24] Another goal is to improve the company's environmental sustainability and eliminate waste across the company.[25] In 2014, Walmart began rolling out an initiative to replace lighting in its stores in the US, UK, Latin America and Asia with LED lights for energy efficiency.[26] At the Davos World Economic Forum in January 2016, McMillon said Walmart would press three of its main goals: supply the company with renewable energy, eliminate waste and promote sustainably packaged goods.[27]\n\n\nAs CEO, McMillon sought to make a \"positive difference\" in other issues.[25] On March 31, 2015, McMillon issued a statement urging Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the state's \"religious freedom\" bill.[28] McMillon said the bill \"threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold\".[28]\n\n\nIn June 2015, McMillon said the company would stop selling Confederate flag merchandise[21] following the shooting of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.[29] McMillon altered Walmart's gun sales. He told *CNNMoney* in an interview that Walmart's selection of firearms should be geared towards hunters and sports shooters.[30] In August 2015, the company ceased sales of military-style semiautomatic weapons.[30]\n\n\n*Forbes* named McMillon to its World's Most Powerful People list in 2014, 2015 and 2016 where he ranked No. 29, No. 32, No. 27 respectively.[31] ExecRank ranked McMillon No. 4 on its 2015 list of top CEOs for large companies.[32]\n\n\nIn December 2016, McMillon joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.[33] In August 2017, McMillon wrote a rebuke of President Trump's response to the violent protests Charlottesville, Virginia in an email to all employees and on the internal company website that is viewable by the public. The statement said the President, \"missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together\". A company spokesman said McMillon would continue to serve on a presidential advisory council on economic development.[34]\n\n\nIn September 2019, McMillion announced that the company would no longer sell ammunition used for handguns and military-style weapons. This policy update came as a result of the mass shooting which took place at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas in August 2019. McMillion's actions to create a dialogue and take actions around the issue, set a new precedent for how corporations and their leaders address these matters.[35]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMcMillon lives with his wife, Shelley, in Bentonville, Arkansas.[19] They have two sons.[6] Doug McMillon is a born-again Christian.[36]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Walmart Executive Management\".

After high school, McMillon attended University of Arkansas, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1989.[6]\n\n\nThe next year, as McMillon studied for a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from University of Tulsa, he called Walmart and told an executive he was interested in training to become a buyer when he completed his studies.[4] Soon thereafter, McMillon rejoined Walmart as an assistant manager at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, store.[4] After completing his MBA in 1991,[6] McMillon moved to Walmart's Bentonville headquarters to join the buyer-training program.[7][8] Originally in charge of buying fishing tackle,[4] he later took on various roles as a buyer and a merchandiser, dealing in food, clothes, crafts and furnishings.[9] He later worked as a general merchandise manager for Walmart's wholesale store division Sam's Club before taking an executive role at Walmart, overseeing toys, electronics, and sporting goods, among other areas.[9]\n\n\n\n### Sam's Club (2005–2009)[edit]\n\n\nWalmart promoted McMillon to president and CEO of Sam's Club on August 4, 2005.[7][10] Under McMillon, the wholesaler emphasized marketing to small business customers.[3] Additionally, McMillon incorporated what *The Wall Street Journal* called \"treasure hunt\" items that are limited-selection expensive premium items, such as diamond necklaces and wine vacations, for sale next to cheap bulk goods in an attempt to compete with Costco.[3]\n\n\n\n### Walmart International (2009–2013)[edit]\n\n\nWalmart officials moved McMillon from his role at Sam's Club to lead Walmart's international division in February 2009,[11] replacing Mike Duke, who was promoted to CEO of Walmart Stores, Inc.[9] Under McMillon, Walmart International focused on improving in existing markets, such as Canada, China, United Kingdom and the Americas.[12] One area of particular importance to McMillon was integrating Walmart's \"everyday low prices\" model to these international markets.[12] Under McMillon, the international division acquired a majority stake in South Africa's Massmart Holdings Ltd. for US$2.4 billion.[4][13]\n\n\nDuring McMillon's tenure, Walmart International's sales growth outpaced Walmart US[14] and grew to 29 percent of total sales company-wide.[9] When McMillon first became head of the division, it comprised more than 3,300 stores in 14 countries.[15] When Walmart announced it would move him to head Walmart Stores, Inc. in late 2013, Walmart International operated 6,300 stores in 26 countries.[16][*failed verification*]\n\n\n\n### CEO of Walmart, Inc. (2014–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McMillon speaks from the White House Rose Garden on the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020\nWalmart announced on November 25, 2013, that McMillon would immediately join the company's board of directors,[17] and would replace Mike Duke as Walmart CEO effective on February 1, 2014, becoming the company's fifth chief executive.[4]\n\n\nMcMillon took over the company at a time of slowing growth and increased competition from rivals, such as Costco, Amazon.com, grocery store chains Kroger and Safeway, and discount chains of small stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General.[4] Within his first two years as chief executive, McMillon raised wages for hourly workers in the US, boosted the company's commitment to e-commerce and revamped Walmart's executive team. While increased spending on labor and Walmart's digital offerings lowered short-term profits, McMillon argued that the moves would lead to happier workers and better customer service,[18] as well as a better footing in a changing retail market.[19]\n\n\nIn February 2015, McMillon announced Walmart would invest an additional US$2.7 billion in higher associate wages, benefits and training, including raising its lowest wage to US$9 an hour in 2015 and US$10 an hour for 2016.[20][21] The action affected 40 percent of the company's 1.4 million US workers.[22] In January 2016, McMillon announced raises for the majority of its workers, free basic short-term disability for full-time workers and a revised paid time off program.[18]\n\n\nMcMillon made it a long-term goal of Walmart to increase investments in e-commerce, stressing a need to create a \"seamless shopping experience\".[23] As such he announced in 2015 that Walmart would invest US$1 billion on its online operations.[24] Another goal is to improve the company's environmental sustainability and eliminate waste across the company.[25] In 2014, Walmart began rolling out an initiative to replace lighting in its stores in the US, UK, Latin America and Asia with LED lights for energy efficiency.[26] At the Davos World Economic Forum in January 2016, McMillon said Walmart would press three of its main goals: supply the company with renewable energy, eliminate waste and promote sustainably packaged goods.[27]\n\n\nAs CEO, McMillon sought to make a \"positive difference\" in other issues.[25] On March 31, 2015, McMillon issued a statement urging Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson to veto the state's \"religious freedom\" bill.[28] McMillon said the bill \"threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold\".[28]\n\n\nIn June 2015, McMillon said the company would stop selling Confederate flag merchandise[21] following the shooting of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.[29] McMillon altered Walmart's gun sales. He told *CNNMoney* in an interview that Walmart's selection of firearms should be geared towards hunters and sports shooters.[30] In August 2015, the company ceased sales of military-style semiautomatic weapons.[30]\n\n\n*Forbes* named McMillon to its World's Most Powerful People list in 2014, 2015 and 2016 where he ranked No. 29, No. 32, No. 27 respectively.[31] ExecRank ranked McMillon No. 4 on its 2015 list of top CEOs for large companies.[32]\n\n\nIn December 2016, McMillon joined a business forum assembled by then president-elect Donald Trump to provide strategic and policy advice on economic issues.[33] In August 2017, McMillon wrote a rebuke of President Trump's response to the violent protests Charlottesville, Virginia in an email to all employees and on the internal company website that is viewable by the public. The statement said the President, \"missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together\". A company spokesman said McMillon would continue to serve on a presidential advisory council on economic development.[34]\n\n\nIn September 2019, McMillion announced that the company would no longer sell ammunition used for handguns and military-style weapons. This policy update came as a result of the mass shooting which took place at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas in August 2019. McMillion's actions to create a dialogue and take actions around the issue, set a new precedent for how corporations and their leaders address these matters.[35]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMcMillon lives with his wife, Shelley, in Bentonville, Arkansas.[19] They have two sons.[6] Doug McMillon is a born-again Christian.[36]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Walmart Executive Management\".

Al Falih |\n| Website | https://www.aramco.com/en |\n\n\n**Amin Hassan Naser** (Arabic: أمين حسن الناصر‎) is the President and CEO of the Saudi Arabian oil company (Saudi Aramco), the world’s largest oil producer. He became acting president and chief executive in May 2015 before assuming the position permanently in September 2015.[1] During his tenure at Aramco, he has criticized fossil fuel divestment and promoted expansion and investment into oil production.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nNasser holds a Bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering from the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran. He completed the Saudi Aramco Management Development Seminar in Washington, D.C., in 1999; the Saudi Aramco Global Business Program in 2000; and the Senior Executive Program at Columbia University in 2002.[4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nNasser began his career with Saudi Aramco in 1982 as an engineer in the oil production department and proceeded to work in drilling and reservoir management. In 1997, he became manager of the Ras Tanura Producing Department. Later he became manager of the Northern Area Production Engineering Department, as well as the Safaniya Aramco.com Offshore and Onshore Producing Departments.[5] He was appointed Chief Petroleum Engineer in 2004 and became Senior Vice President of Saudi Aramco’s Upstream operations in 2008.[6] Nasser became acting President and CEO of Aramco in May 2015, and was made permanent in September 2015.[1]\n\n\nAs CEO, he led the company’s response to drone and missile attacks on its facilities in September 2019.[7]\n\n\nPrior to Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO), he led the company’s entry into the global debt and capital markets with its first bond issuance.[8] He oversaw Aramco’s 2019 IPO in which it became the world’s most valuable listed company, and led its 2020 acquisition of Saudi petrochemicals giant SABIC.[9][10]\n\n\nIn 2021, amid growing pressure for fossil fuel companies to become greener to contribute to climate change mitigation, Nasser warned countries against divesting in fossil fuels, arguing that it would cause inflation and cause unrest.[2]\n\n\n\n## Other[edit]\n\n\nNasser is on the Society of Petroleum Engineers's Industry Advisory Council, the International Advisory Board (IAB) of the KFUPM, the Board of Trustees of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST),[11] the World Economic Forum’s International Business Council, the JPMorgan International Advisory Council, the MIT President CEO Advisory Board and the Board of BlackRock.[12]\n\n\nIn July 2020, he received the ICIS Kavaler Award, which recognizes outstanding achievement in petrochemicals.[13] Nasser ranked first on the Forbes Middle East’s list of top 100 CEOs in the region for 2020.[14]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Saudi Aramco Names Amin H.

(2011–present) |\n| Website | Apple Leadership Profile |\n| Signature |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n**Timothy Donald Cook** (born November 1, 1960)[1] is an American business executive who became the chief executive officer of Apple Inc. in 2011. Cook had previously served as the company's chief operating officer under its co-founder Steve Jobs.[2]\n\n\nCook joined Apple in March 1998 as a senior vice president for worldwide operations, and then served as the executive vice president for worldwide sales and operations.[3] He was appointed chief executive on August 24, 2011 after Jobs, who was ill and died that October, resigned.[4] During his tenure as the chief executive, he advocated for the political reformation of international and domestic surveillance, cybersecurity, American manufacturing, and environmental preservation. Since 2011 when he took over Apple, to 2020, Cook doubled the company's revenue and profit, and the company's market value increased from $348 billion to $1.9 trillion.[5]\n\n\nCook also serves on the boards of directors of Nike, Inc.[4] and the National Football Foundation;[6] he is a trustee of Duke University, his alma mater.[7] Outside of Apple, Cook engages in philanthropy; in March 2015 he said he planned to donate his fortune to charity.[8] In 2014, Cook became the first chief executive of a *Fortune* 500 company to publicly come out as gay.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nCook was born in Mobile, Alabama, United States.[10][11] He was baptized in a Baptist church[12] and grew up in nearby Robertsdale. His father, Donald, was a shipyard worker,[13] and his mother, Geraldine, worked at a pharmacy.[10][14]\n\n\nCook graduated from Robertsdale High School in Alabama in 1978.[15] He earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in industrial engineering from Auburn University in 1982 and a Master of Business Administration from Duke University in 1988.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Pre-Apple era\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter graduating from Auburn University, Cook spent 12 years in IBM's personal computer business, ultimately serving as the director of North American fulfillment.[18] During this time, Cook also earned his MBA from Duke University, becoming a Fuqua Scholar in 1988.[19] Later, he served as the chief operating officer of the computer reseller division of Intelligent Electronics.[20] In 1997, he became the vice president for corporate materials at Compaq, but took up his position at Apple six months later.[21]\n\n\n\n### Apple era\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Early career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1998, Steve Jobs asked Cook to join Apple. In a commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs:\n\n\n\n\n> Any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq's favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998, I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company.[22]\n> \n> \n\n\nHis first position was senior vice president for worldwide operations.[23] Cook closed factories and warehouses, and replaced them with contract manufacturers; this resulted in a reduction of the company's inventory from months to days. Predicting its importance, his group had invested in long-term deals such as advance investment in flash memory since 2005. This guaranteed a stable supply of what became the iPod Nano, then iPhone and iPad. Competitors at Hewlett-Packard described their cancelled HP TouchPad tablet computer and later said that it was made from \"cast-off, reject iPad parts\".[24] Cook's actions were recognized for keeping costs under control, and combined with the rest of the company, generated huge profits.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cook giving the keynote at the 2012 World Wide Developers Conference\nIn January 2007, Cook was promoted to lead operations[26] and served as chief executive in 2009, while Jobs, in failing health, was away on a leave of absence. In January 2011, Apple's board of directors approved a third medical leave of absence requested by Jobs. During that time, Cook was responsible for most of Apple's day-to-day operations, while Jobs made most major decisions.[27][28]\n\n\n\n#### Apple chief executive (since 2011)\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Jobs resigned as CEO and became chairman of the board, Cook was named the new chief executive officer of Apple Inc. on August 24, 2011.[29][30] Six weeks later, on October 5, 2011, Jobs died due to complications from pancreatic cancer.[31] *Forbes* contributor Robin Ferracone wrote in September 2011: \"Jobs and Cook proceeded to forge a strong partnership, and rescued the company from its death spiral, which took it from $11 billion in revenue in 1995 down to less than $6 billion in 1998 ... Under their leadership, the company went from its nadir to a remarkable $100 billion today\".[28][32] In April 2012, *Time* included Cook on its annual \"100 Most Influential People in the World\" list.[33]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Cook made major changes to the company's executive team. Scott Forstall resigned as senior vice president of iOS after the poorly received launch of Apple Maps, and became an advisor to Cook until he eventually departed from the company in 2013. John Browett, who was senior VP of retail, was dismissed six months after he commenced at Apple, and given 100,000 shares worth US$60 million.[34] Forstall's duties were divided among four other Apple executives: design SVP Jony Ive assumed leadership of Apple's human interface team; Craig Federighi became the new head of iOS software engineering; services chief Eddy Cue became responsible for Maps and Siri; and Bob Mansfield, previously SVP of hardware engineering, became the head of a new technology group.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cook with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi\nCook made the executive changes after the third quarter of the fiscal year, when revenues and profits grew less than predicted.[36] Forstall's resignation was widely seen as a dismissal,[37][38] allegedly caused by Cook's desire to reduce \"rivalries between executives\",[39]: 127 and drew criticism, as Forstall had been seen as a possible successor to Cook.[40] On February 28, 2014, Cook made headlines when he challenged shareholders to \"get out of the stock\" if they did not share the company's views on sustainability and climate change.[41] In May 2016, Cook traveled to China to meet with government officials there after the Chinese government closed Apple's online iTunes Store and Apple Books store.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cook with Chongqing Mayor Huang in Apple Store Jiefangbei, China, August 17, 2016\nIn 2016, some analysts compared Cook to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, claiming that innovation had died down since he replaced Jobs, similar to when Ballmer became Microsoft CEO in 2000.[43][44] In December 2017, Cook was a speaker at the World Internet Conference in China.[45][46]\n\n\nCook was appointed chairman of the advisory board for Tsinghua University's economics school in October 2019 for a three-year term.[47]\n\n\nRep. Tom Malinowski, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and several other lawmakers criticized Cook in 2019 over Apple's decision to remove an app used by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong from its App Store.[48] They accused Apple of censorship, and co-signed a letter to Cook that read, \"Apple's decisions last week to accommodate the Chinese government by taking down HKMaps is deeply concerning. We urge you in the strongest terms to reverse course, to demonstrate that Apple puts values above market access, and to stand with the brave men and women fighting for basic rights and dignity in Hong Kong.\"[49] Cook explained in an internal letter why the company removed the Hong Kong mapping app used by protesters to coordinate movements.[50] In 2016, Cook signed a $275 billion deal with Chinese officials.[51] The deal – personally negotiated by Cook – paved the way for increased censorship by Apple in China, for example the removal of Muslim content, preventing users from entering numbers that refer to the date of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, censoring Chinese words like \"human rights\" or \"democracy\", and manipulating Apple Maps to support China in the Senkaku Islands dispute by making Chinese-claimed islands appear larger than they actually were.[52][53][54]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Cook received an approximate $750m payout, selling more than five million shares in Apple, ten years after becoming CEO.[55][56]\n\n\n\n## Public image\n\n[edit]\n\n### Leadership style\n\n[edit]\n\nAs Apple Inc. CEO, Cook regularly begins sending emails at 4:30 am each weekday, and in the past held Sunday-night staff meetings by telephone to prepare for the next week.[57] In May 2013 Cook shared that his leadership focused on people, strategy, and execution; he explained, \"If you get those three right the world is a great place.\"[58] Under Cook's leadership, Apple increased its donations to charity, and in 2013 he hired Lisa Jackson, formerly the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to assist Apple with the development of its renewable energy activities.[59][60][61] Since becoming CEO, Cook replaced Steve Jobs's micromanagement with a more hands-off style, and implemented a more collaborative culture at Apple.[39]: 314[38]\n\n\n\n### Public affiliations\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Cook with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House, April 25, 2018\nDuring the 2008 election cycle, Cook donated to Barack Obama's first White House election.[62]\n\n\nWhile it had been reported in early 2011 that Cook was gay,[63][64] at the time, and prior to his October 2014 public statement, Cook chose to keep his personal life private.[65] He did publicly support LGBT rights.[66] In October 2014, the Alabama Academy of Honor inducted Cook, who spoke about his home state's record of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights.[67] The Academy of Honor is the highest honor Alabama gives its citizens.[68]\n\n\nIn 2015, Cook said he donated to Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer and Patrick Leahy for their stances on e-book pricing and surveillance reform, respectively.[69] During the same election cycle, he hosted a fundraiser for Republican Senator Rob Portman.[69]\n\n\nIn early March 2016, Cook disclosed that he donated to the election campaign of Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California. In early June, Cook hosted a private fundraiser along with then Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan. The event was described by *Politico* as \"a joint fundraising committee aimed at helping to elect other House Republicans\".[69]\n\n\nIn the 2016 election, Cook raised funds for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.[70] At one point, Clinton's campaign considered Cook as a candidate for Vice President.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cook in 2017\nIn September 2017 at Bloomberg's Global Business Forum, Cook defended the DACA immigration program. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the direction of Donald Trump's administration, stating: \"This is unacceptable. This is not who we are as a country. I am personally shocked that there is even a discussion of this.\"[72][73]\n\n\nIn 2018, at a privacy conference in Brussels, Cook expressed his opinions on the stockpiling of personal data by tech firms, suggesting that it amounted to surveillance and should make the public \"very uncomfortable.\"[74]\n\n\nIn a meeting for the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board with President Donald Trump in March 2019, Trump referred to Cook as \"Tim Apple\".[75] Cook leaned into the slip-up by changing his display name on Twitter to Tim Apple.[76]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nCook is a fitness enthusiast and enjoys hiking, cycling, and going to the gym. He is known for being solitary, using an off-campus fitness center for privacy, and little is publicly shared about his personal life. He explained in October 2014 that he has sought to achieve a \"basic level of privacy\".[57][61]\n\n\nCook was misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996, an incident he said made him \"see the world in a different way\". He has since taken part in charity fundraising, such as cycle races to raise money for the disease. He later told the Auburn alumni magazine that his symptoms came from \"lugging a lot of incredibly heavy luggage around\".[77]\n\n\nCook has said that in 2009 he offered a portion of his liver to Jobs, as they shared a rare blood type. Cook said that Jobs responded by yelling, \"I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that.\"[78]\n\n\nWhile delivering the 2010 commencement speech at Auburn, Cook emphasized the importance of intuition during significant decision-making processes, and explained that preparation and hard work are also necessary to execute on intuition.[79]\n\n\nIn June 2014, Cook attended San Francisco's gay pride parade along with a delegation of Apple staff.[80] On October 30, Cook publicly came out as gay in an editorial for *Bloomberg Business*, saying, \"I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.\"[81] He consulted with Anderson Cooper, who had publicly come out himself, on aspects of the statement, and cleared the timing to ensure it would not distract from business interests.[82] Cook had been open about his sexuality \"for years\", and while many people at the company were aware of his sexual orientation, he sought to focus on Apple's products and customers rather than his personal life. He ended his op-ed by writing, \"We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick.\"[81] Cook became the first and only openly gay CEO on the *Fortune* 500 list.[82] In September 2015, Cook clarified on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,* \"Where I valued my privacy significantly, I felt that I was valuing it too far above what I could do for other people, so I wanted to tell everyone my truth.\"[83] In October 2019, he talked about the decision and remarked on how it was thanks to LGBTQ people who had fought for their rights before him that paved the way for his success, and that he needed to let younger generations know that—in a coding analogy—he saw being gay as a feature his life had to offer rather than any problem.[82] He hoped his openness could help LGBTQ youth dealing with homelessness and suicide hope that their situation could get better.[82]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cook appeared on the *Time* 100, *Time*'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[84]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\n* *Financial Times* Person of the Year (2014)[85][86][87]\n* Ripple of Change Award (2015)[88][89]\n* *Fortune*'s World's Greatest Leader (2015)[90][91]\n* Alabama Academy of Honor: Inductee (2015)[67]\n* Human Rights Campaign's Visibility Award (2015)[92][93]\n* Honorary Doctor of Science from University of Glasgow in Glasgow, Scotland (2017)[94]\n* Courage Against Hate award from Anti-Defamation League (2018)[95]\n* Honorary Master’s degree in Innovation and International Management from University of Naples Federico II in Naples, Italy (2022)[96][97]\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Brownlee, John (August 25, 2011). \"Who Is Apple's New CEO Tim Cook?

(2011–present) |\n| Website | Apple Leadership Profile |\n| Signature |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n**Timothy Donald Cook** (born November 1, 1960)[1] is an American business executive who became the chief executive officer of Apple Inc. in 2011. Cook had previously served as the company's chief operating officer under its co-founder Steve Jobs.[2]\n\n\nCook joined Apple in March 1998 as a senior vice president for worldwide operations, and then served as the executive vice president for worldwide sales and operations.[3] He was appointed chief executive on August 24, 2011 after Jobs, who was ill and died that October, resigned.[4] During his tenure as the chief executive, he advocated for the political reformation of international and domestic surveillance, cybersecurity, American manufacturing, and environmental preservation. Since 2011 when he took over Apple, to 2020, Cook doubled the company's revenue and profit, and the company's market value increased from $348 billion to $1.9 trillion.[5]\n\n\nCook also serves on the boards of directors of Nike, Inc.[4] and the National Football Foundation;[6] he is a trustee of Duke University, his alma mater.[7] Outside of Apple, Cook engages in philanthropy; in March 2015 he said he planned to donate his fortune to charity.[8] In 2014, Cook became the first chief executive of a *Fortune* 500 company to publicly come out as gay.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nCook was born in Mobile, Alabama, United States.[10][11] He was baptized in a Baptist church[12] and grew up in nearby Robertsdale. His father, Donald, was a shipyard worker,[13] and his mother, Geraldine, worked at a pharmacy.[10][14]\n\n\nCook graduated from Robertsdale High School in Alabama in 1978.[15] He earned a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in industrial engineering from Auburn University in 1982 and a Master of Business Administration from Duke University in 1988.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Pre-Apple era\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter graduating from Auburn University, Cook spent 12 years in IBM's personal computer business, ultimately serving as the director of North American fulfillment.[18] During this time, Cook also earned his MBA from Duke University, becoming a Fuqua Scholar in 1988.[19] Later, he served as the chief operating officer of the computer reseller division of Intelligent Electronics.[20] In 1997, he became the vice president for corporate materials at Compaq, but took up his position at Apple six months later.[21]\n\n\n\n### Apple era\n\n[edit]\n\n#### Early career\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1998, Steve Jobs asked Cook to join Apple. In a commencement speech at Auburn University, Cook said he decided to join Apple after meeting Jobs:\n\n\n\n\n> Any purely rational consideration of cost and benefits lined up in Compaq's favor, and the people who knew me best advised me to stay at Compaq... On that day in early 1998, I listened to my intuition, not the left side of my brain or for that matter even the people who knew me best... no more than five minutes into my initial interview with Steve, I wanted to throw caution and logic to the wind and join Apple. My intuition already knew that joining Apple was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work for the creative genius and to be on the executive team that could resurrect a great American company.[22]\n> \n> \n\n\nHis first position was senior vice president for worldwide operations.[23] Cook closed factories and warehouses, and replaced them with contract manufacturers; this resulted in a reduction of the company's inventory from months to days. Predicting its importance, his group had invested in long-term deals such as advance investment in flash memory since 2005. This guaranteed a stable supply of what became the iPod Nano, then iPhone and iPad. Competitors at Hewlett-Packard described their cancelled HP TouchPad tablet computer and later said that it was made from \"cast-off, reject iPad parts\".[24] Cook's actions were recognized for keeping costs under control, and combined with the rest of the company, generated huge profits.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cook giving the keynote at the 2012 World Wide Developers Conference\nIn January 2007, Cook was promoted to lead operations[26] and served as chief executive in 2009, while Jobs, in failing health, was away on a leave of absence. In January 2011, Apple's board of directors approved a third medical leave of absence requested by Jobs. During that time, Cook was responsible for most of Apple's day-to-day operations, while Jobs made most major decisions.[27][28]\n\n\n\n#### Apple chief executive (since 2011)\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Jobs resigned as CEO and became chairman of the board, Cook was named the new chief executive officer of Apple Inc. on August 24, 2011.[29][30] Six weeks later, on October 5, 2011, Jobs died due to complications from pancreatic cancer.[31] *Forbes* contributor Robin Ferracone wrote in September 2011: \"Jobs and Cook proceeded to forge a strong partnership, and rescued the company from its death spiral, which took it from $11 billion in revenue in 1995 down to less than $6 billion in 1998 ... Under their leadership, the company went from its nadir to a remarkable $100 billion today\".[28][32] In April 2012, *Time* included Cook on its annual \"100 Most Influential People in the World\" list.[33]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Cook made major changes to the company's executive team. Scott Forstall resigned as senior vice president of iOS after the poorly received launch of Apple Maps, and became an advisor to Cook until he eventually departed from the company in 2013. John Browett, who was senior VP of retail, was dismissed six months after he commenced at Apple, and given 100,000 shares worth US$60 million.[34] Forstall's duties were divided among four other Apple executives: design SVP Jony Ive assumed leadership of Apple's human interface team; Craig Federighi became the new head of iOS software engineering; services chief Eddy Cue became responsible for Maps and Siri; and Bob Mansfield, previously SVP of hardware engineering, became the head of a new technology group.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cook with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi\nCook made the executive changes after the third quarter of the fiscal year, when revenues and profits grew less than predicted.[36] Forstall's resignation was widely seen as a dismissal,[37][38] allegedly caused by Cook's desire to reduce \"rivalries between executives\",[39]: 127 and drew criticism, as Forstall had been seen as a possible successor to Cook.[40] On February 28, 2014, Cook made headlines when he challenged shareholders to \"get out of the stock\" if they did not share the company's views on sustainability and climate change.[41] In May 2016, Cook traveled to China to meet with government officials there after the Chinese government closed Apple's online iTunes Store and Apple Books store.[42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cook with Chongqing Mayor Huang in Apple Store Jiefangbei, China, August 17, 2016\nIn 2016, some analysts compared Cook to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, claiming that innovation had died down since he replaced Jobs, similar to when Ballmer became Microsoft CEO in 2000.[43][44] In December 2017, Cook was a speaker at the World Internet Conference in China.[45][46]\n\n\nCook was appointed chairman of the advisory board for Tsinghua University's economics school in October 2019 for a three-year term.[47]\n\n\nRep. Tom Malinowski, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and several other lawmakers criticized Cook in 2019 over Apple's decision to remove an app used by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong from its App Store.[48] They accused Apple of censorship, and co-signed a letter to Cook that read, \"Apple's decisions last week to accommodate the Chinese government by taking down HKMaps is deeply concerning. We urge you in the strongest terms to reverse course, to demonstrate that Apple puts values above market access, and to stand with the brave men and women fighting for basic rights and dignity in Hong Kong.\"[49] Cook explained in an internal letter why the company removed the Hong Kong mapping app used by protesters to coordinate movements.[50] In 2016, Cook signed a $275 billion deal with Chinese officials.[51] The deal – personally negotiated by Cook – paved the way for increased censorship by Apple in China, for example the removal of Muslim content, preventing users from entering numbers that refer to the date of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, censoring Chinese words like \"human rights\" or \"democracy\", and manipulating Apple Maps to support China in the Senkaku Islands dispute by making Chinese-claimed islands appear larger than they actually were.[52][53][54]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Cook received an approximate $750m payout, selling more than five million shares in Apple, ten years after becoming CEO.[55][56]\n\n\n\n## Public image\n\n[edit]\n\n### Leadership style\n\n[edit]\n\nAs Apple Inc. CEO, Cook regularly begins sending emails at 4:30 am each weekday, and in the past held Sunday-night staff meetings by telephone to prepare for the next week.[57] In May 2013 Cook shared that his leadership focused on people, strategy, and execution; he explained, \"If you get those three right the world is a great place.\"[58] Under Cook's leadership, Apple increased its donations to charity, and in 2013 he hired Lisa Jackson, formerly the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to assist Apple with the development of its renewable energy activities.[59][60][61] Since becoming CEO, Cook replaced Steve Jobs's micromanagement with a more hands-off style, and implemented a more collaborative culture at Apple.[39]: 314[38]\n\n\n\n### Public affiliations\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Cook with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office at the White House, April 25, 2018\nDuring the 2008 election cycle, Cook donated to Barack Obama's first White House election.[62]\n\n\nWhile it had been reported in early 2011 that Cook was gay,[63][64] at the time, and prior to his October 2014 public statement, Cook chose to keep his personal life private.[65] He did publicly support LGBT rights.[66] In October 2014, the Alabama Academy of Honor inducted Cook, who spoke about his home state's record of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights.[67] The Academy of Honor is the highest honor Alabama gives its citizens.[68]\n\n\nIn 2015, Cook said he donated to Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer and Patrick Leahy for their stances on e-book pricing and surveillance reform, respectively.[69] During the same election cycle, he hosted a fundraiser for Republican Senator Rob Portman.[69]\n\n\nIn early March 2016, Cook disclosed that he donated to the election campaign of Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California. In early June, Cook hosted a private fundraiser along with then Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Paul Ryan. The event was described by *Politico* as \"a joint fundraising committee aimed at helping to elect other House Republicans\".[69]\n\n\nIn the 2016 election, Cook raised funds for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.[70] At one point, Clinton's campaign considered Cook as a candidate for Vice President.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cook in 2017\nIn September 2017 at Bloomberg's Global Business Forum, Cook defended the DACA immigration program. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the direction of Donald Trump's administration, stating: \"This is unacceptable. This is not who we are as a country. I am personally shocked that there is even a discussion of this.\"[72][73]\n\n\nIn 2018, at a privacy conference in Brussels, Cook expressed his opinions on the stockpiling of personal data by tech firms, suggesting that it amounted to surveillance and should make the public \"very uncomfortable.\"[74]\n\n\nIn a meeting for the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board with President Donald Trump in March 2019, Trump referred to Cook as \"Tim Apple\".[75] Cook leaned into the slip-up by changing his display name on Twitter to Tim Apple.[76]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nCook is a fitness enthusiast and enjoys hiking, cycling, and going to the gym. He is known for being solitary, using an off-campus fitness center for privacy, and little is publicly shared about his personal life. He explained in October 2014 that he has sought to achieve a \"basic level of privacy\".[57][61]\n\n\nCook was misdiagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1996, an incident he said made him \"see the world in a different way\". He has since taken part in charity fundraising, such as cycle races to raise money for the disease. He later told the Auburn alumni magazine that his symptoms came from \"lugging a lot of incredibly heavy luggage around\".[77]\n\n\nCook has said that in 2009 he offered a portion of his liver to Jobs, as they shared a rare blood type. Cook said that Jobs responded by yelling, \"I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that.\"[78]\n\n\nWhile delivering the 2010 commencement speech at Auburn, Cook emphasized the importance of intuition during significant decision-making processes, and explained that preparation and hard work are also necessary to execute on intuition.[79]\n\n\nIn June 2014, Cook attended San Francisco's gay pride parade along with a delegation of Apple staff.[80] On October 30, Cook publicly came out as gay in an editorial for *Bloomberg Business*, saying, \"I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.\"[81] He consulted with Anderson Cooper, who had publicly come out himself, on aspects of the statement, and cleared the timing to ensure it would not distract from business interests.[82] Cook had been open about his sexuality \"for years\", and while many people at the company were aware of his sexual orientation, he sought to focus on Apple's products and customers rather than his personal life. He ended his op-ed by writing, \"We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick.\"[81] Cook became the first and only openly gay CEO on the *Fortune* 500 list.[82] In September 2015, Cook clarified on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,* \"Where I valued my privacy significantly, I felt that I was valuing it too far above what I could do for other people, so I wanted to tell everyone my truth.\"[83] In October 2019, he talked about the decision and remarked on how it was thanks to LGBTQ people who had fought for their rights before him that paved the way for his success, and that he needed to let younger generations know that—in a coding analogy—he saw being gay as a feature his life had to offer rather than any problem.[82] He hoped his openness could help LGBTQ youth dealing with homelessness and suicide hope that their situation could get better.[82]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cook appeared on the *Time* 100, *Time*'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[84]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\n* *Financial Times* Person of the Year (2014)[85][86][87]\n* Ripple of Change Award (2015)[88][89]\n* *Fortune*'s World's Greatest Leader (2015)[90][91]\n* Alabama Academy of Honor: Inductee (2015)[67]\n* Human Rights Campaign's Visibility Award (2015)[92][93]\n* Honorary Doctor of Science from University of Glasgow in Glasgow, Scotland (2017)[94]\n* Courage Against Hate award from Anti-Defamation League (2018)[95]\n* Honorary Master’s degree in Innovation and International Management from University of Naples Federico II in Naples, Italy (2022)[96][97]\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Brownlee, John (August 25, 2011). \"Who Is Apple's New CEO Tim Cook?

Tillerson |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n**Darren W. Woods** (born 1964/65) is an American businessman who is the chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman of ExxonMobil since January 1, 2017.[2] His salary exceeds $20,000,000 per year.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nWoods was born in Wichita, Kansas. He earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, followed by an MBA from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.[4][5]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\n### ExxonMobil\n\n[edit]\n\nWoods joined Exxon in 1992. He had worked for Exxon for 24 years prior to being promoted to CEO following Rex Tillerson's nomination by President Donald Trump to be the next United States Secretary of State.[2][6] While his predecessor was involved in deal making and exploration, Woods is a veteran of the refining side of the oil business.[7] Prior to becoming CEO, Woods ran the refining and chemical divisions of the company, which delivered the majority of ExxonMobil's $7.8 billion net income in 2016.[8]\n\n\nAt an investor meeting in New York in 2017, Woods outlined his growth plan including drilling in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico and the Bakken shale formation in North Dakota. He also spoke briefly about the company's operations in Russia, expressing an optimistic outlook regarding Exxon's Sakhalin project on Russia's eastern coast.[7]\n\n\nWoods has said that the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has \"shattered the Peak Oil myth\".[8] Woods has publicly endorsed the Paris climate accord. The accord commits nations to cutting greenhouse gas emissions.[9] In May 2017, Woods wrote a personal letter to President Trump to urge that the U.S. remain a party to the agreement. He says that by remaining a party to the accords the U.S. will have a seat at the table to \"ensure a level playing field\" and support \"the most cost-effective greenhouse gas reduction options\".[10]\n\n\nOn October 5, 2020, Bloomberg News reported that Exxon was set to increase its annual carbon emissions by about 17%, or about as much as the annual output of Greece. The emissions expansion would be built off an investment plan reportedly signed off by Woods. Exxon said its internal projections are \"a preliminary, internal assessment of estimated cumulative emission growth through 2025 and did not include the [additional] mitigation and abatement measures that would have been evaluated in the planning process. Furthermore, the projections identified in the leaked documents have significantly changed, a fact that was not fully explained or prominently featured in the article.\"[11]\n\n\nIn 2022, Woods was named one of the US' top 'climate villains' by The Guardian after \"Exxon lobbyists were captured on video revealing the company’s efforts to obstruct climate legislation in Congress.\"[12]\n\n\n\n#### Accusation of lying to Congress\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2021, Woods denied that Exxon had covered up its own research about Big Oil's contribution to the climate crisis. The chair of the Congressional committee taking Woods' testimony likened Woods' denial to the decades' long lies by the American tobacco industry denying that nicotine is addictive.[13] Woods also declined to make a pledge to stop lobbying against  climate initiatives.[13]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"Darren W.
