Their breakthrough came with the soundtrack for the 1988 Bollywood blockbuster *Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak*, composed by Anand\u2013Milind, written by Majrooh Sultanpuri, and starring Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla, which became one of the best-selling Indian music albums of the 1980s, with over 8\u00a0million sales. They eventually became a leading music label with the release of *Aashiqui* (1990), composed by Nadeem\u2013Shravan, which sold 20\u00a0million copies and became the best-selling Indian soundtrack album of all time.[11] However, Gulshan Kumar was murdered by the Mumbai mafia syndicate D-Company on 12 August 1997. Since then, T-Series has been led by his son Bhushan Kumar and younger brother Krishan Kumar.\n\n\nOn YouTube, T-Series has a multi-channel network, with 30 channels (including Lahari Music) that have over 382.3 million subscribers as of 15 December 2021. The company's YouTube team consists of 13\u00a0people at the T-Series headquarters.[12] The company's main T-Series channel on YouTube primarily shows music videos as well as film trailers. It became the most-viewed YouTube channel in January 2017.[13] The T-Series channel primarily features content in the Hindi language, and occasionally several other languages including Bhojpuri, Punjabi and English. T-Series also have other channels dedicated to content in several Indian languages including Bengali, Bhojpuri, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Gujarati, Marathi and Rajasthani.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nT-Series was founded on 11 July 1983[14] by Gulshan Kumar,[15] at the time a fruit juice seller in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Delhi.[16] The company initially sold pirated Hindi film songs, prior to releasing original music.[17][18][19] Back then, the Indian audio cassette market was small-scale, with widespread piracy, but there was growing demand for cassette music. According to *Rediff*, while Kumar \"was involved in piracy, he was passionately market- and consumer-driven.\"[20] The company also took advantage of loopholes in copyright law allowing for the release of cover versions of songs, which T-Series would then flood the market with.[21] Researchers Lawrence Liang and Ravi Sundaram wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> T-Series was a profoundly disruptive force in the Indian music market, in large part because it was a tremendously successful pirate. The company built its catalog through a variety of quasi-legal and illegal practices ... [T-Series] engaged in more straightforward copyright infringement in the form of pirate releases of popular hits, and it often illegally obtained film scores before the release of the film to ensure that its recordings were the first to hit the market.[21]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Krishan Kumar (left) and CEO Bhushan Kumar (right), the brother and son of Gulshan Kumar, respectively, during the audio release of *Aashiqui 2* (2013)\nKumar discovered that there was also a market for devotional music, and began recording and selling it. Kumar noticed that many elderly Hindu followers could not read hymns and chants because of failing eyesight, so Kumar hired singers to record the chants and sold them as cheap cassettes. Later, he filmed major Hindu pilgrimages in India and sold them on VHS and video cassette tapes.[22]\n\n\nT-Series' first original film soundtrack release was for *Lallu Ram* in 1984, with music scored by Ravindra Jain.[*citation needed*] The company's breakthrough came when it released the soundtrack for the 1988 film *Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak* (also known as *QSQT*),[23] directed by Mansoor Khan and starring Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla. The *Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak* soundtrack, composed by Anand\u2013Milind and written by Majrooh Sultanpuri, became the best-selling Indian soundtrack album of 1988 and one of the best-selling Indian soundtrack albums of the 1980s,[24] with more than 8 million units sold.[25] The biggest hit song from the album was \"Papa Kehte Hain\", sung by Udit Narayan and picturised on Aamir Khan.[26][27] T-Series founder Gulshan Kumar soon played a key role in Hindi film music's cassette boom of the late 1980s with his affordable T-Series albums.[28]\n\n\nT-Series later became a leading music label with the release of *Aashiqui* (1990),[17] directed by Mahesh Bhatt. The *Aashiqui* film soundtrack album, composed by the duo Nadeem\u2013Shravan, sold 20 million units in India,[29] and is the best-selling Hindi film soundtrack album of all time.[11] A cover version of \"Dheere Dheere\" from *Aashiqui* was later sung by Yo Yo Honey Singh and released by T-Series in 2015.\n\n\nT-Series was largely responsible for sparking a boom for the Indian music industry in the early 1990s.[25] Many of the best-selling Hindi music albums of the 1990s, particularly those composed by Nadeem\u2013Shravan, were released under the T-Series label.[11] Besides music production, the company also began venturing into film production.[30] The annual earnings of T-Series grew from \u20b920 crore ($16 million) in 1985 to \u20b9200 crore ($88 million) in 1991,[31][32] and by 1997 had reached \u20b9500 crore[33] ($140 million).[34]\n\n\nIn 1997, T-Series founder Gulshan Kumar was murdered by the Mumbai mafia syndicate D-Company.[33] His assassination also led to T-Series losing its most prolific musicians at the time, Nadeem\u2013Shravan, due to Nadeem Akhtar Saifi initially being accused of involvement in the murder, before later being exonerated.[35][36][37] After Gulshan Kumar's death in 1997, the company has since been led by his son Bhushan Kumar,[38] with the help of Gulshan's younger brother Krishan Kumar.\n\n\nAs a film production company, T-Series has had some moderate success. The highest-grossing T-Series film production to date is the critically acclaimed sleeper hit *Hindi Medium* (2017), written by Zeenat Lakhani, directed by Saket Chaudhary, and starring Irrfan Khan and Saba Qamar.[39] It grossed \u20b9322.4 crore ($44 million) worldwide,[40] with $34 million in China alone,[41] becoming one of the top 20 highest-grossing Indian films of all time.[42] One of the most expensive Indian films was T-Series's *Saaho*,[43] a sci-fi thriller with a production budget of \u20b9300 crore (equivalent to \u20b9373\u00a0crore or US$45\u00a0million in 2023), released in 2019.[44][45]\n\n\n\n##  YouTube presence[edit]\n\n\nSee also: PewDiePie vs T-Series\n\nT-Series joined YouTube on 13 March 2006, but only started uploading videos in late 2010. The T-Series YouTube channel is run by a team of 13 people at the T-Series headquarters.[12] Under this channel, T-Series primarily shows music videos and film trailers.\n\n\nBy July 2013, it had crossed 1 billion views, becoming the second Indian YouTube channel to cross the milestone after Rajshri Productions.[46] In January 2017, T-Series surpassed PewDiePie to become the world's most-viewed YouTube channel,[47][13][48][49] and as of November 2023 it has over 236 billion views.[50] On 10 September 2018, the channel received a Custom Ruby Play Button on reaching 50 Million subscribers.[51] It is also the second channel ever to hit 70 million subscribers.[10] On 29 May 2019, T-Series became the first channel to reach 100 million subscribers.[52] In December 2021, T-Series became the first channel to reach 200 million subscribers.[53]\n\n\nAs of 1 November 2023, T-Series has 252 million subscribers, making it the most-subscribed YouTube channel, exceeding the second-placed channel MrBeast by 46 million.[54] On average, T-Series gains 66,000 subscribers daily.[55]\n\n\nT-Series channel also owns a multi-channel network, with 29 channels[2] (excluding Lahari Music), which include YouTube channels such as T-Series Telugu, T-Series Tamil,[56] Bollywood Classics,[57] T-Series Kids Hut, T-Series Apna Punjab, T-Series Kannada, Shabad Gurbani, Health And Fitness, T-Series Bhakti Sagar (mainly dedicated to Hindu devotional music, and to a lesser extent Jain, Sikh, Muslim, Buddhist and Christian), Pop Chartbusters, T-Series Malayalam, T-Series Classics, T-Series Regional, hamaarbhojpuri, T-Series Gujarati, T-Series Marathi, T-Series Bhavageethegalu & Folk, Bhakti Sagar Telugu, Bhakti Sagar Tamil, Bhakti Sagar Malayalam, T-Series Bhakti Marathi, Bhakti Sagar Kannada, T-Series Islamic Music, T-Series Kids Hut-Portuguese Fairy Tales, T-Series Haryanvi, T-Series Kids Hut-Telugu Kathalu, T-Series Kids Hut-Cuentos en Espa\u00f1ol and T-Series Kids Hut Tamil.\n\n\nOn top of this, seven of their channels are among the top 100 most-subscribed channels in India, including T-Series, Bhakti Sagar, Apna Punjab, Pop Chartbusters, Bollywood Classics, T-Series Regional, Lahari Music.[58]\n\n\nT-Series' 29 channels accumulated a total of more than 184 million YouTube subscribers as of July 2019. During January\u2013July 2018, T-Series earned an income of \u20b9720 crore (equivalent to \u20b9895\u00a0crore or US$110\u00a0million in 2023) from YouTube.[56] Online revenue contributes to at least 60% of the company's overall revenue.[59]\n\n\nThe most popular song on the T-Series channel is \"Dilbar\" (2018),[60] an updated version of a 1999 song from *Sirf Tum* originally composed by Nadeem\u2013Shravan, reinvisioned by Tanishk Bagchi with Middle-Eastern musical influences,[61] and a music video featuring Arabic belly dancing from Moroccan-Canadian dancer Nora Fatehi.[62] It has become one of the most popular Hindi film music videos of all time,[63] with its international success inspiring an Arabic language version released by T-Series, also featuring Nora Fatehi. \"Dilbar\" is popular across South Asia and the Arab world, with all versions of the song having received more than 1\u00a0billion views on YouTube.[64] The most popular T-Series artist on YouTube is Punjabi language artist Guru Randhawa, whose song \"Lahore\" (2017) has crossed 1 billion views on YouTube.[65] \"Slowly Slowly\", Guru Randhawa's collaboration with American rapper Pitbull released by T-Series, received 38\u00a0million views within a day, becoming one of the most-viewed music videos in 24 hours.[66]\n\n\nThe growth of T-Series' YouTube channel has been attributed to India's emerging online population. India currently has 500 million Internet users and this number is expected to grow rapidly.[67] A major breakthrough in India's Internet growth came in September 2016 with the advent of 4G network Reliance Jio, offering data at very low costs.[15] India has since emerged as the world's second-largest online population (behind China, where YouTube is blocked), with YouTube alone having over 225 million monthly Indian users. India's high demand for YouTube content and the lack of local content creators has contributed significantly to the rapid growth of T-Series.[68]\n\n\nThe growth of T-Series is also attributed to its growing audience outside of India.[15] About 40% of the channel's traffic comes from outside of India,[2] including 12% from the United States.[15] The majority of the channel's overseas viewers belong to the global South Asian diaspora. More recently, the channel's overseas viewership has increased further, as a result of attention and controversy drawn to the channel by foreign YouTubers such as PewDiePie and MrBeast.[2] On 22 February 2019 at 6:04 AM, T-Series surpassed PewDiePie for the first time to become the most-subscribed YouTube channel, with PewDiePie regaining the spot 8 minutes later. T-Series overtook PewDiePie in a similar manner many more times over the following weeks, and on 27 March, finally gained and maintained, until 1 April, the top spot by a fluctuating, but overall growing, margin.[69][70]\n\n\n\n## Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2007, T-Series filed a lawsuit against YouTube for infringing on the copyright of its music by allowing users to upload videos of its music onto YouTube, which could be accessed for free, and obtained an interim order against YouTube from the Delhi High Court, which restrained YouTube from infringing on its copyrights.[71][72] T-Series and YouTube settled out of court in January 2011.[72]\n\n\nIn April 2019, after PewDiePie released two diss tracks against T-Series, \"Congratulations\" and \"Bitch Lasagna\", T-Series filed a complaint with the Delhi High Court to have the songs removed from YouTube, arguing that they were \"defamatory, disparaging, insulting, and offensive\". Despite Kjellberg's statement that these diss tracks were \"done in good fun\", the court issued a temporary injunction in favour of T-Series on 8 April 2019 and access to the diss tracks on YouTube was blocked in India.[73][74] In August 2019, it was reported that T-Series and PewDiePie had settled their legal disputes outside of court.[75]\n\n\n\n## List of artists[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

He began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012, at the age of 13,[17] under the handle MrBeast6000. His early content ranged from Let's Plays to \"videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers\".[18] He went viral in 2017 after his \"counting to 100,000\" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and he has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his videos gaining tens of millions of views.[18] His videos, typically involving challenges and giveaways, became increasingly grand and extravagant.[19] Once his channel took off, Donaldson hired some of his childhood friends to co-run the brand. As of 2023, the MrBeast team is made up of over 250 people, including Donaldson himself.[20] Other than MrBeast, Donaldson runs the YouTube channels Beast Reacts, MrBeast Gaming, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts)[21] and the philanthropy channel Beast Philanthropy.[22][23] He formerly ran MrBeast 3 (initially MrBeast 2), which is now inactive.[24][25] As of 2023, he is the highest paid YouTuber,[26] and has an estimated net worth of $500 million.[27]\n\n\nDonaldson is the founder of MrBeast Burger and Feastables; and a co-creator of Team Trees, a fundraiser for the Arbor Day Foundation that has raised over $23 million;[28][29] and Team Seas, a fundraiser for Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup that has raised over $30 million.[30] Donaldson won the Creator of the Year award four times at the Streamy Awards in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023; he also won the Favorite Male Creator award twice at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards in 2022 and 2023. In 2023, *Time* named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJames Stephen Donaldson[b] was born on May 7, 1998[31] in Wichita, Kansas.[32] He was mainly raised in Greenville, North Carolina with his brother CJ.[33][34] He moved often and was under the care of au pairs due to his parents working long hours and serving in the military. His parents divorced in 2007.[33] In 2016, Donaldson graduated from Greenville Christian Academy, a small private evangelical Christian high school in the area. He briefly attended East Carolina University before dropping out.[35][36]\n\n\n\n## YouTube career[edit]\n\n\n### Early viral attempts (2012\u20132017)[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson uploaded his first YouTube video in February 2012, at the age of 13, under the name of \"MrBeast6000\".[37] His early content ranged from Let's Plays, mainly focused on *Minecraft* and *Call of Duty: Black Ops II*,[37] videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers,[38] videos that offered tips to upcoming YouTube creators and commentary on YouTube drama. Donaldson appeared infrequently in these videos.[37]\n\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Donaldson began to gain popularity with his \"Worst intros on YouTube\" series poking fun at YouTube video introductions.[37][39][40] By mid-2016, Donaldson had around 30,000 subscribers. In fall 2016, Donaldson dropped out of East Carolina University to pursue a full-time career as a YouTuber.[18][38] His mother did not approve of this and made him move out of the family home.[35]\n\n\nAs his channel grew, Donaldson hired four childhood friends \u2013 Kris Tyson (formerly Chris Tyson), Chandler Hallow, Garrett Ronalds and Jake Franklin \u2013 to contribute to his channel.[35] They then contacted numerous YouTubers in order to obtain statistics of their successful videos and predict the platform's recommendation system.[41][*clarification needed*] Franklin left the crew in 2020. Afterwards, Karl Jacobs, previously a cameraman, was promoted to take his place.[42][43][44]\n\n\n\n### Rise to fame (2017\u20132020)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast in 2018\nIn January 2017, Donaldson published an almost day-long video of himself counting to 100,000, which became his breakthrough viral video.[19] The ordeal took him 40 hours, with some parts sped up to \"keep it under 24 hours.\"[45] Donaldson gained popularity during this period with stunts, such as attempting to break glass using a hundred megaphones, watching paint dry for an hour,[36] attempting to stay underwater for 24 hours, which ended up failing due to health issues, and an unsuccessful attempt to spin a fidget spinner for a day.[46] By 2018, Donaldson had given out $1 million through his outlandish stunts, which earned him the title of \"YouTube's biggest philanthropist\".[35]\n\n\nDuring the PewDiePie vs T-Series rivalry in 2018, a competition to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube, Donaldson bought billboards and numerous television and radio advertisements to help PewDiePie gain more subscribers than T-Series.[47][48] During Super Bowl LIII, he bought multiple seats for himself and his team, whose shirts spelled out \"Sub 2 PewDiePie.\"[49][50]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Donaldson organized and filmed a real-life battle royale competition in Los Angeles with a prize of $200,000 (two games were played, making game earnings of $100,000 for each game) in collaboration with *Apex Legends*.[51] The event and prize pool was sponsored by *Apex Legends* publisher Electronic Arts.[52]\n\n\nDonaldson was accused of using counterfeit money in his video titled \"I Opened A FREE BANK\", published on November 23, 2019.[35] He later explained that he used fake money to avoid participant safety concerns and that participants received real checks after the shoot.[35]\n\n\nIn April 2020, Donaldson created a rock, paper, scissors competition stream that featured 32 influencers and a grand prize of $250,000, which at the time became YouTube's most-watched live Original event with 662,000 concurrent viewers.[53] The event was won by Nadeshot.[54] In October 2020, Donaldson hosted another influencer tournament, this time trivia, featuring 24 competitors with a grand prize of $300,000. The tournament was won by siblings Charli and Dixie D'Amelio, which caused controversy due to claims that they cheated.[55]\n\n\n\n### Mainstream success (2021\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jimmy Donaldson in 2021\nOn January 1, 2021, Donaldson released the video \"Youtube Rewind 2020, Thank God It's Over\".[56] In Donaldson's video, he explains that he had always believed that YouTubers \"should get more say in Rewind\", and with this in mind, he decided to call \"hundreds of YouTubers\".[56] At the end of the video, Donaldson gives a shout-out to PewDiePie, citing him and his 2018 Rewind as the inspiration for Donaldson's Rewind.[56] A month later, Donaldson signed a Facebook and Snapchat content distribution deal with Jellysmack.[57][58]\n\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards 2023\nIn November 2021, Donaldson uploaded \"$456,000 *Squid Game* in Real Life!\", a recreation of the survival drama streaming television series *Squid Game* in real life. The video had 456 people compete for a $456,000 cash prize.[59] The video was one of the most-watched YouTube videos of 2021, receiving over 130 million views within a week.[60] A review of the video in *Vice* argued that it \"badly misunderstood the anti-capitalist message of *Squid Game*\".[61] Despite this, *Squid Game* creator Hwang Dong-hyuk has reacted positively to recreations and parodies of the series.[62]\n\n\nIn December 2021, Donaldson created a third influencer tournament featuring 15 competitors with a grand prize of $1,000,000.[63][64][65] In January 2022, *Forbes* ranked Donaldson as YouTube's highest-earning creator, earning an estimated $54 million in 2021. *Forbes* stated that his income in 2021 would have placed him 40th in the 2020 Forbes Celebrity 100, earning as much money as Vin Diesel and Lewis Hamilton did in 2020.[66][67]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2022, Donaldson surpassed 100 million subscribers on his main channel, making him the fifth channel and the second individual YouTuber to achieve the milestone.[68][69] On November 17, 2022, Donaldson achieved the Guinness World Record of \"Most Subscribers for an Individual Male on YouTube\" with his MrBeast channel at 112,193,139 subscribers.[70] The previous record holder, PewDiePie, had held the record as the most subscribed YouTuber for almost ten years.[71] Donaldson achieved one billion video views over a period of 30 days on his main YouTube channel in November 2022.[72] On October 15th, 2023, Donaldson surpassed 200 million subscribers.[73]\n\n\n\n## YouTube content[edit]\n\n\nEarly in his career, Donaldson's content usually consisted of Let's Plays, \"best and worst\" videos and YouTube commentary.[74][37] Donaldson's present-day videos are categorized into three genres: stunt videos, where Donaldson or other participants perform challenges that are interesting, challenging, or dangerous; \"junklord\" videos, where Donaldson uses a large quantity of a particular product in an unusual way or spends an extravagant amount on it; and giveaway videos, where Donaldson gives away large amounts of money or extravagant prizes to people, usually including a competitive aspect.[c] Giveaway videos are considered to be a distinctive feature of Donaldson's content.[74]\n\n\nDonaldson's videos leverage YouTube's recommendation algorithm in order to go viral, mainly by maximizing click-through rate and viewer retention.[74] To maximize click-through rate, he focuses on creating effective topics, titles and thumbnails.[75] In an interview with Lex Fridman, he stated that for him to create a viral video, it needed to be \"original, creative, something people really need to see, ideally never been done before\".[76] His titles are designed to attract attention by promising outrageous stunts, and using certain keywords like \"24-hours\" and \"challenge\".[41][75] His thumbnails are designed to be easily understandable, clearly focused and brightly colored.[77] To maximize viewer retention, Donaldson paces the videos to have viewers engaged throughout. His videos typically span 10-20 minutes. He hooks viewers by explaining the premise in under half a minute at the start of the video,[41] and promises a \"finale\" to have viewers engaged until the end of the video.[74]\n\n\nDonaldson's funding for these videos mainly come from sponsorships and Google's AdSense program.[78] Donaldson was reported in 2022 to spend about $1 million on each video.[79] Although Donaldson's videos rarely turn a profit, he is concentrated more on expanding his YouTube channel rather than earning a profit, stating in an interview with *Rolling Stone*: \"I could be doing cheaper videos, [...] But I just don't want to. I want to push the boundaries to go bigger, bigger\".[79][80] Most of his funding come from sponsorships.[78] Donaldson uses his reaction channel and gaming channel to help finance his main channel, as their videos are relatively cheap to produce and make a substantial amount of money.[79] *The Verge* noted that his revenue is self-perpetuating: \"The more viral he becomes, the more brands want to work with him, and the bigger his own AdSense earnings get. He can then entice viewers with even bigger giveaway videos. It's a never ending cycle.\"[78] Donaldson earns passive income through merchandise, MrBeast Burger, and Feastables.[74][81]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Donaldson employs over 250 people.[82] They include writers, editors and production assistants. Many employees were people familiar to Donaldson, such as friends and family members.[83] Some former employees alleged that Donaldson nurtured a difficult work environment. In a May 2021 *New York Times* article, Matt Turner, an editor for Donaldson from February 2018 to September 2019, claimed that Donaldson berated him almost daily, including calling him a \"retard\". Turner reported that he was regularly not credited for his work.[83] Reporting by *Insider* showed that Turner previously posted a video in 2018 explaining his allegations, and in October 2019 released a deleted Twitter thread which stated that he was \"yelled at, bullied, called mentally retarded and replaceable by Donaldson every single day.\"[84] Nate Anderson, another editor, quit after working for Donaldson for a week in 2018 over what he said were unreasonable demands, and called Donaldson a perfectionist. After releasing a video describing his experience, Anderson reportedly received death threats from Donaldson's fans. Nine other employees who worked for Donaldson also stated that while he was sometimes generous, his demeanor would change when the cameras were off.[83][84] Donaldson disputes these claims, stating: \"We have high standards, but it\u2019s not a toxic work environment.\"[79] Donaldson also claims that he gave Turner $10,000 and suggested a job at another company to him at the end of his contract.\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Finger on the App[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2020, Donaldson, in collaboration with Brooklyn-based art collective MSCHF, released a one-time multiplayer mobile game titled *Finger on the App*. In the game, players touch their phone screen and the last person to remove their finger from the screen wins $25,000.[85] In the end, four people ended up winning $20,000 each after keeping their finger on the app for over 70 hours.[86] The game was reportedly so successful that a sequel titled *Finger on the App 2* was planned to originally launch in December 2020. The game was postponed to February, and then further delayed to March 2021 due to a flood of downloads, causing the game to crash and requiring the game's developers to upgrade their servers. This time, the game featured a grand prize of $100,000.[87] The winner kept their finger on the phone screen for around 51 hours. The second-place finisher also received a prize of $20,000.[88]\n\n\n\n### MrBeast Burger[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MrBeast Burger\n\n![](image)A MrBeast Burger restaurant in New Jersey\nWill Hyde, a producer for the MrBeast channel, announced in a November 2020 article with *The Wake Weekly* that Donaldson would launch a virtual restaurant called MrBeast Burger in December 2020. Hyde said his team worked with Virtual Dining Concepts during the development of the restaurant concept. He said that MrBeast Burger will sell franchise rights to serve the burgers to restaurants across the U.S. and customers will be able to order the burgers via online delivery services.[89]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Donaldson announced that he would bring a MrBeast Burger shop to the American Dream Mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey, near New York City, to be the location of his first U.S. restaurant. The restaurant opened on September 4, 2022.[90]\n\n\nOn June 17, 2023, Donaldson expressed wishes to shut down MrBeast Burger due to fears that quality cannot be guaranteed, saying he regrets signing \"a bad deal\" with Virtual Dining Concepts, LLC, but said the company \"won't let me stop even though it's terrible for my brand.\"[91][92][93] On July 31, 2023, Donaldson sued Virtual Dining Concepts to end their partnership, alleging that the company damaged his reputation by prioritizing the expansion of the MrBeast Burger brand over food quality. Donaldson also claimed he received no payment from the partnership.[94][95] Virtual Dining Concepts disputed the claims, stating Donaldson had grown his reputation due to the MrBeast Burger brand, and accused Donaldson of attempting a new deal for personal gain and resorting to \"bullying\" when rejected.[96]\n\n\n\n### Feastables[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Feastables\n\n![](image)Feastables Bar\nIn January 2022, Donaldson announced the creation of a new food company called Feastables, which launched with its own brand of chocolate bars called \"MrBeast Bars\". At launch they offered three flavors of bars: original, almond and quinoa crunch. The launch corresponded with a sweepstakes with over $1 million in prizes, including ten grand prize winners who would receive a chance to compete for a chocolate factory in a future video, emulating *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*.[97] The video, released in June 2022, contained a series of elimination challenges where the winner won the choice of the chocolate factory or a $500,000 cash prize. Michelin Star chef Gordon Ramsay featured as a judge in the final challenge of the video and ultimately decided who won the cash prize.[98][99] Feastables reportedly made $10 million in its first few months of operation.[100]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2023, Donaldson asked fans on Twitter to \"clean up the presentation\" of Feastables displays on store shelves, and suggested that they obscure competing products. Feastables offered fans entry into a $5,000 raffle if they provided proof of their assistance. The tweets drew criticism and accusations that Feastables was exploiting fans for unpaid labor.[101][102]\n\n\nOn October 2, 2023, Feastables signed a partnership with the Charlotte Hornets to include MrBeast's insignia on their jerseys.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Investments and partnerships[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson is an investor in the tech startup Backbone, which produces the Backbone One, a controller that makes smartphones appear more similar to Nintendo Switch controllers, and the Backbone app, a content creation and social tools app for its users.[105][106]\n\n\nIn March 2021, Donaldson partnered with Creative Juice financial network to introduce Juice Funds, a $2 million investment fund for content creators.[107][83]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Donaldson became a long-term investor and partner of financial technology company Current.[108][109] The same month, Donaldson received backlash after fans lost large amounts of money in a cryptocurrency scheme that Donaldson had invested in and promoted.[83]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Donaldson partnered with East Carolina University to create a course centered around YouTube content creation.[110][111]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Donaldson featured as a judge on Gordon Ramsay's *Food Stars* show.[112]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n### Team Trees[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Team Trees\n\n![](image)Team Trees\nOn October 25, 2019, Donaldson and former NASA engineer and YouTuber Mark Rober announced a collaborative fundraising challenge event on YouTube called #TeamTrees. The goal of this project was to raise $20\u00a0million for the Arbor Day Foundation by January 1, 2020, and plant trees \"no later than December 2022.\" Every donation goes to the Arbor Day Foundation, which pledges to plant one tree for every dollar donated. Notable YouTubers such as Rhett & Link, Marshmello, iJustine, Marques Brownlee, The Slow Mo Guys, Ninja, Simone Giertz, Jacksepticeye and Smarter Every Day brought attention to the project, and trees began to be planted in October 2019 in US national parks.[113][114]\n\n\nOn December 19 of that year, the $20,000,000 goal was surpassed.[115] The project has received large donations from corporate executives Jack Dorsey, Susan Wojcicki, Elon Musk[116] and Tobias L\u00fctke,[117] as well as from companies such as Discovery, Verizon and Plants vs. Zombies.[118] Tobias L\u00fctke, founder and CEO of Shopify, holds the record for the highest donation at 1,000,001 trees planted.[119] As of February 11, 2023, the original goal of 20 million trees has been far surpassed, with over 24.3 million trees in the ground.[120]\n\n\n\n### Beast Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Greenville received Thanksgiving meals as part of an initiative by Beast Philanthropy and Jennie-O.[121][122]\nOn September 17, 2020, the YouTube channel Beast Philanthropy was created.[123] On the channel's first video, Donaldson announced the charity and food bank and named Darren Margolias, who had appeared in previous videos, as executive director.[24][124] According to the channel description, 100% of its advertising revenue, brand deals and merchandise sales are donated to charity.[19][123]\n\n\nNotable initiatives by Beast Philanthropy include giving away 10,000 turkeys to his hometown Greenville,[121][122] donating 20,000 shoes to children in Africa,[125] and gifting $300,000 worth of technology to various schools.[126]\n\n\n\n### Team Seas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Team Seas\n\n![](image)Team Seas\nOn October 29, 2021, Donaldson and Rober organized another collaborative challenge event on YouTube titled #TeamSeas. The goal of this project was to raise $30 million for the Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup by January 1, 2022. The $30 million goal would fund the removal of 30 million pounds of plastic and other waste from oceans, rivers, and beaches. Donaldson and Rober enlisted thousands of content creators, including AzzyLand, DanTDM, TommyInnit, LinusTechTips, TierZoo, LEMMiNO, The Infographics Show, Hannah Stocking, Dhar Mann and Marques Brownlee, and partnered with BEN and TubeBuddy's initiative of eight million global creators, to promote the fundraiser.[127][128][129]\n\n\n\n### Cataract surgery[edit]\n\n\nIn a video published in January 2023 titled \"1,000 Blind People See For The First Time\", Donaldson paid for cataract surgery for a thousand people who had severely limited vision and had been unable to afford the procedure.[130] Responses to his video on the subject ranged from praise at its intention to spread awareness to criticism that he was creating \"charity porn\" motivated solely by profit.[131] Other comments criticized the American medical system for failing to provide the necessary healthcare to the patients in the video, questioning why patients had to rely on a YouTuber for the procedure.[132]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDonaldson describes himself as an introvert. Donaldson admits to having difficulty maintaining a social life due to his obsession with YouTube and his intense work ethic. Donaldson's mother, Sue, attributes his withdrawn lifestyle to their frequent relocations and his struggles with Crohn's disease.[133]\n\n\nDonaldson dated Maddy Spidell, a YouTuber, from 2019 to 2022. He has dated Thea Booysen, a gaming streamer, since 2022.[134][135]\n\n\nIn June 2023, Donaldson stated that he was invited to go on a tourist expedition to view the wreck of the *Titanic* in the OceanGate submersible *Titan* but declined the offer.[136] The submersible imploded in the Atlantic Ocean, killing all five aboard.[137]\n\n\n\n### Personal views[edit]\n\n\nIn an April 2022 interview with *The Daily Beast*, Donaldson announced that he was no longer an evangelical Christian and identified himself as an agnostic. He also stated that he had long disagreed with the church's position on homosexuality. He states that during the time he grew up in \"the heart of the Bible Belt\", he had religion \"beat into [his] head every day\", and was taught that \"gay people are the reason God's going to come and burn this Earth\". Although he considered anti-LGBT rhetoric to be normal growing up, he has disavowed it since then, stating: \"I realized, 'Oh, this isn't normal. This is just a weird place I grew up in.' So, that type of thing, I [wish I could] go back in time and be like, 'Hey, stop'.\"[133][138]\n\n\nDonaldson considers himself strictly apolitical, saying that \"I don't want to alienate Republicans and Democrats. ... I like having it where everyone can support charity. My goal is to feed hundreds of millions of people ... it would be very silly of me to alienate basically half of America.\"[133] On a podcast in September 2022, Donaldson has commented he would consider a run for president of the United States \"in like 20 years\", adding that the U.S. is \"due for younger presidents\".[139][140]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: a more detailed description of his popularity and public image. You can help by adding to it. *(October 2023)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)MrBeast's large model gumball machine at Vidcon 2022\nOpinion polls have shown that Donaldson is one of the most well-liked YouTubers on the platform. A 2021 SurveyMonkey poll showed that 70% of respondents have a favorable view of him, compared to 12% who had an unfavorable view.[141] In 2023, *Time* listed him on their *Time 100* list; fellow YouTuber and former NASA engineer Mark Rober wrote on his entry: \"He's constantly raising the bar for creators whether it's through re-creating *Squid Game* in real life or paying for the eye surgeries of 1,000 blind people. He doesn't really understand small thinking or complacency. I don't know what he'll do 10 years down the road, but I know it won't be status quo.\"[142] In 2023, CBC News noted that MrBeast's \"viral videos have stoked a wide range of reaction, from acclaim for their altruism to controversy for perceived exploitation.\"[143]\n\n\nIn October 2018, *The Atlantic* published an article on Donaldson's history of using homophobic slurs.[61][144][145] The article stated that Donaldson, while still a teenager, had had a habit of referring to people as \"fags\" on Twitter and regularly treated being homosexual as a punchline in jokes and \"gay\" as an insult.[144] Donaldson later removed the tweets, and in 2021, a spokesperson for Donaldson said that the YouTuber had \"grown up and matured into someone that doesn't speak like that\".[146]\n\n\nIn 2023, Donaldson's childhood friend and employee, Kris (formerly Chris) Tyson, came out as transgender. When a critic tweeted that her transition would be a \u201cnightmare\u201d for the influencer, Donaldson replied, \u201cYeah, this is getting absurd. Chris isn\u2019t my \u2018nightmare\u2019 he\u2019s my friend and things are fine. All this transphobia is starting to piss me off.\u201d[147][148][149]\n\n\nDuring a Clubhouse room in February 2021, Donaldson booted entrepreneur Farokh Sarmad after he allegedly said he could not pronounce his name, a move that Sarmad later said was racist. Sarmad's claims were questioned and denied by other Clubhouse users, who were present at the call who argued against Sarmad's claims, claiming that Donaldson removed him along with others to make room for women to be more inclusive.[150][151]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023\n | *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem* | Times Square Bystander\n |  | [152] |\n| *Under the Boardwalk* | Hot Sauce Crab\n |  |  |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Ceremony\n | Category\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | 9th Streamy Awards | Breakout Creator\n | Won\n | [153] |\n| Ensemble Cast\n | Nominated\n |\n| Creator of the Year\n | Nominated\n |\n| 2020\n | 12th Annual Shorty Awards | YouTuber of the Year\n | Won\n |  |\n| 10th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [154][155] |\n| Live Special\n | Won\n |\n| Social Good: Creator\n | Won\n |\n| Social Good: Nonprofit or NGO\n | Won\n |\n| 2021\n | 2021 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Social Star\n | Nominated\n | [156] |\n| 11th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [157] |\n| 2022\n | 2022 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Creator\n | Won\n | [158] |\n| 12th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [159][160] |\n| Collaboration\n | Nominated\n |\n| Social Good: Creator[d] | Won\n |\n| Creator Product\n | Nominated\n |\n| Editing\n | Nominated\n |\n| Brand Engagement[d] | Won\n |\n| Social Impact Campaign[d] | Nominated\n |\n| 2023\n | 2023 Kids' Choice Awards | Favorite Male Creator\n | Won\n | [161] |\n| 13th Streamy Awards | Creator of the Year\n | Won\n | [162] |\n| Collaboration\n | Won\n |\n| Creator Product\n | Nominated\n |\n| Brand Engagement\n | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### World records[edit]\n\n\n\n\nName of publication, year the record was awarded, name of the record, and the name of the record holder\n| Publication\n | Year\n | World record\n | Record holder\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *Guinness World Records* | 2021\n | Highest-earning YouTube contributor (current)\n | MrBeast\n | [163] |\n| 2022\n | Largest vegetarian burger\n | [164] |\n| Most subscribers for an individual male on YouTube\n | Jimmy Donaldson\n | [165] |\n| 2023\n | First person to reach 1 million followers on Threads | MrBeast\n | [166] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of YouTubers\n* List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n* Night Media\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Only the six main channels are included: MrBeast, MrBeast Gaming, Beast Reacts, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts), Beast Philanthropy and MrBeast 3 (formerly MrBeast 2).\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sources conflict on the spelling of Donaldson's middle name.

Kjellberg's popularity on YouTube and extensive media coverage have made him one of the most noted online personalities and content creators. He has been portrayed in the media as a figurehead for YouTube, especially in the genre of gaming. \n\n\nBorn and raised in Gothenburg, Kjellberg registered his YouTube channel \"PewDiePie\" in 2010, primarily posting Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel gained a substantial following and was one of the fastest growing channels in 2012 and 2013, before becoming the most-subscribed on YouTube on 15 August 2013. From 29 December 2014 to 14 February 2017, Kjellberg's channel was also the most-viewed on the platform. During this period, his content shifted focus from Let's Plays and diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos.\n\n\nKjellberg's content was already noted for its polarizing reception among general audiences online, but in the late 2010s, it became more controversial and attracted increased media scrutiny. In 2019, following a public competition with Indian record label T-Series, Kjellberg was overtaken as the most-subscribed YouTube channel. Kjellberg also became more reserved online, uploading less consistently and taking frequent breaks from Internet use. He eventually semi-retired from YouTube, choosing to upload less frequently for his enjoyment rather than as a career. Meanwhile, in his personal life, he moved to Japan with his wife, Italian Internet personality Marzia.\n\n\nWith over 111 million subscribers and 29 billion views,[c] his channel still ranks as one of the most-subscribed and viewed on YouTube. His popularity online has been noted to boost sales for the video games he plays, and has allowed him to stir support for charity fundraising drives. In 2016, *Time* magazine named him as one of the world's 100 most influential people.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nFelix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg was born on 24 October 1989 in Gothenburg, where he was also raised.[8][9] He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna (n\u00e9e Hellstrand, born 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 1957), and grew up with his older sister, Fanny.[10] His mother, a former chief information officer (CIO), was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden.[10] His father is a corporate executive.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kjellberg studied at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg.\nDuring his childhood, Kjellberg was interested in art and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog, as well as play video games on his Super Nintendo Entertainment System, such as *Star Fox* and *Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest*.[12][13][14] During high school, he frequently played video games in his bedroom and would skip classes to join at an Internet caf\u00e9 with friends.[12][13] During his last year of high school, he bought a computer with the money he made selling artwork through his grandmother's gallery.[12]\n\n\nKjellberg then went on to pursue a degree in industrial engineering and management at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, but left the university in 2011.[4][15] While it has been reported that he left Chalmers to focus on his YouTube career,[15] Kjellberg clarified in 2017 that he had left due to a lack of interest in his course of study. He further expressed that, in general, leaving university to pursue a YouTube career would be \"fucking stupid\".[\u2021 3]\n\n\nKjellberg has also discussed an enjoyment of Adobe Photoshop, wanting to work on photo manipulation art using the program rather than be in school.[\u2021 3] Following this passion after he departed from Chalmers, he entered Photoshop contests and almost earned an apprenticeship at a prominent Scandinavian advertising agency.[\u2021 3] He was also interested in creating content on YouTube; after not earning the apprenticeship, he sold limited edition prints of his photoshopped images to purchase a computer to work on YouTube videos.[\u2021 3]\n\n\n\n##  Internet career[edit]\n\n\n### 2010\u20132012: early years[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg originally registered a YouTube account under the name \"Pewdie\" in December 2006; he explained that \"pew\" represents the sound of lasers and \"die\" refers to dying.[12][16][17] After initially forgetting the password to this account, he registered the \"PewDiePie\" YouTube channel on 29 April 2010.[16] Following his exit from Chalmers, his parents refused to financially support him,[16] so he funded his early videos by working as a harbor captain, selling prints of his Photoshop art, and working at a hot dog stand.[\u2021 3][18] Kjellberg stated that the ability to make videos was more important to him than a prestigious career.[18] Five years later, Kjellberg recalled, \"I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn't know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do.\"[18]\n\n\nIn his early years as a YouTube creator, Kjellberg focused on video game commentaries, most notably of horror and action video games.[19][20][21] Some of his earliest videos featured commentaries of mainstream video games including *Minecraft* and *Call of Duty*, although he was particularly noted for his Let's Plays of *Amnesia: The Dark Descent* and its related mods.[22][23] On these videos, Kjellberg has stated \"I was so shy back then,\" and added, \"It was so weird to me, sitting alone in a room talking into a microphone. That was unheard of back at the time. No one really did it.\"[13] Kjellberg's oldest video available for viewing is titled \"Minecraft Multiplayer Fun\".[22] Uploaded on 2 October 2010, the video is noted for containing mainly Swedish commentary from Kjellberg, rather than the English language he would later employ in his videos.[22] The video has amassed over 21 million video views as of August 2022.[\u2021 4]\n\n\nStarting on 2 September 2011, he also began posting weekly vlogs under the title of *Fridays with PewDiePie*.[13] The series was a weekly deviation from the Let's Play videos that formed most of his content output at the time, and often featured vlogs, and Kjellberg completing viewer requests.[13][24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fan art of Kjellberg from 2012, depicting him as a character from *Happy Wheels*\nBy December 2011, Kjellberg's channel had around 60,000 subscribers,[16] before rapidly increasing in 2012. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, Kjellberg spoke at Nonick Conference 2012.[25][26] July 2012 saw his channel reaching 1 million subscribers,[8] and it reached 2 million subscribers in September.[19] In October, OpenSlate ranked Kjellberg's channel as the No. 1 YouTube channel.[27] Kjellberg signed with Maker Studios in December, a multi-channel network (MCN) that drives the growth of the channels under it.[16] Prior to his partnership with Maker, he was signed to Machinima, which operates as a rival to Maker.[28] Kjellberg expressed feeling neglected by Machinima, and frustrated with their treatment; he hired a lawyer to free him from his contract with the network.[28]\n\n\nEarly in his YouTube career, Kjellberg used jokes about rape in his videos.[29] A satirical video, created by Let's Play YouTuber Michael \"Slowbeef\" Sawyer, mocking Kjellberg's content highlighted his usage of such jokes.[30] Shortly after, Kjellberg attracted criticism and controversy for the jokes, and in October 2012, he addressed the issue through a Tumblr post, writing, \"I just wanted to make clear that I'm no longer making rape jokes, as I mentioned before I'm not looking to hurt anyone and I apologise if it ever did.\"[\u2021 5] *The Globe and Mail* stated \"*unlike* many young gamers, he listened when fans and critics alike pointed out their harmful nature, and resolved to stop making rape jokes.\"[29]\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132014: becoming the most-subscribed user and continued growth[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 February 2013, Kjellberg's channel reached 5 million subscribers.[16] In April, he was covered in *The New York Times* after surpassing 6 million subscribers.[31] In May 2013, at the inaugural Starcount Social Stars Awards in Singapore, Kjellberg won the award for \"Swedish Social Star\".[32] Competing against Jenna Marbles, Smosh, and Toby Turner,[33] he won the award for \"Most Popular Social Show\".[34] In July 2013, he overtook Jenna Marbles to become the second most-subscribed YouTube user,[35] and reached 10 million subscribers on 9 July 2013.[16][36] In August, Kjellberg signed with Maker's gaming sub-network, Polaris.[37] Polaris functioned as a relaunching of The Game Station, Maker's gaming network.[38]\n\n\nKjellberg's subscriber count surpassed that of the leading channel, Smosh, on 15 August.[39] Kjellberg received a certificate from Guinness World Records for becoming the most subscribed YouTuber.[40] In November, YouTube's Spotlight channel overtook Kjellberg's as the most-subscribed.[41] Later in the month, Kjellberg proclaimed his dislike of YouTube's new comment system, and disabled the comment section on all of his videos.[42] On 23 December 2013, his channel overtook the YouTube Spotlight channel, to once again become the most-subscribed on YouTube.[43][44] Throughout 2012 and 2013, Kjellberg's channel was one of the fastest-growing on YouTube, in terms of subscribers gained.[45] *Billboard* reported that the channel gained more subscribers than any other channel in 2013.[46]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kjellberg's commentaries, originally best known for featuring horror video games, began to feature games that interested him regardless of genre. *Kotaku* wrote: \"Instead of limiting himself to horror games, Pewdiepie is now actively playing more things that interest him.\"[22]\n\n\n\n> \n> Around 2014, as YouTube began to invest more deeply in creators, the company developed a classification system for its stable of stars. Either they followed the *SNL* model, using YouTube to springboard into TV or film, or they took the Oprah path, building empires of fervent audiences right on YouTube.\n> \n> \n> PewDiePie was one of the best Oprahs. He lived and breathed YouTube.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u00a0\u2013Mark Bengen, *Like, Comment, Subscribe* (2022)[47]\n\nIn March 2014, he updated his video production output, announcing he would be scaling down the frequency of uploads.[48] In August 2014, Maker Studios released an official PewDiePie app for the iPhone, allowing audiences to view his videos, create custom favourite video feeds, and share videos with others.[49] Later in the month, Kjellberg uploaded a video, announcing he would permanently disable comments on his YouTube videos.[50] He cited most comments being spam and self-advertising and was not what he wanted to see.[51] After disabling comments, Kjellberg continued interacting with his audience through Twitter and Reddit.[52]\n\n\nOn 13 October, he decided to allow comments on his videos once more, albeit only after approval.[53] However, he expressed that he toggled his comment settings this way so that he could redirect viewers to instead comment on the forums of his Broarmy.net website.[54] He stated in a later video that disabling comments made him happier.[55] In the same year, Kjellberg began streaming videos of his co-hosted series, *BroKen*, onto MLG.tv.[56] He co-hosted the series with Kenneth Morrison, better known as CinnamonToastKen, who is also a video game commentator.[57]\n\n\nIn October 2014, Kjellberg hinted at the possibility that he would not renew his contract with Maker Studios upon its expiration in December 2014.[58] He had expressed his frustrations with the studio's parent company, Disney.[28] Kjellberg mulled the option of launching his own network.[59][60] However, in light of news outlets reporting his disinterest with Maker, he tweeted, \"I feel like I was misquoted in The *WSJ*, and I'm really happy with the work that Maker has been doing for me.\"[61] Kjellberg ultimately continued creating videos under Maker. His relationship with Maker saw the network launch an official PewDiePie website, app, and online store to sell merchandise, while Kjellberg promoted Maker's media interests, and gave the network a share of his YouTube ad revenue.[13]\n\n\nIn 2014 alone, Kjellberg's account amassed nearly 14 million new subscribers, and over 4.1 billion total views. Both figures were higher than any other user.[62][63] According to Social Blade, Kjellberg's channel became the most-viewed channel on the website on 29 December 2014, having amassed over 7 billion views by that date.[64][65]\n\n\n\n### 2015\u20132017: YouTube Red, Revelmode, and style change[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kjellberg at PAX in 2015\n*The New York Times* retrospectively noted that around 2015, Kjellberg's video content experienced a change in style: \"He began to take more risks. He continued playing video games, but he started experimenting. He did viral challenges, made fun of other YouTubers, and reviewed meme submissions from his fans.\"[66] Kjellberg has attributed his content around this time as a result of immaturity, boredom with playing video games, YouTube's platform incentives, and the belief that his channel's growth had plateaued.[66] One video cited as being representative of this change featured Kjellberg reading erotic fan fiction about characters from the Disney film *Frozen*. Then-CEO of The Walt Disney Company Bob Iger was reportedly angered by the video, putting Kjellberg's deal with Maker Studios, a Disney subsidiary, in jeopardy.[66]\n\n\nOn 6 September 2015, his YouTube account became the first to surpass 10 billion video views.[11][67] Later in the month, Kjellberg teased about having a role in a web television series, stating that he was in Los Angeles for the show's shooting.[68] Although not many details were revealed at the time, it was later announced that the series would be an original YouTube Red series, titled *Scare PewDiePie*.[69] The series premiered the following February.[70]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Kjellberg announced a partnership with Maker Studios to produce Revelmode, a sub-network of Maker, that would showcase Kjellberg and his friends on YouTube in original series.[71] After the deal, the head of Maker Studios, Courtney Holt, stated, \"we're thrilled to be doubling down with Felix.\"[71] Along with Kjellberg, eight other YouTubers signed to the network upon its creation: CinnamonToastKen, Marzia, Dodger, Emma Blackery, Jacksepticeye, Jelly, Kwebbelkop, and Markiplier.[71] Three YouTubers \u2013 Cryaotic, KickThePJ, and Slogoman \u2013 would later join the sub-network after its launch.[72][73]\n\n\nThroughout 2016, Kjellberg's video style change became more apparent.[74] While producing fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour changed; he commented that he had shifted to drier humour, which was often not understood by younger viewers.[75] He examined his older videos, and while noting the stylistic changes he had undergone, he expressed specific regret for his casual use of words like *gay* or *retarded* in a derogatory sense.[76] In December 2016, *Kotaku*'s Patricia Hernandez wrote about his stylistic changes, explaining that \"over the last year, the PewDiePie channel has also had an underlying friction, as Kjellberg slowly distances himself from many of the things that made him famous. He's doing fewer Let's Plays of horror games like *Amnesia*,[75] and adding, \"the PewDiePie of 2016 can still be immature, sure, but [...] a defining aspect of recent PewDiePie videos is existential angst, as he describes the bleak reality of making content for a machine he cannot fully control or understand.\"[75]\n\n\nOn 2 December 2016, he uploaded a video discussing his frustration with the issue of YouTube accounts experiencing an unexplained loss of subscribers and views.[\u2021 6][77] Kjellberg stated that many people working with YouTube \"have no idea of the struggles that came with being a content creator.\"[75] A Google representative issued a statement to *Ars Technica*, stating that no decreases in subscriber numbers were out of the ordinary.[77] Kjellberg's video was uploaded as his channel approached 50 million subscribers, and he stated he would delete his channel once it reached the milestone.[78] On 8 December, his channel reached 50 million subscribers, becoming the first YouTube channel to do so.[79] He shortly thereafter received a custom Play Button from YouTube as a reward for reaching this milestone.[2] Ultimately, Kjellberg did not delete his PewDiePie channel, and instead deleted a smaller second channel he had then-recently created.[80] His threat to quit was also reported to be \"in fact, a promotional stunt\" for *Scare PewDiePie*.[47]\n\n\nKjellberg nevertheless continued to express discontent with the platform, aiming further criticism at YouTube's changing algorithm negatively affecting viewership for content creators.[80][81] The site's algorithm began to focus on watch time statistics and \"favor videos that drew daily viewers, higher engagement (more likes and comments) and cleaner 'ad-friendly' fare.\"[47] Kjellberg later recounted to *The New York Times* that the platform's boundaries were widely unknown to creators.[47] He responded to the algorithm changes by uploading vlogs that \"mixed earnest schmaltz [...] with inanity.\" Additionally, he \"enjoyed wading into the meme culture and edgelord humor that accompanied Donald Trump's ascent\".[47]\n\n\nDuring this late 2016 and early 2017 period Kjellberg uploaded a string of videos addressing what Kjellberg saw as negative effects to content creator viewership caused by the new algorithm.[80][82][83] As a satirical knock on the changing algorithms, Kjellberg made several videos asking viewers to help the video reach specific engagement milestones such as one million likes, dislikes, and comments.[82][84][85] The videos were successful, promptly achieving the goal Kjellberg requested from viewers;[82] the dislike video accumulated over 5 million dislikes before YouTube made such figures private in November 2021, becoming one of the most-disliked on the entire platform.[86]\n\n\n\n### 2017\u20132018: media controversies, streaming, and formatted shows[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"I've made some jokes that people don't like. And you know what? If people don't like my jokes, I fully respect that. I fully understand that. I acknowledge that I took things too far, and that's something I definitely will keep in mind moving forward, but the reaction and the outrage have been nothing but insanity.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u00a0\u2013Felix Kjellberg, *My Response* video, February 2017 (relating to Fiverr controversy)[\u2021 7]\n\nIn a video posted in January 2017, Kjellberg featured two paid individuals on Fiverr, asked to hold a sign that read \"Death to all Jews\". He alleged his intent was not against Jews, but to showcase how \"crazy\" the modern world and website were.[47][87][88] The video received negative attention and caused a media backlash, with various publications writing critically of Kjellberg's defense of his controversial content as jokes taken out of context, and opining that his content helps normalise ideologies such as fascism, neo-Nazism, and white supremacy.[89][90][91]\n\n\n*The Wall Street Journal* alleged that this was not the first time Kjellberg had used antisemitic language and imagery in his videos.[92][93] Kjellberg and the two individuals later apologised,[87] but the event led Maker Studios to cut their ties with Kjellberg and Google to drop him from the Google Preferred advertising program and cancel the upcoming second season of the *Scare PewDiePie* YouTube Red series.[94][95] Ultimately, Kjellberg apologised, but strongly rebuked media coverage of the event, with particular criticism aimed at *The Wall Street Journal* for how their reporting portrayed references to Nazis in some of his videos.[96] *The Wall Street Journal* response referred to another video with a YouTuber going by the name Jesus Christ, stating \"Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong,\" as well as Kjellberg's response to the Fiverr suspension of the Jesus Christ account.[96]\n\n\nAccording to Social Blade, his channel's total view count was surpassed by the Indian record label T-Series at the top of YouTube's view rankings on 14 February.[97][98]\n\n\nIn April, while still continuing to upload new content onto YouTube, Kjellberg created Netglow, a crowdsourced channel on the livestreaming service Twitch.[99] On Netglow, he started streaming *Best Club*, a weekly live stream show.[99] *Best Club* premiered on 9 April, with its first episode featuring Brad Smith alongside Kjellberg.[99] Kjellberg commented that his decision to create Netglow was in the works prior to the aforementioned allegations of antisemitic themes in his videos.[99] *Business Insider* detailed that Kjellberg's first stream amassed around 60,000 viewers, and that Netglow had accumulated 93,000 subscribers to that point.[100]\n\n\nIn September, while Kjellberg was live-streaming gameplay of *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds* to his YouTube channel, he used the ethnic slur \"nigger\" towards another player in the game.[87] The video clip of the incident quickly went viral despite Kjellberg deleting it, and garnered widespread criticism across the internet.[101] Kjellberg later apologised for the incident in a short video uploaded to his YouTube channel.[102] As a response to the incident, Campo Santo co-founder Sean Vanaman referred to Kjellberg as \"worse than a closeted racist\", announced that Campo Santo would file copyright strikes against Kjellberg's videos featuring the studio's game *Firewatch*, and encouraged other game developers to do the same.[103][104] Amidst the controversy stirred up by the incident, it was brought to light that Kjellberg was following several prominent far-right and white supremacist figures on Twitter, such as Stefan Molyneux, Carl Benjamin and Lauren Southern.[105] He later deactivated his Twitter account and unfollowed everyone he was previously following, stating \"What I don't like is the constant posturing that goes on there. People just can't seem to help themselves from pointing out what is good and what is bad, or how others are bad and you are good.\"[106]\n\n\nIn 2018, Paul MacInnes of *The Guardian* wrote about Kjellberg's YouTube content; he noted that each week Kjellberg posted videos featuring one of three series formats, comparing this uploading pattern to television programming.[107] The three series listed were *You Laugh You Lose*, which features Kjellberg watching humorous video clips while trying to not laugh; *Last Week I Asked You* (*LWIAY*), having begun as a parody and homage to Jack Douglass' *Yesterday I Asked You (YIAY)*, where he challenges his audience to create content and reviews the output; and *Meme Review*, in which he reviews popular Internet memes.[107] Kjellberg began a book club-styled series,[107] with his own enjoyment with the series also being noted.[107] Kjellberg began *Pew News*, a satirical series where he presents and discusses recent news stories while in-character, often as fictional characters named after CNN hosts, such as Gloria Borger, Poppy Harlow, or Mary Katharine Ham and sometimes, an amalgamation of these names.[108] *Pew News* parodies both mainstream news channels, such as CNN, and YouTube news channels, such as DramaAlert.[108] Topics covered by Kjellberg on *Pew News* included culture war topics he previously avoided.[66]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Kjellberg attracted controversy for using the term \"Twitch thots\" in a video that featured him watching a compilation of female Twitch streamers.[109][110] Alinity, a streamer featured in the video, responded by making a copyright claim against his video, which she stated was later removed by CollabDRM, a company that strikes videos on behalf of creators.[110] Alinity stated that her reaction was caused by \"the rampant sexism in online communities\", arguing that Kjellberg's comments degraded women; she refused to accept Kjellberg's apology.[109][111] In July, Kjellberg posted a meme with singer Demi Lovato's face; the meme jokingly referenced Lovato's struggles with addiction. The meme was posted around the same time Lovato was hospitalized after suffering an opioid overdose. As a result, he received criticism from online users.[112] Kjellberg later deleted the meme, and apologized for the incident.[112]\n\n\nIn a video uploaded in early December, Kjellberg promoted several small content creators on YouTube, recommending his viewers to subscribe to them. Among those creators was \"E;R\", whom Kjellberg highlighted for a video essay on Netflix's *Death Note*.[113] Shortly thereafter, *The Verge*'s Julia Alexander said that the video in question used imagery of the Charlottesville car attack, and that the channel made frequent use of racial and homophobic slurs.[113] In December 2018, *Vox* reported that \"E;R\" also contained white supremacist messaging. After online criticism, he described his posting as an \"oopsie\" and asserted that he had posted it \"recommending someone for their anime review\", rather than any intention to promote antisemitism.[114] Kjellberg said he was largely unaware of E;R's content apart from the *Death Note* video essay, revoked his recommendation of the channel, and edited his video to remove the reference.[113][114]\n\n\nOn 27 December 2018, Kjellberg uploaded \"YouTube Rewind 2018 but it's actually good\", in response to the generally negatively-received *YouTube Rewind 2018: Everyone Controls Rewind*, which was originally uploaded by YouTube's Spotlight channel.[115]\n\n\n\n### 2018\u20132019: subscriber competition with T-Series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: PewDiePie vs T-Series\n\nIn September 2018, Kjellberg uploaded a *LWIAY* video discussing Indian record label T-Series' YouTube channel being projected to surpass his in subscribers.[116] On 5 October, Kjellberg uploaded a diss track against the label titled \"Tseries Diss Track\", stylized in all caps and later renamed \"Bitch Lasagna\"[117] in response to their YouTube channel being projected to surpass his in subscribers.[118] The video went on to replace \"A Funny Montage\" as Kjellberg's most-viewed video.[119] It included some lines mocking the Indian background of T-Series, which were described as racist in media publications.[120] On the prospect of being surpassed by T-Series in terms of subscriber count, he stated he was not concerned about T-Series, but feared the consequences a corporate channel surpassing him would have for YouTube as a video-sharing platform.[121] Online campaigns to \"subscribe to PewDiePie\" greatly assisted Kjellberg's subscriber growth; his channel gained 6.62 million subscribers in December 2018 alone, compared to the 7 million subscribers gained in all of 2017.[122]\n\n\nOn 12 March, Kjellberg uploaded an episode of his show *Pew News* in which he mentioned the 2019 Pulwama terrorist attack, where 40 Indian paramilitary troops were killed by a member of a Pakistan-based jihadist group. Following the attack, T-Series removed several songs by Pakistani artists on its YouTube channel after being pressurised by political party MNS to isolate Pakistani artists, a course of action that Kjellberg disagreed with.[123][124] The outlet Zee News reported that Kjellberg \"faced strong criticism for his comments on the heightened tension between Pakistan and India in [the] March 12 issue of *Pew News*\".[125] Kjellberg issued a clarification on Twitter, expressing that he was not attempting to speak on the broader India\u2013Pakistan relations, but rather on the more specific context of T-Series removing artists' songs from its YouTube channel.[125]\n\n\nOn 15 March, the perpetrator of the live-streamed Christchurch mosque shootings said \"remember lads, subscribe to PewDiePie\" before carrying out the attacks. In response, Kjellberg tweeted his disgust after having his name associated with the attack, and offered condolences to those affected by the tragedy.[126] Various journalists covering the shooting reported that Kjellberg was not complicit with the shootings.[127] *The New York Times* suggested that Kjellberg's mention in the shootings was a ploy for the news media to attribute blame to Kjellberg, and to otherwise inflame political tensions.[128]\n\n\nAfter briefly gaining the title several times in early 2019, on 27 March, T-Series surpassed Kjellberg in subscribers to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube.[129] On 31 March, Kjellberg posted another diss track music video, titled \"Congratulations\", sarcastically congratulating T-Series for obtaining the title.[130][131][132] In the music video, Kjellberg mocked T-Series and its actions, alleging T-Series was founded to sell pirated songs and mocking them for sending him a cease and desist letter after \"Bitch Lasagna\".[130] Following the video's release, Kjellberg temporarily regained the most-subscribed position over T-Series.[133]\n\n\nOn 9 April, Kjellberg announced that he would live-stream exclusively on streaming service DLive, as part of a deal with the company.[134]\n\n\nOn 11 April, T-Series started to seek court orders to remove Kjellberg's \"diss tracks\" from YouTube.[135][136] The alleged court order was ruled in favor of T-Series. It was allegedly stated that the complaint against Kjellberg claimed that his songs were \"defamatory, disparaging, insulting, and offensive\", and noted that comments on the videos were \"abusive, vulgar, and also racist in nature.\"[137][138][139] Access to the music videos on YouTube was later blocked in India.[139] The two parties were reported to have come to a settlement later that July, although Kjellberg's videos remained blocked in India.[139]\n\n\nOn 28 April, Kjellberg uploaded a video entitled \"Ending the Subscribe to Pewdiepie Meme\" in which he asked his followers to refrain from using the phrase \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\", due to incidents such as the phrase being graffitied on a war memorial, and its mention by the Christchurch mosque shooter.[140][141] While live streaming the following day, Kjellberg showed a plane flying over New York City with a banner attached saying \"Subscribe to PewDiePie\", and called it \"a nice little wrap up\" to the meme.[142]\n\n\n\n### 2019: Nimses, *Minecraft* series, and milestones[edit]\n\n\nThe remainder of 2019 saw further controversies for PewDiePie. In early June, Kjellberg uploaded a video on YouTube sponsored by social media application Nimses.[143] The app spiked in popularity after he promoted it on his YouTube channel. Controversy ensued when Nimses' location features and privacy settings led fans of Kjellberg and fellow YouTubers to believe that he was promoting a privacy-invasive app, with some fans suspecting the app of being a pyramid scheme due to a referral program in the app that offered more in-application currency.[143] The Pirate Party Germany criticized his promotion of Nimses, warning that Kjellberg was promoting a potentially harmful app to a large audience.[143] Andrey Boborykin, the head of marketing and communications at Nimses, published a blog post denying the allegations that the app is privacy-invasive.[143] Kjellberg responded to the allegations in a video, dismissing them as \"rumors\", and claimed that Nimses was no more invasive than other social media apps.[143]\n\n\nDespite being surpassed by T-Series and the aforementioned controversy, Kjellberg continued to achieve high viewership on the site, mainly propelled by a return to consistent gaming uploads. On 21 June, Kjellberg launched *Gaming Week*, where he focused on uploading Let's Play videos every day, for the first time in several years. Among the games played was *Minecraft*, which he was openly surprised by how much he enjoyed playing it. Kjellberg largely centered his videos around *Minecraft* in the following months, with the content featured in his series *Meme Review* and *LWIAY* also becoming focused on the game. Although he had played *Minecraft* earlier in his YouTube career, he had very rarely played it in the following years due to his reluctance to join the trend of *Minecraft* YouTubers, who he felt only played the game because of its popularity rather than for their enjoyment.[144][145]\n\n\nThis transition was largely successful for Kjellberg, who received a large increase in views, achieving over 570 million views during the month of July, the most views received by the channel in a month since at least October 2016. His daily number of new subscribers grew from 25,000 to 45,000 during that month.[144] Despite this success, Kjellberg insisted that he played the game for his enjoyment, and did not want to become solely a \"*Minecraft* YouTuber\", stating, \"If *Minecraft* gets boring, I can just move on to other things.\"[145]\n\n\nOn 25 August, Kjellberg became the first individual YouTuber to surpass 100 million subscribers. His channel was the second overall to reach the milestone, after T-Series, who passed the mark earlier in the year.[146] YouTube tweeted a congratulatory post to note the occurrence,[147] and awarded him a Red Diamond Play Button.[3] In December, Kjellberg was acknowledged as the most-viewed creator of the year, with more than 4 billion views in 2019.[148]\n\n\n\n### 2019\u20132020: China ban, brief breaks, and content deals[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2019, Kjellberg stated in a video that his YouTube content, as well as content related to him on other websites such as Reddit, had been blocked in China.[149] He explained that this was due to his comments about the 2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests, and an image of Chinese president Xi Jinping being compared to Winnie the Pooh shown in a previous video.[149]\n\n\nIn November, *Business Insider* reported Kjellberg as a client of Re6l, a Toronto-based influencer media and ecommerce company.[150] In December, Kjellberg announced that he would take a break from YouTube the following year, and deleted his Twitter account because of his dissatisfaction with the site.[151][152]\n\n\nKjellberg's hiatus ultimately proved to be brief, lasting a little over a month during early 2020.[153] Taking short breaks from creating online content proved to become a behavior he would repeat throughout the following years.[154][155][156]\n\n\nIn his first video uploaded following his 2020 hiatus, Kjellberg made jokes about the COVID-19 pandemic, and spoke in mock-Chinese phrases. After receiving criticism for these jokes, Kjellberg uploaded another video in which he made more jokes about COVID-19, and defended the jokes he made in his previous video.[157]\n\n\nKjellberg signed an exclusive deal to stream on YouTube in May, as the platform was enrolling high-profile streamers to rival competitors like Twitch and Mixer.[158] At the time of signing with YouTube, Kjellberg had amassed over 800,000 followers on DLive, but due to his deal with the former, and not having streamed on the latter in four months, *Tubefilter* noted that it was unclear if Kjellberg was still affiliated with DLive.[159] Kjellberg's DLive channel was eventually deactivated.[160]\n\n\nIn October, Kjellberg's fans began to suspect his channel was shadowbanned, after noticing it and his recent uploads failed to appear in YouTube's search results.[161] YouTube responded to the shadowban allegations on Twitter, claiming that the reason for the problems was due to search results being influenced by YouTube's system somehow flagging his recent uploads, and that due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, YouTube was taking longer to review videos, including Kjellberg's.[161] YouTube apologized for the situation and stated they were \"working on fixing the issue.\"[161]\n\n\n\n### 2020\u2013present: soft retirement and move to Japan[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"YouTube actually has become fun again for the past two years. And that's when I realized, why should I quit? It's my dream after all to do YouTube. I've worked so hard for this.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u00a0\u2013Felix Kjellberg, September 2022 (relating to his soft retirement from YouTube)[162]\n\nIn November, Kjellberg uploaded a Q&A video, reflecting on his YouTube career. During the video, he expressed that he views himself as \"retired\" from YouTube, having felt so internally since earlier in the year.[\u2021 8][162] He continued to upload videos fairly frequently on the platform afterwards, albeit, inconsistently.[162] He also \"committed to posting more unstructured content, like vlogs.\"[163]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Kjellberg signed a distribution deal with Jellysmack, a content creation company.[164] The deal entails Jellysmack optimizing and then distributing Kjellberg's content for a Facebook Watch audience.[164] Although now having his content released onto the Facebook platform, Kjellberg continued to debut his content on YouTube.[164]\n\n\nOn 14 February, Kjellberg uploaded a diss track titled \"Coco\" about Cocomelon, a kids-oriented channel which had been rising in subscribers for several years, and was growing by nearly two million subscribers per month.[165] Kjellberg clarified that the children appearing in the music video were provided with a clean version of the lyrics to mime to while they were being filmed, and that their parents allowed them to participate in the video.[166] The video was later taken down by YouTube who claimed that it violated their policies on harassment and child safety.[166] Kjellberg stated he \"[didn't] actually care about Cocomelon\" and did not want the pretend-rivalry with the channel to \"get out of control\", as his rivalry with T-Series had previously.[166]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Kjellberg and his wife Marzia moved from England to Japan. Much of his content following the move centered around \"vlogs about daily life around Tokyo.\"[167] In September, Kjellberg explained the shift his upload philosophy underwent when he announced his \"retirement\" from the platform: he opted to share videos for fun, as he did when he first began uploading videos.[162]\n\n\nOn 14 November, MrBeast surpassed Kjellberg as the most-subscribed individual creator on YouTube.[168][169] The two have been noted as contemporaries and friends, with MrBeast having previously supported the 'Subscribe to PewDiePie' campaign during Kjellberg's competition with T-Series.[163] Previously, Kjellberg answered a viewer question relating to whether MrBeast would surpass his subscriber count, replying \"He definitely will ... He definitely deserves it, I hope he does it.\"[163][170]\n\n\nAfter years of inactivity, Kjellberg's Twitch account began streaming episodes of the Canadian sitcom *Trailer Park Boys* in March 2023. This was part of a test by the distribution and monetization service CoPilot Media, as they were on the verge of rolling out \"PewDiePie Infinity\", \"essentially an endless loop of [Kjellberg]'s videos.\"[171] On 9 May, Kjellberg's Twitch account received a ban despite only streaming this previously aired content.[171] On 29 June, Kjellberg announced he would be taking an indefinite hiatus from YouTube due to his imminent fatherhood.[172]\n\n\n\n## YouTube content[edit]\n\n\nSee also: PewDiePie videography\n\n### Style[edit]\n\n\nEarly in his career, Kjellberg's content mainly consisted of Let's Play videos.[173] His commentaries of horror games made up his best-known content during this early stage, although he eventually expanded into other genres.[22] Unlike conventional walkthroughs, Kjellberg devoted his Let's Play videos to communicating more personally with his audience.[174] *Variety* detailed that Kjellberg \"acts like he's spending time with a friend. He begins each video introducing himself in a high-pitched, goofy voice, drawing out the vowels of his YouTube moniker, then delves into the videos.\"[173]\n\n\nKnown for his idiosyncratic sense of humor, the nature of his video content has been described by various outlets as goofy, energetic, and obnoxious,[29][175][176][177] yet genuine and unfiltered.[70][175] Lev Grossman of *Time* noted that \"he's totally unpolished, but at the same time his timing is consistently spot-on,\" adding that \"most of the critical literature about PewDiePie focuses on the bad language and crude physical humor\u2013and admittedly there are a lot of both\u2013and the fact that he is, at the end of the day, just a guy playing video games and yelling.\"[177] Rob Walker of Yahoo! wrote Kjellberg's \"chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments, and pretty much nonstop profanity.\"[175] Occasionally, Kjellberg resorts to just gameplay, resulting in silent or emotional commentary;[175] his playthrough of *The Last of Us*, was detailed to leave the usually vocal gamer speechless at its ending.[178]\n\n\nWith his channel's growth, Kjellberg's content has become more diverse; in addition to traditional Let's Play videos, he has uploaded content including vlogs, comedy shorts, and formatted shows.[13] Toward the end of the 2010s, he began uploading much reaction-style content, such as his late 2018 and early 2019 videos reacting to various compilations of TikTok videos.[179][180] Kjellberg has also uploaded music onto his channel, often accompanied by animation, fan art, or live footage. Oftentimes, music videos uploaded onto his channel are collaborative in nature, as has worked with artists such as The Gregory Brothers (also known as Schmoyoho), Boyinaband, Roomie, and Party In Backyard.[181][182][183]\n\n\n\n### Production and output[edit]\n\n\nDuring the early portion of his YouTube career, Kjellberg did not hire any editor or outside assistance to help with his video output, stating he wanted \"YouTube to be YouTube.\"[48] While his early videos would simply feature raw footage, he later began to dedicate time to edit his videos.[74] Swedish magazine *Icon* noted his use of the Adobe Premiere Pro editing software.[59] On separate occasions, he later sought an editor and a production assistant to help with his content creation.[184][185] Although now having an editor for his videos, in a 2017 video, he maintained that \"I'm just a guy. It's literally just me. There's not a producer out there [...] there's no writer, there's no camera guy.\"[\u2021 7] In July of that same year, Kjellberg commented that a couple of months prior, he had an office and a limited number of employees assisting him with his content creation.[\u2021 9]\n\n\nKjellberg has been noted by both himself and media outlets as prolific on the platform, having uploaded videos with a high frequency.[48] By early 2017, he had uploaded almost 3,500 videos to his channel, around 400 of which have been made private.[\u2021 10] As a result, Kjellberg has made videos and statements expressing his feelings of burnout from frequently creating content for the platform and its effect on his mental health.[186][187] In March 2017, Kjellberg commented that his channel was running on a daily output, stating, \"[there's] a lot of challenges in doing daily content, [...] but I still really, really love the daily challenge\u2014the daily grind\u2014of just being like, 'hey, I'm gonna make a video today, no matter what.' And sometimes it really works, and sometimes it doesn't.\"[\u2021 11]\n\n\n\n### Subscribers and viewership[edit]\n\n\n> \n> An interesting note about Kjellberg's rise to fame: he never really had a video go viral. He just ground it out, slow and steady, growing subscriber by subscriber.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u00a0\u2013Lev Grossman, *Time* (2016)[177]\n\nMedia writers have noted that Kjellberg's content has been largely built up \"methodically,\"[176] as opposed to him having risen to fame through a viral video.[177][176] At the same time, the growth of Kjellberg's channel has been described as rapid by various sources; Douglas Holt of the *Harvard Business Review* commented that \"the power of crowdculture propelled [Kjellberg] to global fame and influence in record time.\"[188] Many close to Kjellberg have described him as \"steadfastly loyal to his YouTube audience,\" with one calling him \"a little spectrumy\" in this regard.[47]\n\n\nBy December 2011, Kjellberg's channel had around 60,000 subscribers,[16] and on 9 May 2012, it reached 500,000 subscribers.[189] In March 2012, Swedish newspaper *Expressen* reported that Kjellberg had uploaded at least one video per day for the seven months preceding their report. Additionally, the publication noted that Kjellberg's channel accumulated 71 million total video views to that point and 25 million video views in February 2012 alone.[190] The channel reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012,[8] and 2\u00a0million subscribers in September.[19]\n\n\nThroughout 2012 and 2013, Kjellberg's channel was one of the fastest-growing on YouTube, in terms of subscribers gained.[45] In 2013, the channel grew from 3.5\u00a0million to just under 19 million subscribers,[191] and by the end of 2013, it was gaining a new subscriber every 1.037 seconds.[192] *Billboard* reported that the channel gained more subscribers than any other channel in 2013.[46] In June 2013, *Tubefilter* began a monthly listing of the most viewed YouTube channels. In 2013, Kjellberg was consistently toward the top of this listing, ranking #1 in June, July, August, October, and December of that year.[193] Analyzing *Tubefilter*'s data, *The Guardian* reported that Kjellberg's channel earned 1.3 billion video views in the second half of 2013.[194] The channel had two of the ten most-viewed gaming videos in 2013: the sixth-part of his *Mad Father* Let's Play was the third-most viewed of the year, earning 27 million views, and an entry in his *Funny Gaming Montage* series ranked as the eight-most viewed gaming video of 2013.[195]\n\n\nOn 18 February 2013, Kjellberg's channel reached 5 million subscribers,[16] and in April, he was covered in *The New York Times* after surpassing 6\u00a0million subscribers.[31] Many of Kjellberg's most-viewed videos are highlight compilations of his Let's Play videos.[182][196] One of these compilations, \"A Funny Montage\", was uploaded in June 2013, and spent a considerable amount of time as Kjellberg's most-viewed, with publications citing it as such through 2018.[197][198]\n\n\nIn July 2013, he overtook Jenna Marbles to become the second-most-subscribed YouTube user,[35] and reached 10 million subscribers on 9 July.[16][36] Kjellberg's subscriber count surpassed that of the leading channel, Smosh, on 15 August 2013.[39] On 31 October 2013, his channel became the first to reach 15 million subscribers.[199] Shortly after, PewDiePie was surpassed by YouTube's Spotlight channel in subscribers.[41] After jostling for the top position during the next month, PewDiePie's channel took firm hold of the most-subscribed title on 23 December.[200] On 9 January 2014, the channel reached the 20 million subscriber milestone.[201]\n\n\nIn 2014, Kjellberg's channel was the most-viewed in January, and then for seven consecutive months from March to September.[202] In August 2014, *Tubefilter* reported that the channel surpassed the Rihanna VEVO channel on 19 July as the most-viewed on YouTube at around 5.2 billion video views.[203] Data from Social Blade, however, shows that the channel still had less video views than the emimusic channel.[204] According to their data, the channel surpassed emimusic on 29 December 2014, at over 7.2\u00a0billion views, to become the most-viewed channel on the website.[205][206] According to *Tubefilter* and *The Guardian*, the channel amassed nearly 14 million new subscribers and around 4.1\u00a0billion video views in 2014; both figures were higher than any other user.[62][63] The latter figure was a reported 81% increase from the channel's video views in 2013; the channel was the most viewed in that year, as well.[62]\n\n\nDuring July 2015, his videos were documented to receive over 300 million views per month.[207] It eclipsed the 10 billion video view milestone on 6 September 2015, becoming the first channel to do so.[11][67][208] At that time, \"A Funny Montage\" (then-titled \"Funny Montage #1\") was Kjellberg's most-viewed video, with approximately 68.8 million views; a partial reason it accumulated many views was due to its status as the PewDiePie channel trailer.[67] In 2016, the channel experienced decreased viewership, which was similarly experienced by other content creators across the platform, due to changes in YouTube's algorithm.[83] On 8 December, it reached 50 million subscribers, becoming the first YouTube channel to do so.[79]\n\n\nOnline campaigns to \"subscribe to PewDiePie\" greatly assisted Kjellberg's subscriber growth; his channel gained 6.62 million subscribers in December 2018 alone, compared to the 7 million subscribers gained in all of 2017.[122] Renewed interest in Kjellberg's videos due to his subscriber competition with T-Series resulted in his channel earning over 500 million video views in December 2018, which was then the channel's single-highest monthly view count.[209] After briefly gaining the title several times in early 2019, on 27 March, T-Series surpassed Kjellberg in subscribers to become the most-subscribed channel on YouTube.[129] The day after \"Congratulations\" was uploaded, Kjellberg temporarily regained his lead over T-Series as the most subscribed channel.[133]\n\n\nIn July 2019, in large part due to Kjellberg's *Minecraft* gameplay videos, his channel surged in video views. *The Verge* noted that it was Kjellberg's most successful month in years, in terms of viewership.[141] Data from Social Blade[d] shows the channel received 573 million video views, a then-single-month record amount of views for Kjellberg's channel.[210] Kjellberg was the most-viewed creator of 2019, with his channel receiving over 4 billion views during the year.[148]\n\n\nAlong with T-Series, the PewDiePie channel is one of only two on YouTube to receive all five tiers of YouTube Creator Awards: Silver, Gold, Diamond, Custom, and Red Diamond Creator. These awards are earned upon surpassing the 100,000; 1 million; 10 million; 50 million; and 100 million subscriber milestones, respectively.[211] Kjellberg nicknamed his Custom Creator Award the Ruby Play Button, which he received in 2016.[2] In 2019, Kjellberg's channel became the second overall, and the first run by an individual creator, to receive the Red Diamond Creator Award.[212]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's YouTube content has been met with mixed critical reception. Media outlets write that he is one of the most popular creators online, despite being involved in multiple media controversies.[213][214][215] His content has been described by various outlets as goofy, energetic, and filled with profanity,[29][175][177][176] and his on-camera personality has been generally received as genuine, unfiltered, and self-aware by various outlets.[70][175] Kjellberg's content has also been received negatively by the media, with detractors describing it as \"obnoxious\" and often reporting his popularity as an \"inexplicable phenomenon\".[22][176] Rob Walker of *Yahoo!* has commented positively on Kjellberg's intelligence, stating Kjellberg is \"clearly\" smart based on when he speaks directly to his audience.[175] Other outlets, such as *Time* and *The Verge*, have written similar sentiments, describing Kjellberg as \"articulate\" and \"self conscious\", respectively.[70][177] In contrast, Andrew Wallenstein of *Variety* heavily criticised Kjellberg, following his channel becoming the most-subscribed on YouTube, describing his videos as \"aggressive stupidity\" and \"psychobabble.\"[176]\n\n\nLev Grossman of *Time* noted that \"he's totally unpolished, but at the same time his timing is consistently spot-on,\" adding that \"most of the critical literature about PewDiePie focuses on the bad language and crude physical humor\u2013and admittedly there are a lot of both\u2013and the fact that he is, at the end of the day, just a guy playing video games and yelling.\"[177] Walker wrote Kjellberg's \"chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments, and pretty much nonstop profanity.\"[175] Justin Charity of *The Ringer* stated, \"PewDiePie isn't a comedian in any conventional sense,\" but described his \"hosting style [as] loopy and irreverent in the extreme: He's a little bit stand-up, a little bit shock jock, a little bit 4chan bottom-feeder.\"[216]\n\n\nIn regards to his early Let's Play content, Swedish columnist Lars Lindstrom commented positively, stating that \"Felix Kjellberg [having] a comic talent is indisputable. It is both amazingly awful and amazingly funny when a father bikes around with his son in the game *Happy Wheels* and both get crushed and bloody again and again and PewDiePie improvises absurd comments as the game continues. The secret is that he loves to play these games and that he has fun doing it.\"[15] As his content went through changes in style in 2016, Patricia Hernandez of *Kotaku* wrote, \"the PewDiePie of 2016 can still be immature, sure, but [...] a defining aspect of recent PewDiePie videos is existential angst, as he describes the bleak reality of making content for a machine he cannot fully control or understand.\"[75]\n\n\nFollowing the controversy regarding alleged antisemitic content in his videos, many media publications both in and outside of the gaming and tech industries severely criticised Kjellberg's content. These outlets suggested that Kjellberg's content contained and promoted fascist, white supremacist, and alt-right ideologies.[89][90][217] A *Wired* article covering the controversy referred to him as a \"poster boy for white supremacists\".[217] Charity opined that Kjellberg's \"occasional, reactionary irreverence has become a core component of his appeal. Likewise, for critics and fans who value inclusivity\u200a\u2014\u200aand among outside observers who view [Kjellberg]'s conduct as inexplicably frequent in the news\u200a\u2014\u200a[Kjellberg] represents all that is wrong and alienating about games culture.\"[216]\n\n\n\n### Censorship[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, \"Congratulations\" and \"Bitch Lasagna\" were banned in India when the Delhi High Court granted an injunction in favor of T-Series.[136][137] The complaint against Kjellberg allegedly stated that his songs were \"defamatory, disparaging, insulting, and offensive,\" and noted that comments on the videos were \"abusive, vulgar, and also racist in nature.\"[137][139][218] Although both parties came to a settlement later in the year, Kjellberg's videos remain blocked in India.[139]\n\n\nOn 16 October 2019, Kjellberg uploaded an episode of his *Meme Review* series, in which he reacted to memes about the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests.[219] The video also featured his commentary on the China\u2013NBA issue and the Blitzchung controversy, as well as memes comparing Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping to Winnie-the-Pooh.[219][220] As a result, Kjellberg's channel and content were reportedly censored in China.[219][220] The BBC wrote that instead of a complete ban, only \"some content related to the YouTuber has indeed been made inaccessible online,\" and that \"there is no evidence to suggest this was done on the orders of the government.\"[221] The BBC suggested that Baidu seemingly removed PewDiePie-related messages on a forum out of caution, but that \"a [Baidu] search for his name still returns more than eight million results.\"[221] *Vox* wrote that \"access to reposted PewDiePie videos and music\" appeared to be available to some regional users.[219]\n\n\nAccording to *Business Insider*, \"For years, critics of Pewds have been campaigning for YouTube to bar him from the platform to no avail.\"[157]\n\n\n\n## Public image and influence[edit]\n\n\nSince breaking through on YouTube with his Let's Play-styled videos, Kjellberg has emerged as one of the most noted, influential, and controversial online personalities. He has also been cited by various publications as largely influential for digital content creation and Internet culture, particularly relating to video gaming subcultures. *Eurogamer* noted that Kjellberg was cast by media reports as a \"figurehead\" of YouTubers, and for being nearly synonymous with gaming YouTubers in general.[213] In 2016, Douglas Holt of *Harvard Business Review* wrote of Kjellberg as \"YouTube's greatest success\", and regarded him, about gaming subcultures, \"the star of this digital art world\u2014just as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Patti Smith had done in urban art worlds back in the analog days\".[188] Lev Grossman of *Time* wrote that Kjellberg dominated \"an entire medium single-handed,\" and pioneered \"a new form of fame not controlled or manufactured by a studio or a network.\"[177]\n\n\nKjellberg has stated that he dislikes being called \"famous\".[222] In a 2014 interview with *The Wall Street Journal*, he called the influence he has \"kind of scary\".[47] In a *Rolling Stone* article, Kjellberg admitted to being shocked by his fame; he recalled a gaming event near his hometown, stating \"I remember there were five security guards yelling at a crowd to back up\u00a0\u2013 it was out of control. It was shocking to find myself in that situation, where I was that celebrity person.\"[13] In a 2019 interview with the *New York Times*, Kjellberg commented on his influence stating, \"it's weird for me to be in this position because I don't really want to be in this position.\"[66] He went on to express feelings of nostalgia for his early YouTube career, when he had fewer subscribers, and admitted to periodically thinking about giving up the platform altogether.[66] Colleagues and media have referred to Kjellberg as \"normally press shy\", \"quiet\", and \"much more reserved in real life.\"[47][222] After moving to Japan, Kjellberg expressed enjoying a lack of recognition while in public.[167][\u2021 12]\n\n\n\n### As a YouTube personality[edit]\n\n\n#### After becoming the most-subscribed[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Rob Walker of *Yahoo!* called Kjellberg's popularity \"insane\", writing that it \"strikes me as considerably more curious\u00a0\u2013 I mean, you know who Rihanna is, but would you recognize this kid if he was standing in line behind you at the bank?\"[175] Walker, among other reporters, has questioned and analysed reasons for his popularity.[175][176][177] Walker commented on Kjellberg's interaction with his audience, writing, \"While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly more than willing to make fun of himself in the process.\"[175]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ross Miller of *The Verge* wrote, \"Love it or hate it, his success\u00a0\u2013 like so many other YouTube personalities\u00a0\u2013 isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record.\"[223] Writing about and analyzing Kjellberg's career, Kevin Roose of *The New York Times* wrote that during the period in which Kjellberg had the most-subscribed channel but prior to his alleged antisemitism controversy, \"[Kjellberg] was not just the YouTuber with the biggest channel. To many Inner YouTubers, he represented the values of the platform \u2014 lo-fi, authentic, defiantly weird.\"[66]\n\n\n\n#### Following media controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn the wake of the *Wall Street Journal* controversy, John Herman of *The New York Times* commented that \"[Kjellberg] bemoaned [YouTube's] structure and the way it had changed; he balked at its limits and took joy in causing offense and flouting rules. Over time, he grew into an unlikely, disorienting, and insistently unserious political identity: He became YouTube's very own populist reactionary.\"[224] YouTube's chief business officer Robert Kyncl stated Kjellberg \"underestimated the responsibility he had as the platform's most popular ambassador, even if he himself is not a hateful person.\"[47]\n\n\nIn 2018, Paul MacInnes of *The Guardian* wrote, \"Given the scale of his audience and his influence, not much is written about PewDiePie. Tech sites like *The Verge* and *Polygon* report on him and often critique him severely. But in the mainstream media, his name has broken through only either as a result of novelty or scandal,\" and noted that his content was rarely written about.[225] Touching on Kjellberg's alleged antisemitic controversy, MacInnes also added that he \"is funny, intelligent, innovative and highly charismatic [...] to call him an alt-right agitator would perhaps be unfair as he has never publicly identified with the proto-fascist movement. But he shares much of their culture and amplifies it across the world. People should pay PewDiePie more attention.\"[225]\n\n\nMax Read of *Intelligencer* retrospectively opined on Kjellberg's alleged antisemitic controversy, commenting that \"Kjellberg, for his part, is seen as a standard-bearer for the oppressed YouTuber subject to the whims of YouTube's corporate masters \u2014 a symbol of the ongoing tension between YouTube and the culture that it spawned,\" and added that \"he, through fights over his behavior and his position within the YouTube space, is something like a gateway drug to bigger political battles over free speech, the role of media, and diversity.\"[226]\n\n\nShortly prior to his 2020 hiatus, Erin Nyren of *Variety* commented that Kjellberg's \"popularity continues unabated in spite of\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014the fact that he has been the subject of ongoing controversies.\"[214]\n\n\n\n### Media lists and rankings[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's influence has ranked highly on various lists. Subtitled as the \"King of YouTube\" on *The Verge*'s 2014 \"Verge 50\" list\u2014the outlet's \"definitive list of the most interesting people building the future.\" On his listing's blurb, *The Verge* wrote that \"Kjellberg's real talent is finding the human within games. He's just a normal person, finding the authentic in games for an audience that are desperate for a little more humanity.\"[227] In 2015, Kjellberg was included on *Time*'s list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet, with the publication writing that his channel \"broadcasts some of the most-watched programs in pop culture.\"[228] Later in 2015, Kjellberg was featured on the cover of *Variety*'s \"Famechangers\" issue, with the magazine ranking him as the \"#1 Famechanger\", or \"those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest\".[229]\n\n\nThe following year, *Time* included him on their *Time 100* list, with *South Park* co-creator Trey Parker writing in his entry, \"I know it might seem weird, especially to those of us from an older generation, that people would spend so much time watching someone else play video games [...] But I choose to see it as the birth of a new art form. And I don't think anyone should underestimate its most powerful artist.\"[230] *Forbes* wrote that \"[Kjellberg's] overall brand suffered earlier this year [2017] when he included antisemitic content in nine of his videos,\" when citing their reason for not ranking him as the top gaming influence.[231] *Forbes* still included Kjellberg in the gaming category of their June 2017 \"Top Influencers\" list.[232] In September 2019, *The Sunday Times* ranked him first on their list of the UK's 100 most influential people online.[233][234]\n\n\n\n### Channel demographics[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's channel appeals strongly to younger viewers, a group Google refers to as \"Generation C\" for their habits of \"creation, curation, connection and community\".[17][174] This demographic has been more commonly referred to as Generation Z by researchers and popular media. In a 2017 video, Kjellberg shared a screenshot of data provided by YouTube regarding his channel statistics, which suggested his largest demographic was among the 18\u201324 age group, followed by the 25\u201334 age group.[225] Surveys conducted throughout the 2010s highlighted that favorable opinions of Kjellberg, as well as his name recognition and online influence within these age ranges, was comparable to that of mainstream figures such as Jennifer Lawrence, Justin Bieber, and LeBron James.[235][236]\n\n\n*The New York Times* published results of an online reader poll the publication held, showing that only 17% of their digital readers correctly identified Kjellberg after seeing an image of him; the outlet wrote that the poll's results \"probably reflect the fact that *Times* readers are older than a representative sample of Americans, citing that \"in 2015, the median digital *Times* subscriber was 54 years old.\"[237] In 2016, Maker Studios' international chief content officer was cited in *The Guardian* as comparing \"the average parent's bafflement at their teenage children's passion for stars like PewDiePie, KSI, and Zoella to past generations' inability to comprehend punk rock or gangsta rap.\"[238]\n\n\nStudies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95% of video game players engage in watching online videos related to gaming, which has been linked to being an important reason for Kjellberg's popularity.[239]\n\n\n\n### Fan base[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fans demonstrate in Tallinn during the PewDiePie vs T-Series subscriber competition.\n*ESPN* noted in 2015 that Kjellberg typically performed a \"Brofist\" gesture at the end of his videos,[16] and often referred to his fan base as the \"Bro Army\", addressing his audience as \"bros\".[240] Likewise, media outlets also adopted the name when referring to Kjellberg's fan base.[16][241][242] Later in his YouTube career, Kjellberg stopped using the term \"Bro Army\", and began to refer to his audience as \"Squad Fam\", \"9 year olds\", and later \"19 year olds\", in his videos.[243] The fan base has been subject to criticism; in July 2018, *Wired* published an article, referring to Kjellberg's fan base as \"toxic\", stating that \"it's not just that they've stuck with the Swedish gamer/alleged comedian as he peppered his videos with racial slurs, rape jokes, antisemitism, and homophobia for nearly a decade (though that's bad enough). It's also that they insist that PewDiePie somehow isn't being hateful at all.\"[242]\n\n\nAt the 2013 Social Star Awards in Singapore, Kjellberg greeted his fans personally despite security warning him against doing so.[17][244] Kjellberg also mentioned this event to *Rolling Stone*, stating, \"I didn't even understand they were screaming for me at first.\"[13] Kjellberg has commented on fans from Malaysia and Singapore; during a trip to Kuala Lumpur in 2016, fans entered his hotel to search for him, which he expressed annoyance with.[245] In a 2019 vlog, Kjellberg expressed that fans in Malaysia and Singapore can be \"very hectic and scream-ish and crazy, and they lose their minds when they see you.\"[245] He later apologized to fans from the two countries, stating that seeing the effect he had \"on fans back then [during his 2013 trip to Singapore] was cool\" and that he would \"be lying\" if he claimed to hate this initial experience with fans, although added that he has grown to not enjoy being treated as more than a person.[245] *Business Insider Singapore* reported that some fans took offense to Kjellberg's comments, but that \"most netizens accepted the YouTuber's apology and admitted that fans had gone overboard in invading his privacy.\"[245]\n\n\nRelating to his responsibility to his audience, Kjellberg has stated, \"many people see me as a friend they can chill with for 15 minutes a day,\" adding, \"The loneliness in front of the computer screens brings us together. But I never set out to be a role model; I just want to invite them to come over to my place.\"[59] Correlating with this note, his audience has been reported to provide positive remarks about him; some of his viewers created and contributed to a thread expressing that he has made them happier and feel better about themselves.[22] Conversely, during an informal Twitter poll conducted by one *Kotaku* reporter, respondents described him as \"annoying\" and an \"obnoxious waste of time.\"[22] Additionally, *Rolling Stone* has documented the existence of several Reddit threads dedicated to sharing disparaging views of Kjellberg.[13]\n\n\n\n### Influence on video games[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg has been noted to support video games from indie developers, often having played through such titles in his videos.[19][246] His commentaries have had a positive effect on sales of indie games, with *The Washington Post* writing that \"gamemakers have observed a kind of Oprah effect.\"[11][239][247] The developers of the indie game *McPixel* stated, \"The largest force driving attention to *McPixel* at that time were 'Let's Play' videos. Mostly by Jesse Cox and PewDiePie.\"[248] Kjellberg has also been confirmed to have driven the popularity of *Yandere Simulator* during that game's development,[249][250] and positively influenced the sales of *Slender: The Eight Pages* and *Goat Simulator*.[22][59] Although games being featured on Kjellberg's channel have reportedly contributed to their commercial success, he has stated, \"I just want to play the games, not influence sales.\"[251]\n\n\nIn 2019, Kjellberg's *Minecraft* videos led a surge of interest towards the game, which saw an increase in players. It also registered the largest-trending score on YouTube since January 2017 and surpassed *Fortnite* as the most-searched game on YouTube, with the searches for *Minecraft* on Google almost doubling since previous months.[144][145] Video game media outlets, such as *Polygon* and *The Verge*, largely credited this newfound success to Kjellberg, with *The Verge* suggesting that the surge \"proves that the 'PewDiePie Effect' is still real\" (about the Oprah effect-like success enjoyed by games Kjellberg has played).[144] Several other popular YouTubers followed suit by focusing on *Minecraft* content.[144] *Polygon* also noted that in the wake of Kjellberg's focus on *Minecraft*, YouTubers focused on *Fortnite* began to shift towards making *Minecraft* videos instead.[145]\n\n\nKjellberg, along with characters from *Amnesia: The Dark Descent*, were referred to by a *McPixel* level designed in his honour.[252] Additionally, in the video game *Surgeon Simulator 2013*, the Alien Surgery stage features an organ called \"Pewdsball\" in honour of Kjellberg.[253][254] Kjellberg agreed to allow the developers of *Surgeon Simulator 2013* to use his likeness in *GOTY IDST*, a showering simulation video game.[255][256] Kjellberg was also included as an NPC in the indie game *Party Hard*,[257] and had a voice acting role in *Pinstripe*, a puzzle adventure game.[258]\n\n\n\n### Income[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2014, Kjellberg made an estimated $140,000\u2013$1.4\u00a0million from YouTube revenue, according to Social Blade.[259] In June 2014, *The Wall Street Journal* reported that Kjellberg earned $4\u00a0million in 2013;[260][261] Kjellberg confirmed on Reddit that the figures were somewhat close to what he actually earned.[59] In July 2015, the Swedish newspaper *Expressen* reported that Kjellberg's production company, PewDie Productions AB, reported earnings of 63.7\u00a0million SEK ($7.5\u00a0million) in 2014.[262][263] In 2015, outlets described Kjellberg's income as sizeable, and even \"remarkable\";[264] Kjellberg appeared at the top of *Forbes*' October 2015 list of the richest YouTube stars with a reported $12\u00a0million earned in 2015.[265]\n\n\nIn December 2016, *Forbes* named Kjellberg as the highest-earning YouTuber with his annual income reaching $15\u00a0million.[266] This was up 20% from 2015, largely due to his YouTube Red series *Scare PewDiePie* and his book *This Book Loves You*, which sold over 112,000 copies according to Nielsen Bookscan.[267] Kjellberg relies on external revenue sources rather than YouTube's ad model, which he has stated is common for most YouTube content creators; Kjellberg commented that YouTube's ad revenue model is inefficient, unstable, and insecure.[268] According to *Forbes*, Kjellberg's income dropped to $12\u00a0million in 2017, which made him the sixth highest-paid YouTuber during that year.[269] *Forbes* commented that Kjellberg's income would have been higher had he avoided the pushback from advertisers resulting from the controversies surrounding his videos in 2017.[270]\n\n\nExtensive media coverage on his earnings has been met with frustration by Kjellberg, who has stated that he is \"tired of talking about how much [he makes]\",[271] and suggested that media outlets should rather report on the money he raised for charity.[272] *The Guardian* commented that the reason the media was so captivated by Kjellberg's earnings is that the topic \"offers a rare insight into the money being made at the top end of YouTube stardom,\" adding \"it's very rare for any YouTube creator to talk about their earnings publicly, not least because YouTube itself does not encourage it.\"[18]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Video games, authorship and fashion design[edit]\n\n\nOn 24 September 2015, Kjellberg released his own video game, *PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist*, on iOS and Android. The game was developed by Canadian game developer Outerminds in collaboration with Kjellberg.[273][274] On 29 September 2016, he released another game developed by Outerminds, *PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator*.[275] It was released as a free app on iOS and Android devices and reached the number one spot on the App Store within a few days of its release.[241][275] On 31 October 2017, former *Goat Simulator* developer and lead designer Armin Ibrisagic announced his partnership with Kjellberg for his video game *Animal Super Squad*.[276] Kjellberg helped Ibrisagic with the core concept of the game and provided him with feedback and creative direction.[276] In 2019, Kjellberg released two more video games: *PewDiePie's Pixelings* on 15 November and *Poopdie* on 12 December.[277][278] The latter game was rejected from the App Store due to its \"crude imagery and sound effects which may disgust users\", but is available on Android.[278]\n\n\nPenguin Group's Razorbill imprint released Kjellberg's *This Book Loves You*, a parody of self-help books, on 20 October 2015.[69] The book is a collection of anti-proverbs paired with visuals.[279] It was number-one on *The New York Times* Best Seller list for two weeks in the Young Adult Paperback category.[280][281] Kjellberg and his wife Marzia launched Tsuki, a unisex clothing brand which they announced in a YouTube video.[282]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorships[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in April 2014 and spanning into August, Kjellberg, along with his then-girlfriend Marzia, began a marketing campaign for the Legendary Pictures film *As Above, So Below*.[283][284] Kjellberg's videos for the marketing campaign included a miniseries featuring him participating in the \"Catacombs Challenge\". The challenge involved Kjellberg searching for three keys in the catacombs to open a container holding \"the Philosopher's stone\".[285] The couple's videos were able to earn nearly 20\u00a0million views.[286] Maker Studios, which both Kjellberg and Marzia were represented by, brokered the ad deal between the two and Legendary Pictures.[285] In January 2015, Mountain Dew partnered with Kjellberg to launch a fan fiction contest, in which winning fan fiction will be animated into video formats and then uploaded onto his channel.[287]\n\n\nWhile he entered partnerships early in his YouTube career, Kjellberg maintained that he worked with few brands and conducted few promotions.[59][288] He stated he felt he made enough money from YouTube and found endorsing too many brands to be disrespectful to his fans.[289] On this topic, Kjellberg has expressed disappointment when a sizable portion of people misinterpret his intentions; he stated, \"if I mention on Twitter that I find this or that Kickstarter project cool, people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it.\"[59] Eventually, Kjellberg began to work with more brands, stating that he wanted to have a genuine relationship with brands and added he was lucky to not be dependent on working with them to support his career.[\u2021 13] In January 2019, Kjellberg announced a partnership with energy drink company G Fuel.[\u2021 14]\n\n\n\n### Appearances in other media[edit]\n\n\nAside from his own YouTube channel, Kjellberg has made appearances in the videos of other YouTube creators. In April 2013, he made a cameo in an episode of *Epic Rap Battles of History*, portraying Mikhail Baryshnikov.[290] In July 2013, he starred alongside Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox of Smosh, as well as Jenna Marbles, as guest judges on the second season of *Internet Icon*.[291] Kjellberg also appeared in YouTube's annual year-end *Rewind* series each year from 2013 to 2016;[292][293][294][295] he once again appeared in *YouTube Rewind* in 2019.[296]\n\n\nOn 3 June 2014, Sveriges Radio announced that Kjellberg was chosen to host his own episode of the Swedish radio show *Sommar i P1*.[297] Due to his international popularity, the episode was recorded in both Swedish and English. The Swedish version was broadcast on 9 August 2014 on Sveriges Radio P1, and when the broadcast started the English version was published online.[298][299] The link to the Swedish version of the broadcast was shared over 3,500 times, and the link to the English version was shared about 49,000 times.[300]\n\n\nIn December 2014, Kjellberg guest-starred in two episodes of the 18th season of *South Park.* The two episodes served as a two-part season finale. The first part, titled \"#REHASH\" aired on 3 December, while the second part, titled \"#HappyHolograms\", aired on 10 December.[301][302] In the episodes, he parodied himself and other Let's Play commentators, providing commentary over *Call of Duty* gameplay in an overly expressive way.[301]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Kjellberg was announced as a voice actor in the Vimeo fantasy series, *Oscar's Hotel for Fantastical Creatures*.[303] In October of the same year, he appeared as a guest on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,*[304] where Colbert referred to him as \"Emperor of the Internet\".[305] In February 2016, he appeared on *Conan*, playing *Far Cry Primal* as part of the show's Clueless Gamer segment.[306] In 2019, he was a guest on the *Cold Ones* YouTube podcast.[307]\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nKjellberg's popularity has allowed him to stir support for fundraising drives.[308] In February 2012, Kjellberg ran for King of the Web, an online contest. He lost the overall title, but still became the \"Gaming King of the Web\" for the 1\u201315 February 2012 voting period.[309] During the following voting period, Kjellberg won and donated his cash winnings to the World Wildlife Fund.[310] He has raised money for the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital,[19][310] and began a \"Water Campaign\" charity, where his fans could donate money to Charity: Water, in celebration of reaching ten million subscribers.[311] Kjellberg contributed one dollar to the charity for every 500 views the video announcing the campaign accumulated, up to a maximum of $10,000.[312] Kjellberg had the stated goal of raising US$250,000, but at the end of the drive, the amount raised was $446,612.[310][313][\u2021 15] Kjellberg organized another charity drive for Charity: Water in February 2016.[314] The drive raised $152,239, surpassing a $100,000 goal.[315]\n\n\nIn celebration of reaching 25\u00a0million subscribers in June 2014, Kjellberg announced another charity drive for Save the Children. It raised over $630,000, surpassing a $250,000 goal.[316] In an interview with the Swedish magazine *Icon*, he has expressed a desire to continue these drives as time goes on, and also credited John and Hank Green as two individuals who gave him the idea of making unique videos for charity.[59] These videos are purchased by game manufacturers and advertisers, for prices ranging up to $50,000.[59]\n\n\nIn December 2016, he hosted *Cringemas*, a livestream held across two days (9 and 10 December, both at around 6\u00a0pm\u201310 pm GMT), with other Revelmode creators.[72] During the livestream, they helped raise money for RED, a charity committed to helping eliminate HIV/AIDS in Africa.[317] After the first day, the fundraiser raised over $200,000, after YouTube doubled their goal of $100,000, and at the end of the livestream, they had raised a total of over $1.3\u00a0million with help from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.[318]\n\n\nOn 3 December 2018, Kjellberg announced that he had started a fundraiser on GoFundMe for Child Rights and You (CRY) to help Indian children, partially in response to racist comments left on his videos directed toward Indians.[319][320] Kjellberg also hosted a livestream on 4 December, donating all of its proceeds to CRY. He raised over $200,000.[319]\n\n\nOn 21 July 2019, Kjellberg started a fundraiser on GoFundMe with American actor Jack Black for National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), in the wake of the suicide of the internet personality Etika in June 2019. Kjellberg and Jack Black streamed themselves playing *Minecraft* together to raise money for their fundraiser. Kjellberg donated $10,000 to his fundraiser and managed to raise over $30,000 for NAMI.[321] Kjellberg has previously spoken on the topic of mental health, including his struggles with his own, and as part of the UK's Mental Health Awareness Week in 2017, he highlighted various resources to help one's mental health in a video.[322]\n\n\nIn celebration of receiving his 100\u00a0million subscribers Play Button in September 2019, Kjellberg announced in a video that he was donating $50,000 to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an international Jewish non-governmental organisation.[323] Part of Kjellberg's fanbase criticized his decision, citing controversial actions and stances of the ADL.[323] *Kotaku* and *Vice* praised Kjellberg's donation and were critical of the portion of Kjellberg's fanbase who opposed the donation.[324][325] Two days after his initial announcement, Kjellberg announced in another video that he had decided to withdraw his donation. He expressed that he was advised to donate to the ADL, and did not hand-pick an organization that he was passionate about, as he had done with previous donations.[326] Additionally, he confirmed that he would still make a $50,000 donation to an organization at some point in the future, but after undergoing his usual process to select a suitable one.[327][328]\n\n\nOn 31 October 2019, Kjellberg donated $69,420 to Team Trees, a fundraising drive taking action against deforestation by pledging to plant one tree for every dollar donated. The donation number is a comedic in-joke combining numbers from internet culture: 69 and 420.[329][\u2021 16]\n\n\nIn early June 2020, Kjellberg raised more than $116,000 for the Sentencing Project, victims of police brutality, and for small businesses affected by Black Lives Matter demonstrators looting and rioting after the murder of George Floyd.[330][\u2021 17]\n\n\nKjellberg pledged to donate money earned from his YouTube membership to various charities every month. By 2021, Kjellberg raised over $1 million to charities such as Red Nose Day, Movember, Papyrus, Blue Ocean Foundation, Save the Children Lebanon, and Winston's Wish.[154]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Marzia Kjellberg, Felix's wife, has featured in his videos on several occasions.\nKjellberg married his long-time Italian girlfriend Marzia Bisognin on 19 August 2019.[331] The couple have one son, born 11 July 2023.[332][333]\n\n\nKjellberg and Bisognin were introduced to each other through a friend of Bisognin's in 2011, and after establishing an online relationship, Kjellberg flew to Italy to meet her.[59] The pair shuffled between Sweden and Italy, before settling in Brighton, England.[8][59][334] Kjellberg explained that they moved to the UK in July 2013 for preference to live close to the sea and for better Internet connectivity.[59][\u2021 18] He said he enjoyed the general anonymity that living in Brighton granted him.[16]\n\n\nA 2018 trip to Japan inspired Kjellberg to move to the country. Announcing their intention to permanently move there, Kjellberg and his wife bought a home in Japan in 2019.[335] The home was robbed in late 2019,[335] and the couple's move was delayed due to Japan restricting relocation regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[\u2021 19] In May 2022, Kjellberg and his wife moved to their home in Japan with a 5-year business visa.[336]\n\n\nRegarding his political beliefs, Kjellberg stated in October 2019 that he is \"more apolitical than anything\", and that he was \"somewhere in between\" left-wing and right-wing.[66] In June 2014, Kjellberg stated that he is an agnostic atheist.[337]\n\n\nKjellberg has frequently mentioned in videos that he adheres to a pescetarian diet for various reasons.[\u2021 20] To deal with stress stemming from his content creation workload, Kjellberg developed a daily whiskey-drinking habit.[47] During a *Cold Ones* podcast interview in July 2019, Kjellberg shared that a book on Buddhism inspired him to drop the habit.[338]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Film\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *South Park* | Himself\n | Comedy Central | Cameo;
