Djokovic has been ranked No. 1 for a record total of 400 weeks in a record 13 different years, and finished as the year-end No. 1 a record eight times.[7] Djokovic has won an all-time record 24 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record ten Australian Open titles. Overall, he has won 98 singles titles, including a record 71 Big Titles: 24 majors, a record 40 Masters, and a record seven ATP Finals. Djokovic is the only man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of all four majors at once across three different surfaces. In singles, he is the only man to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam, and the only player to complete a career Golden Masters, a feat he has achieved twice. \n\n\nDjokovic began his professional career in 2003. In 2008, at age 20, he disrupted Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's streak of 11 consecutive majors by winning his first major title at the Australian Open. By 2010, Djokovic had begun to separate himself from the rest of the field and, as a result, the trio of Federer, Nadal and him was referred to as the \"Big Three\" among fans and commentators. In 2011, Djokovic ascended to No. 1 for the first time, winning three majors and a then-record five Masters titles while going 10–1 against Nadal and Federer. He remained the most successful player in men's tennis for the rest of the decade.[8] In 2015, Djokovic had his most successful season, reaching a single-season record 15 consecutive finals, winning a season-record 10 Big Titles while having a record 31 victories over the top-10 players.[9] His dominant run extended through to the 2016 French Open, where he completed his first Career Grand Slam and a non-calendar year Grand Slam, becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four majors simultaneously and setting a rankings points record of 16,950. In 2017, Djokovic suffered from an elbow injury that weakened his results until the 2018 Wimbledon Championships, where he won the title while ranked No. 21 in the world. Djokovic has continued to be a dominant force on the tour since then, winning 12 major titles and completing his second and third Career Grand Slams. Due to his opposition to COVID-19 vaccine, Djokovic was forced to skip many tournaments in 2022,[10] notably the Australian Open and the US Open; two major events he was the favourite to win.[11][12] One year after the Australian visa controversy, Djokovic made a successful comeback to reclaim the 2023 Australian Open trophy,[13] and shortly after he claimed the French Open to take the outright record for most men's singles majors won in history.[14]\n\n\nRepresenting Serbia, Djokovic led the national tennis team to its first Davis Cup title in 2010, and to the inaugural ATP Cup title in 2020. He also won the bronze medal for his country at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Djokovic is a recipient of the Order of St. Sava, the Order of Karađorđe's Star, and the Order of the Republika Srpska. His other awards include being named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year four times (2012, 2015, 2016 and 2019) and the 2011 BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year.[15][16]\n\n\nBeyond competition, Djokovic was elected as the president of the ATP Player Council in 2016. He stepped down in 2020 to front a new player-only tennis association; the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) founded by him and Vasek Pospisil, citing the need for players to have more influence on the tour and advocating better prize money structure for lower ranked players.[17][18] Djokovic is an active philanthropist. He is the founder of Novak Djokovic Foundation, which is committed to supporting children from disadvantaged communities.[19] Djokovic was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2015.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nNovak Djokovic was born on 22 May 1987 in Belgrade, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia, to Dijana (née Žagar) and Srdjan Djokovic. He is of paternal Serbian and maternal Croatian descent.[21] His two younger brothers, Marko and Djordje, have also played professional tennis.[22]\n\n\nDjokovic began playing tennis at the age of four,[22] after his parents gave him a mini-racket and a soft foam ball, which his father claimed became \"the most beloved toy in his life\".[23] His parents then sent him to a tennis camp in Novi Sad.[23][24] In the summer of 1993, as a six-year-old, he was sent to a tennis camp organized by the Teniski Klub Partizan[24] and overseen by Yugoslav tennis player Jelena Genčić[24][25] at Mount Kopaonik, where Djokovic's parents ran a fast-food parlour.[23][26][27] Genčić worked with Djokovic over the following six years, convincing him to hit his backhand with two hands instead of the single hand used by his idol, Pete Sampras.[2][26][28] Djokovic has credited Genčić for \"shaping my mind as a human being, but also as a professional\".[29][30]\n\n\nDuring the Yugoslav Wars in the late 1990s, Djokovic had to endure embargoes[30] and NATO bombings[22][26] but that fear and exhaustion made him tougher and drove him to pursue tennis with greater determination.[22][31] At one point he had to train inside a disused swimming pool converted into a tennis court.[32] Due to his rapid development, Genčić contacted Nikola Pilić and in September 1999 Djokovic moved to the Pilić tennis academy in Oberschleißheim, Germany, spending four years there.[2][26][33] Pilić made him serve against a wall for several months to improve his technique, and he had him working with a rubber exercise band for a year to improve flexibility in his wrist.[26] One of the players he trained with at the Niki Pilić academy was future world No. 10 Ernests Gulbis, with whom he allegedly had a fiery rivalry.[34][35]\n\n\nHis father also took him to train at academies in the United States, Italy and Germany.[23] Because of the high cost of traveling and training his father took out high-interest loans to help pay for his son's tennis education, putting Djokovic under immense pressure to deliver.[23][26][29][30] He believes the impact this had on him could be the reason behind his prowess under pressure.[24][26]\n\n\nHe met his future wife, Jelena Ristić, in high school, and began dating her in 2005.[36] The two became engaged in September 2013,[37] and on 10 July 2014 the couple were married on Sveti Stefan in Montenegro.[38][39] He and Ristić had their first child, a boy, in October 2014.[40][41] Their daughter was born in 2017.[42]\n\n\nDjokovic is a self-described fan of languages, speaking Serbian, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.[43][44][45][46]\n\n\n\n## Tennis career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Novak Djokovic Singles Ranking History Chart\n![](image)Singles Ranking Composite History Chart (Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic)\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\n#### 2001–2003: Juniors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Djokovic dominated the U14 circuit in the ETA Junior Tour, currently known as the Tennis Europe Junior Tour.[47] After a poor start to the season, being eliminated from the prestigious Petits As tournament in the quarterfinals by the eventual runner-up and future rival Andy Murray, 6–0, 6–1;[47][48] Djokovic returned to form in April 2001, in Italy, where he won his first ETA title in a second category tournament in Messina, defeating his compatriot Bojan Božović in the final, and also reached the final of a first category tournament in Arezzo, which he lost to Mischa Zverev.[47][49] In May, the 14-year-old Djokovic decided to try two ETA tournaments played in the 16-age group, which took place in Turin and Milan, winning the doubles event of the latter alongside Viktor Troicki.[47] Djokovic then won his second ETA singles tournament of the season in Livorno[47] after beating the No. 1 seed Murray in the semifinals, and the No. 2 seed Aljoscha Thron in the final, 5–7, 7–5, 6–4.[50]\n\n\nIn July, Djokovic was the No. 1 seed at the U14 European championship, held in Sanremo, where he became only the fourth player in the competition's history to win both the singles and doubles tournaments, beating Lukáš Lacko in three sets in the singles final,[51] and pairing with Božović in doubles, beating Russia's Alexandre Krasnoroutskiy and Mikhail Bekker in the final.[52][53] As a member of the Yugoslav national team, Djokovic reached the final of the 2001 ITF World Junior Championship for players under 14, in which he lost his match in singles to Germany's Aljoscha Thron.[54][55] Djokovic also led the Serbian team to victory in the European Summer Cup,[47] thus ending the year as a European champion in singles, doubles and in team competition, while also winning the silver medal at the World Junior Championship in a team competition for Yugoslavia.[2][22] Djokovic ended 2001 at the top of the ETA rankings for U14s, one place ahead of Murray at No. 2.[47]\n\n\nIn 2002, Djokovic continued his dominance, now in the under 16 circuit, winning prestigious tournaments such as *La Boule* and *La Poet* in France, Prince's Cup in Miami,[56] as well as his first-ever ITF tournament, which was played at just twenty kilometers away from his home in Belgrade, in the small town of Pančevo.[2] He entered the tournament as a wild card and won all of his matches in straight sets, some of which against rivals three years older than him, including the No. 1 seed David Savić in the final, 6–2, 6–2.[57] At 16, after winning five ITF tournaments, he was ranked the 40th best junior tennis player in the world.[22]\n\n\nIn juniors, he compiled a singles win-loss record of 40–11 (and 23–6 in doubles), reaching a combined junior world ranking of No. 24 in February 2004.[58] At the junior Grand Slam events, his best showing was at the Australian Open where he reached the semifinals in 2004. He also played at the French Open and US Open junior events in 2003.[59]\n\n\n\n#### 2003–2005: Start of professional career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Djokovic turned professional and began competing on the ATP Tour, around the time Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal had established themselves as the two dominant players in men's tennis.[60] At the beginning of his professional career, he mainly played in Futures and Challenger tournaments, winning three of each type from 2003 to 2005. His first tour-level tournament was the Croatia Open Umag in July 2004, where he qualified for the main draw and lost to Filippo Volandri in the first round.[61]\n\n\nIn January 2005, Djokovic made his Grand Slam debut at the Australian Open, where he defeated future rival Stan Wawrinka in the second round of the qualifying competition. In the first round of the main draw, he was defeated by eventual champion Marat Safin in straight sets[62][63] Later that year, Djokovic won his first Grand Slam match at the French Open, and went on to reach the third round of both Wimbledon and the US Open, coming back from two sets down and saving multiple match points to defeat Guillermo García López in the former, and beating Gaël Monfils and Mario Ančić in the latter. Djokovic participated in four Masters events and qualified for two of them, his best performance coming in Paris, where he reached the third round and defeated fourth seed Mariano Puerta along the way.[64] He finished the year ranked No. 78, the youngest player in the top 100.[44]\n\n\n\n#### 2006: Maiden Grand Slam quarterfinal and first ATP titles[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 April 2006, Djokovic clinched a decisive Davis Cup win against Great Britain by defeating Greg Rusedski in four sets in the fourth match of the tie, giving Serbia and Montenegro an insurmountable 3–1 lead in their best-of-five series, thus keeping the country in the Group One Euro/African Zone of Davis Cup. Afterwards, Djokovic briefly considered moving from Serbia to play for Great Britain.[65] The British media spoke of Djokovic's family negotiating with the Lawn Tennis Association about changing his international loyalty by joining British tennis ranks.[65] The 18-year-old Djokovic, who was ranked 64th in the world, initially dismissed the story by saying that the talks were not serious, describing them as \"the British being very kind to us after the Davis Cup.\"[66] However, more than three years later, in October 2009, Djokovic confirmed that the talks between his family and the LTA throughout April and May 2006 were indeed serious:\n\n\n\n\n> Britain was offering me a lot of opportunities and they needed someone because Andy [Murray] was the only one, and still is. That had to be a disappointment for all the money they invest. But I didn't need the money as much as I had done. I had begun to make some for myself, enough to afford to travel with a coach, and I said, \"Why the heck?\" I am Serbian, I am proud of being a Serbian, I didn't want to spoil that just because another country had better conditions. If I had played for Great Britain, of course I would have played exactly as I do for my country but deep inside, I would never have felt that I belonged. I was the one who took the decision.[67]\n> \n> \n\nDjokovic reached his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open as the world No. 63, after upsetting ninth-ranked Fernando González in the second round.[68] In the quarterfinals, he faced Rafael Nadal, the first-ever meeting of their historic rivalry, which Nadal won via a retirement from Djokovic after Nadal took the first two sets.[68] This deep run at Roland-Garros saw him reach the top 40 in the world singles rankings. At Wimbledon, he reached the fourth round, losing to seventh seed Mario Ančić in five sets.[69]\n\n\nThree weeks after Wimbledon, Djokovic won his maiden ATP title at the Dutch Open in Amersfoort without losing a set, defeating Nicolás Massú in the final.[68] He won his second career title at the Moselle Open in Metz, France, defeating Jürgen Melzer in the final, and moved into the top 20.[68][70] He also reached his first career Masters quarterfinal at Madrid during the indoor hardcourt season.[71] Djokovic finished the year ranked No. 16, the youngest player in the top 20.[72]\n\n\n\n#### 2007: First Masters titles, first Major final & breaking top 3[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic began 2007 by defeating Australian Chris Guccione in the Adelaide final, before losing in the fourth round of the Australian Open to eventual champion Roger Federer[73] in straight sets. His performances at the Masters Series events in Indian Wells, and Miami, where he was the runner-up and champion respectively, pushed him into the world's top 10.[68] Djokovic lost the Indian Wells final to Rafael Nadal, but defeated Nadal in Key Biscayne in the quarterfinals before going on to defeat Guillermo Cañas in the final to win his maiden Masters Series title.[74][75] In doing so, he became the youngest player to ever win the tournament and the first teenager to win the event since Andre Agassi in 1990.[68][75]\n\n\nDjokovic then returned to Serbia to help his country enter the Davis Cup World Group[76] in a match against Georgia. He won a point by defeating Georgia's George Chanturia.[76] Later, he played in the Monte-Carlo Masters, where he was defeated by David Ferrer in the third round, and at the Estoril Open, where he defeated Richard Gasquet in the final.[77] Djokovic then reached the quarterfinals of both the Italian Open in Rome, where he lost to Nadal, and the Hamburg Masters, where he was defeated by Carlos Moyá. At the French Open, Djokovic reached his first major semifinal, losing to eventual champion Nadal.[78]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, Djokovic won a five-hour quarterfinal against Marcos Baghdatis to reach his first Wimbledon semi-final.[79] At the time, the match had lasted just 5 minutes shy of the longest Wimbledon match played in a single day. After the match, Baghdatis stated that playing against Djokovic was “a bit like facing Andre Agassi. He is just making you move from one place to another”.[80] Djokovic started his semifinal match against Nadal with nearly 17 hours on court, and ended up retiring with elbow problems in the third set, after winning the first and losing the second set.[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)Djokovic during his first round match at the 2007 US Open.\nDjokovic's next tournament was the Canadian Open in Montreal, and he defeated No. 3 Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Nadal in the semifinals, and No. 1 Federer in the final. This was the first time a player had defeated the top three ranked players in one tournament since Boris Becker in 1994.[82] Djokovic was also only the second player, after Tomáš Berdych, to have defeated both Federer and Nadal since they became the top two players in the world. After this tournament, Björn Borg stated that Djokovic \"is definitely a contender to win a Grand Slam (tournament).\"[83] The following week at the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic lost in the second round to Moyà in straight sets. Nevertheless, he went on to reach the final of the US Open, where he had five set points in the first set and two in the second set, but lost them all before losing the match in straight sets to the top-seeded Federer.[84]\n\n\nDjokovic won his fifth title of the year at the BA-CA TennisTrophy in Vienna, defeating Stanislas Wawrinka in the final. His next tournament was the Madrid Masters, where he lost to David Nalbandian in the semifinals. Djokovic, assured of finishing the year ranked No. 3, qualified for the year-ending championships, but did not advance beyond the round robin matches. He received the Golden Badge award for the best athlete in Serbia, and the Olympic Committee of Serbia declared him the best athlete in the country.[85]\n\n\nDjokovic played a key role in the 2007 play-off win over Australia by winning all his matches and helping promote the Serbia Davis Cup team to the 2008 World Group.[86] In Serbia's tie against Russia in Moscow in early 2008, Djokovic was sidelined due to influenza and missed his first singles match. He returned to win his doubles match, teaming with Nenad Zimonjić, before retiring during his singles match with Nikolay Davydenko.[87]\n\n\n\n#### 2008: First Major title, two Masters & first Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\nDjokovic started his preparations for the season by playing the Hopman Cup with fellow Serbian world No. 3 Jelena Janković where he won all of his four singles matches, including in the final against the United States, where he beat Mardy Fish in a deciding set tiebreak to level the tie, but then losing the decisive mixed doubles rubber,[88] in which he faced former WTA No. 1 Serena Williams in a competitive event for the first time.[89] At the Australian Open, Djokovic reached his second consecutive Grand Slam final, this time without dropping a set, including a victory over two-time defending champion Federer in the semifinals.[90] By reaching the semifinals, Djokovic became the youngest player in the Open Era to have reached the semifinals in all four Grand Slam events.[91] In the final, Djokovic defeated unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in four sets to earn his first Grand Slam singles title.[92] This marked the first time since the 2005 Australian Open that a Grand Slam singles title was not won by Federer or Nadal.[92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Djokovic celebrating Australian Open triumph in Belgrade.\nDjokovic's next tournament was the Dubai Championships, where he lost in the semifinals to Roddick. At the Indian Wells Masters, Djokovic won his ninth career singles title, defeating Mardy Fish in the final.[93] Djokovic won his tenth career singles title and fourth Master Series singles crown at the Italian Open in Rome after defeating Wawrinka in the final.[94] The following week he lost to Nadal in the semifinals at the Hamburg Masters. At the French Open, Djokovic was the third-seeded player behind Federer and Nadal. He lost to Nadal in the semifinals in straight sets.[95]\n\n\nOn grass, Djokovic once again played Nadal, this time in the Artois Championships final in Queen's Club, where he lost in two sets. Djokovic entered Wimbledon seeded third but lost in the second round to Marat Safin, ending a streak of five consecutive majors where he had reached at least the semifinals.[96]\n\n\nDjokovic then failed to defend his 2007 singles title at the Rogers Cup in Toronto, where he was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Andy Murray. The following week at the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic advanced to the final, beating Nadal in the semifinals, which not only ended the Spaniard's 32-match winning streak, but also delayed Nadal's first ascension to world No. 1 by a week.[97] In the final, he again lost to Murray in straight sets. His next tournament was the 2008 Summer Olympics, his first Olympics. He and Nenad Zimonjić, seeded second in men's doubles, were eliminated in the first round by the Czech pairing of Martin Damm and Pavel Vízner. Seeded third in singles, Djokovic lost in the semifinals to Nadal. Djokovic then defeated James Blake, the loser of the other semifinal, in the bronze medal match.[98]\n\n\nAfter the Olympics, Djokovic entered the US Open seeded third, where he defeated Roddick in the quarterfinals. To a smattering of boos in a post-match interview, Djokovic criticized Roddick for accusing him of making excessive use of the trainer during matches and for suggesting that he was faking his injuries.[99] His run at the US Open ended in the semifinals when he lost to Federer in four sets, in a rematch of the previous year's final. In November, Djokovic was the second seed at the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, beating Juan Martín del Potro and Nikolay Davydenko in the round-robin stage, and Gilles Simon in the semifinals. In the final, Djokovic defeated Davydenko to win his first title at the year-end championship.[100]\n\n\n\n#### 2009: Ten finals, five titles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2009 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\nDjokovic started the year at the Brisbane International, where he was upset by fellow Pilić academy trainee Ernests Gulbis in the first round.[101] As defending champion at the Australian Open, Djokovic retired from his quarterfinal match with former world No. 1 Andy Roddick, primarily due to heat illness that generated muscle aches and cramps.[102][103] After losing in the semifinals of the Open 13 tournament in Marseille to Tsonga, Djokovic won the singles title at the Dubai Championships, defeating Ferrer to claim his twelfth career title.[104] The following week, Djokovic was the defending champion at the Indian Wells Masters but lost to Roddick in the quarterfinals. At the Miami Open in Key Biscayne, Djokovic beat Federer in the semifinals, before losing to Murray in the final.[105]\n\n\nDjokovic reached the final of the next Masters event, the Monte-Carlo Masters on clay, losing to Nadal in the final.

In addition to leading the ATP Tour in match wins, he reached a career-best ten finals, winning five titles.[118]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\n#### 2010: US Open final & Davis Cup crown[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\nAfter playing nearly a hundred matches in 2009, Djokovic stated that he was \"fed up with matches\", so he decided not to play any ranking tournaments before the Australian Open, thus starting his year by playing in the AAMI Classic, an exhibition event, where he beat Tommy Haas, but lost to Fernando Verdasco and teenager Bernard Tomic.[118] At the Australian Open, Djokovic lost a five-setter to Tsonga in the quarterfinals.[119] Despite the loss, he attained a career-high ranking of No. 2 and went on to reach the semifinals in Rotterdam, where he lost to Mikhail Youzhny.

Djokovic then lost to Roddick in the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Masters.[130] As the third seed at the US Open, Djokovic came very close to losing in his opening round against Viktor Troicki in extreme heat.

He also reached his first-ever Wimbledon final, which he eventually won.](image)Djokovic celebrates upon defeating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals of the 2011 Wimbledon Championships, clinching the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in his career.\nDjokovic began his season by winning the Australian Open. He only dropped one set en route to the title, beating Federer in the semifinals and Murray in the final to capture his second Australian Open title and his first grand slam in three years.[135][136]\n\n\nHe next competed at the Dubai Championships and beat Federer in the final in straight sets.[137] Two weeks later, Djokovic won his second Indian Wells title after beating Federer in the semifinals and Nadal in the final, both in three sets, thus becoming only the third player to beat Nadal and Federer in the same tournament twice, joining Nikolay Davydenko and David Nalbandian.[138][139] In Miami, Djokovic once again beat Nadal in the finals in three sets, with the final set being decided in a tiebreak.[140] After winning the Serbia Open, Djokovic won the Madrid and Italian Opens, beating Nadal in straight sets in both finals.[141][142] Beating Nadal in back-to-back matches on clay was a notable reversal due to the fact that he had previously lost all nine matches played against Nadal on clay.[142]\n\n\nHe continued his good form on clay at the French Open by dropping only one set en route to the semifinal, which he lost to Federer. This loss marked Djokovic's first defeat of the season (with Federer also being the last man to defeat Djokovic in 2010), ending a 43-match win streak, which included a 41–0 start to 2011.[143][144] Five weeks later at Wimbledon, Djokovic replaced Nadal as the world No. 1 and then defeated him in a four set final to take his first Wimbledon title.[145][146]\n\n\nIn Canada, Djokovic won his single-season record-breaking fifth Masters title with a three-set win over Mardy Fish in the final.[147] At the US Open, Djokovic beat Federer and Nadal on the way to the title, thus becoming only the second player to defeat both of them in the same Major event after Juan Martín del Potro in the 2009 US Open.[148] Djokovic saved match points en route to the title, saving two against Federer in the semifinals to complete a comeback from two sets down,[149][150] thus becoming just the second player to beat Federer from two sets down after Tsonga a few months earlier in Wimbledon.[151] Djokovic's crosscourt forehand return winner to save the first match point is widely regarded as one of the greatest shots in US Open history as well as one of the greatest returns in tennis history.[152][153] This was the second consecutive US Open where Djokovic saved two match points against Federer to reach the final, and the fifth consecutive US Open where Djokovic and Federer played each other.[149] Djokovic played Nadal in their second successive major final, winning the match in four sets and taking his first US Open title.[154][155][156]\n\n\nWith the victory, Djokovic extended his season record to an impressive 64–2.[155] However, his level dropped toward the season's end, beginning with a back injury sustained during the US Open which caused him to retire from the Davis Cup, and ending with a poor showing at the ATP Finals, in which he lost to David Ferrer and Janko Tipsarević, but saved match point against Tomáš Berdych to seal his 70th and final win of the year.[157] Djokovic concluded the season with a 70–6 record and a year-end ranking of No. 1.

This was the first time since 2007 that Djokovic failed to reach the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, and the first time in his career that he lost to a player ranked outside of the top 100 at a major.[257] In February and March, Djokovic played at the Mexican Open and Indian Wells Masters, but was eliminated by Nick Kyrgios in both events before the semifinals. In April, Djokovic reached the quarterfinals of the Monte-Carlo Masters, losing to David Goffin. After the tournament, he chose to split with his long-time coach Marián Vajda, fitness specialist Gebhard Phil-Gritsch, and physiotherapist Miljan Amanović, citing the need to find a winning spark. A better showing at the Madrid Masters saw Djokovic reach the semifinals, losing to Nadal in straight sets.[258] A runner-up result at the Rome Masters indicated improvement in his form.\n\n\nOn 21 May 2017, Djokovic announced that Andre Agassi would become his new coach, starting at the French Open. However, as the defending champion, he lost in the quarterfinals to Dominic Thiem.[259] He began the grass court season at the Eastbourne International, playing his first non-Wimbledon tournament on grass since 2010. He won the title by beating Gaël Monfils in the final. This was also the only tournament that Djokovic won without his coach being Marián Vajda until the duo split in 2022. He made it to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon before retiring against Tomáš Berdych due to an elbow injury.[260]\n\n\nOn 26 July, Djokovic announced he would miss the US Open and the rest of the 2017 season to recover from his elbow injury.[261] This was the first time that he missed a major tournament since he entered his first, the 2005 Australian Open, thus ending his streak of participating in 51 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments, the seventh-longest run in history.[262]\n\n\n\n#### 2018: Surgery and resurgence; two Majors, return to No. 1 & historic Golden Masters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\nIn January, Djokovic defeated Dominic Thiem at the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament.

Although Federer was riding a streak of 100 consecutive holds of serve at the tournament,[276] dating back to the 2014 final,[277] Djokovic broke his serve three times to win his first Cincinnati Masters title. With this victory, Djokovic became the first (and, as of 2022, only) player in tennis history to complete the Career Golden Masters — winning all nine ATP Masters events at least once in one's career.[278]\n\n\nDjokovic was the sixth seed at the US Open. He advanced to his eleventh US Open semifinal in as many appearances, where he overcame Kei Nishikori. Djokovic then defeated Juan Martín del Potro to win his third US Open title and 14th major title overall, tying Pete Sampras' tally.

Djokovic was criticized for holding the event with a lack of social distancing and other precautions taken against COVID-19.[307][308] The last match of the tour was cancelled after several players, their partners, and coaches tested positive for the virus.[309] Djokovic stated he was \"deeply sorry\", admitting he and organisers \"were wrong\" to go ahead with the event and that they believed the tournament met all health protocols.[310] He also said that many of the criticisms were malicious, adding: \"It's obviously more than just criticism, it's like an agenda and a witch hunt\".[311][312]\n\n\nWith the resumption of the ATP Tour, Djokovic defeated Milos Raonic to win his second Cincinnati Masters title. By doing so, he won his 35th Masters title, completing his second career Golden Masters.[313] In the fourth round of the US Open, Djokovic was defaulted after accidentally hitting a line official in the throat with a tennis ball during his fourth round match against Pablo Carreño Busta.[314] The United States Tennis Association docked Djokovic all ranking points he would have earned at the tournament and fined him the prize money that he would have won had the incident not occurred.[315] On 21 September, Djokovic moved past Pete Sampras for the second most weeks spent as the world number 1 player.\n\n\nDjokovic next won a record 36th Masters title and his fifth in Rome, defeating Diego Schwartzman in the final.[316] At the rescheduled French Open, Djokovic lost in straight sets to Rafael Nadal in the final.[317] Djokovic then played at the Vienna Open, where he was upset in the quarterfinals by Lorenzo Sonego in straight sets.[318] In the ATP Finals, Djokovic lost to Daniil Medvedev in the round robin, but defeated Alexander Zverev and Diego Schwartzman.

Djokovic was one of \"a handful\" of players and staff to be granted a medical exemption by Tennis Australia and the Department of Health in Victoria.[352][353][354][355] It was later revealed that Djokovic tested positive for COVID-19 on 16 December 2021 which was used as the basis for his exemption.[356]\n\n\nDjokovic had been granted a visa to enter Australia on 18 November 2021.[357] He travelled to Melbourne on 5 January but was detained by the Australian Border Force after they determined that he did not meet the entry requirements for an unvaccinated traveller.[358][359] Djokovic disclosed that a member of his support team ticked a box on his application form stating he had not travelled abroad two weeks before he left for Australia; however, he had been to Spain at that time.[360] His visa was cancelled and he was held in an immigration detention hotel for several days awaiting a court hearing.[361]\n\n\nOn 10 January, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia ordered his release and awarded costs,[362][363] ruling that the visa cancelation process undertaken by Australian border officials was flawed on the basis that they did not give Djokovic sufficient time to contact his lawyers and tennis authorities before his official interview. The Australian Government conceded that the cancelation was \"unreasonable in [the] circumstances\".[364]\n\n\nOn 14 January 2022, Alex Hawke, Australia's Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, exercised his ministerial powers under sections 133C(3) and 116(1)(e)(i) of the *Migration Act 1958* to cancel Djokovic's visa,[365] citing \"health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so\".[366] Djokovic applied for a judicial review, but three Federal Court of Australia judges unanimously dismissed his application on 16 January, preventing his participation in the 2022 Australian Open.[367][368][369] Djokovic said he was \"extremely disappointed\" with the decision but accepted the ruling, and flew out of Australia to Dubai that night.[370][371][372] Because he was removed using ministerial powers under the *Migration Act*, he is now barred from returning to Australia for three years,[373] although each visa application is reviewed on its merits.[373] As of November 2022, this visa ban has been overturned by the recently elected Immigration Minister Andrew Giles.[374]\n\n\nIn February, Djokovic gave an interview to the BBC regarding his deportation from Australia, stating he is willing to forego career records by sticking to his principles of free choice and not having the COVID-19 vaccine.[10] In May, he admitted that the court battle and his deportation from Australia \"took a major toll\" on him.[375] He said: \"The amount of pressure and everything that I was feeling in the first few months of the year, as much as I've felt pressure in my life and my career, that was something really on a whole different level\".[376]\n\n\n\n##### After Australia[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic entered the Dubai Championships in February, where vaccination was not required for entry.[377] He was upset in the quarterfinals by eventual finalist Jiří Veselý, resulting in him conceding his world No. 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev. This marked the first time a man outside of the Big Four was ranked singles world No. 1 since Andy Roddick in February 2004.[378] Djokovic withdrew from both the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Open, due to the United States forbidding unvaccinated foreign travellers.[379] Despite being unable to play, Djokovic regained the world No. 1 ranking after Medvedev's third-round defeat at Indian Wells.[380]\n\n\nAfter being unable to play in March, Djokovic began his clay court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters in April. Seeded first, he received a bye in the first round and lost to eventual finalist Davidovich Fokina in the second, his first opening match loss since the 2018 Barcelona Open.[381][382] Later that month, he reached the final of the Serbia Open and lost to Andrey Rublev in three sets.[383] At the Madrid Open in May, Djokovic made it to the semifinals where he was beaten in three sets by 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, the eventual champion.[384]\nAt the Italian Open a week later, he reached the twelfth final of his career at this Masters.

He lost in four sets, ending his French Open title defense.[387] As a result of his quarterfinals defeat, he conceded the No. 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev for the second time in 2022.\n\n\nWith his first-round win at the Wimbledon Championships against Kwon Soon-woo, Djokovic became the first player in history (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four Grand Slams.[388] With his semifinal win over Cameron Norrie, Djokovic reached a record 32nd Grand Slam final, one ahead of Roger Federer.[389] Djokovic went on to defeat Nick Kyrgios in the final in four sets for his fourth consecutive and seventh overall Wimbledon trophy.[390]\nWith this victory, he reached a total of 21 major titles, which broke his tie of 20 majors with Federer and put him one Grand Slam title behind Nadal.[391][392]\n\n\nDue to Djokovic's unvaccinated status against COVID-19, he was unable to compete in the US Open as the US government did not allow unvaccinated non-US citizens to enter the country.[393] As a result, he withdrew from the tournament on 25 August.[394] At the Astana Open in October, he defeated Medvedev in the semifinals and Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final to win his 90th singles title.[395] Djokovic also qualified for the ATP Finals for the 15th time.[396][397]\n\n\nDjokovic then competed at the Paris Masters, where he reached his 90th Masters quarterfinal, defeating Karen Khachanov, who at the time, was the only player to have defeated him in the final of this Masters.[398] He then defeated Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets to reach his 74th Masters semifinal and eighth at this tournament.[399] In the semifinals, Djokovic defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas to reach his third straight final of the season and eighth overall at this Masters. It was also Djokovic's record 56th ATP Masters final and the 650th hard-court win of his career, making him just the third male player in the Open Era to record 650 or more career wins on any single surface.[400][401] He lost in the final to 19-year-old Holger Rune, who defeated five top-10 players en route to the title. It was the first time Djokovic has lost in 31 Masters finals when winning the first set.[402]\n\n\nSeeded seventh at the ATP Finals, Djokovic won his first round robin match over second seed Stefanos Tsitsipas to record his 60th career victory over a Top 3 player, making him the first player to accomplish this milestone since the ATP rankings began in 1973.

Afterwards, Djokovic struggled in the clay court season, suffering early defeats at the Monte-Carlo Masters[415] and the Banja Luka Open.[416] At the Italian Open, Djokovic was defeated in the quarterfinals by Holger Rune.[417]\n\n\nAt the French Open, he returned to form, reaching the semifinals to face world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz, whom he defeated in four sets to reach a record-extending 34th major final.

He beat Alcaraz in a rematch of their Wimbledon final, in what was the longest best-of-three-sets ATP final and the longest match in the tournament's history, at 3 hours and 49 minutes, and was immediately praised as one of the best matches of all time.[422][423] He won the match from a set down and down a break in the second set, along with saving a championship point in the second-set tiebreaker.[422] Djokovic called it one of his toughest matches, and said \"It did feel like a Grand Slam final, even more than that to be honest\". He compared the intensity and toughness of the match to his match against Rafael Nadal in the 2012 Australian Open final.[424]\n\n\nDjokovic then played at the US Open where he dropped only two sets en route to the title, both to his fellow countryman Laslo Djere in a win from two sets down in the third round.[425] By reaching a 47th men's singles major semifinal, Djokovic surpassed Roger Federer's Open Era record.[426] By reaching the final, Djokovic matched Federer's record of reaching all major finals in a season three times.

Djokovic has two streaks of seven victories against Nadal, in 2011–2012 and 2015–2016. The two contested in the longest major finals match ever played at the 2012 Australian Open where Djokovic won in five sets lasting 5 hours and 53 minutes.[440][441][442] Other classics they played include the 2009 Madrid Masters semifinal,[443] 2011 Miami Masters final,[444][445] the 2013 French Open semifinal,[446] 2018 Wimbledon semifinal,[447][448] and the 2021 French Open semifinal.[449]\n\n\n\n### Roger Federer[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Federer rivalry\n\n![](image)Djokovic and Federer after their semifinal match at the 2011 US Open.\nDjokovic and Roger Federer rivalry is considered to be one of the greatest rivalries in tennis history. They faced each other 50 times, with Djokovic leading 27–23, including 13–6 in finals (not including a 2014 walkover in favour of Djokovic). Djokovic leads on hard courts 20–18 as well as on grass 3–1 and they are split 4–4 on clay.[450]\n\n\nDjokovic is the player with the most victories over Federer and the only player to beat Federer multiple times at his most successful major tournaments, four times at the Australian Open, three times at the US Open, three times at the Year-end Championship and most notably, three times at the final of Wimbledon Championships. Their most recent final was at the 2019 Wimbledon where Djokovic won in five sets in what became the longest final in Wimbledon history.[451][452] Other notable matches they contested are the 2014 Wimbledon and 2015 Wimbledon finals, along with semifinals at the 2010 US Open, 2011 US Open, 2011 French Open, and 2018 Paris Masters.[150][453][454]\n\n\n\n### Andy Murray[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Murray rivalry\n\nDjokovic and Andy Murray have met 36 times, with Djokovic leading 25–11.[455] Djokovic leads on hard courts 20–8 and 5–1 on clay, while Murray has won the two matches played on grass. Djokovic and Murray are one of two pairs to have met in each of the four major finals (other pair being Djokovic and Nadal). The two are almost exactly the same age, with Murray being a week older than Djokovic. They went to training camp together, and Murray was the winner of the first match they ever played as teenagers. One of their most notable matches was a three-set thriller at the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters, in which Murray held five championship point opportunities in the second set; however, Djokovic saved each of them, forcing a deciding set.[456] He eventually prevailed to win his first Shanghai Masters title, ending Murray's 12–0 winning streak at the event. This match and the three-set semifinal they played in Rome in 2011, were voted the ATP Tour match of the year, for each respective season.[457][458] Other classics they had include the 2012 Australian Open semifinal, 2012 US Open final, the 2015 semifinal and 2016 final at the French Open, and the 2017 Qatar Open final.\n\n\n\n### Stan Wawrinka[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Stan Wawrinka have met 27 times with Djokovic leading 21–6. However, the two have contested numerous close matches, including four five-setters at the majors.[459] Wawrinka and Djokovic have met in three consecutive Australian Opens – with each match going to five sets – and a five-setter in the US Open. In the 2013 Australian Open fourth round, Djokovic won 12–10 in a fifth set, with the match being considered one of the best ever played;[460][187][188][191][189][461] at the 2013 US Open semifinals Djokovic won 6–4 in the fifth set; at the 2014 Australian Open quarterfinals, Wawrinka won 9–7 in the fifth. Wawrinka's win broke Djokovic's run of 14 consecutive major semifinals, and ended a 28-match winning streak; and Wawrinka went on to win his first major title at the tournament.[462] Djokovic got revenge the next year at the 2015 Australian Open, winning 6–0 in the fifth set.[463]\n\n\nAt the 2015 French Open final, Wawrinka defeated Djokovic in four sets to claim his second major title. Later that year, Djokovic beat Wawrinka at the Cincinnati Masters and Paris Masters.[464] At the 2016 US Open, Wawrinka beat Djokovic in a major final for a second time.[465]\n\n\nDespite Djokovic's 21–6 overall record against Wawrinka, Wawrinka leads Djokovic 3–2 in ATP finals, two of which in major finals.[466] During Djokovic's run of 13 major finals from the 2014 Wimbledon Championships through the 2020 Australian Open, his only two losses were to Wawrinka. Contrary to most high-profile rivalries, the pair have also played doubles together.[467]\n\n\n\n### Juan Martín del Potro[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Juan Martín del Potro met 20 times, with Djokovic leading 16–4.[468] Djokovic won their first four meetings, before back-to-back victories for del Potro at the 2011 Davis Cup and their Bronze medal match at the 2012 Summer Olympics in straight sets. Djokovic won the next four matches before he lost to del Potro at the 2013 Indian Wells Masters, where the Argentine made his second career Masters final. Djokovic got the upper hand on the rivalry once again by winning two of the most important matches between them to date; an epic five-setter at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships semifinals (which was the longest Wimbledon semifinal at the time),[469] and a thrilling three-setter at the 2013 Shanghai Masters final. Del Potro upset Djokovic in the first round at the 2016 Rio Olympics in Rio en route to the final. In 2018, Djokovic defeated del Potro in three close sets in the final of the US Open, which was the first Grand Slam final for del Potro since his 2009 US Open victory. They played their last match at the 2019 Italian Open quarterfinal which Djokovic won in a dramatic three-setter after saving two match points.\n\n\n\n### Jo-Wilfried Tsonga[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga met 23 times, with Djokovic leading 17–6.[470][471] Their first meeting was in the final of the 2008 Australian Open, which Djokovic won in four sets to win his first major singles title.[472]\n\n\nTheir next meeting at the majors was at the 2010 Australian Open in the quarterfinals. This time Tsonga prevailed, winning in five sets after Djokovic fell ill during the match.[473] It would be another year-and-a-half until they met again, this time in the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2011. It was their first meeting on grass, and Djokovic prevailed in four sets to advance to his first Wimbledon final (and claiming the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in the process).[474] At the 2012 French Open, Djokovic and Tsonga met again in the quarterfinals, with Djokovic prevailing in five sets after over four hours.[475]\n\n\nThey met again two months later at the Olympics, with Djokovic winning in straight sets in the quarterfinals.[476] They contested the final of the 2012 China Open, where Djokovic was victorious once again, in straight sets.[477] The pair were drawn in the same pool for the 2012 ATP Finals in which Djokovic prevailed in the first (of three) round robin matches.[478] It was Djokovic's fifth win over Tsonga in 2012. Their final major meeting was in the second round of the 2019 Australian Open,[479] which Djokovic won in straight sets.\n\n\n\n### Daniil Medvedev[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Daniil Medvedev have met 15 times, with Djokovic leading 10–5.[480][481] They have contested three major finals, with Djokovic winning the 2021 Australian Open and the 2023 US Open, and Medvedev winning his first major title at the 2021 US Open, also ending Djokovic's quest for a calendar-year Grand Slam.[482]\n\n\nDjokovic won their first two matches at the 2017 Davis Cup and 2017 Eastbourne International.[483] They next met at a major for the first time in the fourth round of the 2019 Australian Open, with Djokovic prevailing in four sets.[484] Medvedev improved their head-to-head to 3–2 with three-set wins at the quarterfinal of the 2019 Monte-Carlo Masters and the semifinal of 2019 Cincinnati Masters, the latter of which Medvedev went on to win for his maiden ATP Masters title.[485][486] They met in three finals in 2021, with Djokovic winning the Australian Open and Paris Masters and Medvedev winning the US Open.\n\n\nMedvedev replaced Djokovic as the world No. 1 player when he rose to the top ranking for the first time in February 2022.[487]\n\n\nAt the 2023 US Open Final, Djokovic beat Medvedev in a rematch of the 2021 US Open final to claim his 24th Grand Slam Title in straight sets. The second set was a grueling 104-minute battle that Djokovic won in a tiebreak.[488]\n\n\n\n### Stefanos Tsitsipas[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Stefanos Tsitsipas have met 13 times, with Djokovic leading 11–2, including at the 2021 French Open and 2023 Australian Open finals, both of which Djokovic won.[489][490]\n\n\nTheir first meeting took place at the third round of the 2018 Rogers Cup, with the then 19-year-old Tsitsipas, ranked No. 27, pulling an upset over Djokovic in three sets.[491] Djokovic avenged this loss by beating Tsitsipas, then ranked in the top 10, in straight sets to win the 2019 Madrid Open.[492] Tstisipas won their next match in the quarterfinals of the 2019 Shanghai Masters in three sets to bring their head-to-head to 2–1 in his favor.[493] Djokovic then won all of their next ten matches, including the 2020 French Open semifinal, 2021 French Open final, 2022 Italian Open final, and 2023 Australian Open final, the last of which also saw the two competing for the world No. 1 ranking.[489]\n\n\n\n### Carlos Alcaraz[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Carlos Alcaraz have met four times, splitting it evenly 2–2, with both winning once at a Grand Slam tournament and once at a Masters tournament.[494] Their rivalry has been deemed to be a significant intergenerational rivalry, as Alcaraz being 16 years younger than Djokovic is seen as the successor to the Big Three, while Djokovic is defending the old guard.[495][496][497]\n\n\nTheir first meeting was at the 2022 Madrid Masters semifinals, in which Alcaraz prevailed in an epic that was praised as the match of the year, finishing at 3 hours and 35 minutes.[498] Their next meeting would not be until the 2023 French Open semifinals, in which Djokovic won in four sets, which was close in the beginning until Alcaraz faltered due to cramps from mental pressure and physical intensity.[499] They would meet again soon after in the 2023 Wimbledon final, in which Alcaraz would defeat Djokovic in five sets, ending his hopes for a calendar Grand Slam and his record 45-match Centre Court win streak. At five sets it was the third-longest Wimbledon final, at 4 hours and 42 minutes.[500] They would meet soon again in another epic at the 2023 Cincinnati Masters final, with Djokovic prevailing in three tightly contested sets after saving a match point. The match was the longest best-of-three-sets ATP Tour final and the longest match in the tournament's history, at 3 hours and 49 minutes, and was immediately praised as one of the best matches ever.[422][423][501] Djokovic won despite being a set down and down a break in the second set, along with saving a championship point in the second-set tiebreaker.[502][503]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic is regarded by many observers, tennis players and coaches as the greatest men's tennis player of all time, primarily for his achievements across all top-level tournaments of the men's professional tour in addition to his time spent with the world No. 1 ranking. Many media, including Forbes, Reuters, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, Marca, Tennis World USA, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and Sporting News have named Djokovic the greatest male tennis player in history.[504][505][506][507][508][509]\n\n\nDjokovic has won a record 70 Big Titles, including an all-time record of 24 Grand Slam titles, and holds the most weeks at No. 1, the most wins over top 5 and top 10-ranked players, has won all major and Masters events and the year-end championships at least twice (which has not been done by another player once) and has a winning head-to-head record over his greatest rivals in one of the strongest eras of tennis.[510][511][512][513][514][515][516][517][518][519] Former world No. 1 Daniil Medvedev labelled Djokovic the \"greatest tennis player in history\" after winning his first major title at the 2021 US Open over Djokovic.[520] Pat Cash emphasized that Djokovic is one of two players who beat Rafael Nadal at the French Open, which he considers to be \"the biggest challenge in tennis\".[512] Richard Krajicek and *The Roar*, sports opinion website, said that Djokovic should be considered for the greatest player of all time because he is the only one among his rivals who has won all four majors consecutively.[521][522][523] Patrick Mouratoglou stated, \"Novak is the most complete player of all times. That enables him to find the solution to most of the problems on court and this, on every surface. It explains why he is now in the best position to become the GOAT\".[524] Former world No. 7 Mardy Fish also declared that Djokovic in 2011 was \"the best player of all time\".[525] Rafael Nadal has praised Djokovic's peak level of performance, stating in 2011 (when he went 0–6 against Djokovic for the season) that \"[Djokovic's level is] probably the highest level of tennis that I ever saw.\"[526] Nadal reiterated this after a one-sided loss in the 2016 Qatar Open final, stating that \"I played against a player who did everything perfectly. I don't know anybody who's ever played tennis like this. Since I know this sport I've never seen somebody playing at this level.\"[527]\n\n\nNadal later said in an interview with Spanish daily sports newspaper Diario AS shortly after Djokovic (aged 36) won the 2023 US Open for his 24th Grand Slam:\n\n\n\n\n> I believe that numbers are numbers and statistics are statistics and, in that sense, I think he [Djokovic] has better numbers than mine and that is indisputable. It is not beneath me nor do I have an ego big enough to try and disguise a reality that is not. This is the truth. The rest are tastes, inspiration, sensations that one player or the other may transmit to you, that you may like one or the other more. I think that with respect to titles, Djokovic is the best in history and there is nothing to discuss in that.[528][529][530][531]\n> \n> \n\n\nTennis coach Nick Bollettieri praised Djokovic as the \"most complete player ever\",[532] and the \"most perfect player of all time\":[533]\n\n\n\n\n> When you look at match players in the history of tennis, I don't believe that anybody can equal everything on the court that Djokovic does. I don't think you can find a weakness in his game. His movement, personality, his return of serve, his serve, excellent touch, not hesitant in coming to the net, great serve. Overall, almost every player has a downfall; to me, he doesn't have one. He's perhaps the best put-together player that I've seen over 60 years.[534]\n> \n> \n\n\nAndre Agassi, stated in an interview in 2019 with the Times of India that:\n\n\n\n\n> The highest standard of tennis that I've ever seen is when Novak is playing his best tennis. The single level, for whatever my tennis IQ is worth, is an unmistakable standard to which everybody will strive to be.[535]\n> \n> \n\n\nPete Sampras, who at the time of his retirement in 2003 was considered by some to be the greatest male tennis player of all time, stated after Djokovic earned a record-breaking seventh year-end No. 1 finish in 2021:\n\n\n\n\n> Seven years for him, I'm sure he sees it as a bonus to all the majors that he's won, but I think he'll appreciate it more as he gets older. He did it at a time where he dominated two of the greats, in Roger and Rafa, and he handled the next generation of players very well – all at the same time. I do think what Novak's done over the past 10 years, winning the majors, being consistent, finishing number one for seven years, to me it's a clear sign that he is the greatest of all time.[515][536]\n> \n> \n\n\nTennis pundits have classified many of Djokovic's matches as some of the greatest contests ever, such as the 2012 Australian Open final, in which he beat Nadal in five long and gruelling sets.[537][538] Other matches include the five-set 2013 Australian Open fourth round against Stan Wawrinka,[188][189] the 2018 Wimbledon semifinal against Nadal, which lasted five brutal sets played over two days,[539][540] the five-set 2019 Wimbledon final against Roger Federer, the longest Wimbledon final in history,[541][542] and the 2023 Cincinnati Masters final against Carlos Alcaraz, the longest best-of-three-sets final in ATP Tour history.[422][423]\n\n\nSome analysts claim that the Djokovic–Nadal rivalry ranks as the best rivalry in tennis history because of the quality of matches they produce.[543]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n### Playing style[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic is an aggressive baseline player.[544] His groundstrokes from both wings are consistent, deep, and penetrating. His backhand is widely regarded as the greatest two-handed backhand of all time, due to its effectiveness on both sides of the court and its accuracy.[545][546][547] His best shot is his backhand down the line, with great pace and precision. He excels at returning serve in particular, and regularly ranks among the tour leaders in return points, return games, and break points won. His forehand is deemed to be underrated, yet one of the best, due to its versatility.[548] After great technical difficulties during the 2009 season (coinciding with his switch to the Head racket series), his serve is one of his major weapons again, winning him many free points; his first serve is typically hit flat, while he prefers to slice and kick his second serves wide.[544] He has also led the ATP Tour in their career \"Under Pressure Rating\" statistic, in part because of his prowess at winning deciding sets.\n\n\n\n![](image)Djokovic serving at the Eastbourne International. Djokovic plays with a Head racquet and wears Lacoste apparel and Asics shoes.\nDjokovic has been described as one of the fittest and most complete athletes in sports history, with high agility, court coverage and mobility, which allows him to hit winners from seemingly indefensible positions.[549][550] Because of this, coupled with flexibility and length, he rarely gets aced. Todd Martin, who coached Djokovic between 2009 and 2010, noted that:[551]\n\n\n\n\n> His athleticism is from another world. His return of serve is way better than any other return of serve ever and I mean way better. Nobody has gotten so many balls back and neutralized so many good serves. \n> \n> \n\n\nDjokovic's return of serve is a big weapon for him, with which he can be both offensive and defensive. He is highly efficient off both the forehand and backhand return, often getting the return in play deep with pace, neutralizing the advantage the server usually has in a point. Andre Agassi described Djokovic's return of serve as \"the precedent-setting standard for the return\".[552][553] Occasionally, Djokovic employs a well-disguised backhand underspin drop shot and sliced backhand. Djokovic is widely\n\n\nDjokovic commented on the modern style of play, including his own, in an interview with Jim Courier after his semifinal win against Andy Murray in the 2012 Australian Open tournament:[554]\n\n\n\n\n> I had a big privilege and honour to meet personally today Mr. Laver, and he is one of the biggest, and greatest players ever to play the game, thank you for staying this late, sir, thank you ... even though it would actually be better if we played a couple times serve and volley, but we don't know to play ... we are mostly around here [points to the area near the baseline], we are running, you know, around the baseline ... \n> \n> \n\n\nIn assessing Djokovic's 2011 season, Jimmy Connors said that Djokovic gives his opponents problems by playing \"a little bit old-school, taking the ball earlier, catching the ball on the rise, (and) driving the ball flat.\" Connors adds that a lot of the topspin that Djokovic's opponents drive at him comes right into his zone, thus his ability to turn defense into offense well.[555]\n\n\n\n### Equipment[edit]\n\n\nEntering the pro circuit, Djokovic used the Head Liquidmetal Radical, but changed sponsors to Wilson in 2005. He could not find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson agreed to make him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head.[556] After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 Australian Open. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign.[557] Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses Head Synthetic Leather Grip as a replacement grip.[558] In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and ten-pin bowling.[559]\n\n\n\n### Coaching and personal team[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Novak Djokovic coaches\n\nIn the period 2004 and 2005, Djokovic was coached by Dejan Petrovic.[560] From fall 2005 until June 2006, he was coached by Riccardo Piatti, who divided his time between the 18-year-old and Ivan Ljubičić. Player and coach reportedly parted ways over the latter's refusal to work full-time with Djokovic.[561]\n\n\nFrom June 2006 until May 2017, Djokovic was coached by former professional Slovakian tennis player Marián Vajda. They met for the first time during that year's French Open, after which Vajda was hired to be the 19-year-old's coach. On occasion Djokovic employed additional coaches on a part-time basis: in 2007, during the spring hardcourt season, he worked with Australian doubles ace Mark Woodforde with specific emphasis on volleys and net play while from August 2009 until April 2010 American Todd Martin joined the coaching team, a period marked by his ill-fated attempt to change Djokovic's serve motion.[562] From early 2007 until 2017, Djokovic worked with physiotherapist Miljan Amanović, who was previously employed by Red Star Belgrade, and NBA player Vladimir Radmanović.[563]\n\n\nFrom the fall of 2006, Djokovic had an Israeli fitness coach, Ronen Bega, but the two parted ways during the spring of 2009.[564] Djokovic decided to make a change after identifying his conditioning as a weakness in his game following continual losses to Nadal.[565] In April 2009, ahead of the Rome Masters, Djokovic hired Austrian Gebhard Phil-Gritsch (formerly worked with Thomas Muster) to join the team in fitness coach capacity.[566][567]\n\n\nIn 2008, Djokovic hired Edoardo Artaldi's management team, which includes his wife, Elena Capellaro, to oversee the huge operation that runs around him. They met when Djokovic signed a contract with the Italian clothing brand Sergio Tacchini, where Artaldi was working at the time.[568] Despite taking a lead role as an agent and business manager, Artaldi has acted like a father figure in Djokovic's camp. During an interview with Italian outlet SBS in 2019, Artaldi explained that, together with his wife, they have tried to “create the atmosphere” that Djokovic needed while on tour because he missed his family while traveling.[568][569] Artaldi's relationship with Djokovic has had its challenging moments, as he screamed at Artaldi and brother Marko to leave his box during the final of the 2023 Adelaide Open.[568]\n\n\nIn July 2010, before the Davis Cup clash away at Croatia, Djokovic made another addition to his team – Igor Četojević, a Serbian nutritionist and proponent of traditional medicine living in Cyprus,[570] who influenced Djokovic's diet.[571][572] A gluten-free diet appeared to have worked as Djokovic began feeling stronger, quicker, and much more fit.[573] After Djokovic's Wimbledon win in July 2011, Četojević left the team.[574]\n\n\nAfter retiring from professional tennis in August 2011, Serbian player Dušan Vemić joined Djokovic's team as the assistant coach and hitting partner for Novak. The collaboration ended before the 2013 US Open.[575] Likewise, Djokovic's childhood friend and former junior doubles partner Bojan Božović also briefly served as a hitting partner for Novak in late 2014, shortly after Božović had opened his academy, and due to his height and strong serve, Djokovic practiced his returns with him, specifically for the 2014 Paris Masters final against Milos Raonic, a player with a powerful serve.[53]\n\n\nSix-time major champion and former world No. 1 Boris Becker, who had mostly worked as a television pundit for BBC Sport and Sky Sports since retiring from playing in 1999, was announced as Djokovic's new head coach in December 2013.[576] According to Djokovic, the Becker appointment was done with input from the player's existing head coach Marián Vajda who reportedly wanted to spend more time with his family and was looking to have his coaching workload somewhat reduced.[577] For Becker, in addition to working alongside Vajda, the job entailed special emphasis on Grand Slam tournaments as Djokovic felt he missed out on winning a couple of majors over the previous two seasons due to a lack of mental edge in the final stages of those tournaments.[578] Becker's first tournament coaching Djokovic was the 2014 Australian Open.\n\n\nOn 5 May 2017, Djokovic confirmed that he had come to a mutual agreement to terminate his coaching relationship with Vajda, as well as Phil-Gritsch and Amanović. In a statement on his website, Djokovic cited the reasons for the personnel shakeup: \"Novak and the team members decided to part ways after a detailed analysis of the game, achieved results in the previous period, and also after discussing private plans of each team member. Despite the fantastic cooperation so far, Djokovic felt he needed to make a change, and to introduce new energy in order to raise his level of play.\"[579]\n\n\nDjokovic reunited with Marián Vajda in April 2018 for the Monte-Carlo Masters.[580][581] On 30 June 2019, Djokovic confirmed that he also added former world No. 2 and Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanišević to his coaching team.[582]\n\n\nIn late 2021, Djokovic decided to play fewer tournaments in order to focus on Grand Slam tournaments and as such, he decided to be with a smaller team with only one coach, and he chose Ivanišević due to Vajda's reluctance to coach only him only on Grand Slams.[583] Djokovic and Vajda thus parted ways for a second time in December 2021, but it was only made public in March 2022,[583] when both announced that Vajda would no longer coach Djokovic and that it was an amicable and mutual decision. Vajda promised to remain his 'biggest support' on and off the court. Djokovic said on Twitter \"What a journey Marian. 15 years!\"[584] In addition to Ivanišević as his new coach, Djokovic also added fitness trainer Marco Panichi and hitting partner Carlos Gómez-Herrera, a retired tennis player with whom he had been friends for around 15 years, while also keeping physiotherapist Miljan Amanović.[569][585]\n\n\nIn late 2023, Djokovic decided to end his professional long-term association with Edoardo Artaldi's management team, who had been with him since 2008, stating that “I’m now at a stage where I'm entering a new chapter about the off-court approach”.[569]\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kindergarten in Jalovik village built by the Novak Djokovic Foundation.[586]\nIn 2007, Djokovic founded the Novak Djokovic Foundation.[587] The organization's mission is to help children from disadvantaged communities grow up and develop in stimulating and safe environments.[588] The foundation partnered with the World Bank in August 2015 to promote early childhood education in Serbia.[589][590][591] His foundation has built 50 schools as of April 2022 and are building their 51st, and supported more than 20,800 children and over a thousand families.[592][593]\n\n\nDjokovic participated in charity matches to raise funds for the reconstruction of the Avala Tower, as well as to aid victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake and 2010–11 Queensland floods.[594][595][596] Starting in 2007, he has established a tradition of hosting and socializing with hundreds of Kosovo Serb children during Davis Cup matches organized in Serbia.[597] Djokovic was selected as the 2012 Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year, for his contributions through the foundation, his role as a UNICEF national ambassador and other charitable projects.[598] In August 2015, he was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.[20]\n\n\nDuring the 2014 Balkans floods, Djokovic sparked worldwide financial and media support for victims in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia.[599] After winning the 2014 Rome Masters, Djokovic donated his prize money to the flood victims in Serbia, while his foundation collected another $600,000.[599][593] Following his 2016 Australian Open victory, Djokovic donated $20,000 to Melbourne City Mission's early childhood education programm to help disadvantaged children.[600] After the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Serbia in March 2020, he and his wife announced that they will donate €1 million for the purchase of ventilators and medical equipment to support hospitals and other medical institutions.[601] He also made a donation to Bergamo, Italy‚ one of the worst-affected Italian provinces, as well as to Novi Pazar, Serbia and North Mitrovica, Serbia.[602][603][604]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorships and business ventures[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic endorses Serbian telecommunications company Telekom Srbija and German nutritional supplement brand FitLine.[605]\n\n\nOn turning professional in 2003, Djokovic began wearing Adidas clothing. At the end of 2009, Djokovic signed a 10-year deal with the Italian clothing company Sergio Tacchini after Adidas refused to extend his clothing contract (choosing instead to sign Andy Murray).[606] Tacchini doesn't make shoes so Djokovic continued with Adidas as his choice of footwear. His sponsorship contract with Tacchini was incentive-heavy, and Djokovic's disproportionate success and dominance in 2011 caused the company to fall behind on bonus payments, leading to the termination of the sponsorship contract.[607][608]\n\n\nFrom 2011, Djokovic began to wear custom Red and Blue Adidas Barricade 6.0's shoes, referring to the colours of the Serbian national flag. By April 2012, the Tacchini deal had fallen first short and then apart. At that point, he was set to join forces with Nike, Inc.,[609] but instead, on 23 May 2012, Uniqlo appointed Djokovic as its global brand ambassador. The five-year sponsorship, reportedly worth €8 million per year,[610] began on 27 May 2012 in Paris' French Open tennis tournament. A year later, Djokovic's long-term footwear deal with Adidas was announced ahead of 2013 French Open.[611]\n\n\nIn August 2011, Djokovic became the brand ambassador of Swiss watch manufacturer Audemars Piguet.[612] Less than a month later, Djokovic signed a sponsorship deal with German car company Mercedes-Benz.[613] In March 2012, Djokovic was announced by Bombardier Aerospace as its latest Learjet brand ambassador, thus joining the likes of actor and pilot John Travolta, architect Frank Gehry, maestro Valery Gergiev, and classical pianist Lang Lang.[614] From January 2014 Djokovic has been endorsing French car manufacturer Peugeot.[615] At the same time he entered into an endorsement deal with Japanese watch manufacturer Seiko,[616] having just ended his affiliation with their rivals Audemars Piguet.[617] In early 2015, ahead of the Australian Open, Djokovic teamed up with Australian banking corporation ANZ for a social media campaign to raise money for local communities across the Asia Pacific region.[618][619] At the same time his partnership with Jacob's Creek, an Australian wine brand owned by Orlando Wines, was announced in regards to the production and distribution of 'Made By' film series, a documentary style content meant to \"show a side of Novak not seen before as he recounts never before told life stories from Belgrade, Serbia, celebrating what has made him the champion he is today\".[620]\n\n\nSince 2004, the business end of Djokovic's career has been handled by Israeli managers Amit Naor (former pro tennis player turned sports agent) and Allon Khakshouri, a duo which also had Marat Safin and Dinara Safina as its clients. In June 2008, after the duo entered into a partnership with CAA Sports, the sports division of Hollywood talent firm Creative Artists Agency, meaning that the famous company started representing tennis players for the first time,[621] Djokovic formally signed with CAA Sports.[622] After Djokovic's contract with CAA Sports expired during summer 2012, he decided to switch representation, announcing IMG Worldwide as his new representatives in December 2012.[623]\n\n\nOn 22 May 2017, Djokovic was unveiled as a brand ambassador of Lacoste after a five-year partnership with Uniqlo.[624]\n\n\nDuring the 2021 US Open, some people in Djokovic's player box wore hats and shirts bearing the logo of Raiffeisen Bank International, the central back of one of the two largest banking cooperatives in Austria. In April 2021, Djokovic became a brand ambassador for RBI and its subsidiaries in Central and Eastern Europe. The bank will help to support Djokovic's tennis academy in Belgrade.[625] Djokovic did not wear the RBI logo, but he did wear on his shirt the logo of UKG, an American workforce management and human resource management company. People in his box wore the logo on hats as well. UKG lists Djokovic as one of their sponsored athletes.[626]\n\n\n\n#### Investments[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, as Djokovic moved up the tennis rankings, he began venturing into the business world. Most of his activities in the business arena have been channeled through Family Sport, a legal entity in Serbia established and run by members of his immediate family. Registered as a limited liability company, Family Sport initially focused on hospitality, specifically the restaurant business, by launching Novak Café & Restaurant, a franchise developed on the theme of Djokovic's tennis success. Over time, the company, whose day-to-day operations are mostly handled by Novak's father Srdjan and uncle Goran, expanded its activities into real estate, sports/entertainment event organization, and sports apparel distribution.[627]\n\n\nThe company launched Novak Café & Restaurant in 2008 in the Belgrade municipality of Novi Beograd, the flagship location in a franchised chain of theme café-restaurants. During 2009, two more locations were added—one in Kragujevac and the other in Belgrade, the city's second, in September at the neighbourhood of Dorćol overlooking the playing courts of Serbia Open whose inaugural edition took place several months earlier.[628] On 16 December 2011 a location in Novi Sad was opened,[629] however, it operated just over three years before closing in late March 2015.[630] Banja Luka in neighbouring Bosnia got its Novak Café & Restaurant location on 16 October 2015 within Hotel Trešnja on Banj hill.[631][632]\n\n\nIn 2009, the company bought a 250-series ATP tournament known as the Dutch Open and moved it to Serbia where it was renamed the Serbia Open. With the help of Belgrade city authorities, the tournament's inaugural edition was held in May 2009 at the city-owned \"Milan Gale Muškatirović\" courts, located at an attractive spot in Dorćol neighbourhood.[633] The tournament folded in 2012 after four editions and its place in the ATP calendar got taken over by the Düsseldorf Open.\n\n\nIn May 2015, right after winning his fourth Rome Masters title, Djokovic launched a line of nutritional food products, called *Djokolife*.[634] On 10 April 2016, while in town for the Monte-Carlo Masters, Djokovic opened a vegan restaurant called Eqvita in Monte Carlo.[635] The restaurant reportedly closed in March 2019.[636]\n\n\nDjokovic has 80% stake in biotech firm QuantBioRes which claims to be developing a drug to treat patients who have contracted COVID-19.[637] Their research is based on electromagnetic frequency; one biomedical scientist likened it to homeopathy and argued that it \"does not reflect a contemporary understanding of how biochemistry works\", while Peter Collignon commented that their website \"describes a way of finding a new molecule without providing any evidence of success\".[638]\n\n\n\n### Professional Tennis Players Association[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Djokovic resigned from the Players Council of the Association of Tennis Professionals and formed the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) with Vasek Pospisil. The pair will serve as co-presidents of the new organisation to promote the interests of male and female tennis players above a ranking of 500 in singles and 200 in doubles.[639]\n\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nThroughout the latter part of the 2007 season, including before Wimbledon and during US Open, his comedic impressions of fellow contemporary tennis players received much media play.[640] It began when a BBC camera crew recorded some footage of the twenty-year-old impersonating Maria Sharapova, Rafael Nadal, Goran Ivanišević, and Lleyton Hewitt on a practice court at London's Queen's Club Championships just before Wimbledon.[641] The material — consisting of Djokovic imitating the said players by exaggerating their trademark physical gestures or nervous tics for the entertainment of his coaching team Marián Vajda and Mark Woodforde — aired during BBC's coverage of the tournament and subsequently became popular online.[642] Two months later at the US Open, a phone video shot by Argentine players of Djokovic doing locker room impressions of players such as Andy Roddick, Roger Federer, Filippo Volandri and Nadal made its way online, becoming viral.[641][643] A few days later, after beating Carlos Moyá in the quarterfinals, USA Network's on-court interviewer Michael Barkann asked Djokovic to perform some impressions and the player obliged by doing Sharapova and Nadal to the delight of the crowd.[641][644][645][646]\n\n\nIn addition to Djokovic, the national surge in the popularity of tennis was also inspired by three other up-and-coming young players: twenty-year-old Ana Ivanovic, twenty-two-year-old Jelena Janković, and twenty-three-year-old Janko Tipsarević as evidenced in early December 2007 when a sports-entertainment show named NAJJ Srbije (The Best of Serbia), put together in honour of the four players' respective successes in the 2007 season, drew a capacity crowd to Belgrade's Kombank Arena.[647][648] In May 2008, he was a special guest during the first semifinal of the Eurovision Song Contest, held in Belgrade that year. He threw a big tennis ball into the crowd, announcing the start of the voting and together with one of the show's co-presenters, Željko Joksimović, Djokovic sang Đorđe Marjanović's song \"Beograde\".[649]\n\n\nThroughout late April and early May 2009, during ATP Master Series tournaments in Rome and Madrid, respectively, the Serb was a guest on the *Fiorello Show* on Sky Uno hosted by Italian comedian Rosario Fiorello[650] followed by an appearance on Pablo Motos' show *El Hormiguero*.[651]\n\n\nDjokovic is also featured in the music video for the song \"Hello\" by Martin Solveig and Dragonette. The video, filmed at Stade Roland Garros, shows Solveig facing off against Bob Sinclar, another DJ, in a tennis match. When the referee calls a crucial ball \"Out\", Djokovic enters the arena and convinces the referee otherwise.[652] In 2010, the Serbian blues-rock band Zona B recorded the song \"The Joker\", dedicating it to Djokovic.[653][654]\n\n\n\n![](image)Djokovic with Emir Kusturica in Andrićgrad in January 2014, where he received Key to the City.\nOn 25 June 2011, at the Serbian National Defense Council's seventieth congress in Chicago, Djokovic was unanimously awarded the Order of Serbian National Defense in America I class – the highest decoration of the SND. The order was given to the twenty-four-year-old for his merits on the international sports scene and his contributions to the reputation of Serbs and Serbia around the world.[655] The day after winning his first Wimbledon title and reaching the No. 1 ranking for the first time in his career, Djokovic went home to Belgrade for a homecoming celebration in front of the Serbian National Assembly, an event attended by close to 100,000 people.[656]\n\n\nOn 28 November 2011, after returning from London where he finished early due to failing to progress out of his round-robin group, Djokovic visited his childhood tennis coach Jelena Genčić at her Belgrade home, bringing the Wimbledon trophy along.[657] The meeting, reportedly their first in more than four years, was recorded by two television crews – a Serbian one shooting for Aleksandar Gajšek's show *Agape* on Studio B television[658] and an American one from CBS television network filming material for Djokovic's upcoming piece on *60 Minutes*. The next day, 29 November 2011, on invitation from film producer Avi Lerner, Djokovic was part of the high-budget Hollywood movie production *The Expendables 2* in a cameo playing himself[659] that was shot in a warehouse in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia.[660] However, his bit part was later cut out of the final version of the movie.[661]\n\n\nIn March 2012, he was profiled on the CBS show *60 Minutes* by their correspondent Bob Simon. He was named amongst the 100 most influential people of 2012 by *TIME* magazine.[662]\n\n\nDjokovic has been a guest on late-night talk shows, such as *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*, *Veče sa Ivanom Ivanovićem*, *Conan*, *Late Night with Jimmy Fallon*, *Late Show with David Letterman*, *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, *The Jonathan Ross Show* and *The Ellen DeGeneres Show*.[663]\n\n\nIn April 2021, a team of Balkan biospeleologists named a recently discovered freshwater snail species *Travunijana djokovici* after Djokovic.[664]\n\n\nIn 2022, a book titled *Facing Novak Djokovic*, a compilation of interviews with ATP players who described in detail what it's like to compete against Djokovic, was published.[665]\n\n\nIn 2022, Nikola Vesović, a research associate at the University of Belgrade, announced that a new species of beetle in the genus *Duvalius* recently discovered near the town of Ljubovija, Serbia, had been named *Duvalius djokovici* after Djokovic.[666]\n\n\n\n### Views on diet, medicine and science[edit]\n\n\nSince 2010, he has been connected with the nutritionist Igor Četojević who additionally focuses on Chinese medicine and performs acupuncture.[570] He allegedly discovered that Djokovic suffers from gluten intolerance, using applied kinesiology, and that he should not eat gluten, removing it from his diet.[571] He eventually settled on a vegan diet, while later sometimes eating fish.[667] He also claims this vegan, plant-based diet cured his persistent allergies and mild asthma.[668] The gluten-free diet has been credited for improving his endurance on the court and playing a role in his subsequent success.[669][670]\n\n\nFollowing his elbow surgery in 2018, he stated that he \"cried for three days\" after it, feeling guilty, because he was \"not a fan of surgeries or medications\" and wanted \"to be as natural as possible\". He further stated that his belief that human \"bodies are self-healing mechanisms\".[671][672]\n\n\nIn his 2013 autobiography, *Serve to Win*, he wrote of a \"researcher\" who directed \"anger, fear, hostility\" at a glass of water, which turned \"slightly green\" after a few days, while also directing \"love, joy\" at another glass of water, which remained \"bright and crystal clear\" in the same period.[571][673] In 2020, Djokovic spoke of his belief that \"some people\" used \"prayer\" and \"gratitude\" to \"turn the most toxic food, or maybe most polluted water into the most healing water.\" He also claimed that \"scientists [have] proven\" that \"molecules in the water react to our emotions\" and speech.[674][675] Such claims are scientifically dubious,[676][677] and generally regarded as superstitious beliefs.[678]\n\n\n\n### Opposition to COVID-19 vaccine[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Australian Open § COVID-19 vaccination, visa controversies and other controversies\n\nDuring the ATP Tour's shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in a Facebook live stream with other Serbian athletes hosted in April 2020, Djokovic indicated he opposes vaccination and would not be forced to take a Covid vaccine just to be able to return to the Тour.[672][679] He later clarified his remarks by stating that he is not against all kinds of vaccines, but that he is against forced vaccination.[680] He added that he was extremely careful about what he puts into his body.[680]\n\n\nDjokovic's views came under increased scrutiny in late 2021, in the run-up to the 2022 Australian Open, after comments made by Australian government officials indicated that tennis players would need to be vaccinated to enter the tournament.[681] Prior to the tournament, Djokovic had refused to state publicly whether he was vaccinated or not, but had made comments stating his concern over the possibility of a hotel quarantine in Australia.[682] However, while being interviewed by the Australian Border Force in January 2022, Djokovic confirmed to the officer interviewing him that he was unvaccinated.[683]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"The principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Djokovic, on why he is willing to forgo playing major tournaments.\n\nSeveral commentators feel that Djokovic's stance against the COVID-19 vaccine could damage his placement among the all-time great tennis players as he would not be able to participate in the major tournaments where vaccination is required for entry[684][685][686][687][688][689] while others have applauded his view of having a choice.[690][691][692][693] He was unable to play the 2022 Australian Open, where he was the defending champion and the main favourite to win.[11][687] Shortly thereafter, he lost the No. 1 ranking he had held for a record 373 weeks. Due to the federal government's vaccination policy for non-US citizens, Djokovic was unable to enter the United States to play the 2022 US Open, another major tournament he was the favorite to win.[12]\n\n\nIn an interview with the BBC on 15 February 2022, a few weeks after the tournament, Djokovic stated he does not associate with the wider anti-vax movement. However, he believes in personal freedom of choice and supports an individual's right to choose whether or not they receive a vaccine. He re-affirmed sticking to his principles and refusal to receive a vaccine, saying that he would be willing to forego entry into tournaments which are held in countries mandating the vaccine even if it cost him his career records and placement among the all-time great players.[10]\n\n\n\n### Faith and religious beliefs[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic is a member of the Serbian Orthodox Church. On 28 April 2011, Patriarch Irinej of Serbia awarded Djokovic the Order of St. Sava I class, the highest decoration of the Serbian Orthodox Church, for his contributions to monasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo and charitable work in Serbia.[694] He has said that he admired and held in high regard Bishop Amfilohije, who played a key part in helping him through a tough time during the Yugoslav Wars.[695]\n\n\nDjokovic has been reported to meditate for up to an hour a day at the Buddhist Buddhapadipa Temple in Wimbledon as he appreciates the natural setting and serenity, and is close to monks in the complex.[696] He has spoken of the positive power of meditation.[697][698][699] He is frequent visitor of Bosnian town of Visoko and its park that is host to several meditation platforms.[700]\n\n\n\n### Support of sport and sportspeople[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic is a fan of Serbian football club Red Star,[701] Italian club Milan,[702] and Portuguese club Benfica,[703] as well as Serbian basketball club Red Star.[704][705] He has also shown public support for Croatia at the 2018 FIFA World Cup and when faced with criticism from some within his native country of Serbia, Djokovic replied that \"sports have their 'universal language,' they erase boundaries between people, [and] overcome differences in religion, race and nationality.\"[706][707][708] Djokovic has expressed admiration for Croatian football player Luka Modrić, who plays for Real Madrid.[709][710][711] He is a friend of former Serbian tennis player Ana Ivanovic, whom he has known since the two were children growing up in Serbia.[712]\n\n\nDjokovic is a member of the \"Champions for Peace\" club, a group of elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport. It was created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization.[713]\n\n\n\n### Political statements[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Djokovic's victory over Aleksandar Kovacevic in the first round of the 2023 French Open, Djokovic wrote \"Kosovo is the heart of Serbia. Stop the violence\" on the lens of a camera, in response to the recent clashes in Kosovo. The political statement was criticized as inappropriate by France's minister of sports Amélie Oudéa-Castéra.[714]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Novak Djokovic career

Djokovic has been ranked No. 1 for a record total of 400 weeks in a record 13 different years, and finished as the year-end No. 1 a record eight times.[7] Djokovic has won an all-time record 24 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record ten Australian Open titles. Overall, he has won 98 singles titles, including a record 71 Big Titles: 24 majors, a record 40 Masters, and a record seven ATP Finals. Djokovic is the only man in tennis history to be the reigning champion of all four majors at once across three different surfaces. In singles, he is the only man to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam, and the only player to complete a career Golden Masters, a feat he has achieved twice. \n\n\nDjokovic began his professional career in 2003. In 2008, at age 20, he disrupted Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal's streak of 11 consecutive majors by winning his first major title at the Australian Open. By 2010, Djokovic had begun to separate himself from the rest of the field and, as a result, the trio of Federer, Nadal and him was referred to as the \"Big Three\" among fans and commentators. In 2011, Djokovic ascended to No. 1 for the first time, winning three majors and a then-record five Masters titles while going 10–1 against Nadal and Federer. He remained the most successful player in men's tennis for the rest of the decade.[8] In 2015, Djokovic had his most successful season, reaching a single-season record 15 consecutive finals, winning a season-record 10 Big Titles while having a record 31 victories over the top-10 players.[9] His dominant run extended through to the 2016 French Open, where he completed his first Career Grand Slam and a non-calendar year Grand Slam, becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four majors simultaneously and setting a rankings points record of 16,950. In 2017, Djokovic suffered from an elbow injury that weakened his results until the 2018 Wimbledon Championships, where he won the title while ranked No. 21 in the world. Djokovic has continued to be a dominant force on the tour since then, winning 12 major titles and completing his second and third Career Grand Slams. Due to his opposition to COVID-19 vaccine, Djokovic was forced to skip many tournaments in 2022,[10] notably the Australian Open and the US Open; two major events he was the favourite to win.[11][12] One year after the Australian visa controversy, Djokovic made a successful comeback to reclaim the 2023 Australian Open trophy,[13] and shortly after he claimed the French Open to take the outright record for most men's singles majors won in history.[14]\n\n\nRepresenting Serbia, Djokovic led the national tennis team to its first Davis Cup title in 2010, and to the inaugural ATP Cup title in 2020. He also won the bronze medal for his country at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Djokovic is a recipient of the Order of St. Sava, the Order of Karađorđe's Star, and the Order of the Republika Srpska. His other awards include being named the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year four times (2012, 2015, 2016 and 2019) and the 2011 BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year.[15][16]\n\n\nBeyond competition, Djokovic was elected as the president of the ATP Player Council in 2016. He stepped down in 2020 to front a new player-only tennis association; the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) founded by him and Vasek Pospisil, citing the need for players to have more influence on the tour and advocating better prize money structure for lower ranked players.[17][18] Djokovic is an active philanthropist. He is the founder of Novak Djokovic Foundation, which is committed to supporting children from disadvantaged communities.[19] Djokovic was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2015.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nNovak Djokovic was born on 22 May 1987 in Belgrade, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia, to Dijana (née Žagar) and Srdjan Djokovic. He is of paternal Serbian and maternal Croatian descent.[21] His two younger brothers, Marko and Djordje, have also played professional tennis.[22]\n\n\nDjokovic began playing tennis at the age of four,[22] after his parents gave him a mini-racket and a soft foam ball, which his father claimed became \"the most beloved toy in his life\".[23] His parents then sent him to a tennis camp in Novi Sad.[23][24] In the summer of 1993, as a six-year-old, he was sent to a tennis camp organized by the Teniski Klub Partizan[24] and overseen by Yugoslav tennis player Jelena Genčić[24][25] at Mount Kopaonik, where Djokovic's parents ran a fast-food parlour.[23][26][27] Genčić worked with Djokovic over the following six years, convincing him to hit his backhand with two hands instead of the single hand used by his idol, Pete Sampras.[2][26][28] Djokovic has credited Genčić for \"shaping my mind as a human being, but also as a professional\".[29][30]\n\n\nDuring the Yugoslav Wars in the late 1990s, Djokovic had to endure embargoes[30] and NATO bombings[22][26] but that fear and exhaustion made him tougher and drove him to pursue tennis with greater determination.[22][31] At one point he had to train inside a disused swimming pool converted into a tennis court.[32] Due to his rapid development, Genčić contacted Nikola Pilić and in September 1999 Djokovic moved to the Pilić tennis academy in Oberschleißheim, Germany, spending four years there.[2][26][33] Pilić made him serve against a wall for several months to improve his technique, and he had him working with a rubber exercise band for a year to improve flexibility in his wrist.[26] One of the players he trained with at the Niki Pilić academy was future world No. 10 Ernests Gulbis, with whom he allegedly had a fiery rivalry.[34][35]\n\n\nHis father also took him to train at academies in the United States, Italy and Germany.[23] Because of the high cost of traveling and training his father took out high-interest loans to help pay for his son's tennis education, putting Djokovic under immense pressure to deliver.[23][26][29][30] He believes the impact this had on him could be the reason behind his prowess under pressure.[24][26]\n\n\nHe met his future wife, Jelena Ristić, in high school, and began dating her in 2005.[36] The two became engaged in September 2013,[37] and on 10 July 2014 the couple were married on Sveti Stefan in Montenegro.[38][39] He and Ristić had their first child, a boy, in October 2014.[40][41] Their daughter was born in 2017.[42]\n\n\nDjokovic is a self-described fan of languages, speaking Serbian, English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.[43][44][45][46]\n\n\n\n## Tennis career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Novak Djokovic Singles Ranking History Chart\n![](image)Singles Ranking Composite History Chart (Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic)\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\n#### 2001–2003: Juniors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, Djokovic dominated the U14 circuit in the ETA Junior Tour, currently known as the Tennis Europe Junior Tour.[47] After a poor start to the season, being eliminated from the prestigious Petits As tournament in the quarterfinals by the eventual runner-up and future rival Andy Murray, 6–0, 6–1;[47][48] Djokovic returned to form in April 2001, in Italy, where he won his first ETA title in a second category tournament in Messina, defeating his compatriot Bojan Božović in the final, and also reached the final of a first category tournament in Arezzo, which he lost to Mischa Zverev.[47][49] In May, the 14-year-old Djokovic decided to try two ETA tournaments played in the 16-age group, which took place in Turin and Milan, winning the doubles event of the latter alongside Viktor Troicki.[47] Djokovic then won his second ETA singles tournament of the season in Livorno[47] after beating the No. 1 seed Murray in the semifinals, and the No. 2 seed Aljoscha Thron in the final, 5–7, 7–5, 6–4.[50]\n\n\nIn July, Djokovic was the No. 1 seed at the U14 European championship, held in Sanremo, where he became only the fourth player in the competition's history to win both the singles and doubles tournaments, beating Lukáš Lacko in three sets in the singles final,[51] and pairing with Božović in doubles, beating Russia's Alexandre Krasnoroutskiy and Mikhail Bekker in the final.[52][53] As a member of the Yugoslav national team, Djokovic reached the final of the 2001 ITF World Junior Championship for players under 14, in which he lost his match in singles to Germany's Aljoscha Thron.[54][55] Djokovic also led the Serbian team to victory in the European Summer Cup,[47] thus ending the year as a European champion in singles, doubles and in team competition, while also winning the silver medal at the World Junior Championship in a team competition for Yugoslavia.[2][22] Djokovic ended 2001 at the top of the ETA rankings for U14s, one place ahead of Murray at No. 2.[47]\n\n\nIn 2002, Djokovic continued his dominance, now in the under 16 circuit, winning prestigious tournaments such as *La Boule* and *La Poet* in France, Prince's Cup in Miami,[56] as well as his first-ever ITF tournament, which was played at just twenty kilometers away from his home in Belgrade, in the small town of Pančevo.[2] He entered the tournament as a wild card and won all of his matches in straight sets, some of which against rivals three years older than him, including the No. 1 seed David Savić in the final, 6–2, 6–2.[57] At 16, after winning five ITF tournaments, he was ranked the 40th best junior tennis player in the world.[22]\n\n\nIn juniors, he compiled a singles win-loss record of 40–11 (and 23–6 in doubles), reaching a combined junior world ranking of No. 24 in February 2004.[58] At the junior Grand Slam events, his best showing was at the Australian Open where he reached the semifinals in 2004. He also played at the French Open and US Open junior events in 2003.[59]\n\n\n\n#### 2003–2005: Start of professional career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Djokovic turned professional and began competing on the ATP Tour, around the time Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal had established themselves as the two dominant players in men's tennis.[60] At the beginning of his professional career, he mainly played in Futures and Challenger tournaments, winning three of each type from 2003 to 2005. His first tour-level tournament was the Croatia Open Umag in July 2004, where he qualified for the main draw and lost to Filippo Volandri in the first round.[61]\n\n\nIn January 2005, Djokovic made his Grand Slam debut at the Australian Open, where he defeated future rival Stan Wawrinka in the second round of the qualifying competition. In the first round of the main draw, he was defeated by eventual champion Marat Safin in straight sets[62][63] Later that year, Djokovic won his first Grand Slam match at the French Open, and went on to reach the third round of both Wimbledon and the US Open, coming back from two sets down and saving multiple match points to defeat Guillermo García López in the former, and beating Gaël Monfils and Mario Ančić in the latter. Djokovic participated in four Masters events and qualified for two of them, his best performance coming in Paris, where he reached the third round and defeated fourth seed Mariano Puerta along the way.[64] He finished the year ranked No. 78, the youngest player in the top 100.[44]\n\n\n\n#### 2006: Maiden Grand Slam quarterfinal and first ATP titles[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 April 2006, Djokovic clinched a decisive Davis Cup win against Great Britain by defeating Greg Rusedski in four sets in the fourth match of the tie, giving Serbia and Montenegro an insurmountable 3–1 lead in their best-of-five series, thus keeping the country in the Group One Euro/African Zone of Davis Cup. Afterwards, Djokovic briefly considered moving from Serbia to play for Great Britain.[65] The British media spoke of Djokovic's family negotiating with the Lawn Tennis Association about changing his international loyalty by joining British tennis ranks.[65] The 18-year-old Djokovic, who was ranked 64th in the world, initially dismissed the story by saying that the talks were not serious, describing them as \"the British being very kind to us after the Davis Cup.\"[66] However, more than three years later, in October 2009, Djokovic confirmed that the talks between his family and the LTA throughout April and May 2006 were indeed serious:\n\n\n\n\n> Britain was offering me a lot of opportunities and they needed someone because Andy [Murray] was the only one, and still is. That had to be a disappointment for all the money they invest. But I didn't need the money as much as I had done. I had begun to make some for myself, enough to afford to travel with a coach, and I said, \"Why the heck?\" I am Serbian, I am proud of being a Serbian, I didn't want to spoil that just because another country had better conditions. If I had played for Great Britain, of course I would have played exactly as I do for my country but deep inside, I would never have felt that I belonged. I was the one who took the decision.[67]\n> \n> \n\nDjokovic reached his first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the French Open as the world No. 63, after upsetting ninth-ranked Fernando González in the second round.[68] In the quarterfinals, he faced Rafael Nadal, the first-ever meeting of their historic rivalry, which Nadal won via a retirement from Djokovic after Nadal took the first two sets.[68] This deep run at Roland-Garros saw him reach the top 40 in the world singles rankings. At Wimbledon, he reached the fourth round, losing to seventh seed Mario Ančić in five sets.[69]\n\n\nThree weeks after Wimbledon, Djokovic won his maiden ATP title at the Dutch Open in Amersfoort without losing a set, defeating Nicolás Massú in the final.[68] He won his second career title at the Moselle Open in Metz, France, defeating Jürgen Melzer in the final, and moved into the top 20.[68][70] He also reached his first career Masters quarterfinal at Madrid during the indoor hardcourt season.[71] Djokovic finished the year ranked No. 16, the youngest player in the top 20.[72]\n\n\n\n#### 2007: First Masters titles, first Major final & breaking top 3[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic began 2007 by defeating Australian Chris Guccione in the Adelaide final, before losing in the fourth round of the Australian Open to eventual champion Roger Federer[73] in straight sets. His performances at the Masters Series events in Indian Wells, and Miami, where he was the runner-up and champion respectively, pushed him into the world's top 10.[68] Djokovic lost the Indian Wells final to Rafael Nadal, but defeated Nadal in Key Biscayne in the quarterfinals before going on to defeat Guillermo Cañas in the final to win his maiden Masters Series title.[74][75] In doing so, he became the youngest player to ever win the tournament and the first teenager to win the event since Andre Agassi in 1990.[68][75]\n\n\nDjokovic then returned to Serbia to help his country enter the Davis Cup World Group[76] in a match against Georgia. He won a point by defeating Georgia's George Chanturia.[76] Later, he played in the Monte-Carlo Masters, where he was defeated by David Ferrer in the third round, and at the Estoril Open, where he defeated Richard Gasquet in the final.[77] Djokovic then reached the quarterfinals of both the Italian Open in Rome, where he lost to Nadal, and the Hamburg Masters, where he was defeated by Carlos Moyá. At the French Open, Djokovic reached his first major semifinal, losing to eventual champion Nadal.[78]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, Djokovic won a five-hour quarterfinal against Marcos Baghdatis to reach his first Wimbledon semi-final.[79] At the time, the match had lasted just 5 minutes shy of the longest Wimbledon match played in a single day. After the match, Baghdatis stated that playing against Djokovic was “a bit like facing Andre Agassi. He is just making you move from one place to another”.[80] Djokovic started his semifinal match against Nadal with nearly 17 hours on court, and ended up retiring with elbow problems in the third set, after winning the first and losing the second set.[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)Djokovic during his first round match at the 2007 US Open.\nDjokovic's next tournament was the Canadian Open in Montreal, and he defeated No. 3 Andy Roddick in the quarterfinals, No. 2 Nadal in the semifinals, and No. 1 Federer in the final. This was the first time a player had defeated the top three ranked players in one tournament since Boris Becker in 1994.[82] Djokovic was also only the second player, after Tomáš Berdych, to have defeated both Federer and Nadal since they became the top two players in the world. After this tournament, Björn Borg stated that Djokovic \"is definitely a contender to win a Grand Slam (tournament).\"[83] The following week at the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic lost in the second round to Moyà in straight sets. Nevertheless, he went on to reach the final of the US Open, where he had five set points in the first set and two in the second set, but lost them all before losing the match in straight sets to the top-seeded Federer.[84]\n\n\nDjokovic won his fifth title of the year at the BA-CA TennisTrophy in Vienna, defeating Stanislas Wawrinka in the final. His next tournament was the Madrid Masters, where he lost to David Nalbandian in the semifinals. Djokovic, assured of finishing the year ranked No. 3, qualified for the year-ending championships, but did not advance beyond the round robin matches. He received the Golden Badge award for the best athlete in Serbia, and the Olympic Committee of Serbia declared him the best athlete in the country.[85]\n\n\nDjokovic played a key role in the 2007 play-off win over Australia by winning all his matches and helping promote the Serbia Davis Cup team to the 2008 World Group.[86] In Serbia's tie against Russia in Moscow in early 2008, Djokovic was sidelined due to influenza and missed his first singles match. He returned to win his doubles match, teaming with Nenad Zimonjić, before retiring during his singles match with Nikolay Davydenko.[87]\n\n\n\n#### 2008: First Major title, two Masters & first Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\nDjokovic started his preparations for the season by playing the Hopman Cup with fellow Serbian world No. 3 Jelena Janković where he won all of his four singles matches, including in the final against the United States, where he beat Mardy Fish in a deciding set tiebreak to level the tie, but then losing the decisive mixed doubles rubber,[88] in which he faced former WTA No. 1 Serena Williams in a competitive event for the first time.[89] At the Australian Open, Djokovic reached his second consecutive Grand Slam final, this time without dropping a set, including a victory over two-time defending champion Federer in the semifinals.[90] By reaching the semifinals, Djokovic became the youngest player in the Open Era to have reached the semifinals in all four Grand Slam events.[91] In the final, Djokovic defeated unseeded Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in four sets to earn his first Grand Slam singles title.[92] This marked the first time since the 2005 Australian Open that a Grand Slam singles title was not won by Federer or Nadal.[92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Djokovic celebrating Australian Open triumph in Belgrade.\nDjokovic's next tournament was the Dubai Championships, where he lost in the semifinals to Roddick. At the Indian Wells Masters, Djokovic won his ninth career singles title, defeating Mardy Fish in the final.[93] Djokovic won his tenth career singles title and fourth Master Series singles crown at the Italian Open in Rome after defeating Wawrinka in the final.[94] The following week he lost to Nadal in the semifinals at the Hamburg Masters. At the French Open, Djokovic was the third-seeded player behind Federer and Nadal. He lost to Nadal in the semifinals in straight sets.[95]\n\n\nOn grass, Djokovic once again played Nadal, this time in the Artois Championships final in Queen's Club, where he lost in two sets. Djokovic entered Wimbledon seeded third but lost in the second round to Marat Safin, ending a streak of five consecutive majors where he had reached at least the semifinals.[96]\n\n\nDjokovic then failed to defend his 2007 singles title at the Rogers Cup in Toronto, where he was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Andy Murray. The following week at the Cincinnati Masters, Djokovic advanced to the final, beating Nadal in the semifinals, which not only ended the Spaniard's 32-match winning streak, but also delayed Nadal's first ascension to world No. 1 by a week.[97] In the final, he again lost to Murray in straight sets. His next tournament was the 2008 Summer Olympics, his first Olympics. He and Nenad Zimonjić, seeded second in men's doubles, were eliminated in the first round by the Czech pairing of Martin Damm and Pavel Vízner. Seeded third in singles, Djokovic lost in the semifinals to Nadal. Djokovic then defeated James Blake, the loser of the other semifinal, in the bronze medal match.[98]\n\n\nAfter the Olympics, Djokovic entered the US Open seeded third, where he defeated Roddick in the quarterfinals. To a smattering of boos in a post-match interview, Djokovic criticized Roddick for accusing him of making excessive use of the trainer during matches and for suggesting that he was faking his injuries.[99] His run at the US Open ended in the semifinals when he lost to Federer in four sets, in a rematch of the previous year's final. In November, Djokovic was the second seed at the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, beating Juan Martín del Potro and Nikolay Davydenko in the round-robin stage, and Gilles Simon in the semifinals. In the final, Djokovic defeated Davydenko to win his first title at the year-end championship.[100]\n\n\n\n#### 2009: Ten finals, five titles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2009 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\nDjokovic started the year at the Brisbane International, where he was upset by fellow Pilić academy trainee Ernests Gulbis in the first round.[101] As defending champion at the Australian Open, Djokovic retired from his quarterfinal match with former world No. 1 Andy Roddick, primarily due to heat illness that generated muscle aches and cramps.[102][103] After losing in the semifinals of the Open 13 tournament in Marseille to Tsonga, Djokovic won the singles title at the Dubai Championships, defeating Ferrer to claim his twelfth career title.[104] The following week, Djokovic was the defending champion at the Indian Wells Masters but lost to Roddick in the quarterfinals.

In the final, he defeated home favourite and three-time defending champion Federer to win his fourth title of the year.[115] Djokovic won his first Masters title of the year at the Paris Masters after defeating Nadal in the semifinals, and outlasting Gaël Monfils in a decisive set tiebreak in the final.[116]\n\n\nEven though he came into the year-ending ATP Finals in London on a 10-match winning streak and as the defending champion, Djokovic failed to make it out from the round-robin stage despite beating both Davydenko and Nadal due to having fewer sets.[117] Djokovic ended the year as the No. 3 for the third consecutive year, having played 97 matches, the most of any player on the ATP Tour, which earned him the Ironman nickname, with a 78–19 win–loss record. In addition to leading the ATP Tour in match wins, he reached a career-best ten finals, winning five titles.[118]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\n#### 2010: US Open final & Davis Cup crown[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\nAfter playing nearly a hundred matches in 2009, Djokovic stated that he was \"fed up with matches\", so he decided not to play any ranking tournaments before the Australian Open, thus starting his year by playing in the AAMI Classic, an exhibition event, where he beat Tommy Haas, but lost to Fernando Verdasco and teenager Bernard Tomic.[118] At the Australian Open, Djokovic lost a five-setter to Tsonga in the quarterfinals.[119] Despite the loss, he attained a career-high ranking of No. 2 and went on to reach the semifinals in Rotterdam, where he lost to Mikhail Youzhny.

Djokovic again lost to Verdasco at the Italian Open in Rome, this time in the quarterfinals.[123] As the defending champion at his hometown event, the Serbia Open in Belgrade, he withdrew in the quarterfinals while trailing No. 319 Filip Krajinović,[124] the lowest-ranked player to ever beat Djokovic as well as the only time that Djokovic lost to a player outside the Top 200.[125] Djokovic entered the French Open seeded third, where he lost to Jürgen Melzer in five sets, marking the only time he lost a match at a major after leading two sets to love.[126] Djokovic then won the first ATP doubles titles of his career at the Aegon Championships, pairing with Jonathan Erlich to beat Karol Beck and David Škoch in the final.[127] In Wimbledon, he lost in the semifinals to Tomáš Berdych in straight sets.[128]\n\n\nDjokovic then competed at the Canadian Open in Toronto, where he lost to Federer in the semifinals.

This had not happened since 1976, when Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe as No. 1 and No. 2 paired together as a doubles team.[129] They lost in the first round to Canadians Milos Raonic and Vasek Pospisil. Djokovic then lost to Roddick in the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Masters.[130] As the third seed at the US Open, Djokovic came very close to losing in his opening round against Viktor Troicki in extreme heat. He then defeated Philipp Petzschner, James Blake, Mardy Fish, and Gaël Monfils, all in straight sets, to reach the US Open semifinals for the fourth consecutive year. There, he defeated Federer in five sets after saving two match points with forehand winners while serving to stay in the match at 4–5 in the fifth set. It was Djokovic's first victory over Federer at the US Open in four attempts, and his first victory over Federer in a Major since the 2008 Australian Open.

Serbia came from 1–2 down to defeat France in the final tie 3–2 in Belgrade to win the nation's first Davis Cup Championship. In the final, Djokovic scored two singles points for Serbia, defeating Gilles Simon and Gaël Monfils.[133] He was the backbone of the Serbian squad, going 7–0 in singles rubbers to lead the nation to the title, although the honour of winning the deciding rubber in the final went to compatriot Viktor Troicki. This two singles rubbers wins started a long unbeaten run that went on into 2011. Djokovic finished the year ranked No. 3, his fourth successive finish at this position. He was awarded the title \"Serbian Sportsman of the year\" by the Olympic Committee of Serbia and \"Serbian Athlete of the year\" by DSL Sport.[134]\n\n\n\n#### 2011: Rise to the top in one of the greatest seasons in history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n![Novak Djokovic celebrates his 2011 Wimbledon semi-final win over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

He also reached his first-ever Wimbledon final, which he eventually won.](image)Djokovic celebrates upon defeating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals of the 2011 Wimbledon Championships, clinching the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in his career.\nDjokovic began his season by winning the Australian Open. He only dropped one set en route to the title, beating Federer in the semifinals and Murray in the final to capture his second Australian Open title and his first grand slam in three years.[135][136]\n\n\nHe next competed at the Dubai Championships and beat Federer in the final in straight sets.[137] Two weeks later, Djokovic won his second Indian Wells title after beating Federer in the semifinals and Nadal in the final, both in three sets, thus becoming only the third player to beat Nadal and Federer in the same tournament twice, joining Nikolay Davydenko and David Nalbandian.[138][139] In Miami, Djokovic once again beat Nadal in the finals in three sets, with the final set being decided in a tiebreak.[140] After winning the Serbia Open, Djokovic won the Madrid and Italian Opens, beating Nadal in straight sets in both finals.[141][142] Beating Nadal in back-to-back matches on clay was a notable reversal due to the fact that he had previously lost all nine matches played against Nadal on clay.[142]\n\n\nHe continued his good form on clay at the French Open by dropping only one set en route to the semifinal, which he lost to Federer. This loss marked Djokovic's first defeat of the season (with Federer also being the last man to defeat Djokovic in 2010), ending a 43-match win streak, which included a 41–0 start to 2011.[143][144] Five weeks later at Wimbledon, Djokovic replaced Nadal as the world No. 1 and then defeated him in a four set final to take his first Wimbledon title.[145][146]\n\n\nIn Canada, Djokovic won his single-season record-breaking fifth Masters title with a three-set win over Mardy Fish in the final.[147] At the US Open, Djokovic beat Federer and Nadal on the way to the title, thus becoming only the second player to defeat both of them in the same Major event after Juan Martín del Potro in the 2009 US Open.[148] Djokovic saved match points en route to the title, saving two against Federer in the semifinals to complete a comeback from two sets down,[149][150] thus becoming just the second player to beat Federer from two sets down after Tsonga a few months earlier in Wimbledon.[151] Djokovic's crosscourt forehand return winner to save the first match point is widely regarded as one of the greatest shots in US Open history as well as one of the greatest returns in tennis history.[152][153] This was the second consecutive US Open where Djokovic saved two match points against Federer to reach the final, and the fifth consecutive US Open where Djokovic and Federer played each other.[149] Djokovic played Nadal in their second successive major final, winning the match in four sets and taking his first US Open title.[154][155][156]\n\n\nWith the victory, Djokovic extended his season record to an impressive 64–2.[155] However, his level dropped toward the season's end, beginning with a back injury sustained during the US Open which caused him to retire from the Davis Cup, and ending with a poor showing at the ATP Finals, in which he lost to David Ferrer and Janko Tipsarević, but saved match point against Tomáš Berdych to seal his 70th and final win of the year.[157] Djokovic concluded the season with a 70–6 record and a year-end ranking of No. 1. He was named the 2011 ITF World Champion.[158]\n\n\nIn total, Djokovic won ten tournaments in 2011,[27] including three Grand Slam tournament victories at the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open.[27] He also captured a then-record-breaking five ATP Masters titles,[27][159] and won $12.6 million on the ATP Tour.[27] Djokovic lost only two matches from the start of the season until the final match of the US Open in September, going 10–1 against Nadal and Federer, the other two best players of the year, including 6–0 against Nadal, all in Big Title finals.[160] Djokovic also had the most dominant record versus a world No. 1 for a single season, going 5–0 against Nadal before overtaking him as the world No. 1.\n\n\nPete Sampras declared Djokovic's 2011 season as the best he had seen in his lifetime, calling it \"one of the best achievements in all of the sports.\"[161] Boris Becker called Djokovic's season \"one of the very best years in tennis of all time\", noting that it \"may not be the best statistically, but he's beaten Federer, he's beaten Nadal, he's beaten everybody that came around to challenge him in the biggest tournaments in the world.\"[162] Rafael Nadal, who lost to Djokovic in six finals on hard, clay and grass courts, described Djokovic's performances as \"probably the highest level of tennis that I ever saw.\"[163]\n\n\n\n#### 2012: Australian Open title, three Masters & Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\nDjokovic began his season by winning the Australian Open. In the quarterfinals, he defeated David Ferrer in three sets. In the semifinal, Djokovic beat Andy Murray in five sets after 4 hours and 50 minutes, recovering from a two-sets-to-one deficit and fending off break points at 5-all in the fifth set.[164] In the final, Djokovic beat Rafael Nadal in five sets, recovering from losing the first set and then a break down in the final set to win 7–5. At 5 hours and 53 minutes, the match was the longest Grand Slam final in Open Era history, as well as the longest match in Australian Open history, surpassing the 5-hour and 14-minute 2009 semifinal between Nadal and Fernando Verdasco.[165]\n\n\nDjokovic was beaten by John Isner in the semifinals at Indian Wells. He successfully defended his title in Miami after beating Murray in the final.[166] In the Monte Carlo final, he lost in straight sets to Nadal.

This meant he became only the second man to have won against Nadal at the French Open. However, he lost the next match and the tournament to No. 8 seed Stan Wawrinka in four sets.[230] Five weeks later, he rebounded again from the tough loss in Paris, just like 2014, coming from two sets down to beat Kevin Anderson in the fourth round, and then going on to claim his third Wimbledon title, with a four-set win over Roger Federer.[231]\n\n\nPrior to the final Grand Slam event of the year, Djokovic had the chance to become the first man in history to complete the full set of Masters titles in Cincinnati, achieving the Career Golden Masters, but he lost the final to Federer (Djokovic would accomplish the feat at the 2018 and 2020 events).[232] At the US Open, Djokovic reached the final for the sixth time in his career, achieving the feat of reaching all four Grand Slam finals in a single calendar year.

The 2015 season is Djokovic's most successful season as of 2022, and it is considered one of the greatest seasons in tennis history.[237]\n\n\n\n#### 2016: Historic 'Nole Slam', four Masters & ranking points record[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n![](image)Djokovic kissing Coupe des Mousquetaires after winning the 2016 French Open, completing \"Nole Slam\" and his first career Grand Slam.\nDjokovic collected his 60th career title in Doha, defeating Rafael Nadal in two sets in a final that lasted 73 minutes.

Djokovic's run was so dominant that the world no. 2 and 3 (Andy Murray and Roger Federer) could have combined their points and still not have had enough to pass him in the rankings.[239]\n\n\nOn 3 April 2016, Djokovic won the Miami Open for the third consecutive year, and did so without dropping a set en route to his sixth career Miami Open title, tying him with Andre Agassi for most ever Miami Open men's singles titles.[240] In addition, the victory marked the fourth year Djokovic completed the Sunshine Double in his career, the most Sunshine Doubles out of any player in history, and 2016 being the third consecutive year that Djokovic completed it. His win in Miami also saw Djokovic surpass Roger Federer to become the all-time leading prize money winner on the ATP tour with career earnings of $98.2 million.[241] After an early round exit at the Monte-Carlo Masters,[242] Djokovic quickly bounced back by winning the Madrid title for the second time in his career, with a three-set victory over Murray.[243] They met again in the Rome Masters final one week later with Murray as the victor; despite a sluggish performance, Djokovic defeated Nadal and Kei Nishikori in two long quarterfinals and semifinals.[244]\n\n\nDjokovic defeated Andy Murray in the final of the French Open in four sets, making him the reigning champion of all four major tournaments, a historic feat the media dubbed the Nole Slam.[245][246] With his French Open triumph, Djokovic became the eighth player in history to achieve a Career Grand Slam, the third player in history after Don Budge and Rod Laver to hold all four Grand Slam titles at the same time, and the first player to win $100 million in prize money.[247] The victory at Roland Garros brought his ATP ranking points up to a new record of 16,950.[248][249] At Wimbledon, his major win streak came to an end in the third-round when he lost to American Sam Querrey in four sets. It was his earliest exit in a Grand Slam since the 2009 French Open.[250]\n\n\nIn late July, Djokovic returned to form by winning his fourth Canadian Open title, and 30th Masters title overall, without dropping a set.[251] In August, Djokovic was beaten in the first round of the Olympic men's singles in Rio de Janeiro by Juan Martín del Potro. It was Djokovic's first opening round defeat since January 2009, when Ernest Gulbis defeated him at the 2009 Brisbane International.[252][253] In the final slam of the year, the US Open, Djokovic advanced to the final but was defeated by Stan Wawrinka in four sets.[254] Djokovic was defeated by Roberto Bautista Agut and Marin Čilić in the semifinals and quarterfinals of Shanghai and Paris. Due to this result, he lost the No. 1 ranking to Andy Murray.[255] However, a runner-up finish at the ATP Finals indicated his best performances in nearly three months. After the season, he parted ways with his coach of three years, Boris Becker.[256]\n\n\n\n#### 2017: Split with team and long injury hiatus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2017 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\nIn January, Djokovic defended his title in Doha after defeating the new world No. 1 Andy Murray. At the Australian Open, he was upset in the second round by world No. 117 Denis Istomin.

In April, Djokovic reached the quarterfinals of the Monte-Carlo Masters, losing to David Goffin. After the tournament, he chose to split with his long-time coach Marián Vajda, fitness specialist Gebhard Phil-Gritsch, and physiotherapist Miljan Amanović, citing the need to find a winning spark. A better showing at the Madrid Masters saw Djokovic reach the semifinals, losing to Nadal in straight sets.[258] A runner-up result at the Rome Masters indicated improvement in his form.\n\n\nOn 21 May 2017, Djokovic announced that Andre Agassi would become his new coach, starting at the French Open. However, as the defending champion, he lost in the quarterfinals to Dominic Thiem.[259] He began the grass court season at the Eastbourne International, playing his first non-Wimbledon tournament on grass since 2010.

Although Federer was riding a streak of 100 consecutive holds of serve at the tournament,[276] dating back to the 2014 final,[277] Djokovic broke his serve three times to win his first Cincinnati Masters title. With this victory, Djokovic became the first (and, as of 2022, only) player in tennis history to complete the Career Golden Masters — winning all nine ATP Masters events at least once in one's career.[278]\n\n\nDjokovic was the sixth seed at the US Open.

Djokovic also competed in mixed doubles partnering Nina Stojanović; the pair lost in the semifinals to Aslan Karatsev and Elena Vesnina, then withdrew from their bronze medal match against WTA singles No. 1 Ashleigh Barty and John Peers, with Djokovic citing a shoulder injury.[342][343]\n\n\nDjokovic then entered the US Open vying to be the third man in history to achieve the Grand Slam in men's singles.[344] In the third round, Djokovic faced Kei Nishikori and lost the first set, but won the next three sets to advance; he repeated this pattern against Jenson Brooksby[345] and Matteo Berrettini. In the semifinals, he defeated Alexander Zverev in five sets, to advance to his record-equaling 31st major final.[346] There, he faced Daniil Medvedev but lost in straight sets, ending his chances of achieving the Grand Slam.[347]\n\n\nAt the Paris Masters, Djokovic defeated Hubert Hurkacz to reach the final, which secured the year-end No. 1 ranking for the seventh time, breaking Pete Sampras' all-time record. In the final, he avenged his US Open loss to Daniil Medvedev to win his sixth Paris Masters title and record 37th ATP Masters title overall.[348] At the 2021 ATP Finals, Djokovic was defeated in the semifinals by Zverev.[349] Djokovic finished the season by leading Serbia to the semifinals of 2021 Davis Cup Finals, where they lost to Croatia.[350]\n\n\n\n#### 2022: Travel restrictions, 1000 career wins, Wimbledon title, record 38th Masters & record 6th Year-end Championship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n##### Australian Open controversy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: § Opposition to COVID-19 vaccine\n\nDjokovic was set to begin his 2022 season by participating in the ATP Cup in Sydney but pulled out.[351] In order to play at the Australian Open, where he was a three-time defending champion, the Victorian Government required all players to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or have a medical exemption. Djokovic was one of \"a handful\" of players and staff to be granted a medical exemption by Tennis Australia and the Department of Health in Victoria.[352][353][354][355] It was later revealed that Djokovic tested positive for COVID-19 on 16 December 2021 which was used as the basis for his exemption.[356]\n\n\nDjokovic had been granted a visa to enter Australia on 18 November 2021.[357] He travelled to Melbourne on 5 January but was detained by the Australian Border Force after they determined that he did not meet the entry requirements for an unvaccinated traveller.[358][359] Djokovic disclosed that a member of his support team ticked a box on his application form stating he had not travelled abroad two weeks before he left for Australia; however, he had been to Spain at that time.[360] His visa was cancelled and he was held in an immigration detention hotel for several days awaiting a court hearing.[361]\n\n\nOn 10 January, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia ordered his release and awarded costs,[362][363] ruling that the visa cancelation process undertaken by Australian border officials was flawed on the basis that they did not give Djokovic sufficient time to contact his lawyers and tennis authorities before his official interview. The Australian Government conceded that the cancelation was \"unreasonable in [the] circumstances\".[364]\n\n\nOn 14 January 2022, Alex Hawke, Australia's Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, exercised his ministerial powers under sections 133C(3) and 116(1)(e)(i) of the *Migration Act 1958* to cancel Djokovic's visa,[365] citing \"health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so\".[366] Djokovic applied for a judicial review, but three Federal Court of Australia judges unanimously dismissed his application on 16 January, preventing his participation in the 2022 Australian Open.[367][368][369] Djokovic said he was \"extremely disappointed\" with the decision but accepted the ruling, and flew out of Australia to Dubai that night.[370][371][372] Because he was removed using ministerial powers under the *Migration Act*, he is now barred from returning to Australia for three years,[373] although each visa application is reviewed on its merits.[373] As of November 2022, this visa ban has been overturned by the recently elected Immigration Minister Andrew Giles.[374]\n\n\nIn February, Djokovic gave an interview to the BBC regarding his deportation from Australia, stating he is willing to forego career records by sticking to his principles of free choice and not having the COVID-19 vaccine.[10] In May, he admitted that the court battle and his deportation from Australia \"took a major toll\" on him.[375] He said: \"The amount of pressure and everything that I was feeling in the first few months of the year, as much as I've felt pressure in my life and my career, that was something really on a whole different level\".[376]\n\n\n\n##### After Australia[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic entered the Dubai Championships in February, where vaccination was not required for entry.[377] He was upset in the quarterfinals by eventual finalist Jiří Veselý, resulting in him conceding his world No. 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev. This marked the first time a man outside of the Big Four was ranked singles world No. 1 since Andy Roddick in February 2004.[378] Djokovic withdrew from both the Indian Wells Masters and the Miami Open, due to the United States forbidding unvaccinated foreign travellers.[379] Despite being unable to play, Djokovic regained the world No. 1 ranking after Medvedev's third-round defeat at Indian Wells.[380]\n\n\nAfter being unable to play in March, Djokovic began his clay court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters in April. Seeded first, he received a bye in the first round and lost to eventual finalist Davidovich Fokina in the second, his first opening match loss since the 2018 Barcelona Open.[381][382] Later that month, he reached the final of the Serbia Open and lost to Andrey Rublev in three sets.[383] At the Madrid Open in May, Djokovic made it to the semifinals where he was beaten in three sets by 19-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, the eventual champion.[384]\nAt the Italian Open a week later, he reached the twelfth final of his career at this Masters. In the semifinals, he defeated Casper Ruud for his 1,000th career win, becoming only the fifth man in the Open Era to reach this milestone.[385] In the final, he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets to win his sixth Italian Open and record-extending 38th Masters title.[386]\n\n\nDjokovic entered the French Open in May as the defending champion. After defeating Yoshihito Nishioka, Alex Molčan, Aljaž Bedene and Diego Schwartzman in straight sets, he faced Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals for their record-extending 59th meeting. He lost in four sets, ending his French Open title defense.[387] As a result of his quarterfinals defeat, he conceded the No. 1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev for the second time in 2022.\n\n\nWith his first-round win at the Wimbledon Championships against Kwon Soon-woo, Djokovic became the first player in history (male or female) to win 80 matches at all four Grand Slams.[388] With his semifinal win over Cameron Norrie, Djokovic reached a record 32nd Grand Slam final, one ahead of Roger Federer.[389] Djokovic went on to defeat Nick Kyrgios in the final in four sets for his fourth consecutive and seventh overall Wimbledon trophy.[390]\nWith this victory, he reached a total of 21 major titles, which broke his tie of 20 majors with Federer and put him one Grand Slam title behind Nadal.[391][392]\n\n\nDue to Djokovic's unvaccinated status against COVID-19, he was unable to compete in the US Open as the US government did not allow unvaccinated non-US citizens to enter the country.[393] As a result, he withdrew from the tournament on 25 August.[394] At the Astana Open in October, he defeated Medvedev in the semifinals and Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final to win his 90th singles title.[395] Djokovic also qualified for the ATP Finals for the 15th time.[396][397]\n\n\nDjokovic then competed at the Paris Masters, where he reached his 90th Masters quarterfinal, defeating Karen Khachanov, who at the time, was the only player to have defeated him in the final of this Masters.[398] He then defeated Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets to reach his 74th Masters semifinal and eighth at this tournament.[399] In the semifinals, Djokovic defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas to reach his third straight final of the season and eighth overall at this Masters. It was also Djokovic's record 56th ATP Masters final and the 650th hard-court win of his career, making him just the third male player in the Open Era to record 650 or more career wins on any single surface.[400][401] He lost in the final to 19-year-old Holger Rune, who defeated five top-10 players en route to the title. It was the first time Djokovic has lost in 31 Masters finals when winning the first set.[402]\n\n\nSeeded seventh at the ATP Finals, Djokovic won his first round robin match over second seed Stefanos Tsitsipas to record his 60th career victory over a Top 3 player, making him the first player to accomplish this milestone since the ATP rankings began in 1973. It was also his ninth straight win over Tsitsipas.[403] Djokovic then defeated sixth seed Andrey Rublev and fourth seed Daniil Medvedev to reach the semifinals, where he defeated Taylor Fritz to reach his eighth final at this event and secured his 15th year-end top-5 finish in the rankings.[404][405] He defeated Casper Ruud to win a record-equaling sixth ATP Finals title.[406] He is also the first player ever to win the ATP Finals in three different decades—the 2000s, 2010s and 2020s.[407] Djokovic, at the age of 35, also became the oldest champion in the ATP Finals' 53-year history.[408]\n\n\n\n#### 2023: Record-extending 24th Major, 40th Masters, 8th Year-End No. 1, 3rd Career Slam, record 7th Year-end Championship & 400 weeks at No. 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 Novak Djokovic tennis season\n\n![](image)Djokovic at the 2023 French OpenDjokovic started his season by winning his 92nd career title at the 2023 Adelaide International, where he defeated Sebastian Korda in three sets in the final after saving a championship point.[409] At the Australian Open,[410] Djokovic overcame hamstring injury concerns[411] to reach the final, where he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets to claim his record-extending 10th Australian Open title while tying Nadal for the record of 22 men's singles major titles and reclaiming the world No. 1 ranking from Carlos Alcaraz.[412][413] On 27 February 2023, Djokovic broke Steffi Graf's record of 377 weeks that she set back 25 years ago for most weeks as world No. 1 in women's tennis, thus he became the player with most weeks at No. 1 on both the men's and women's tours.[414]\n\n\nIn March, Djokovic withdrew from the Indian Wells Masters and Miami Open after being denied a visa into the United States due to being unvaccinated. Afterwards, Djokovic struggled in the clay court season, suffering early defeats at the Monte-Carlo Masters[415] and the Banja Luka Open.[416] At the Italian Open, Djokovic was defeated in the quarterfinals by Holger Rune.[417]\n\n\nAt the French Open, he returned to form, reaching the semifinals to face world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz, whom he defeated in four sets to reach a record-extending 34th major final. Moreover, he became the only player to contest at least seven finals at each Grand Slam tournament. Djokovic would go on to beat Casper Ruud in the final, securing a record-breaking 23rd major title and becoming the first man in tennis history to achieve a triple Career Grand Slam.[418][14] By winning the title, Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 position from Alcaraz.[419]\n\n\nDjokovic then played at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships where he was bidding to win a fifth consecutive title and a record-equalling eighth title. He reached the semifinals with straight set victories over Pedro Cachin, Jordan Thompson and Stan Wawrinka, and four set victories over Hubert Hurkacz and Andrey Rublev. In the semifinals, he faced Jannik Sinner in a rematch of their quarterfinal match the previous year, and Djokovic won in straight sets to reach his 5th consecutive and 9th overall Wimbledon final, as well as his record-extending 35th major final, where he faced Carlos Alcaraz.[420] He subsequently lost an epic final to Alcaraz in five sets, ending his 34-match winning streak at Wimbledon since 2018 and his unbeaten run in both Wimbledon finals and Centre Court since his 2013 defeat to Andy Murray.[421]\n\n\nHe proceeded to win his third Cincinnati Masters title and a record-extending 39th Masters title. He beat Alcaraz in a rematch of their Wimbledon final, in what was the longest best-of-three-sets ATP final and the longest match in the tournament's history, at 3 hours and 49 minutes, and was immediately praised as one of the best matches of all time.[422][423] He won the match from a set down and down a break in the second set, along with saving a championship point in the second-set tiebreaker.[422] Djokovic called it one of his toughest matches, and said \"It did feel like a Grand Slam final, even more than that to be honest\". He compared the intensity and toughness of the match to his match against Rafael Nadal in the 2012 Australian Open final.[424]\n\n\nDjokovic then played at the US Open where he dropped only two sets en route to the title, both to his fellow countryman Laslo Djere in a win from two sets down in the third round.[425] By reaching a 47th men's singles major semifinal, Djokovic surpassed Roger Federer's Open Era record.[426] By reaching the final, Djokovic matched Federer's record of reaching all major finals in a season three times. In the final, he faced Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of their 2021 US Open final. Djokovic defeated Medvedev in straight sets to win his fourth US Open title and a record-extending 24th men's singles major title overall, also equaling Margaret Court's all-time record of major singles titles by either sex.[427][428] Djokovic became the oldest US Open men's singles champion in the Open Era, at 36 years and 111 days,[429] and became the first man to win three majors in a season four times.[430] This triumph also meant that, at the time, Djokovic had won one third of all Grand Slams he had entered (24 out of 72), and had been in the final in half of all Grand Slams he had played (36 out of 72).[431] By winning his first-round match, Djokovic guaranteed that he would regain the ATP No. 1 singles ranking at the end of the tournament for a record-extending 390th week.[432][433]\n\n\nAt the Paris Masters, Djokovic beat Tomás Martín Etcheverry in the first round in his 1289th career match, surpassing Rafael Nadal for the fourth most in the Open Era.[434] He went on to win the title for a record-extending seventh Paris Masters title and 40th Masters overall, defeating Grigor Dimitrov in the final.[435] With his first match win over Holger Rune at the 2023 ATP Finals, he secured the Year-End World No. 1 for a record-extending eighth time and 400 weeks at No. 1.[436]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Big Three (tennis) and List of tennis rivalries\n\nDjokovic has a winning record against all of his top contemporaries, including his fellow Big Three counterparts, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.\n\n\n\n### Rafael Nadal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Nadal rivalry\n\nDjokovic and Rafael Nadal rivalry is the most prolific in men's tennis in the Open Era. The two have faced each other 59 times, including in all four major finals, with Djokovic leading 30–29 overall.[437][438] Djokovic leads on hard courts 20–7 while Nadal leads on clay 20–8, and they are tied on grass 2–2.[439]\n\n\nDjokovic is the only player to have beaten Nadal in all four majors. He is also the player with the most victories over Nadal on clay, beating him twice at Roland Garros and all three claycourt Masters events, notably in 2013 Monte-Carlo Masters where he ended Nadal's run of 8 consecutive titles. Djokovic has two streaks of seven victories against Nadal, in 2011–2012 and 2015–2016. The two contested in the longest major finals match ever played at the 2012 Australian Open where Djokovic won in five sets lasting 5 hours and 53 minutes.[440][441][442] Other classics they played include the 2009 Madrid Masters semifinal,[443] 2011 Miami Masters final,[444][445] the 2013 French Open semifinal,[446] 2018 Wimbledon semifinal,[447][448] and the 2021 French Open semifinal.[449]\n\n\n\n### Roger Federer[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Federer rivalry\n\n![](image)Djokovic and Federer after their semifinal match at the 2011 US Open.\nDjokovic and Roger Federer rivalry is considered to be one of the greatest rivalries in tennis history. They faced each other 50 times, with Djokovic leading 27–23, including 13–6 in finals (not including a 2014 walkover in favour of Djokovic). Djokovic leads on hard courts 20–18 as well as on grass 3–1 and they are split 4–4 on clay.[450]\n\n\nDjokovic is the player with the most victories over Federer and the only player to beat Federer multiple times at his most successful major tournaments, four times at the Australian Open, three times at the US Open, three times at the Year-end Championship and most notably, three times at the final of Wimbledon Championships. Their most recent final was at the 2019 Wimbledon where Djokovic won in five sets in what became the longest final in Wimbledon history.[451][452] Other notable matches they contested are the 2014 Wimbledon and 2015 Wimbledon finals, along with semifinals at the 2010 US Open, 2011 US Open, 2011 French Open, and 2018 Paris Masters.[150][453][454]\n\n\n\n### Andy Murray[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Murray rivalry\n\nDjokovic and Andy Murray have met 36 times, with Djokovic leading 25–11.[455] Djokovic leads on hard courts 20–8 and 5–1 on clay, while Murray has won the two matches played on grass. Djokovic and Murray are one of two pairs to have met in each of the four major finals (other pair being Djokovic and Nadal). The two are almost exactly the same age, with Murray being a week older than Djokovic. They went to training camp together, and Murray was the winner of the first match they ever played as teenagers. One of their most notable matches was a three-set thriller at the final of the 2012 Shanghai Masters, in which Murray held five championship point opportunities in the second set; however, Djokovic saved each of them, forcing a deciding set.[456] He eventually prevailed to win his first Shanghai Masters title, ending Murray's 12–0 winning streak at the event. This match and the three-set semifinal they played in Rome in 2011, were voted the ATP Tour match of the year, for each respective season.[457][458] Other classics they had include the 2012 Australian Open semifinal, 2012 US Open final, the 2015 semifinal and 2016 final at the French Open, and the 2017 Qatar Open final.\n\n\n\n### Stan Wawrinka[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Stan Wawrinka have met 27 times with Djokovic leading 21–6. However, the two have contested numerous close matches, including four five-setters at the majors.[459] Wawrinka and Djokovic have met in three consecutive Australian Opens – with each match going to five sets – and a five-setter in the US Open. In the 2013 Australian Open fourth round, Djokovic won 12–10 in a fifth set, with the match being considered one of the best ever played;[460][187][188][191][189][461] at the 2013 US Open semifinals Djokovic won 6–4 in the fifth set; at the 2014 Australian Open quarterfinals, Wawrinka won 9–7 in the fifth. Wawrinka's win broke Djokovic's run of 14 consecutive major semifinals, and ended a 28-match winning streak; and Wawrinka went on to win his first major title at the tournament.[462] Djokovic got revenge the next year at the 2015 Australian Open, winning 6–0 in the fifth set.[463]\n\n\nAt the 2015 French Open final, Wawrinka defeated Djokovic in four sets to claim his second major title. Later that year, Djokovic beat Wawrinka at the Cincinnati Masters and Paris Masters.[464] At the 2016 US Open, Wawrinka beat Djokovic in a major final for a second time.[465]\n\n\nDespite Djokovic's 21–6 overall record against Wawrinka, Wawrinka leads Djokovic 3–2 in ATP finals, two of which in major finals.[466] During Djokovic's run of 13 major finals from the 2014 Wimbledon Championships through the 2020 Australian Open, his only two losses were to Wawrinka. Contrary to most high-profile rivalries, the pair have also played doubles together.[467]\n\n\n\n### Juan Martín del Potro[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Juan Martín del Potro met 20 times, with Djokovic leading 16–4.[468] Djokovic won their first four meetings, before back-to-back victories for del Potro at the 2011 Davis Cup and their Bronze medal match at the 2012 Summer Olympics in straight sets. Djokovic won the next four matches before he lost to del Potro at the 2013 Indian Wells Masters, where the Argentine made his second career Masters final. Djokovic got the upper hand on the rivalry once again by winning two of the most important matches between them to date; an epic five-setter at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships semifinals (which was the longest Wimbledon semifinal at the time),[469] and a thrilling three-setter at the 2013 Shanghai Masters final. Del Potro upset Djokovic in the first round at the 2016 Rio Olympics in Rio en route to the final. In 2018, Djokovic defeated del Potro in three close sets in the final of the US Open, which was the first Grand Slam final for del Potro since his 2009 US Open victory. They played their last match at the 2019 Italian Open quarterfinal which Djokovic won in a dramatic three-setter after saving two match points.\n\n\n\n### Jo-Wilfried Tsonga[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga met 23 times, with Djokovic leading 17–6.[470][471] Their first meeting was in the final of the 2008 Australian Open, which Djokovic won in four sets to win his first major singles title.[472]\n\n\nTheir next meeting at the majors was at the 2010 Australian Open in the quarterfinals. This time Tsonga prevailed, winning in five sets after Djokovic fell ill during the match.[473] It would be another year-and-a-half until they met again, this time in the semifinals at Wimbledon in 2011. It was their first meeting on grass, and Djokovic prevailed in four sets to advance to his first Wimbledon final (and claiming the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in the process).[474] At the 2012 French Open, Djokovic and Tsonga met again in the quarterfinals, with Djokovic prevailing in five sets after over four hours.[475]\n\n\nThey met again two months later at the Olympics, with Djokovic winning in straight sets in the quarterfinals.[476] They contested the final of the 2012 China Open, where Djokovic was victorious once again, in straight sets.[477] The pair were drawn in the same pool for the 2012 ATP Finals in which Djokovic prevailed in the first (of three) round robin matches.[478] It was Djokovic's fifth win over Tsonga in 2012. Their final major meeting was in the second round of the 2019 Australian Open,[479] which Djokovic won in straight sets.\n\n\n\n### Daniil Medvedev[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Daniil Medvedev have met 15 times, with Djokovic leading 10–5.[480][481] They have contested three major finals, with Djokovic winning the 2021 Australian Open and the 2023 US Open, and Medvedev winning his first major title at the 2021 US Open, also ending Djokovic's quest for a calendar-year Grand Slam.[482]\n\n\nDjokovic won their first two matches at the 2017 Davis Cup and 2017 Eastbourne International.[483] They next met at a major for the first time in the fourth round of the 2019 Australian Open, with Djokovic prevailing in four sets.[484] Medvedev improved their head-to-head to 3–2 with three-set wins at the quarterfinal of the 2019 Monte-Carlo Masters and the semifinal of 2019 Cincinnati Masters, the latter of which Medvedev went on to win for his maiden ATP Masters title.[485][486] They met in three finals in 2021, with Djokovic winning the Australian Open and Paris Masters and Medvedev winning the US Open.\n\n\nMedvedev replaced Djokovic as the world No. 1 player when he rose to the top ranking for the first time in February 2022.[487]\n\n\nAt the 2023 US Open Final, Djokovic beat Medvedev in a rematch of the 2021 US Open final to claim his 24th Grand Slam Title in straight sets. The second set was a grueling 104-minute battle that Djokovic won in a tiebreak.[488]\n\n\n\n### Stefanos Tsitsipas[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Stefanos Tsitsipas have met 13 times, with Djokovic leading 11–2, including at the 2021 French Open and 2023 Australian Open finals, both of which Djokovic won.[489][490]\n\n\nTheir first meeting took place at the third round of the 2018 Rogers Cup, with the then 19-year-old Tsitsipas, ranked No. 27, pulling an upset over Djokovic in three sets.[491] Djokovic avenged this loss by beating Tsitsipas, then ranked in the top 10, in straight sets to win the 2019 Madrid Open.[492] Tstisipas won their next match in the quarterfinals of the 2019 Shanghai Masters in three sets to bring their head-to-head to 2–1 in his favor.[493] Djokovic then won all of their next ten matches, including the 2020 French Open semifinal, 2021 French Open final, 2022 Italian Open final, and 2023 Australian Open final, the last of which also saw the two competing for the world No. 1 ranking.[489]\n\n\n\n### Carlos Alcaraz[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic and Carlos Alcaraz have met four times, splitting it evenly 2–2, with both winning once at a Grand Slam tournament and once at a Masters tournament.[494] Their rivalry has been deemed to be a significant intergenerational rivalry, as Alcaraz being 16 years younger than Djokovic is seen as the successor to the Big Three, while Djokovic is defending the old guard.[495][496][497]\n\n\nTheir first meeting was at the 2022 Madrid Masters semifinals, in which Alcaraz prevailed in an epic that was praised as the match of the year, finishing at 3 hours and 35 minutes.[498] Their next meeting would not be until the 2023 French Open semifinals, in which Djokovic won in four sets, which was close in the beginning until Alcaraz faltered due to cramps from mental pressure and physical intensity.[499] They would meet again soon after in the 2023 Wimbledon final, in which Alcaraz would defeat Djokovic in five sets, ending his hopes for a calendar Grand Slam and his record 45-match Centre Court win streak. At five sets it was the third-longest Wimbledon final, at 4 hours and 42 minutes.[500] They would meet soon again in another epic at the 2023 Cincinnati Masters final, with Djokovic prevailing in three tightly contested sets after saving a match point. The match was the longest best-of-three-sets ATP Tour final and the longest match in the tournament's history, at 3 hours and 49 minutes, and was immediately praised as one of the best matches ever.[422][423][501] Djokovic won despite being a set down and down a break in the second set, along with saving a championship point in the second-set tiebreaker.[502][503]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic is regarded by many observers, tennis players and coaches as the greatest men's tennis player of all time, primarily for his achievements across all top-level tournaments of the men's professional tour in addition to his time spent with the world No. 1 ranking. Many media, including Forbes, Reuters, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, Marca, Tennis World USA, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and Sporting News have named Djokovic the greatest male tennis player in history.[504][505][506][507][508][509]\n\n\nDjokovic has won a record 70 Big Titles, including an all-time record of 24 Grand Slam titles, and holds the most weeks at No. 1, the most wins over top 5 and top 10-ranked players, has won all major and Masters events and the year-end championships at least twice (which has not been done by another player once) and has a winning head-to-head record over his greatest rivals in one of the strongest eras of tennis.[510][511][512][513][514][515][516][517][518][519] Former world No. 1 Daniil Medvedev labelled Djokovic the \"greatest tennis player in history\" after winning his first major title at the 2021 US Open over Djokovic.[520] Pat Cash emphasized that Djokovic is one of two players who beat Rafael Nadal at the French Open, which he considers to be \"the biggest challenge in tennis\".[512] Richard Krajicek and *The Roar*, sports opinion website, said that Djokovic should be considered for the greatest player of all time because he is the only one among his rivals who has won all four majors consecutively.[521][522][523] Patrick Mouratoglou stated, \"Novak is the most complete player of all times. That enables him to find the solution to most of the problems on court and this, on every surface. It explains why he is now in the best position to become the GOAT\".[524] Former world No. 7 Mardy Fish also declared that Djokovic in 2011 was \"the best player of all time\".[525] Rafael Nadal has praised Djokovic's peak level of performance, stating in 2011 (when he went 0–6 against Djokovic for the season) that \"[Djokovic's level is] probably the highest level of tennis that I ever saw.\"[526] Nadal reiterated this after a one-sided loss in the 2016 Qatar Open final, stating that \"I played against a player who did everything perfectly. I don't know anybody who's ever played tennis like this. Since I know this sport I've never seen somebody playing at this level.\"[527]\n\n\nNadal later said in an interview with Spanish daily sports newspaper Diario AS shortly after Djokovic (aged 36) won the 2023 US Open for his 24th Grand Slam:\n\n\n\n\n> I believe that numbers are numbers and statistics are statistics and, in that sense, I think he [Djokovic] has better numbers than mine and that is indisputable. It is not beneath me nor do I have an ego big enough to try and disguise a reality that is not. This is the truth. The rest are tastes, inspiration, sensations that one player or the other may transmit to you, that you may like one or the other more. I think that with respect to titles, Djokovic is the best in history and there is nothing to discuss in that.[528][529][530][531]\n> \n> \n\n\nTennis coach Nick Bollettieri praised Djokovic as the \"most complete player ever\",[532] and the \"most perfect player of all time\":[533]\n\n\n\n\n> When you look at match players in the history of tennis, I don't believe that anybody can equal everything on the court that Djokovic does. I don't think you can find a weakness in his game. His movement, personality, his return of serve, his serve, excellent touch, not hesitant in coming to the net, great serve. Overall, almost every player has a downfall; to me, he doesn't have one. He's perhaps the best put-together player that I've seen over 60 years.[534]\n> \n> \n\n\nAndre Agassi, stated in an interview in 2019 with the Times of India that:\n\n\n\n\n> The highest standard of tennis that I've ever seen is when Novak is playing his best tennis. The single level, for whatever my tennis IQ is worth, is an unmistakable standard to which everybody will strive to be.[535]\n> \n> \n\n\nPete Sampras, who at the time of his retirement in 2003 was considered by some to be the greatest male tennis player of all time, stated after Djokovic earned a record-breaking seventh year-end No. 1 finish in 2021:\n\n\n\n\n> Seven years for him, I'm sure he sees it as a bonus to all the majors that he's won, but I think he'll appreciate it more as he gets older. He did it at a time where he dominated two of the greats, in Roger and Rafa, and he handled the next generation of players very well – all at the same time. I do think what Novak's done over the past 10 years, winning the majors, being consistent, finishing number one for seven years, to me it's a clear sign that he is the greatest of all time.[515][536]\n> \n> \n\n\nTennis pundits have classified many of Djokovic's matches as some of the greatest contests ever, such as the 2012 Australian Open final, in which he beat Nadal in five long and gruelling sets.[537][538] Other matches include the five-set 2013 Australian Open fourth round against Stan Wawrinka,[188][189] the 2018 Wimbledon semifinal against Nadal, which lasted five brutal sets played over two days,[539][540] the five-set 2019 Wimbledon final against Roger Federer, the longest Wimbledon final in history,[541][542] and the 2023 Cincinnati Masters final against Carlos Alcaraz, the longest best-of-three-sets final in ATP Tour history.[422][423]\n\n\nSome analysts claim that the Djokovic–Nadal rivalry ranks as the best rivalry in tennis history because of the quality of matches they produce.[543]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n### Playing style[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic is an aggressive baseline player.[544] His groundstrokes from both wings are consistent, deep, and penetrating. His backhand is widely regarded as the greatest two-handed backhand of all time, due to its effectiveness on both sides of the court and its accuracy.[545][546][547] His best shot is his backhand down the line, with great pace and precision. He excels at returning serve in particular, and regularly ranks among the tour leaders in return points, return games, and break points won. His forehand is deemed to be underrated, yet one of the best, due to its versatility.[548] After great technical difficulties during the 2009 season (coinciding with his switch to the Head racket series), his serve is one of his major weapons again, winning him many free points; his first serve is typically hit flat, while he prefers to slice and kick his second serves wide.[544] He has also led the ATP Tour in their career \"Under Pressure Rating\" statistic, in part because of his prowess at winning deciding sets.\n\n\n\n![](image)Djokovic serving at the Eastbourne International. Djokovic plays with a Head racquet and wears Lacoste apparel and Asics shoes.\nDjokovic has been described as one of the fittest and most complete athletes in sports history, with high agility, court coverage and mobility, which allows him to hit winners from seemingly indefensible positions.[549][550] Because of this, coupled with flexibility and length, he rarely gets aced. Todd Martin, who coached Djokovic between 2009 and 2010, noted that:[551]\n\n\n\n\n> His athleticism is from another world. His return of serve is way better than any other return of serve ever and I mean way better. Nobody has gotten so many balls back and neutralized so many good serves. \n> \n> \n\n\nDjokovic's return of serve is a big weapon for him, with which he can be both offensive and defensive. He is highly efficient off both the forehand and backhand return, often getting the return in play deep with pace, neutralizing the advantage the server usually has in a point. Andre Agassi described Djokovic's return of serve as \"the precedent-setting standard for the return\".[552][553] Occasionally, Djokovic employs a well-disguised backhand underspin drop shot and sliced backhand. Djokovic is widely\n\n\nDjokovic commented on the modern style of play, including his own, in an interview with Jim Courier after his semifinal win against Andy Murray in the 2012 Australian Open tournament:[554]\n\n\n\n\n> I had a big privilege and honour to meet personally today Mr. Laver, and he is one of the biggest, and greatest players ever to play the game, thank you for staying this late, sir, thank you ... even though it would actually be better if we played a couple times serve and volley, but we don't know to play ... we are mostly around here [points to the area near the baseline], we are running, you know, around the baseline ... \n> \n> \n\n\nIn assessing Djokovic's 2011 season, Jimmy Connors said that Djokovic gives his opponents problems by playing \"a little bit old-school, taking the ball earlier, catching the ball on the rise, (and) driving the ball flat.\" Connors adds that a lot of the topspin that Djokovic's opponents drive at him comes right into his zone, thus his ability to turn defense into offense well.[555]\n\n\n\n### Equipment[edit]\n\n\nEntering the pro circuit, Djokovic used the Head Liquidmetal Radical, but changed sponsors to Wilson in 2005. He could not find a Wilson racquet he liked, so Wilson agreed to make him a custom racquet to match his previous one with Head.[556] After the 2008 season, Djokovic re-signed with Head, and debuted a new paint job of the Head YouTek Speed Pro at the 2009 Australian Open. He then switched to the Head YouTek IG Speed (18x20) paint job in 2011, and in 2013, he again updated his paint job to the Head Graphene Speed Pro, which included an extensive promotional campaign.[557] Djokovic uses a hybrid of Head Natural Gut (gauge 16) in the mains and Luxilon Big Banger ALU Power Rough (gauge 16L) in the crosses. He also uses Head Synthetic Leather Grip as a replacement grip.[558] In 2012, Djokovic appeared in a television commercial with Maria Sharapova promoting the use of Head rackets for many techniques such as golf and ten-pin bowling.[559]\n\n\n\n### Coaching and personal team[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Novak Djokovic coaches\n\nIn the period 2004 and 2005, Djokovic was coached by Dejan Petrovic.[560] From fall 2005 until June 2006, he was coached by Riccardo Piatti, who divided his time between the 18-year-old and Ivan Ljubičić. Player and coach reportedly parted ways over the latter's refusal to work full-time with Djokovic.[561]\n\n\nFrom June 2006 until May 2017, Djokovic was coached by former professional Slovakian tennis player Marián Vajda. They met for the first time during that year's French Open, after which Vajda was hired to be the 19-year-old's coach. On occasion Djokovic employed additional coaches on a part-time basis: in 2007, during the spring hardcourt season, he worked with Australian doubles ace Mark Woodforde with specific emphasis on volleys and net play while from August 2009 until April 2010 American Todd Martin joined the coaching team, a period marked by his ill-fated attempt to change Djokovic's serve motion.[562] From early 2007 until 2017, Djokovic worked with physiotherapist Miljan Amanović, who was previously employed by Red Star Belgrade, and NBA player Vladimir Radmanović.[563]\n\n\nFrom the fall of 2006, Djokovic had an Israeli fitness coach, Ronen Bega, but the two parted ways during the spring of 2009.[564] Djokovic decided to make a change after identifying his conditioning as a weakness in his game following continual losses to Nadal.[565] In April 2009, ahead of the Rome Masters, Djokovic hired Austrian Gebhard Phil-Gritsch (formerly worked with Thomas Muster) to join the team in fitness coach capacity.[566][567]\n\n\nIn 2008, Djokovic hired Edoardo Artaldi's management team, which includes his wife, Elena Capellaro, to oversee the huge operation that runs around him. They met when Djokovic signed a contract with the Italian clothing brand Sergio Tacchini, where Artaldi was working at the time.[568] Despite taking a lead role as an agent and business manager, Artaldi has acted like a father figure in Djokovic's camp. During an interview with Italian outlet SBS in 2019, Artaldi explained that, together with his wife, they have tried to “create the atmosphere” that Djokovic needed while on tour because he missed his family while traveling.[568][569] Artaldi's relationship with Djokovic has had its challenging moments, as he screamed at Artaldi and brother Marko to leave his box during the final of the 2023 Adelaide Open.[568]\n\n\nIn July 2010, before the Davis Cup clash away at Croatia, Djokovic made another addition to his team – Igor Četojević, a Serbian nutritionist and proponent of traditional medicine living in Cyprus,[570] who influenced Djokovic's diet.[571][572] A gluten-free diet appeared to have worked as Djokovic began feeling stronger, quicker, and much more fit.[573] After Djokovic's Wimbledon win in July 2011, Četojević left the team.[574]\n\n\nAfter retiring from professional tennis in August 2011, Serbian player Dušan Vemić joined Djokovic's team as the assistant coach and hitting partner for Novak. The collaboration ended before the 2013 US Open.[575] Likewise, Djokovic's childhood friend and former junior doubles partner Bojan Božović also briefly served as a hitting partner for Novak in late 2014, shortly after Božović had opened his academy, and due to his height and strong serve, Djokovic practiced his returns with him, specifically for the 2014 Paris Masters final against Milos Raonic, a player with a powerful serve.[53]\n\n\nSix-time major champion and former world No. 1 Boris Becker, who had mostly worked as a television pundit for BBC Sport and Sky Sports since retiring from playing in 1999, was announced as Djokovic's new head coach in December 2013.[576] According to Djokovic, the Becker appointment was done with input from the player's existing head coach Marián Vajda who reportedly wanted to spend more time with his family and was looking to have his coaching workload somewhat reduced.[577] For Becker, in addition to working alongside Vajda, the job entailed special emphasis on Grand Slam tournaments as Djokovic felt he missed out on winning a couple of majors over the previous two seasons due to a lack of mental edge in the final stages of those tournaments.[578] Becker's first tournament coaching Djokovic was the 2014 Australian Open.\n\n\nOn 5 May 2017, Djokovic confirmed that he had come to a mutual agreement to terminate his coaching relationship with Vajda, as well as Phil-Gritsch and Amanović. In a statement on his website, Djokovic cited the reasons for the personnel shakeup: \"Novak and the team members decided to part ways after a detailed analysis of the game, achieved results in the previous period, and also after discussing private plans of each team member. Despite the fantastic cooperation so far, Djokovic felt he needed to make a change, and to introduce new energy in order to raise his level of play.\"[579]\n\n\nDjokovic reunited with Marián Vajda in April 2018 for the Monte-Carlo Masters.[580][581] On 30 June 2019, Djokovic confirmed that he also added former world No. 2 and Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanišević to his coaching team.[582]\n\n\nIn late 2021, Djokovic decided to play fewer tournaments in order to focus on Grand Slam tournaments and as such, he decided to be with a smaller team with only one coach, and he chose Ivanišević due to Vajda's reluctance to coach only him only on Grand Slams.[583] Djokovic and Vajda thus parted ways for a second time in December 2021, but it was only made public in March 2022,[583] when both announced that Vajda would no longer coach Djokovic and that it was an amicable and mutual decision. Vajda promised to remain his 'biggest support' on and off the court. Djokovic said on Twitter \"What a journey Marian. 15 years!\"[584] In addition to Ivanišević as his new coach, Djokovic also added fitness trainer Marco Panichi and hitting partner Carlos Gómez-Herrera, a retired tennis player with whom he had been friends for around 15 years, while also keeping physiotherapist Miljan Amanović.[569][585]\n\n\nIn late 2023, Djokovic decided to end his professional long-term association with Edoardo Artaldi's management team, who had been with him since 2008, stating that “I’m now at a stage where I'm entering a new chapter about the off-court approach”.[569]\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kindergarten in Jalovik village built by the Novak Djokovic Foundation.[586]\nIn 2007, Djokovic founded the Novak Djokovic Foundation.[587] The organization's mission is to help children from disadvantaged communities grow up and develop in stimulating and safe environments.[588] The foundation partnered with the World Bank in August 2015 to promote early childhood education in Serbia.[589][590][591] His foundation has built 50 schools as of April 2022 and are building their 51st, and supported more than 20,800 children and over a thousand families.[592][593]\n\n\nDjokovic participated in charity matches to raise funds for the reconstruction of the Avala Tower, as well as to aid victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake and 2010–11 Queensland floods.[594][595][596] Starting in 2007, he has established a tradition of hosting and socializing with hundreds of Kosovo Serb children during Davis Cup matches organized in Serbia.[597] Djokovic was selected as the 2012 Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year, for his contributions through the foundation, his role as a UNICEF national ambassador and other charitable projects.[598] In August 2015, he was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.[20]\n\n\nDuring the 2014 Balkans floods, Djokovic sparked worldwide financial and media support for victims in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia.[599] After winning the 2014 Rome Masters, Djokovic donated his prize money to the flood victims in Serbia, while his foundation collected another $600,000.[599][593] Following his 2016 Australian Open victory, Djokovic donated $20,000 to Melbourne City Mission's early childhood education programm to help disadvantaged children.[600] After the COVID-19 pandemic spread to Serbia in March 2020, he and his wife announced that they will donate €1 million for the purchase of ventilators and medical equipment to support hospitals and other medical institutions.[601] He also made a donation to Bergamo, Italy‚ one of the worst-affected Italian provinces, as well as to Novi Pazar, Serbia and North Mitrovica, Serbia.[602][603][604]\n\n\n\n### Sponsorships and business ventures[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic endorses Serbian telecommunications company Telekom Srbija and German nutritional supplement brand FitLine.[605]\n\n\nOn turning professional in 2003, Djokovic began wearing Adidas clothing. At the end of 2009, Djokovic signed a 10-year deal with the Italian clothing company Sergio Tacchini after Adidas refused to extend his clothing contract (choosing instead to sign Andy Murray).[606] Tacchini doesn't make shoes so Djokovic continued with Adidas as his choice of footwear. His sponsorship contract with Tacchini was incentive-heavy, and Djokovic's disproportionate success and dominance in 2011 caused the company to fall behind on bonus payments, leading to the termination of the sponsorship contract.[607][608]\n\n\nFrom 2011, Djokovic began to wear custom Red and Blue Adidas Barricade 6.0's shoes, referring to the colours of the Serbian national flag. By April 2012, the Tacchini deal had fallen first short and then apart. At that point, he was set to join forces with Nike, Inc.,[609] but instead, on 23 May 2012, Uniqlo appointed Djokovic as its global brand ambassador. The five-year sponsorship, reportedly worth €8 million per year,[610] began on 27 May 2012 in Paris' French Open tennis tournament. A year later, Djokovic's long-term footwear deal with Adidas was announced ahead of 2013 French Open.[611]\n\n\nIn August 2011, Djokovic became the brand ambassador of Swiss watch manufacturer Audemars Piguet.[612] Less than a month later, Djokovic signed a sponsorship deal with German car company Mercedes-Benz.[613] In March 2012, Djokovic was announced by Bombardier Aerospace as its latest Learjet brand ambassador, thus joining the likes of actor and pilot John Travolta, architect Frank Gehry, maestro Valery Gergiev, and classical pianist Lang Lang.[614] From January 2014 Djokovic has been endorsing French car manufacturer Peugeot.[615] At the same time he entered into an endorsement deal with Japanese watch manufacturer Seiko,[616] having just ended his affiliation with their rivals Audemars Piguet.[617] In early 2015, ahead of the Australian Open, Djokovic teamed up with Australian banking corporation ANZ for a social media campaign to raise money for local communities across the Asia Pacific region.[618][619] At the same time his partnership with Jacob's Creek, an Australian wine brand owned by Orlando Wines, was announced in regards to the production and distribution of 'Made By' film series, a documentary style content meant to \"show a side of Novak not seen before as he recounts never before told life stories from Belgrade, Serbia, celebrating what has made him the champion he is today\".[620]\n\n\nSince 2004, the business end of Djokovic's career has been handled by Israeli managers Amit Naor (former pro tennis player turned sports agent) and Allon Khakshouri, a duo which also had Marat Safin and Dinara Safina as its clients. In June 2008, after the duo entered into a partnership with CAA Sports, the sports division of Hollywood talent firm Creative Artists Agency, meaning that the famous company started representing tennis players for the first time,[621] Djokovic formally signed with CAA Sports.[622] After Djokovic's contract with CAA Sports expired during summer 2012, he decided to switch representation, announcing IMG Worldwide as his new representatives in December 2012.[623]\n\n\nOn 22 May 2017, Djokovic was unveiled as a brand ambassador of Lacoste after a five-year partnership with Uniqlo.[624]\n\n\nDuring the 2021 US Open, some people in Djokovic's player box wore hats and shirts bearing the logo of Raiffeisen Bank International, the central back of one of the two largest banking cooperatives in Austria. In April 2021, Djokovic became a brand ambassador for RBI and its subsidiaries in Central and Eastern Europe. The bank will help to support Djokovic's tennis academy in Belgrade.[625] Djokovic did not wear the RBI logo, but he did wear on his shirt the logo of UKG, an American workforce management and human resource management company. People in his box wore the logo on hats as well. UKG lists Djokovic as one of their sponsored athletes.[626]\n\n\n\n#### Investments[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, as Djokovic moved up the tennis rankings, he began venturing into the business world. Most of his activities in the business arena have been channeled through Family Sport, a legal entity in Serbia established and run by members of his immediate family. Registered as a limited liability company, Family Sport initially focused on hospitality, specifically the restaurant business, by launching Novak Café & Restaurant, a franchise developed on the theme of Djokovic's tennis success. Over time, the company, whose day-to-day operations are mostly handled by Novak's father Srdjan and uncle Goran, expanded its activities into real estate, sports/entertainment event organization, and sports apparel distribution.[627]\n\n\nThe company launched Novak Café & Restaurant in 2008 in the Belgrade municipality of Novi Beograd, the flagship location in a franchised chain of theme café-restaurants. During 2009, two more locations were added—one in Kragujevac and the other in Belgrade, the city's second, in September at the neighbourhood of Dorćol overlooking the playing courts of Serbia Open whose inaugural edition took place several months earlier.[628] On 16 December 2011 a location in Novi Sad was opened,[629] however, it operated just over three years before closing in late March 2015.[630] Banja Luka in neighbouring Bosnia got its Novak Café & Restaurant location on 16 October 2015 within Hotel Trešnja on Banj hill.[631][632]\n\n\nIn 2009, the company bought a 250-series ATP tournament known as the Dutch Open and moved it to Serbia where it was renamed the Serbia Open. With the help of Belgrade city authorities, the tournament's inaugural edition was held in May 2009 at the city-owned \"Milan Gale Muškatirović\" courts, located at an attractive spot in Dorćol neighbourhood.[633] The tournament folded in 2012 after four editions and its place in the ATP calendar got taken over by the Düsseldorf Open.\n\n\nIn May 2015, right after winning his fourth Rome Masters title, Djokovic launched a line of nutritional food products, called *Djokolife*.[634] On 10 April 2016, while in town for the Monte-Carlo Masters, Djokovic opened a vegan restaurant called Eqvita in Monte Carlo.[635] The restaurant reportedly closed in March 2019.[636]\n\n\nDjokovic has 80% stake in biotech firm QuantBioRes which claims to be developing a drug to treat patients who have contracted COVID-19.[637] Their research is based on electromagnetic frequency; one biomedical scientist likened it to homeopathy and argued that it \"does not reflect a contemporary understanding of how biochemistry works\", while Peter Collignon commented that their website \"describes a way of finding a new molecule without providing any evidence of success\".[638]\n\n\n\n### Professional Tennis Players Association[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2020, Djokovic resigned from the Players Council of the Association of Tennis Professionals and formed the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) with Vasek Pospisil. The pair will serve as co-presidents of the new organisation to promote the interests of male and female tennis players above a ranking of 500 in singles and 200 in doubles.[639]\n\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nThroughout the latter part of the 2007 season, including before Wimbledon and during US Open, his comedic impressions of fellow contemporary tennis players received much media play.[640] It began when a BBC camera crew recorded some footage of the twenty-year-old impersonating Maria Sharapova, Rafael Nadal, Goran Ivanišević, and Lleyton Hewitt on a practice court at London's Queen's Club Championships just before Wimbledon.[641] The material — consisting of Djokovic imitating the said players by exaggerating their trademark physical gestures or nervous tics for the entertainment of his coaching team Marián Vajda and Mark Woodforde — aired during BBC's coverage of the tournament and subsequently became popular online.[642] Two months later at the US Open, a phone video shot by Argentine players of Djokovic doing locker room impressions of players such as Andy Roddick, Roger Federer, Filippo Volandri and Nadal made its way online, becoming viral.[641][643] A few days later, after beating Carlos Moyá in the quarterfinals, USA Network's on-court interviewer Michael Barkann asked Djokovic to perform some impressions and the player obliged by doing Sharapova and Nadal to the delight of the crowd.[641][644][645][646]\n\n\nIn addition to Djokovic, the national surge in the popularity of tennis was also inspired by three other up-and-coming young players: twenty-year-old Ana Ivanovic, twenty-two-year-old Jelena Janković, and twenty-three-year-old Janko Tipsarević as evidenced in early December 2007 when a sports-entertainment show named NAJJ Srbije (The Best of Serbia), put together in honour of the four players' respective successes in the 2007 season, drew a capacity crowd to Belgrade's Kombank Arena.[647][648] In May 2008, he was a special guest during the first semifinal of the Eurovision Song Contest, held in Belgrade that year. He threw a big tennis ball into the crowd, announcing the start of the voting and together with one of the show's co-presenters, Željko Joksimović, Djokovic sang Đorđe Marjanović's song \"Beograde\".[649]\n\n\nThroughout late April and early May 2009, during ATP Master Series tournaments in Rome and Madrid, respectively, the Serb was a guest on the *Fiorello Show* on Sky Uno hosted by Italian comedian Rosario Fiorello[650] followed by an appearance on Pablo Motos' show *El Hormiguero*.[651]\n\n\nDjokovic is also featured in the music video for the song \"Hello\" by Martin Solveig and Dragonette. The video, filmed at Stade Roland Garros, shows Solveig facing off against Bob Sinclar, another DJ, in a tennis match. When the referee calls a crucial ball \"Out\", Djokovic enters the arena and convinces the referee otherwise.[652] In 2010, the Serbian blues-rock band Zona B recorded the song \"The Joker\", dedicating it to Djokovic.[653][654]\n\n\n\n![](image)Djokovic with Emir Kusturica in Andrićgrad in January 2014, where he received Key to the City.\nOn 25 June 2011, at the Serbian National Defense Council's seventieth congress in Chicago, Djokovic was unanimously awarded the Order of Serbian National Defense in America I class – the highest decoration of the SND. The order was given to the twenty-four-year-old for his merits on the international sports scene and his contributions to the reputation of Serbs and Serbia around the world.[655] The day after winning his first Wimbledon title and reaching the No. 1 ranking for the first time in his career, Djokovic went home to Belgrade for a homecoming celebration in front of the Serbian National Assembly, an event attended by close to 100,000 people.[656]\n\n\nOn 28 November 2011, after returning from London where he finished early due to failing to progress out of his round-robin group, Djokovic visited his childhood tennis coach Jelena Genčić at her Belgrade home, bringing the Wimbledon trophy along.[657] The meeting, reportedly their first in more than four years, was recorded by two television crews – a Serbian one shooting for Aleksandar Gajšek's show *Agape* on Studio B television[658] and an American one from CBS television network filming material for Djokovic's upcoming piece on *60 Minutes*. The next day, 29 November 2011, on invitation from film producer Avi Lerner, Djokovic was part of the high-budget Hollywood movie production *The Expendables 2* in a cameo playing himself[659] that was shot in a warehouse in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia.[660] However, his bit part was later cut out of the final version of the movie.[661]\n\n\nIn March 2012, he was profiled on the CBS show *60 Minutes* by their correspondent Bob Simon. He was named amongst the 100 most influential people of 2012 by *TIME* magazine.[662]\n\n\nDjokovic has been a guest on late-night talk shows, such as *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*, *Veče sa Ivanom Ivanovićem*, *Conan*, *Late Night with Jimmy Fallon*, *Late Show with David Letterman*, *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, *The Jonathan Ross Show* and *The Ellen DeGeneres Show*.[663]\n\n\nIn April 2021, a team of Balkan biospeleologists named a recently discovered freshwater snail species *Travunijana djokovici* after Djokovic.[664]\n\n\nIn 2022, a book titled *Facing Novak Djokovic*, a compilation of interviews with ATP players who described in detail what it's like to compete against Djokovic, was published.[665]\n\n\nIn 2022, Nikola Vesović, a research associate at the University of Belgrade, announced that a new species of beetle in the genus *Duvalius* recently discovered near the town of Ljubovija, Serbia, had been named *Duvalius djokovici* after Djokovic.[666]\n\n\n\n### Views on diet, medicine and science[edit]\n\n\nSince 2010, he has been connected with the nutritionist Igor Četojević who additionally focuses on Chinese medicine and performs acupuncture.[570] He allegedly discovered that Djokovic suffers from gluten intolerance, using applied kinesiology, and that he should not eat gluten, removing it from his diet.[571] He eventually settled on a vegan diet, while later sometimes eating fish.[667] He also claims this vegan, plant-based diet cured his persistent allergies and mild asthma.[668] The gluten-free diet has been credited for improving his endurance on the court and playing a role in his subsequent success.[669][670]\n\n\nFollowing his elbow surgery in 2018, he stated that he \"cried for three days\" after it, feeling guilty, because he was \"not a fan of surgeries or medications\" and wanted \"to be as natural as possible\". He further stated that his belief that human \"bodies are self-healing mechanisms\".[671][672]\n\n\nIn his 2013 autobiography, *Serve to Win*, he wrote of a \"researcher\" who directed \"anger, fear, hostility\" at a glass of water, which turned \"slightly green\" after a few days, while also directing \"love, joy\" at another glass of water, which remained \"bright and crystal clear\" in the same period.[571][673] In 2020, Djokovic spoke of his belief that \"some people\" used \"prayer\" and \"gratitude\" to \"turn the most toxic food, or maybe most polluted water into the most healing water.\" He also claimed that \"scientists [have] proven\" that \"molecules in the water react to our emotions\" and speech.[674][675] Such claims are scientifically dubious,[676][677] and generally regarded as superstitious beliefs.[678]\n\n\n\n### Opposition to COVID-19 vaccine[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Australian Open § COVID-19 vaccination, visa controversies and other controversies\n\nDuring the ATP Tour's shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in a Facebook live stream with other Serbian athletes hosted in April 2020, Djokovic indicated he opposes vaccination and would not be forced to take a Covid vaccine just to be able to return to the Тour.[672][679] He later clarified his remarks by stating that he is not against all kinds of vaccines, but that he is against forced vaccination.[680] He added that he was extremely careful about what he puts into his body.[680]\n\n\nDjokovic's views came under increased scrutiny in late 2021, in the run-up to the 2022 Australian Open, after comments made by Australian government officials indicated that tennis players would need to be vaccinated to enter the tournament.[681] Prior to the tournament, Djokovic had refused to state publicly whether he was vaccinated or not, but had made comments stating his concern over the possibility of a hotel quarantine in Australia.[682] However, while being interviewed by the Australian Border Force in January 2022, Djokovic confirmed to the officer interviewing him that he was unvaccinated.[683]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"The principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Djokovic, on why he is willing to forgo playing major tournaments.\n\nSeveral commentators feel that Djokovic's stance against the COVID-19 vaccine could damage his placement among the all-time great tennis players as he would not be able to participate in the major tournaments where vaccination is required for entry[684][685][686][687][688][689] while others have applauded his view of having a choice.[690][691][692][693] He was unable to play the 2022 Australian Open, where he was the defending champion and the main favourite to win.[11][687] Shortly thereafter, he lost the No. 1 ranking he had held for a record 373 weeks. Due to the federal government's vaccination policy for non-US citizens, Djokovic was unable to enter the United States to play the 2022 US Open, another major tournament he was the favorite to win.[12]\n\n\nIn an interview with the BBC on 15 February 2022, a few weeks after the tournament, Djokovic stated he does not associate with the wider anti-vax movement. However, he believes in personal freedom of choice and supports an individual's right to choose whether or not they receive a vaccine. He re-affirmed sticking to his principles and refusal to receive a vaccine, saying that he would be willing to forego entry into tournaments which are held in countries mandating the vaccine even if it cost him his career records and placement among the all-time great players.[10]\n\n\n\n### Faith and religious beliefs[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic is a member of the Serbian Orthodox Church. On 28 April 2011, Patriarch Irinej of Serbia awarded Djokovic the Order of St. Sava I class, the highest decoration of the Serbian Orthodox Church, for his contributions to monasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo and charitable work in Serbia.[694] He has said that he admired and held in high regard Bishop Amfilohije, who played a key part in helping him through a tough time during the Yugoslav Wars.[695]\n\n\nDjokovic has been reported to meditate for up to an hour a day at the Buddhist Buddhapadipa Temple in Wimbledon as he appreciates the natural setting and serenity, and is close to monks in the complex.[696] He has spoken of the positive power of meditation.[697][698][699] He is frequent visitor of Bosnian town of Visoko and its park that is host to several meditation platforms.[700]\n\n\n\n### Support of sport and sportspeople[edit]\n\n\nDjokovic is a fan of Serbian football club Red Star,[701] Italian club Milan,[702] and Portuguese club Benfica,[703] as well as Serbian basketball club Red Star.[704][705] He has also shown public support for Croatia at the 2018 FIFA World Cup and when faced with criticism from some within his native country of Serbia, Djokovic replied that \"sports have their 'universal language,' they erase boundaries between people, [and] overcome differences in religion, race and nationality.\"[706][707][708] Djokovic has expressed admiration for Croatian football player Luka Modrić, who plays for Real Madrid.[709][710][711] He is a friend of former Serbian tennis player Ana Ivanovic, whom he has known since the two were children growing up in Serbia.[712]\n\n\nDjokovic is a member of the \"Champions for Peace\" club, a group of elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport. It was created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization.[713]\n\n\n\n### Political statements[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Djokovic's victory over Aleksandar Kovacevic in the first round of the 2023 French Open, Djokovic wrote \"Kosovo is the heart of Serbia. Stop the violence\" on the lens of a camera, in response to the recent clashes in Kosovo. The political statement was criticized as inappropriate by France's minister of sports Amélie Oudéa-Castéra.[714]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Novak Djokovic career

He has been ranked as high as world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals, holding the ranking for a total of 16 weeks. Currently ranked world No. 3 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Medvedev has won 20 ATP Tour singles titles, including the 2021 US Open and 2020 ATP Finals. In the former, Medvedev defeated then-world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final to deny him the Grand Slam.[5] In the latter, he became the first and only player to defeat the top three ranked players in the world en route to the year-end championship title. He has also won six Masters titles, and contested five major finals. His six Masters titles all came in different venues, making him only the sixth player to win Masters titles at six different venues.Medvedev made his ATP Tour main draw debut at the singles event of the 2015 Kremlin Cup. In 2017, he participated in a major for the first time at Wimbledon, where he defeated world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka. In 2018, Medvedev won his first ATP Tour singles titles at Sydney and Winston-Salem, and his first ATP 500 title in Tokyo. He achieved a breakthrough in 2019, making his top 10 debut after Wimbledon and reaching six consecutive tournament finals, including at the US Open.[6][7] In February 2022, Medvedev became the first man outside of the Big Three to hold the world No. 1 ranking since Andy Murray, the third Russian man following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000, and the 27th man overall.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nDaniil Medvedev was born in Moscow to Sergey Medvedev and Olga Medvedeva. Daniil's father, a computer engineer, developed his own business of building materials sales, from the mid-1980s to the early 2010s.[9] Medvedev has two older sisters named Julia and Elena, 12 and 8 years his senior, respectively. When he was 6 years old, his mother noticed an advertisement for group tennis lessons at the pool where he was taking swimming lessons. His father encouraged him to enroll. Medvedev's first tennis teacher was Ekaterina Kryuchkova, a former coach of professional tennis player Vera Zvonareva among others.[10] Daniil's other childhood activities besides sport included harpsichord and guitar lessons.[11][12][13]\n\n\nMedvedev studied physics and maths at a specialized school before graduating early and enrolling in economics and commerce at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He later dropped out to focus on tennis.[13] He then switched to the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth, and Tourism, where he received his diploma as coach.[14] With his family he moved to Antibes, France where he trained at the tennis academy.[15] His parents have been living in France since then, as retirees.[12] As a result of living mostly overseas after turning 18, Medvedev can speak French and English fluently, besides his native Russian.[11]\n\n\nMedvedev married his girlfriend Daria Chernyshkova, a Moscow State University graduate and former juniors tennis player, in Moscow on 12 September 2018.[16][17] On October 14, 2022, they announced the birth of their daughter.[18]\nIn September 2019, he credited his marriage for the improvement of his tennis results: \"Before I made a proposal, I had been on the 65th place in the ranking, and then in ten months I've won two major tournaments and entered the top 10. We have significantly rebuilt our life, we work for each other. I earn [money], and Daria helps me to earn more\".[19] Daria also works as his assistant, e.g., she helps to procure travel visas, which is not easy with a Russian passport.[20] When he won the US Open on 12 September 2021, his first Grand Slam singles title, Medvedev joked, referring to the final being on the same day as his wedding anniversary, \"If I lose, I have no time to find a present. So I have to win this match.\"[21]\n\n\nMedvedev has been listed as an \"unsuitable\" subject for compulsory military service in the Russian Armed Forces because of minor health issues due to his preterm birth at 8 months.[12] Like many other Russian tennis players, Medvedev considered switching to the flag of Kazakhstan in the beginning of his professional career for a lack of support from the Russian Tennis Federation.[22][23] Sports psychologist Francisca Dauzet has been a part of his French-speaking entourage since 2018.[24] Medvedev is a supporter of FC Bayern Munich.[25]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev played his first junior match in July 2009 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Estonia.

After that, Medvedev said Young and French were friends. As both parties are black, he was disqualified mid-match for allegedly 'question[ing] the impartiality of the umpire based on her race'.[28]\n\n\n\n### 2017 First ATP final[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Medvedev reached his first ATP singles final. In the final at the Chennai Open he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in two sets. As a result, Medvedev jumped 34 positions from 99 to 65 in the ATP rankings, a new career-high.

He reached the final which he won against Australian Alex de Minaur. The final was the youngest ATP Tour tournament final since 2007, when a 20-year-old Rafael Nadal defeated a 19-year-old Novak Djokovic in the final of Indian Wells. It also was the tournament's youngest final since 1989.[32]\n\n\nIn August, Medvedev won his second ATP title at the 2018 Winston-Salem Open after defeating Steve Johnson in straight sets.[*citation needed*] In October, Medvedev won his first ATP 500 and third career ATP title in Tokyo as a qualifier, overcoming Japanese star and No. 3 seeded, Kei Nishikori, in straight sets in the final.

He returned to form on the grass courts of Queen's Club, reaching his sixth semifinal of the season where he lost to Gilles Simon. Medvedev made his top 10 debut after reaching the third round of Wimbledon.\n\n\nThe North American hard-court swing proved to be a momentous breakthrough in Medvedev's career, as he reached four tournament finals (in Washington, Montreal, Cincinnati, and the US Open), becoming only the third man in tennis history to do so (after Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi).[42] In Washington, he was defeated by Nick Kyrgios in the final. He followed this up with a strong performance at the Rogers Cup, reaching his first Masters final after beating top 10 players Dominic Thiem and Karen Khachanov.

He led Russia to the semifinals, where they were eliminated by the Serbian team after Medvedev lost to world No. 2 Novak Djokovic.[58] At the Australian Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by former champion Stan Wawrinka in five sets. During the February indoor season, Medvedev suffered early defeats in Rotterdam and Marseille.\n\n\nWhen the season resumed in August after a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Medvedev failed to defend his title at Cincinnati Masters, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in the quarterfinals. As the 3rd seed in the US Open, Medvedev reached the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Dominic Thiem.[59] At the French Open, Medvedev exited the tournament in the first round for the fourth consecutive year, losing to Márton Fucsovics. His struggles with form continued into the October indoor season, failing to string together more than two consecutive match wins in the St. Petersburg Open and Vienna Opens. Medvedev then resurged, winning his first title in a year at the Paris Masters.[60][61]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals, Medvedev won all his round-robin matches in straight sets, over Alexander Zverev, Novak Djokovic and Diego Schwartzman. Medvedev recovered from a set- and break-deficit to defeat Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, before beating Dominic Thiem in the final, once again coming from a set down.[62] With the victory, he became the first player to have defeated the world's top three players at the ATP Finals, and only the fourth player (after Djokovic, Boris Becker, and David Nalbandian) to have done so at any tournament since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990.[63][64]\n\n\n\n### 2021 US Open, Davis and ATP Cups champion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nAt the second edition of the ATP Cup in February, Medvedev led Russia to the title, going 4–0 in singles.

At Wimbledon, he reached the fourth round for the first time in his career.[70] There, he lost to Hubert Hurkacz in a match plagued by rain delays.[71] Medvedev entered both the men's singles and the men's doubles events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. In doubles, Medvedev and Aslan Karatsev were defeated in the first round by Slovakia's Filip Polášek and Lukáš Klein. In singles, he defeated Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, India's Sumit Nagal, and Italy's Fabio Fognini to reach the quarterfinals.[72][73] In the quarterfinals, he lost to Spain's Pablo Carreño Busta.[74] To start the North American hardcourt season, Medvedev competed at the Canadian Open, where he won the title by defeating Reilly Opelka in the final.[75] The following week, he competed at the Cincinnati Masters, reaching the semifinals where he was defeated by Andrey Rublev.[76]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Medvedev dropped just one set en route to his first major title, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.[77][78][79] The final received immense attention, as Djokovic was vying to become only the second man in the Open Era to achieve the calendar-year Grand Slam.[80]\n\n\nFollowing the US Open, Medvedev participated in the Laver Cup as part of Team Europe. Team Europe comfortably won the title, with Medvedev winning his match against Denis Shapovalov in straight sets.

Russia advanced to the semifinals of the tournament after Medvedev and Roman Safiullin went undefeated in doubles. There, Medvedev won his singles match against Canada's Félix Auger-Aliassime, but Russia was eliminated when Medvedev and Safiullin were defeated in the decisive doubles rubber.[85]\n\n\nIn January, Medvedev reached the final of the Australian Open for the second successive year. En route to the final, he beat home favorite Nick Kyrgios, world No. 10 Auger-Aliassime (saving match point), and world No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas.

At 5 hours and 24 minutes, it was the second longest Major final ever played.[86] In February, Medvedev was nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year award.[87]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the Mexican Open with the opportunity to gain the world number 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic. Medvedev reached the semifinals where he was defeated once again by Rafael Nadal in a rematch of the Australian Open final.[88] However, as Djokovic was also defeated in the Dubai quarterfinals being played simultaneously, Medvedev ascended to world number 1 for the first time. Medvedev thus became the first man outside of the Big Four to hold the top ranking since Andy Roddick in February 2004,[89] and the third Russian man to achieve the ranking, following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000.[90]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev lost to Gael Monfils in the third round. The loss resulted in his losing the number 1 ranking, with Novak Djokovic once again taking the top spot.[91] Medvedev had a chance to reclaim the number 1 ranking the following fortnight if he reached the semifinals at the Miami Masters, but fell one match short, losing to defending champion Hubert Hurkacz in the quarterfinals.[92]\n\n\nOn April 2, Medvedev announced that he would miss the beginning of the clay court season to recover from a hernia procedure.[93] On April 20, the All England Club announced a ban on all Russian and Belarusian players, including Medvedev, from competing at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[94]\n\n\nFollowing his recovery from surgery, Medvedev returned to play at the Geneva Open, where he lost his opening match to Richard Gasquet in straight sets.[95] At the French Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by Marin Čilić.[96] However, as Novak Djokovic failed to defend his title, Medvedev reclaimed the number 1 ranking.[97]\n\n\nMedvedev entered three tournaments in the grass court season, Rosmalen, Halle, and Mallorca. At his first event in Rosmalen, he reached the final without dropping a set before suffering a shock loss to world No. 205 Tim van Rijthoven.[98][99] He then reached the final at Halle, once again without dropping a set, where he lost to Hubert Hurkacz.[100][101] In Mallorca, Medvedev was defeated in the quarterfinals by Roberto Bautista Agut.[102]\n\n\nMedvedev started his North American summer hardcourt season by winning the title at the Los Cabos Open defeating Cameron Norrie in the final.[103] In his opening round match against Rinky Hijikata, he recorded his 250th career singles match win.[104] At the Canadian Open, Medvedev, who was the defending champion, lost his opening match to Nick Kyrgios.

This resulted in him dropping to world no. 7 in the year-end rankings.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Three consecutive titles, 300th win, 20th career title, US Open finalist[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev started the season at the Adelaide International where he reached the semifinals, losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[109] Seeded 7th at the Australian Open, he defeated opponents Marcos Giron and John Millman before losing to Sebastian Korda in straight sets in the third round.

Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their last seven.[124]\n\n\n\n### Alexander Zverev[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Zverev rivalry\n\nMedvedev and Zverev have faced each other 18 times with Medvedev leading the rivalry 11–7. Zverev won the first four matches of their rivalry, but Medvedev won ten of the last twelve of their encounters.[125]\n\n\n\n### Nadal and Djokovic[edit]\n\n\nOf his five major finals, Medvedev has twice faced Rafael Nadal (at the 2019 US Open and 2022 Australian Open) and thrice faced Novak Djokovic (at 2021 Australian Open, 2021 US Open, and 2023 US Open). His lone victory in major finals came at the 2021 US Open, where he defeated Djokovic in straight sets to win his first major title and deny Djokovic the Grand Slam. The following year, at the 2022 Australian Open, he was aiming to become the first man in the Open Era to win his second major title directly after the first, but lost to Nadal in an epic five-set match despite being two sets up.\n\n\nOverall, Medvedev's head-to-head against the two all-time greats is 1–5 against Nadal, and 5–10 against Djokovic.\n\n\n\n## Playing style and mentality[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is a counterpuncher. Standing at 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) tall, he has an very powerful first serve capable of reaching 148 mph (232 km/h). He hits long, flat groundstrokes, often wearing opponents down with lengthy baseline rallies. Medvedev's biggest weapon is his ability to play consistently. He has not thrived on power and spin but has been able to land the ball between the lines over and over again.[126]\n\n\nMedvedev is also known for his strong return of serve. He tends to adopt a very deep position at the back of the court which allows him to hit full-swing groundstrokes rather than blocking the serve back into play.[127] He also possesses one of the best backhands on tour. His forehand is generally the weaker shot of the two. He is known for his very defensive play. Medvedev is a moderately strong competitor mentally, evident in his attitude on the court, playing style, and demeanor in big matches.[126] According to Francisca Dauzet, the performance coach he has been working with since 2018, he has “monstrous mental potential” and is learning to control his impatience. He has at times been “unable to channel his outbursts”, but Dauzet describes him as a quick learner who is \"fast at catching things\".[128]\n\n\nMedvedev's preferred surface is hardcourt and he has been one of the very best and most consistent players on the surface since he first broke through to the top 10 in 2019. He struggles much more on clay due to his extremely flat strokes and the fact that his movement, one of his biggest strengths on a hardcourt, is hampered. He has still achieved solid results on the surface.\n\n\nWith his playing style, Novak Djokovic has described Medvedev as a very complete player and in October 2019 Alexander Zverev called him the best player in the world. 2019 ATP Finals champion, Stefanos Tsitsipas, once described his way of playing as \"very boring\"; but later said \"he just plays extremely smart and outplays you\".[129][130][131][132]\n\n\nMedvedev has sometimes had an antagonistic relationship with crowds. In the 2023 US Open Medvedev lashed out at the crowd, asking if they were stupid and asking them to shut up.[133]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is endorsed by Lacoste for apparel and shoes, Tecnifibre for racquets, and Bovet for watches.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 1 in men's singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals, holding the ranking for a total of 16 weeks. Currently ranked world No. 3 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Medvedev has won 20 ATP Tour singles titles, including the 2021 US Open and 2020 ATP Finals. In the former, Medvedev defeated then-world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the final to deny him the Grand Slam.[5] In the latter, he became the first and only player to defeat the top three ranked players in the world en route to the year-end championship title. He has also won six Masters titles, and contested five major finals. His six Masters titles all came in different venues, making him only the sixth player to win Masters titles at six different venues.Medvedev made his ATP Tour main draw debut at the singles event of the 2015 Kremlin Cup. In 2017, he participated in a major for the first time at Wimbledon, where he defeated world No. 3 Stan Wawrinka. In 2018, Medvedev won his first ATP Tour singles titles at Sydney and Winston-Salem, and his first ATP 500 title in Tokyo. He achieved a breakthrough in 2019, making his top 10 debut after Wimbledon and reaching six consecutive tournament finals, including at the US Open.[6][7] In February 2022, Medvedev became the first man outside of the Big Three to hold the world No. 1 ranking since Andy Murray, the third Russian man following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000, and the 27th man overall.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nDaniil Medvedev was born in Moscow to Sergey Medvedev and Olga Medvedeva. Daniil's father, a computer engineer, developed his own business of building materials sales, from the mid-1980s to the early 2010s.[9] Medvedev has two older sisters named Julia and Elena, 12 and 8 years his senior, respectively. When he was 6 years old, his mother noticed an advertisement for group tennis lessons at the pool where he was taking swimming lessons. His father encouraged him to enroll. Medvedev's first tennis teacher was Ekaterina Kryuchkova, a former coach of professional tennis player Vera Zvonareva among others.[10] Daniil's other childhood activities besides sport included harpsichord and guitar lessons.[11][12][13]\n\n\nMedvedev studied physics and maths at a specialized school before graduating early and enrolling in economics and commerce at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He later dropped out to focus on tennis.[13] He then switched to the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth, and Tourism, where he received his diploma as coach.[14] With his family he moved to Antibes, France where he trained at the tennis academy.[15] His parents have been living in France since then, as retirees.[12] As a result of living mostly overseas after turning 18, Medvedev can speak French and English fluently, besides his native Russian.[11]\n\n\nMedvedev married his girlfriend Daria Chernyshkova, a Moscow State University graduate and former juniors tennis player, in Moscow on 12 September 2018.[16][17] On October 14, 2022, they announced the birth of their daughter.[18]\nIn September 2019, he credited his marriage for the improvement of his tennis results: \"Before I made a proposal, I had been on the 65th place in the ranking, and then in ten months I've won two major tournaments and entered the top 10. We have significantly rebuilt our life, we work for each other. I earn [money], and Daria helps me to earn more\".[19] Daria also works as his assistant, e.g., she helps to procure travel visas, which is not easy with a Russian passport.[20] When he won the US Open on 12 September 2021, his first Grand Slam singles title, Medvedev joked, referring to the final being on the same day as his wedding anniversary, \"If I lose, I have no time to find a present. So I have to win this match.\"[21]\n\n\nMedvedev has been listed as an \"unsuitable\" subject for compulsory military service in the Russian Armed Forces because of minor health issues due to his preterm birth at 8 months.[12] Like many other Russian tennis players, Medvedev considered switching to the flag of Kazakhstan in the beginning of his professional career for a lack of support from the Russian Tennis Federation.[22][23] Sports psychologist Francisca Dauzet has been a part of his French-speaking entourage since 2018.[24] Medvedev is a supporter of FC Bayern Munich.[25]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev played his first junior match in July 2009 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Estonia. In December 2010, he won his first junior title as a qualifier at just his third tournament.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n2012–2013 would see Medvedev surge on the junior circuit as he won six titles between October 2012 and July 2013 which included four consecutive titles. He made his junior Grand Slam debut at 2013 Junior Wimbledon where he won his first round match against Hong Seong-chan but lost in the second round to 2nd seed Nikola Milojević. At the 2013 Junior US Open, he went into the tournament seeded 10th and made the third round where he lost to Johan Tatlot.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev reached his career-high junior ranking of world No. 13 at the beginning of 2014 and went into the 2014 Junior Australian Open seeded 8th. He ended his junior career after a first round loss at 2014 Junior Wimbledon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev ended his junior career with an overall win–loss record of 109–43 and wins over several future stars including Alexander Zverev and Reilly Opelka.[26]\n\n\nJunior Grand Slam results – singles:\n\n\nAustralian Open: 3R (2014)  \n\nFrench Open: 3R (2014)  \n\nWimbledon: 2R (2013)  \n\nUS Open: 3R (2013)\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2015–2016 Early pro career[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev made his ATP main draw debut at the 2015 Kremlin Cup, partnering Aslan Karatsev in the doubles event. The two defeated Aliaksandr Bury and Denis Istomin in the first round but were defeated by Radu Albot and František Čermák in the second round.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev at the 2015 Nice Open\nAs a qualifier, Medvedev made his ATP singles main draw debut at the 2016 Nice Open, losing to Guido Pella in three sets. Three weeks later he earned his first singles ATP World Tour win at the 2016 Ricoh Open, defeating Horacio Zeballos in straight sets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev was disqualified from the second round of the Savannah Challenger event (in Georgia, U.S.) for comments he made after the umpire ruled in favor of his opponent.[27] Medvedev thought he had won a break point against his opponent Donald Young's serve, but chair umpire Sandy French ruled that his returning shot had gone out. After that, Medvedev said Young and French were friends. As both parties are black, he was disqualified mid-match for allegedly 'question[ing] the impartiality of the umpire based on her race'.[28]\n\n\n\n### 2017 First ATP final[edit]\n\n\nIn January 2017, Medvedev reached his first ATP singles final. In the final at the Chennai Open he lost to Roberto Bautista Agut in two sets. As a result, Medvedev jumped 34 positions from 99 to 65 in the ATP rankings, a new career-high. In February, he advanced to the quarterfinals of both the Open Sud de France and the Open 13, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Lucas Pouille respectively.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn June, he made it to the quarterfinals of the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships, defeating the 6th seed, Robin Haase, and Thanasi Kokkinakis before losing to Ivo Karlović in straight sets. At the Aegon Championships, he advanced to his first ATP 500 quarterfinal by beating Nicolas Mahut and Kokkinakis in the first two rounds, before losing to the No. 6 seed, Grigor Dimitrov, in the quarterfinals. One week later, he on grass advanced to the semifinal of Eastbourne International, losing to Novak Djokovic.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev registered his maiden Grand Slam match win at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, defeating fifth seed and world No. 3, Stan Wawrinka, in the first round in four sets.[29] He lost in the next round to Ruben Bemelmans.[30] Medvedev was handed three fines totaling $14,500 (£11,200) for his conduct during the match with Bemelmans: $7,000 for insulting the umpire on two occasions and $7,500 for throwing coins under the umpire's chair.[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev serving at the 2017 Queen's Club Championships\n### 2018 First ATP titles[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev started the 2018 season by qualifying for the Sydney International. He reached the final which he won against Australian Alex de Minaur. The final was the youngest ATP Tour tournament final since 2007, when a 20-year-old Rafael Nadal defeated a 19-year-old Novak Djokovic in the final of Indian Wells. It also was the tournament's youngest final since 1989.[32]\n\n\nIn August, Medvedev won his second ATP title at the 2018 Winston-Salem Open after defeating Steve Johnson in straight sets.[*citation needed*] In October, Medvedev won his first ATP 500 and third career ATP title in Tokyo as a qualifier, overcoming Japanese star and No. 3 seeded, Kei Nishikori, in straight sets in the final. This triumph brought him to a new career high ranking of No. 22 and made him the No. 1 player in Russia. The victory also marked the third consecutive final that Medvedev had beaten the home favorite in to win the title. Medvedev reached the Kremlin Cup semifinal, losing to his countryman and eventual champion Karen Khachanov. One week later, he made the semifinals at the ATP 500 Swiss Indoors event, which he lost to Roger Federer. After the tournament, he achieved a new career high ranking of world No. 16.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMedvedev finished 2018 with the most hard court match wins of any player on the ATP Tour (38 wins). He also had the most titles on hard court tournaments (3 titles), tying with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Karen Khachanov.[33]\n\n\n\n### 2019 Two Masters titles, US Open final[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev started the season strongly by reaching the final of the Brisbane International, defeating Andy Murray, Milos Raonic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga en route, but then lost to Kei Nishikori.[34] At the Australian Open, he was seeded 15th, the first time he was seeded at a major. He reached the round of 16 for the first time in his career, where he was defeated by eventual champion Novak Djokovic.[35] In February, Medvedev won his fourth ATP title at the Sofia Open, beating Márton Fucsovics in the final.[36] The following week, Medvedev lost in the semifinals of Rotterdam to Gaël Monfils. Medvedev entered the Monte Carlo Masters having only won two of his 13 career matches on clay courts. Despite this, he reached his first ever Masters 1000 quarterfinal at the event after defeating world No. 8 Stefanos Tsitsipas.[37] In the quarterfinals, Medvedev earned his first triumph over a world number 1 ranked player, when he defeated Djokovic in three sets.[38] His run ended in the semifinals against Dušan Lajović.[39] At the Barcelona Open, Medvedev earned his third successive top 10 victory (this time over Kei Nishikori) to reach his first clay-court final.[40] There, he was defeated by world No. 5 Dominic Thiem.[41] Following his victory over Nishikori, Medvedev experienced a five-match losing streak, including an opening-round defeat at the French Open. He returned to form on the grass courts of Queen's Club, reaching his sixth semifinal of the season where he lost to Gilles Simon. Medvedev made his top 10 debut after reaching the third round of Wimbledon.\n\n\nThe North American hard-court swing proved to be a momentous breakthrough in Medvedev's career, as he reached four tournament finals (in Washington, Montreal, Cincinnati, and the US Open), becoming only the third man in tennis history to do so (after Ivan Lendl and Andre Agassi).[42] In Washington, he was defeated by Nick Kyrgios in the final. He followed this up with a strong performance at the Rogers Cup, reaching his first Masters final after beating top 10 players Dominic Thiem and Karen Khachanov. In the final, he was defeated by defending champion Rafael Nadal. Medvedev would reach a second consecutive Masters final at Cincinnati after beating defending champion Djokovic for the second time, where he defeated David Goffin in straight sets for his first Masters title.[43]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the US Open as the world No. 5.[44] In his second round match, he fought off cramping to defeat Hugo Dellien in four sets.[45] He then defeated Feliciano López in a contentious match for which he was fined $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and $4,000 for flipping off the crowd.[46][47] Medvedev next recovered from a set and a break deficit to beat Dominik Köpfer and reach his first Major quarterfinal.[48] He then beat former champion Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals and Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals to reach his first Grand Slam final.[49][50] There, Medvedev was defeated by Rafael Nadal in five sets.[51]\n\n\nMedvedev followed up his success in North America with his maiden title on Russian soil at the St. Petersburg Open, to become the first Russian to win the tournament in 15 years.[52][53] Medvedev then won a second consecutive title at the Shanghai Masters, defeating Alexander Zverev in the final.[54] By reaching the final, Medvedev became the 7th man since 2000 to reach at least nine finals in a season.[55][56][57] He ended the season losing his last four matches, including all three round robin matches in his ATP Finals debut.\n\n\n\n### 2020 ATP Finals champion, third Masters title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medvedev at the 2020 Australian Open\nMedvedev opened his season at the inaugural edition of the ATP Cup as Russia's top ranked singles player. He led Russia to the semifinals, where they were eliminated by the Serbian team after Medvedev lost to world No. 2 Novak Djokovic.[58] At the Australian Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by former champion Stan Wawrinka in five sets. During the February indoor season, Medvedev suffered early defeats in Rotterdam and Marseille.\n\n\nWhen the season resumed in August after a six-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Medvedev failed to defend his title at Cincinnati Masters, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in the quarterfinals. As the 3rd seed in the US Open, Medvedev reached the semifinals before losing to eventual champion Dominic Thiem.[59] At the French Open, Medvedev exited the tournament in the first round for the fourth consecutive year, losing to Márton Fucsovics. His struggles with form continued into the October indoor season, failing to string together more than two consecutive match wins in the St. Petersburg Open and Vienna Opens. Medvedev then resurged, winning his first title in a year at the Paris Masters.[60][61]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals, Medvedev won all his round-robin matches in straight sets, over Alexander Zverev, Novak Djokovic and Diego Schwartzman. Medvedev recovered from a set- and break-deficit to defeat Rafael Nadal in the semifinals, before beating Dominic Thiem in the final, once again coming from a set down.[62] With the victory, he became the first player to have defeated the world's top three players at the ATP Finals, and only the fourth player (after Djokovic, Boris Becker, and David Nalbandian) to have done so at any tournament since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990.[63][64]\n\n\n\n### 2021 US Open, Davis and ATP Cups champion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nAt the second edition of the ATP Cup in February, Medvedev led Russia to the title, going 4–0 in singles. This included 3 top ten victories (over Diego Schwartzman, Alexander Zverev, and Matteo Berrettini) extending his win streak over top 10 opponents to ten wins.[65] Medvedev then reached his second Grand Slam final at the Australian Open after straight sets victories over Andrey Rublev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, extending his win streak against top 10 opponents to twelve wins, and his overall win streak to twenty wins. In the final, he was defeated by the defending champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[66]\n\n\nMedvedev won his first title of the season at the Open 13 in Marseille, defeating Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the final.[67] With the win, Medvedev ascended to world number 2 in the ATP rankings, becoming the first man outside of the Big Four to occupy a position in the top 2 since Lleyton Hewitt in July 2005.[68] On 13 April, Medvedev tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced to withdraw from the 2021 Monte-Carlo Masters.[69] At the French Open, Medvedev reached the quarterfinals, where he lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith the grass-court season, Medvedev took a wildcard to play in the Mallorca Championships, where he won his first career grass-court title. At Wimbledon, he reached the fourth round for the first time in his career.[70] There, he lost to Hubert Hurkacz in a match plagued by rain delays.[71] Medvedev entered both the men's singles and the men's doubles events at the 2020 Summer Olympics. In doubles, Medvedev and Aslan Karatsev were defeated in the first round by Slovakia's Filip Polášek and Lukáš Klein. In singles, he defeated Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik, India's Sumit Nagal, and Italy's Fabio Fognini to reach the quarterfinals.[72][73] In the quarterfinals, he lost to Spain's Pablo Carreño Busta.[74] To start the North American hardcourt season, Medvedev competed at the Canadian Open, where he won the title by defeating Reilly Opelka in the final.[75] The following week, he competed at the Cincinnati Masters, reaching the semifinals where he was defeated by Andrey Rublev.[76]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Medvedev dropped just one set en route to his first major title, defeating Novak Djokovic in the final.[77][78][79] The final received immense attention, as Djokovic was vying to become only the second man in the Open Era to achieve the calendar-year Grand Slam.[80]\n\n\nFollowing the US Open, Medvedev participated in the Laver Cup as part of Team Europe. Team Europe comfortably won the title, with Medvedev winning his match against Denis Shapovalov in straight sets. At the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev was upset in the fourth round by Grigor Dimitrov.[81] At the Paris Masters, Medvedev reached the final for the second consecutive year, but lost to Novak Djokovic in three sets.[82] In his third ATP Finals, Medvedev qualified for the semifinals after winning all of his group matches. He there defeated Casper Ruud, but lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the final.[83] Medvedev ended his 2021 season by leading Russia to the Davis Cup title, not dropping a set through his five singles matches.[84]\n\n\n\n### 2022 Australian Open final, world No. 1[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev represented Russia in the third edition of the ATP Cup. Russia advanced to the semifinals of the tournament after Medvedev and Roman Safiullin went undefeated in doubles. There, Medvedev won his singles match against Canada's Félix Auger-Aliassime, but Russia was eliminated when Medvedev and Safiullin were defeated in the decisive doubles rubber.[85]\n\n\nIn January, Medvedev reached the final of the Australian Open for the second successive year. En route to the final, he beat home favorite Nick Kyrgios, world No. 10 Auger-Aliassime (saving match point), and world No. 4 Stefanos Tsitsipas. In the final, he was defeated in five epic sets by Rafael Nadal despite taking a two-set lead. At 5 hours and 24 minutes, it was the second longest Major final ever played.[86] In February, Medvedev was nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for Breakthrough of the Year award.[87]\n\n\nMedvedev entered the Mexican Open with the opportunity to gain the world number 1 ranking from Novak Djokovic. Medvedev reached the semifinals where he was defeated once again by Rafael Nadal in a rematch of the Australian Open final.[88] However, as Djokovic was also defeated in the Dubai quarterfinals being played simultaneously, Medvedev ascended to world number 1 for the first time. Medvedev thus became the first man outside of the Big Four to hold the top ranking since Andy Roddick in February 2004,[89] and the third Russian man to achieve the ranking, following Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 1999 and Marat Safin in 2000.[90]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Masters, Medvedev lost to Gael Monfils in the third round. The loss resulted in his losing the number 1 ranking, with Novak Djokovic once again taking the top spot.[91] Medvedev had a chance to reclaim the number 1 ranking the following fortnight if he reached the semifinals at the Miami Masters, but fell one match short, losing to defending champion Hubert Hurkacz in the quarterfinals.[92]\n\n\nOn April 2, Medvedev announced that he would miss the beginning of the clay court season to recover from a hernia procedure.[93] On April 20, the All England Club announced a ban on all Russian and Belarusian players, including Medvedev, from competing at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[94]\n\n\nFollowing his recovery from surgery, Medvedev returned to play at the Geneva Open, where he lost his opening match to Richard Gasquet in straight sets.[95] At the French Open, Medvedev was eliminated in the fourth round by Marin Čilić.[96] However, as Novak Djokovic failed to defend his title, Medvedev reclaimed the number 1 ranking.[97]\n\n\nMedvedev entered three tournaments in the grass court season, Rosmalen, Halle, and Mallorca. At his first event in Rosmalen, he reached the final without dropping a set before suffering a shock loss to world No. 205 Tim van Rijthoven.[98][99] He then reached the final at Halle, once again without dropping a set, where he lost to Hubert Hurkacz.[100][101] In Mallorca, Medvedev was defeated in the quarterfinals by Roberto Bautista Agut.[102]\n\n\nMedvedev started his North American summer hardcourt season by winning the title at the Los Cabos Open defeating Cameron Norrie in the final.[103] In his opening round match against Rinky Hijikata, he recorded his 250th career singles match win.[104] At the Canadian Open, Medvedev, who was the defending champion, lost his opening match to Nick Kyrgios. At the Cincinnati Masters, Medvedev was defeated by Stefanos Tsitsipas in the semifinals. Medvedev was yet again defeated by Kyrgios at the US Open, resulting in Medvedev losing his number one ranking.[105]\n\n\nMedvedev began the fall indoor-hardcourt season by competing at the Moselle Open, where he lost his opening match to Stan Wawrinka in three sets. Medvedev next competed at the Astana Open where he reached the semifinals. In his semifinal match, against Novak Djokovic, Medvedev was forced to retire with the match level at one-set-all with a leg injury.[106][107] Medvedev returned to play at the Vienna Open where he defeated Denis Shapovalov in the final to win his second title of the year, and second ATP 500 title of his career.[108] Medvedev finished the year on a 4 match losing skid, losing in the opening round in Paris Masters, and losing all three of his round robin matches in the ATP Finals in third-set tiebreakers. This resulted in him dropping to world no. 7 in the year-end rankings.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Three consecutive titles, 300th win, 20th career title, US Open finalist[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Daniil Medvedev tennis season\n\nMedvedev started the season at the Adelaide International where he reached the semifinals, losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[109] Seeded 7th at the Australian Open, he defeated opponents Marcos Giron and John Millman before losing to Sebastian Korda in straight sets in the third round. As a result, Medvedev dropped out of the Top 10 to World No. 12.\n\n\nIn February, Medvedev entered the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam seeded 6th, where he made it to the finals whilst dropping only one set. In the final, he defeated Italian No. 1 Jannik Sinner in three sets,[110] thus returning back to the Top 10. The following week, Medvedev entered the Qatar ExxonMobil Open seeded third and won the tournament, defeating Andy Murray in straight sets in the final.\n\n\nIn March, Medvedev defeated No. 2 seed Andrey Rublev in straight sets in an all-Russian final to win in Dubai his third title in three weeks,[111] and his 18th title overall thus winning titles in 18 different cities and becoming the first man in the Open Era to accomplish the feat.[112] In this tournament, he did not drop a set including his win against No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic, snapping his 20-match winning streak.[113] As a result he moved back to world No. 6 on 6 March 2023.\n\n\nAt the next Masters 1000 Indian Wells Masters he reached back-to-back quarterfinals defeating 12th seed Alexander Zverev. His victories against 23rd seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and 14h seed Frances Tiafoe propelled him into the final.[114] In the final, he lost to Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets but reentered the Top 5.[115] In Miami he reached back-to-back finals defeating 14th seed Karen Khachanov and won his 19th title in a 19th different city defeating tenth seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets. He moved to world No. 4 in the rankings on 3 April 2023.[116]\n\n\nMedvedev began his clay court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters, where he reached his sixth consecutive quarterfinal with wins over Lorenzo Sonego and 13th seed Alexander Zverev but he lost to sixth seed Holger Rune in the quarterfinals, ending his streak of five consecutive finals.\nAt the next Masters in Madrid he recorded his 300th win over first-time qualifier and compatriot Alexander Shevchenko in the third round.[117] He lost to qualifier, another compatriot Aslan Karatsev in the fourth round. In Rome he reached the semifinals at a Masters 1000 clay-court event for just the second time (after Monte-Carlo 2019) defeating qualifier Yannick Hanfmann.[118] Next he defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas to reach only his second final on clay. He won his first clay title defeating Holger Rune, having won 20 titles in 20 different cities. As a result he returned to world No. 2 in the singles rankings on 22 May 2023.[119] Medvedev entered the French Open as the second seed but lost in his first round match against Thiago Seyboth Wild.\n\n\nAt the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, he was seeded 3rd and reached the semifinals for the first time at this Major. Following wins over wildcard Arthur Fery, Adrian Mannarino, Márton Fucsovics, Jiří Lehečka, and Christopher Eubanks in a tight five set match, he set up a semifinal clash with Carlos Alcaraz but lost in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the US Summer Hard Court Swing, Medvedev made the quarterfinals at the Rogers Cup and reached the fourth round at the Cincinnati Masters, losing to Alex De Minaur and Alexander Zverev respectively.[120] Next, at the 2023 US Open, he reached the final following wins over Attila Balazs, Christopher O'Connell, Sebastian Baez, Alex De Minaur, fellow countryman Andrey Rublev, and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals to set up a rematch of the 2021 final with Novak Djokovic. Djokovic won in straight sets on Sunday, September 10. Due to his US Open run, he was the third player to qualify for the 2023 ATP Finals on September 5.[121]\n\n\nAt the Asian Swing, Medvedev reached the final of the China Open where he lost Jannik Sinner straight sets. [122] At the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he recorded his 60th win of the season to reach the third round over Cristian Garin, after Carlos Alcaraz did the same.[123]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tennis rivalries\n\n### Stefanos Tsitsipas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Tsitsipas rivalry\n\nDaniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas have faced each other 13 times since 2018, with Medvedev leading the rivalry, 9–4. Medvedev won his first five matches against Tsitsipas, but Tsitsipas has won four of their last seven.[124]\n\n\n\n### Alexander Zverev[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medvedev–Zverev rivalry\n\nMedvedev and Zverev have faced each other 18 times with Medvedev leading the rivalry 11–7. Zverev won the first four matches of their rivalry, but Medvedev won ten of the last twelve of their encounters.[125]\n\n\n\n### Nadal and Djokovic[edit]\n\n\nOf his five major finals, Medvedev has twice faced Rafael Nadal (at the 2019 US Open and 2022 Australian Open) and thrice faced Novak Djokovic (at 2021 Australian Open, 2021 US Open, and 2023 US Open). His lone victory in major finals came at the 2021 US Open, where he defeated Djokovic in straight sets to win his first major title and deny Djokovic the Grand Slam. The following year, at the 2022 Australian Open, he was aiming to become the first man in the Open Era to win his second major title directly after the first, but lost to Nadal in an epic five-set match despite being two sets up.\n\n\nOverall, Medvedev's head-to-head against the two all-time greats is 1–5 against Nadal, and 5–10 against Djokovic.\n\n\n\n## Playing style and mentality[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is a counterpuncher. Standing at 1.98 m (6 ft 6 in) tall, he has an very powerful first serve capable of reaching 148 mph (232 km/h). He hits long, flat groundstrokes, often wearing opponents down with lengthy baseline rallies. Medvedev's biggest weapon is his ability to play consistently. He has not thrived on power and spin but has been able to land the ball between the lines over and over again.[126]\n\n\nMedvedev is also known for his strong return of serve. He tends to adopt a very deep position at the back of the court which allows him to hit full-swing groundstrokes rather than blocking the serve back into play.[127] He also possesses one of the best backhands on tour. His forehand is generally the weaker shot of the two. He is known for his very defensive play. Medvedev is a moderately strong competitor mentally, evident in his attitude on the court, playing style, and demeanor in big matches.[126] According to Francisca Dauzet, the performance coach he has been working with since 2018, he has “monstrous mental potential” and is learning to control his impatience. He has at times been “unable to channel his outbursts”, but Dauzet describes him as a quick learner who is \"fast at catching things\".[128]\n\n\nMedvedev's preferred surface is hardcourt and he has been one of the very best and most consistent players on the surface since he first broke through to the top 10 in 2019. He struggles much more on clay due to his extremely flat strokes and the fact that his movement, one of his biggest strengths on a hardcourt, is hampered. He has still achieved solid results on the surface.\n\n\nWith his playing style, Novak Djokovic has described Medvedev as a very complete player and in October 2019 Alexander Zverev called him the best player in the world. 2019 ATP Finals champion, Stefanos Tsitsipas, once described his way of playing as \"very boring\"; but later said \"he just plays extremely smart and outplays you\".[129][130][131][132]\n\n\nMedvedev has sometimes had an antagonistic relationship with crowds. In the 2023 US Open Medvedev lashed out at the crowd, asking if they were stupid and asking them to shut up.[133]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nMedvedev is endorsed by Lacoste for apparel and shoes, Tecnifibre for racquets, and Bovet for watches. He also has been employed as an ambassador by BMW, Tinkoff Bank, and HyperX for gaming accessories, mostly for the Russian-speaking world. He was previously endorsed by Lotto for apparel and shoes until 2019.[134][135] Since November 2021, he has been signed as a promoter of the Guojiao 1573 brand.[136]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Daniil Medvedev career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 1R | 2R | 4R | 4R | F | F | 3R |  | 0 / 7\n | 21–7\n | 75%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | 1R | 1R | 1R | 1R | QF | 4R | 1R |  | 0 / 7\n | 7–7\n | 50%\n |\n| Wimbledon | Q3 | 2R | 3R | 3R | NH\n | 4R | A[a] | SF |  | 0 / 5\n | 13–5\n | 72%\n |\n| US Open | Q1 | 1R | 3R | F | SF | **W** | 4R | F |  | 1 / 7\n | 29–6\n | 83%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 1–4\n | 5–4\n | 11–4\n | 8–3\n | 20–3\n | 12–3\n | 13–4\n |  | 1 / 26\n | 70–25\n | 74%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Finals: 5 (1 title, 4 runners-ups)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss | 2019 | US Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 5–7, 3–6, 7–5, 6–4, 4–6\n |\n| Loss | 2021 | Australian Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 5–7, 2–6, 2–6\n |\n| Win | 2021 | US Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 6–4, 6–4, 6–4\n |\n| Loss | 2022 | Australian Open | Hard | ![Spain](image) Rafael Nadal | 6–2, 7–6(7–5), 4–6, 4–6, 5–7 |\n| Loss | 2023 | US Open | Hard | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 3–6, 6–7(5–7), 3–6\n |\n\n\n### Year-end championship finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles 2 (1 title, 1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win\n | 2020 | ATP Finals, London\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem | 4–6, 7–6(7–2), 6–4\n |\n| Loss\n | 2021 | ATP Finals, Turin\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Germany](image) Alexander Zverev | 4–6, 4–6\n |\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\n* These records were attained in the Open Era.\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019 | 4 consecutive finals of the North American swing/US Open Series | Ivan LendlAndre Agassi[42] |\n| 2020\n | Defeated the world No. 1, 2, and 3 in one tournament | Boris BeckerNovak DjokovicDavid Nalbandian |\n| 2020\n | Defeated the world No. 1, 2, and 3 to win the ATP Finals | **Stands alone**[138] |\n| 2021\n | Winner of the two premier team competitions (ATP Cup & Davis Cup) in a single season | Andrey RublevFélix Auger-Aliassime |\n| 2021\n | Undefeated winner of the two premier team competitions (ATP Cup & Davis Cup) in a single season\n | **Stands alone** |\n| 2021\n | Tallest Grand Slam champion (6'6\" – 2021 US Open) | Juan Martín del PotroMarin Čilić[139] |\n| 2022\n | Tallest World number 1 | **Stands alone** |\n| 2023\n | Winner of his first 20 tour-level titles in 20 different cities | **Stands alone**[140] |\n| 2023\n | Winner of both the Miami Open and Italian Open in the same season\n | Andre AgassiNovak Djokovic |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External image |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) Medvedev's parents, Sergey and Olga in 2019, receive the Russian Cup[141] |\n\n\nNational\n* The Russian Cup in the nominations:\n\t+ Male Tennis Player of the Year: 2019, 2021;\n\t+ Team of the Year: 2019, 2021.[141]\n* ![](image) Sports title \"Merited Master of Sports of Russia\" (2019)[142]\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Russian athletes were banned from competing following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[137][94]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Daniil Medvedev\". *ATP World Tour*.

Alcaraz has won twelve ATP Tour-level singles titles, including two major titles (at the 2022 US Open and 2023 Wimbledon Championships) and four Masters 1000 titles. Following his win at the 2022 US Open, Alcaraz became the youngest man and the first teenager in the Open Era to top the singles rankings, at 19 years, 4 months, and 6 days old.[5][6][7]\n\n\n\nAs a junior, Alcaraz was ranked as high as world No. 22 and won two titles on the ITF Junior Circuit. After turning professional in 2018, he won three titles on the ITF Men's World Tennis Tour and four on the ATP Challenger Tour and broke into the top 100 in rankings in May 2021. Two months later, Alcaraz won his first ATP title at the Croatia Open, an ATP 250 tournament. He later entered the top 50 after reaching the quarterfinals at the following US Open and won the year end Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan. After winning his first ATP 500 title at the Rio Open in February 2022, Alcaraz won his first Masters 1000 title at the Miami Open and his second ATP 500 title at the Barcelona Open in April, propelling him into the top 10. In September 2022, Alcaraz defeated Casper Ruud in the US Open final to win his first major singles title. In May 2023, he was awarded the Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year award. In July 2023, Alcaraz won Wimbledon, defeating seven-time and defending champion Novak Djokovic in the final to claim his second major singles title. \n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nCarlos Alcaraz Garfia was born on 5 May 2003, in El Palmar, Murcia, Spain, to parents Carlos Alcaraz González and Virginia Garfia Escandón. He has three siblings.\n\n\nAlcaraz started playing tennis at the age of four at the Real Sociedad Club de Campo de Murcia (Royal Society Murciashire Club), where his father was the tennis academy director. Alcaraz' father was a former professional player, but stopped playing when he couldn't afford to any longer. In 2018, he moved to Villena to begin training at Juan Carlos Ferrero's Equelite JC Ferrero Sport Academy.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2020: ATP debut[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, at the age of 16, Alcaraz made his ATP main-draw debut at the Rio Open after receiving a wildcard for the singles main draw. There, he defeated Albert Ramos Viñolas.[10] Alcaraz was defeated in the second round by Federico Coria.\n\n\n\n### 2021: First title, Next-Gen Finals champion, top 35[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2021 French Open\nAt age 17, Alcaraz made it to the main draw of the Australian Open, making him the youngest participant in the men's singles.[11] He won his Grand Slam tournament debut defeating fellow qualifier Botic van de Zandschulp in straight sets before losing in the second round to Mikael Ymer.[12]\n\n\nAlcaraz became the youngest match winner in the Madrid Open's history, defeating Adrian Mannarino as a wildcard and breaking then-18-year-old Rafael Nadal's record from 2004. In the second round, he lost to five-time champion Nadal on Alcaraz's 18th birthday.[13][14][15]\nBy winning the biggest title of his career until then at the 2021 Open de Oeiras III Challenger tournament, he entered the top 100 as the youngest player at the age of 18 on 24 May 2021.[16][17]\n\n\nAt the French Open, Alcaraz reached the third round of a major for the first time in his career by defeating Nikoloz Basilashvili.\n\n\nIn July 2021, he reached his first ATP final at the 2021 Croatia Open Umag, defeating top seed Albert Ramos Viñolas.[18] He then won his maiden ATP title by defeating Richard Gasquet and becoming the youngest tour-level champion since 18-year-old Kei Nishikori won the Delray Beach Open in 2008. Alcaraz was the youngest Spaniard to win an ATP Tour title since Nadal claimed his first trophy in Sopot in 2004.[19]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, he lost in the second round to Daniil Medvedev. At the Winston-Salem Open, Alcaraz reached the round of 16 defeating qualifier Alexei Popyrin, and his second tour-level quarterfinal of the season defeating fourth seed Márton Fucsovics.[20] He defeated Marcos Giron to reach the semifinals,[21] where he lost to Mikael Ymer.\n\n\nAt the US Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas in a fifth-set tiebreak to reach the fourth round in the biggest win of his career.[22] At 18 years of age, Alcaraz became the youngest man in a major fourth round since 17-year-old Andrei Medvedev at the 1992 French Open, and the youngest man in the US Open fourth round since 17-year-old Michael Chang and 18-year-old Pete Sampras in 1989.[23][24] He then reached the quarterfinals by defeating qualifier Peter Gojowczyk. Alcaraz became the youngest US Open men's quarterfinalist in the Open Era, the youngest at the tournament since 18-year-old Thomaz Koch in 1963, and the youngest Grand Slam tournament men's singles quarterfinalist since 18-year-old Michael Chang at the 1990 French Open. He then lost to Félix Auger-Aliassime via retirement in the second set in the quarterfinals after injuring his leg.[25]\n\n\nAt the Erste Bank Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 7 Matteo Berrettini, his second win over a top-10 player,[26] and became the youngest player in the top 35 on 1 November. During his Paris Masters run, Alcaraz defeated French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert in three thrilling sets in the first round.[27] He then defeated Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the second round, his third win over a top-10 player.[28] In the third round, he was defeated by Hugo Gaston in straight sets.[29]\n\n\nAt the Next Gen ATP Finals, Alcaraz defeated Brandon Nakashima, Juan Manuel Cerúndolo, and Holger Rune in the round-robin stage. He beat Sebastian Baez in the semifinal, and Sebastian Korda in the final.[30][31][32][33]\n\n\n\n### 2022: First major, youngest world No. 1, and year-end No. 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\nSeeded for the first time in a major at No. 31, Alcaraz reached the third round of the Australian Open before losing in five sets to Matteo Berrettini.[34]\n\n\nSeeded seventh at the Rio Open, Alcaraz won his first ATP 500 title by defeating Diego Schwartzman in the final.[35] He entered the top 20 in the singles rankings on 21 February 2022. In Indian Wells, Alcaraz reached his first Masters 1000 quarterfinal and semifinal, defeating defending champion Cameron Norrie before losing to Rafael Nadal.\n\n\nSeeded 14th at the Miami Open, Alcaraz defeated 6th seed Casper Ruud to win his first Masters 1000 title, the youngest men's champion in the tournament's history and the third-youngest ATP Masters 1000 titlist in history.[36]\n\n\nAt the Monte-Carlo Masters, Alcaraz lost in the second round to Sebastian Korda.[37] At the Barcelona Open, Alcaraz defeated top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals[38] to enter the top 10 in rankings for the first time on 25 April.[39][40] He became the 20th teen to break into top 10 overall since rankings were established in 1973, and the youngest since Rafael Nadal also on 25 April 2005.[41][42] Alcaraz later defeated Pablo Carreño Busta to win the title.[43]\n\n\nA day after his 19th birthday at the Madrid Open, he defeated 5-time Madrid champion, world No. 4 and third seed Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals to become the first teenager to defeat him on clay.[44] The following day, he beat the world No. 1 and top seed Novak Djokovic in the semifinals for his 6th straight top-10 win, and became the youngest player to win a match against a world No. 1 since 2004. He also became the first player to ever beat Djokovic and Nadal back-to-back on clay.[36][45][46] In the final, he won his fourth title for the season (and second Masters 1000), by defeating defending champion and world No. 3 Alexander Zverev, thereby defeating the top three seeds in three consecutive matches. He also became the youngest champion in tournament history.[47] As a result, he climbed to a career-high of world No. 6 in the rankings on 9 May 2022.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships\nFollowing his withdrawal from the Italian Open due to an ankle injury,[49] Alcaraz made his seeded debut at the French Open as No. 6. Having won two of the tour's biggest titles on clay coming into the Slam, he was widely projected to be one of the favorites for the title.[50] He defeated Juan Ignacio Londero in straight sets before saving a match point in a second round five-setter against Albert Ramos Viñolas.[51][52] He then defeated Korda and Karen Khachanov in straight sets before losing to Zverev, in the second major quarterfinal of his career.[53][54][55]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, Alcaraz beat Jan-Lennard Struff in a close five set match before defeating Tallon Griekspoor and Oscar Otte in straight sets, reaching the round of 16 for the first time at this major. He lost to Jannik Sinner in the fourth round.\n\n\nAt the Hamburg Open, he reached the final, resulting in a new career-high of world No. 5 on 25 July 2022. Alcaraz became the youngest player to enter the top 5 in rankings since Nadal in 2005.[56][57] He was defeated in the final by Lorenzo Musetti, resulting in the first loss in a tournament final of his career.[58] At the Croatia Open, he reached his second consecutive final, resulting in another ranking jump to world No. 4 on 1 August.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Evolution of Carlos Alcaraz compared to the \"Big Three\" in the ATP RANKING from 17 to 20 years old, on the left the starting ranking and the names of the players can be seen, and the highest ranking reached in the period are on the right.\nAlcaraz entered the 2022 US Open as the No. 3 seed.[61] He defeated Sebastian Baez, Federico Coria and Jenson Brooksby without dropping a set to reach the fourth round.[62] Next he defeated 15th seed Marin Čilić in five sets, becoming the youngest man to reach back-to-back quarterfinals at this Major in the Open Era.[63] In his quarterfinal match he defeated Jannik Sinner, saving a match point in the fourth set. The match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50AM EST) and second longest match (5 hours and 15 minutes) in US Open history.[64][65] He defeated Frances Tiafoe in the semifinals for his third consecutive five-set match victory.[66] He defeated 5th seed Casper Ruud in the final, where both players were in contention for the world No. 1 ranking, to win the title. Alcaraz became the youngest No. 1 in the history of the ATP Rankings at the age of 19 years, 4 months and 6 days, breaking Lleyton Hewitt's record.[5] He also became the first teenager in the Open Era to top the men's rankings and the youngest men's US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990.[67]\n\n\nIn his first match as world No. 1, Alcaraz lost his singles match at the 2022 Davis Cup Finals to Félix Auger-Aliassime.[68] Next, he lost to David Goffin at the Astana Open in his opening round. Alcaraz reached the semifinals in Basel, where he was defeated by the eventual champion Auger-Aliassime for a second time in the season.[69] At the Paris Masters, Alcaraz reached the quarterfinals after defeating Yoshihito Nishioka and Grigor Dimitrov, but retired while being a set down against Holger Rune.[70] A day later, Alcaraz announced he had suffered an abdominal tear requiring a six-week layoff, forcing him to end his season early. Alcaraz withdrew from the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup Finals.[71] Alcaraz, at the age of 19 years and 214 days, ended the year as youngest and first teenager world No. 1.[7]\n\n\n\n### 2023: 100th career win and Wimbledon champion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2023 French OpenOn 7 January, Alcaraz announced his withdrawal from the Australian Open due to a hamstring injury he suffered in his right leg while training.[72] Following the tournament, he lost the world No. 1 ranking to the champion Novak Djokovic.[73] He held the ranking for a total of 20 weeks.\n\n\nIn his first tournament for the 2023 season at the Golden Swing in South America, Alcaraz won his seventh title at the Argentina Open, defeating second seed Cameron Norrie.[74] Defending his title at the Rio Open, he reached back to back finals where he played against Norrie again, but lost in three sets.[75] Alcaraz was additionally scheduled to play in Acapulco in the month of February, but withdrew prior to the tournament after suffering another hamstring injury.[76]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Open he recorded his 100th career win, defeating 31st seed Tallon Griekspoor to reach the fourth round, making him the second fastest player to reach this milestone after John McEnroe, and faster than the Big 3.[77][36] After reaching the semifinals, Alcaraz defeated eleventh seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets in an anticipated match.[78][79] Defeating fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, he won his eighth career title and third Masters 1000 title, breaking Medvedev's 19-match winning streak, and becoming the first player to win the tournament without dropping a set since Roger Federer in 2017. He additionally became the ninth and youngest man to win both legs of the Sunshine Double. As a result, he returned to world No. 1 on 20 March 2023.[80] \nIn Miami where Alcaraz was the defending champion, he reached the semifinals having not dropped a set defeating Facundo Bagnis, Dušan Lajović, 16th seed Tommy Paul and ninth seed Taylor Fritz. This time he lost to Jannik Sinner in three sets.[81] He dropped to No. 2 in the rankings having not been able to defend his previous year title points.[82]\n\n\nAlcaraz was scheduled to play at the Monte-Carlo Masters the following week, but withdrew due to post-traumatic arthritis in his left hand and muscular discomfort in his spine.[83] He began the European clay court swing at the Barcelona Open; defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, he successfully defended his title without dropping a set.[84] He won his tenth career title at the Madrid Open again as the defending champion, defeating lucky loser Jan-Lennard Struff.[85] At the next clay court tournament, the Rome Masters, Alcaraz earned the opportunity to clinch the No. 1 ranking just by playing his second round match. Following his victory, he regained the top ranking from Novak Djokovic. However, he was upset in the next round by the world No. 135 Fabian Marozsan in straight sets, in what Jon Wertheim labelled the biggest upset of the year.[86][87]\n\n\nAt the 2023 French Open, Alcaraz advanced to the semifinals. In a highly anticipated match, he was defeated by Novak Djokovic in four sets, after suffering cramps at the onset of the third. Alcaraz and Djokovic had not played against each other in over a year, despite alternating between the world No. 1 ranking throughout 2023; Alcaraz would later claim the nerves of the occasion had partially led to his cramping. Djokovic regained the No. 1 ranking from Alcaraz, after he ultimately went on to win the tournament.[88][89]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 2023 Carlos Alcaraz won his first Wimbledon title. At the Queen's Club Championships, he recorded his first title on grass in only his third career grass court tournament, beating Alex de Minaur in the final. The tournament win in London also returned him to the world No. 1 in rankings.[90] At the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, as the top seed, he reached the final following wins over Jérémy Chardy, Alexandre Müller, Nicolas Jarry, Matteo Berrettini, Holger Rune, and Daniil Medvedev. In a monumental match, Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in five sets, ending Djokovic's run to win a fifth consecutive title, and securing the No. 1 ranking. With this win, Alcaraz became the second player, after Andy Murray, to defeat Djokovic in a Wimbledon final.[91] Additionally, Alcaraz became the first non-\"Big 4\" player to win Wimbledon since Lleyton Hewitt's victory in 2002.[92]\n\n\nAlcaraz lost to Djokovic in a rematch of their Wimbledon final at the Cincinnati final. He lost in three sets, despite winning the first set, being 4–2 up in the second set, and having a championship point in the second-set tiebreak. It was the longest ever best-of-three-sets ATP Masters final and the longest match in the tournament's history, at 3 hours and 49 minutes.[93] At the 2023 US Open, where Alcaraz was looking to defend his grand slam title, he reached the semifinals having only dropped one set. However, he lost to 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev in four sets.[94] Alcaraz dropped to No. 2 in the rankings following the tournament, as Novak Djokovic was not defending any points.[95]\n\n\nAlcaraz entered the year-end indoor hardcourt season with the goal of gaining the year-end No. 1 ranking.[96][97] However, in the Asian swing, he lost to Jannik Sinner in the semifinals of Beijing for a second time in the season, and then to Grigor Dimitrov in the round of 16 at Shanghai.[98][99] He then withdrew from Basel due to injury,[100] and lost in his opening round at the Paris-Bercy Masters to Roman Safiullin.[101][102] His final tournament of the year will be the ATP Finals in Turin.[*citation needed*] Despite qualification for the 2023 ATP Next Generation Finals, he is expected not to play in said tournament.[103]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is sponsored by Nike for clothing and shoes, and by Babolat for racquets, using the Babolat Pure Aero 98 racquet.[104][105] In January 2022, he became a brand ambassador for Rolex.[106][107] He is also a brand ambassador for dermocosmetics company Isdin, Spanish food company ElPozo, and German automobile manufacturer BMW under their BMW Spain division.[108][109][110] In January 2023, he became ambassador for the American clothing brand Calvin Klein especially for their 1996 underwear campaign.[111] In June 2023, Alcaraz became a brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton.[112]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is an all-court, all-round tennis player, but primarily employs an aggressive baseline style of play, with an emphasis on a high winner count from his forehand, typically his most reliable and potent shot. He can either hit his forehand flat and fast for winners from every court position, or add a great amount of topspin and margin over the net. He also possesses a well-rounded and more flat and lower net-clearance backhand groundstroke that he is able to redirect down the line for clean winners. His greatly disguised drop shot is key to his game, as he often combines the heaviness of his groundstrokes that pushes his opponents back into the court into a defensive position, with a drop shot that is often too well-placed and disguised to deal with. He has an impressive net-game with great drop volleys and drive volleys, and frequently serves-and-volleys on crucial points.[113]\n\n\nAlcaraz has a strong first serve for his mid-sized frame which is commonly around 115 to 120 mph and hit with average placement.[114] Alcaraz has a reliable second serve to which he can add topspin, in order to get a high bounce off the court and either push back or get a weak return from closer-returning opponents. This serve typically reaches 150 to 170 km/h (93 to 106 mph).[115]\n\n\nAlcaraz has earned acclaim for his athletic and physical traits. In particular, his direct sprints, counterattacking abilities, and an extremely high peak footspeed have garnered him comparisons to a young Rafael Nadal. He has been compared to Novak Djokovic for his assured lateral movement and court-coverage aided by physical splits and sliding through the court on defense, particularly on his backhand side where he is often able to neutralize his opponent's groundstroke aggression or drop shot attempts. Court coverage and exceptional touch have also been crucial in his success.[*citation needed*] In particular he is known for his frequent use of the drop shot.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Carlos Alcaraz career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 3R | A\n |  | 0 / 2\n | 3–2\n | 60%\n |\n| French Open | Q1 | 3R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 11–3\n | 79%\n |\n| Wimbledon | NH\n | 2R | 4R | **W** |  | 1 / 3\n | 11–2\n | 85%\n |\n| US Open | A\n | QF | **W** | SF |  | 1 / 3\n | 16–2\n | 89%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 8–4\n | 16–3\n | 17–2\n |  | 2 / 11\n | 41–9\n | 82%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (2 titles)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win | 2022 | US Open | Hard | ![Norway](image) Casper Ruud | 6–4, 2–6, 7–6(7–1), 6–3\n |\n| Win | 2023 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 1–6, 7–6(8–6), 6–1, 3–6, 6–4 |\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\n#### Open Era records[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Miami Open – 18 years, 11 months[116] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Madrid Open – 19 years[117] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to become ATP world No. 1 – 19 years, 4 months[118] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest year-end No. 1 – 19 years, 5 months[119] | **Stands alone** |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* ATP Newcomer of the Year (2020)\n* ATP Player of the Year (2022)\n* ATP Most Improved Player (2022)\n* Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year (2023)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players (since 1973)\n* Top ten ranked male tennis players\n* List of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n* World number 1 ranked male tennis players (all time, based on recognized tennis authorities)\n* ATP Awards\n* Tennis in Spain\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In ATP Tour and Grand Slam main draw matches, Summer Olympics, Davis Cup and Laver Cup\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Carlos Alcaraz | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

Alcaraz has won twelve ATP Tour-level singles titles, including two major titles (at the 2022 US Open and 2023 Wimbledon Championships) and four Masters 1000 titles. Following his win at the 2022 US Open, Alcaraz became the youngest man and the first teenager in the Open Era to top the singles rankings, at 19 years, 4 months, and 6 days old.[5][6][7]\n\n\n\nAs a junior, Alcaraz was ranked as high as world No. 22 and won two titles on the ITF Junior Circuit. After turning professional in 2018, he won three titles on the ITF Men's World Tennis Tour and four on the ATP Challenger Tour and broke into the top 100 in rankings in May 2021. Two months later, Alcaraz won his first ATP title at the Croatia Open, an ATP 250 tournament. He later entered the top 50 after reaching the quarterfinals at the following US Open and won the year end Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan. After winning his first ATP 500 title at the Rio Open in February 2022, Alcaraz won his first Masters 1000 title at the Miami Open and his second ATP 500 title at the Barcelona Open in April, propelling him into the top 10. In September 2022, Alcaraz defeated Casper Ruud in the US Open final to win his first major singles title. In May 2023, he was awarded the Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year award. In July 2023, Alcaraz won Wimbledon, defeating seven-time and defending champion Novak Djokovic in the final to claim his second major singles title. \n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nCarlos Alcaraz Garfia was born on 5 May 2003, in El Palmar, Murcia, Spain, to parents Carlos Alcaraz González and Virginia Garfia Escandón. He has three siblings.\n\n\nAlcaraz started playing tennis at the age of four at the Real Sociedad Club de Campo de Murcia (Royal Society Murciashire Club), where his father was the tennis academy director. Alcaraz' father was a former professional player, but stopped playing when he couldn't afford to any longer. In 2018, he moved to Villena to begin training at Juan Carlos Ferrero's Equelite JC Ferrero Sport Academy.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2020: ATP debut[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, at the age of 16, Alcaraz made his ATP main-draw debut at the Rio Open after receiving a wildcard for the singles main draw. There, he defeated Albert Ramos Viñolas.[10] Alcaraz was defeated in the second round by Federico Coria.\n\n\n\n### 2021: First title, Next-Gen Finals champion, top 35[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2021 French Open\nAt age 17, Alcaraz made it to the main draw of the Australian Open, making him the youngest participant in the men's singles.[11] He won his Grand Slam tournament debut defeating fellow qualifier Botic van de Zandschulp in straight sets before losing in the second round to Mikael Ymer.[12]\n\n\nAlcaraz became the youngest match winner in the Madrid Open's history, defeating Adrian Mannarino as a wildcard and breaking then-18-year-old Rafael Nadal's record from 2004. In the second round, he lost to five-time champion Nadal on Alcaraz's 18th birthday.[13][14][15]\nBy winning the biggest title of his career until then at the 2021 Open de Oeiras III Challenger tournament, he entered the top 100 as the youngest player at the age of 18 on 24 May 2021.[16][17]\n\n\nAt the French Open, Alcaraz reached the third round of a major for the first time in his career by defeating Nikoloz Basilashvili.\n\n\nIn July 2021, he reached his first ATP final at the 2021 Croatia Open Umag, defeating top seed Albert Ramos Viñolas.[18] He then won his maiden ATP title by defeating Richard Gasquet and becoming the youngest tour-level champion since 18-year-old Kei Nishikori won the Delray Beach Open in 2008. Alcaraz was the youngest Spaniard to win an ATP Tour title since Nadal claimed his first trophy in Sopot in 2004.[19]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, he lost in the second round to Daniil Medvedev. At the Winston-Salem Open, Alcaraz reached the round of 16 defeating qualifier Alexei Popyrin, and his second tour-level quarterfinal of the season defeating fourth seed Márton Fucsovics.[20] He defeated Marcos Giron to reach the semifinals,[21] where he lost to Mikael Ymer.\n\n\nAt the US Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas in a fifth-set tiebreak to reach the fourth round in the biggest win of his career.[22] At 18 years of age, Alcaraz became the youngest man in a major fourth round since 17-year-old Andrei Medvedev at the 1992 French Open, and the youngest man in the US Open fourth round since 17-year-old Michael Chang and 18-year-old Pete Sampras in 1989.[23][24] He then reached the quarterfinals by defeating qualifier Peter Gojowczyk. Alcaraz became the youngest US Open men's quarterfinalist in the Open Era, the youngest at the tournament since 18-year-old Thomaz Koch in 1963, and the youngest Grand Slam tournament men's singles quarterfinalist since 18-year-old Michael Chang at the 1990 French Open. He then lost to Félix Auger-Aliassime via retirement in the second set in the quarterfinals after injuring his leg.[25]\n\n\nAt the Erste Bank Open, Alcaraz defeated world No. 7 Matteo Berrettini, his second win over a top-10 player,[26] and became the youngest player in the top 35 on 1 November. During his Paris Masters run, Alcaraz defeated French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert in three thrilling sets in the first round.[27] He then defeated Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the second round, his third win over a top-10 player.[28] In the third round, he was defeated by Hugo Gaston in straight sets.[29]\n\n\nAt the Next Gen ATP Finals, Alcaraz defeated Brandon Nakashima, Juan Manuel Cerúndolo, and Holger Rune in the round-robin stage. He beat Sebastian Baez in the semifinal, and Sebastian Korda in the final.[30][31][32][33]\n\n\n\n### 2022: First major, youngest world No. 1, and year-end No. 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\nSeeded for the first time in a major at No. 31, Alcaraz reached the third round of the Australian Open before losing in five sets to Matteo Berrettini.[34]\n\n\nSeeded seventh at the Rio Open, Alcaraz won his first ATP 500 title by defeating Diego Schwartzman in the final.[35] He entered the top 20 in the singles rankings on 21 February 2022. In Indian Wells, Alcaraz reached his first Masters 1000 quarterfinal and semifinal, defeating defending champion Cameron Norrie before losing to Rafael Nadal.\n\n\nSeeded 14th at the Miami Open, Alcaraz defeated 6th seed Casper Ruud to win his first Masters 1000 title, the youngest men's champion in the tournament's history and the third-youngest ATP Masters 1000 titlist in history.[36]\n\n\nAt the Monte-Carlo Masters, Alcaraz lost in the second round to Sebastian Korda.[37] At the Barcelona Open, Alcaraz defeated top seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarterfinals[38] to enter the top 10 in rankings for the first time on 25 April.[39][40] He became the 20th teen to break into top 10 overall since rankings were established in 1973, and the youngest since Rafael Nadal also on 25 April 2005.[41][42] Alcaraz later defeated Pablo Carreño Busta to win the title.[43]\n\n\nA day after his 19th birthday at the Madrid Open, he defeated 5-time Madrid champion, world No. 4 and third seed Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals to become the first teenager to defeat him on clay.[44] The following day, he beat the world No. 1 and top seed Novak Djokovic in the semifinals for his 6th straight top-10 win, and became the youngest player to win a match against a world No. 1 since 2004. He also became the first player to ever beat Djokovic and Nadal back-to-back on clay.[36][45][46] In the final, he won his fourth title for the season (and second Masters 1000), by defeating defending champion and world No. 3 Alexander Zverev, thereby defeating the top three seeds in three consecutive matches. He also became the youngest champion in tournament history.[47] As a result, he climbed to a career-high of world No. 6 in the rankings on 9 May 2022.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships\nFollowing his withdrawal from the Italian Open due to an ankle injury,[49] Alcaraz made his seeded debut at the French Open as No. 6. Having won two of the tour's biggest titles on clay coming into the Slam, he was widely projected to be one of the favorites for the title.[50] He defeated Juan Ignacio Londero in straight sets before saving a match point in a second round five-setter against Albert Ramos Viñolas.[51][52] He then defeated Korda and Karen Khachanov in straight sets before losing to Zverev, in the second major quarterfinal of his career.[53][54][55]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, Alcaraz beat Jan-Lennard Struff in a close five set match before defeating Tallon Griekspoor and Oscar Otte in straight sets, reaching the round of 16 for the first time at this major. He lost to Jannik Sinner in the fourth round.\n\n\nAt the Hamburg Open, he reached the final, resulting in a new career-high of world No. 5 on 25 July 2022. Alcaraz became the youngest player to enter the top 5 in rankings since Nadal in 2005.[56][57] He was defeated in the final by Lorenzo Musetti, resulting in the first loss in a tournament final of his career.[58] At the Croatia Open, he reached his second consecutive final, resulting in another ranking jump to world No. 4 on 1 August.[59][60]\n\n\n\n![](image)Evolution of Carlos Alcaraz compared to the \"Big Three\" in the ATP RANKING from 17 to 20 years old, on the left the starting ranking and the names of the players can be seen, and the highest ranking reached in the period are on the right.\nAlcaraz entered the 2022 US Open as the No. 3 seed.[61] He defeated Sebastian Baez, Federico Coria and Jenson Brooksby without dropping a set to reach the fourth round.[62] Next he defeated 15th seed Marin Čilić in five sets, becoming the youngest man to reach back-to-back quarterfinals at this Major in the Open Era.[63] In his quarterfinal match he defeated Jannik Sinner, saving a match point in the fourth set. The match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50AM EST) and second longest match (5 hours and 15 minutes) in US Open history.[64][65] He defeated Frances Tiafoe in the semifinals for his third consecutive five-set match victory.[66] He defeated 5th seed Casper Ruud in the final, where both players were in contention for the world No. 1 ranking, to win the title. Alcaraz became the youngest No. 1 in the history of the ATP Rankings at the age of 19 years, 4 months and 6 days, breaking Lleyton Hewitt's record.[5] He also became the first teenager in the Open Era to top the men's rankings and the youngest men's US Open champion since Pete Sampras in 1990.[67]\n\n\nIn his first match as world No. 1, Alcaraz lost his singles match at the 2022 Davis Cup Finals to Félix Auger-Aliassime.[68] Next, he lost to David Goffin at the Astana Open in his opening round. Alcaraz reached the semifinals in Basel, where he was defeated by the eventual champion Auger-Aliassime for a second time in the season.[69] At the Paris Masters, Alcaraz reached the quarterfinals after defeating Yoshihito Nishioka and Grigor Dimitrov, but retired while being a set down against Holger Rune.[70] A day later, Alcaraz announced he had suffered an abdominal tear requiring a six-week layoff, forcing him to end his season early. Alcaraz withdrew from the ATP Finals and the Davis Cup Finals.[71] Alcaraz, at the age of 19 years and 214 days, ended the year as youngest and first teenager world No. 1.[7]\n\n\n\n### 2023: 100th career win and Wimbledon champion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 Carlos Alcaraz tennis season\n\n![](image)Alcaraz at the 2023 French OpenOn 7 January, Alcaraz announced his withdrawal from the Australian Open due to a hamstring injury he suffered in his right leg while training.[72] Following the tournament, he lost the world No. 1 ranking to the champion Novak Djokovic.[73] He held the ranking for a total of 20 weeks.\n\n\nIn his first tournament for the 2023 season at the Golden Swing in South America, Alcaraz won his seventh title at the Argentina Open, defeating second seed Cameron Norrie.[74] Defending his title at the Rio Open, he reached back to back finals where he played against Norrie again, but lost in three sets.[75] Alcaraz was additionally scheduled to play in Acapulco in the month of February, but withdrew prior to the tournament after suffering another hamstring injury.[76]\n\n\nAt the Indian Wells Open he recorded his 100th career win, defeating 31st seed Tallon Griekspoor to reach the fourth round, making him the second fastest player to reach this milestone after John McEnroe, and faster than the Big 3.[77][36] After reaching the semifinals, Alcaraz defeated eleventh seed Jannik Sinner in straight sets in an anticipated match.[78][79] Defeating fifth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final, he won his eighth career title and third Masters 1000 title, breaking Medvedev's 19-match winning streak, and becoming the first player to win the tournament without dropping a set since Roger Federer in 2017. He additionally became the ninth and youngest man to win both legs of the Sunshine Double. As a result, he returned to world No. 1 on 20 March 2023.[80] \nIn Miami where Alcaraz was the defending champion, he reached the semifinals having not dropped a set defeating Facundo Bagnis, Dušan Lajović, 16th seed Tommy Paul and ninth seed Taylor Fritz. This time he lost to Jannik Sinner in three sets.[81] He dropped to No. 2 in the rankings having not been able to defend his previous year title points.[82]\n\n\nAlcaraz was scheduled to play at the Monte-Carlo Masters the following week, but withdrew due to post-traumatic arthritis in his left hand and muscular discomfort in his spine.[83] He began the European clay court swing at the Barcelona Open; defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, he successfully defended his title without dropping a set.[84] He won his tenth career title at the Madrid Open again as the defending champion, defeating lucky loser Jan-Lennard Struff.[85] At the next clay court tournament, the Rome Masters, Alcaraz earned the opportunity to clinch the No. 1 ranking just by playing his second round match. Following his victory, he regained the top ranking from Novak Djokovic. However, he was upset in the next round by the world No. 135 Fabian Marozsan in straight sets, in what Jon Wertheim labelled the biggest upset of the year.[86][87]\n\n\nAt the 2023 French Open, Alcaraz advanced to the semifinals. In a highly anticipated match, he was defeated by Novak Djokovic in four sets, after suffering cramps at the onset of the third. Alcaraz and Djokovic had not played against each other in over a year, despite alternating between the world No. 1 ranking throughout 2023; Alcaraz would later claim the nerves of the occasion had partially led to his cramping. Djokovic regained the No. 1 ranking from Alcaraz, after he ultimately went on to win the tournament.[88][89]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 2023 Carlos Alcaraz won his first Wimbledon title. At the Queen's Club Championships, he recorded his first title on grass in only his third career grass court tournament, beating Alex de Minaur in the final. The tournament win in London also returned him to the world No. 1 in rankings.[90] At the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, as the top seed, he reached the final following wins over Jérémy Chardy, Alexandre Müller, Nicolas Jarry, Matteo Berrettini, Holger Rune, and Daniil Medvedev. In a monumental match, Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic in five sets, ending Djokovic's run to win a fifth consecutive title, and securing the No. 1 ranking. With this win, Alcaraz became the second player, after Andy Murray, to defeat Djokovic in a Wimbledon final.[91] Additionally, Alcaraz became the first non-\"Big 4\" player to win Wimbledon since Lleyton Hewitt's victory in 2002.[92]\n\n\nAlcaraz lost to Djokovic in a rematch of their Wimbledon final at the Cincinnati final. He lost in three sets, despite winning the first set, being 4–2 up in the second set, and having a championship point in the second-set tiebreak. It was the longest ever best-of-three-sets ATP Masters final and the longest match in the tournament's history, at 3 hours and 49 minutes.[93] At the 2023 US Open, where Alcaraz was looking to defend his grand slam title, he reached the semifinals having only dropped one set. However, he lost to 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev in four sets.[94] Alcaraz dropped to No. 2 in the rankings following the tournament, as Novak Djokovic was not defending any points.[95]\n\n\nAlcaraz entered the year-end indoor hardcourt season with the goal of gaining the year-end No. 1 ranking.[96][97] However, in the Asian swing, he lost to Jannik Sinner in the semifinals of Beijing for a second time in the season, and then to Grigor Dimitrov in the round of 16 at Shanghai.[98][99] He then withdrew from Basel due to injury,[100] and lost in his opening round at the Paris-Bercy Masters to Roman Safiullin.[101][102] His final tournament of the year will be the ATP Finals in Turin.[*citation needed*] Despite qualification for the 2023 ATP Next Generation Finals, he is expected not to play in said tournament.[103]\n\n\n\n## Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is sponsored by Nike for clothing and shoes, and by Babolat for racquets, using the Babolat Pure Aero 98 racquet.[104][105] In January 2022, he became a brand ambassador for Rolex.[106][107] He is also a brand ambassador for dermocosmetics company Isdin, Spanish food company ElPozo, and German automobile manufacturer BMW under their BMW Spain division.[108][109][110] In January 2023, he became ambassador for the American clothing brand Calvin Klein especially for their 1996 underwear campaign.[111] In June 2023, Alcaraz became a brand ambassador for Louis Vuitton.[112]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nAlcaraz is an all-court, all-round tennis player, but primarily employs an aggressive baseline style of play, with an emphasis on a high winner count from his forehand, typically his most reliable and potent shot. He can either hit his forehand flat and fast for winners from every court position, or add a great amount of topspin and margin over the net. He also possesses a well-rounded and more flat and lower net-clearance backhand groundstroke that he is able to redirect down the line for clean winners. His greatly disguised drop shot is key to his game, as he often combines the heaviness of his groundstrokes that pushes his opponents back into the court into a defensive position, with a drop shot that is often too well-placed and disguised to deal with. He has an impressive net-game with great drop volleys and drive volleys, and frequently serves-and-volleys on crucial points.[113]\n\n\nAlcaraz has a strong first serve for his mid-sized frame which is commonly around 115 to 120 mph and hit with average placement.[114] Alcaraz has a reliable second serve to which he can add topspin, in order to get a high bounce off the court and either push back or get a weak return from closer-returning opponents. This serve typically reaches 150 to 170 km/h (93 to 106 mph).[115]\n\n\nAlcaraz has earned acclaim for his athletic and physical traits. In particular, his direct sprints, counterattacking abilities, and an extremely high peak footspeed have garnered him comparisons to a young Rafael Nadal. He has been compared to Novak Djokovic for his assured lateral movement and court-coverage aided by physical splits and sliding through the court on defense, particularly on his backhand side where he is often able to neutralize his opponent's groundstroke aggression or drop shot attempts. Court coverage and exceptional touch have also been crucial in his success.[*citation needed*] In particular he is known for his frequent use of the drop shot.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Carlos Alcaraz career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 3R | A\n |  | 0 / 2\n | 3–2\n | 60%\n |\n| French Open | Q1 | 3R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 11–3\n | 79%\n |\n| Wimbledon | NH\n | 2R | 4R | **W** |  | 1 / 3\n | 11–2\n | 85%\n |\n| US Open | A\n | QF | **W** | SF |  | 1 / 3\n | 16–2\n | 89%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 8–4\n | 16–3\n | 17–2\n |  | 2 / 11\n | 41–9\n | 82%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (2 titles)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win | 2022 | US Open | Hard | ![Norway](image) Casper Ruud | 6–4, 2–6, 7–6(7–1), 6–3\n |\n| Win | 2023 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 1–6, 7–6(8–6), 6–1, 3–6, 6–4 |\n\n\n### Records[edit]\n\n\n#### Open Era records[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Time span\n | Record accomplished\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Miami Open – 18 years, 11 months[116] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to win the Madrid Open – 19 years[117] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest player to become ATP world No. 1 – 19 years, 4 months[118] | **Stands alone** |\n| 2022 | Youngest year-end No. 1 – 19 years, 5 months[119] | **Stands alone** |\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* ATP Newcomer of the Year (2020)\n* ATP Player of the Year (2022)\n* ATP Most Improved Player (2022)\n* Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year (2023)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players (since 1973)\n* Top ten ranked male tennis players\n* List of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n* World number 1 ranked male tennis players (all time, based on recognized tennis authorities)\n* ATP Awards\n* Tennis in Spain\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** In ATP Tour and Grand Slam main draw matches, Summer Olympics, Davis Cup and Laver Cup\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Carlos Alcaraz | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 4 by the ATP, achieved on 2 October 2023, making him the highest ranked Italian male player in history (tied with Adriano Panatta). He also has a career-high ranking of world No. 124 in doubles, achieved on 27 September 2021. Sinner has won ten ATP Tour titles in singles, including a Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open, and one in doubles.\n\n\nSinner grew up in northern Italy in the region of South Tyrol. He was active in skiing, football, and tennis as a child. After winning a national championship in skiing at age eight, Sinner switched his focus to tennis at age thirteen and moved to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train with veteran coach Riccardo Piatti. Despite limited success as a junior, Sinner began playing in professional events at age 16 and became one of the few players to win multiple ATP Challenger Tour titles at age 17. He won the ATP Newcomer of the Year award in 2019 after breaking through into the top 100, reaching his first ATP semifinal, and winning the Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan.\n\n\nSinner continued his rise into the top 50 in 2020 with his first top 10 victory, a French Open quarterfinal (becoming the youngest quarterfinalist in men's singles since Novak Djokovic in 2006), and a maiden ATP title at the 2020 Sofia Open. He had a strong start to 2021, highlighted by his second ATP title in a row and a Masters 1000 runner-up at the Miami Open. On 1 November 2021, he became the first player born in the 2000s to enter the ATP top 10. He became the first teenage ATP 500 champion since the category was renamed in 2009 by winning the 2021 Citi Open. Sinner won his first Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\nJannik Sinner was born 16 August 2001 to Hanspeter and Siglinde Sinner in Innichen in the region of South Tyrol in northern Italy into a Roman Catholic family. He grew up in the town of Sexten, where his father and mother work as a chef and a waitress at a ski lodge.[2] He has a brother named Marc.[3] Sinner began both skiing and playing tennis at age three. He was one of Italy's top junior skiers from eight to twelve years old, winning a national championship in giant slalom at age eight and earning a national runner-up at the age of twelve.[4][5][6]\n\n\nWhile training in skiing, Sinner gave up tennis for a year at the age of seven before his father pushed him to return to the sport.[7] When he resumed playing, he began working with Heribert Mayr as his first regular coach.[8] Nonetheless, tennis was still only his third priority behind skiing and football.[9][10]\n\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Sinner decided to give up skiing and football in favour of tennis. He preferred it over skiing because he wanted to compete directly against an opponent and to have more margin of error over the course of an entire match. He also wanted to be in an individual sport where he could make all of the decisions, an opportunity he would not have in a team sport like football.[10] He decided to move on his own to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train at the Piatti Tennis Centre under Riccardo Piatti and Massimo Sartori, a decision which his parents supported.[3][5][7] At the centre, Sinner lived with the family of Luka Cvjetković, one of his coaches.[11] Before Sinner began training in tennis full-time with Piatti, he had been playing only twice a week.[9]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nSinner began playing on the ITF Junior Circuit, the premier junior tour which is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), in 2016. Despite having limited success as a junior, he moved mainly to the professional tour following the end of 2017. He never played the main draw of any high-level Grade 1 events in singles, and the only higher-level Grade A tournament he entered was the Trofeo Bonfiglio. He followed up an opening round loss at Italy's Grade A tournament in 2017 with a quarterfinal in 2018. That was the only junior event he played in 2018. He never played any of the junior Grand Slam tournaments. Because he entered so few high-level tournaments, Sinner's career-high junior ranking was a relatively low No. 133.[12]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2018: ITF Futures and Challenger Tour[edit]\n\n\nSinner wasn't too focused on the junior circuit,[*clarification needed*] and he began playing on the ITF Men's Circuit in early 2018. With his low ranking, he could initially be directly accepted into only ITF Futures events. Nonetheless, he began receiving wild cards for ATP Challenger Tour events, the second-tier tour run by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), in the second half of the year.[13] His only ITF title of the year was in doubles,[14] and he finished the season ranked No. 551.[15]\n\n\n\n### 2019: NextGen Finals title and top 100[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2019 NextGen ATP Finals in Milan\nSinner won his first ATP Challenger title in Bergamo in February 2019 at the age of 17 years and 6 months, despite entering the tournament with no match wins at the Challenger level. He became the first person born in 2001 to reach a Challenger final, and the youngest Italian to win a Challenger title in history. With the title, he rose over 200 spots in ATP rankings up to No. 324.[16][17] After his first two ITF Futures titles, Sinner entered his first ATP tournament at the Hungarian Open as a lucky loser, where he notched his first tour-level win over home wild card Máté Valkusz.[18] The next week, he reached his second ATP Challenger final in Ostrava, finishing runner-up to Kamil Majchrzak.[19]\n\n\nDuring the second half of the season, Sinner played more often on the ATP Tour than the Challenger Tour.[20] His first ATP Masters victory came at the Italian Open against Steve Johnson, and he broke into the top 200 with his next ATP win at the Croatia Open Umag in July.[15] The next month, he won a second ATP Challenger title in Lexington to become one of just eleven 17-year-olds to have won multiple Challenger titles.[21] After losing in qualifying at Wimbledon, Sinner qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw at the US Open.[22] He lost his debut match to No. 24 Stan Wawrinka.[20]\n\n\nSinner had a strong finish to the season. As a wild card at the European Open, he became the youngest player in five years to reach an ATP semifinal.[23] Along the way, he knocked off top seed and world No. 13 Gaël Monfils for his first career top 50 victory.[24] This performance helped him break into the top 100 for the first time one week later.[15] At the end of the season, Sinner qualified for the 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals as the Italian wild card and the lowest seed.[25] He won in his round robin group with victories over Frances Tiafoe and Mikael Ymer, losing only to Ugo Humbert. After defeating Miomir Kecmanović in the semifinals, Sinner upset top seed and world No. 18 Alex de Minaur in straight sets to win the title.[26] He played one last event in Italy the following week, winning a third Challenger title in Ortisei. Sinner finished the year at world No. 78, becoming the youngest player in the year-end top 80 since Rafael Nadal in 2003.[18] He was also named ATP Newcomer of the Year.[27]\n\n\n\n### 2020: First ATP title and top 40[edit]\n\n\nEarly in the year, Sinner made the second round of the 2020 Australian Open, recording his first Grand Slam main draw match win over home wild card Max Purcell before losing to Márton Fucsovics. As a wild card at the Rotterdam Open, he earned his first top 10 victory against world No. 10 David Goffin.[28]\n\n\nFollowing the ATP Tour shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinner had a successful restart to the season. Although he lost his opening round match to Karen Khachanov at the US Open, he fared better in Europe. He reached the third round at the Rome Masters, highlighted by a victory over world No. 6 Stefanos Tsitsipas.[29] He then progressed to become the youngest quarterfinalist at the French Open since Novak Djokovic in 2006, and the first to make the quarterfinals on debut since Rafael Nadal in 2005. During the tournament, he defeated Goffin again as well as US Open runner-up and world No. 7 Alexander Zverev before losing to Nadal.[30][31]\n\n\nAfter a semifinal at the Cologne Championship where he lost to Zverev,[32] Sinner closed out the season by winning the Sofia Open for his first ATP title. During the event, he defeated Next Gen rival Alex de Minaur and then Vasek Pospisil in the final.[33] He became the youngest Italian tour-level champion in the Open Era and the youngest player overall to win an ATP title since Kei Nishikori in 2008.[34][35]\n\n\nSinner finished the year ranked world No. 37.[15]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Four titles, Masters final and top 10 debut[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2021 French Open\nSinner carried over his success from late 2020 into the start of the 2021 season. He won his second career ATP title at the Great Ocean Road Open,[36] and notably defeated No. 20 Karen Khachanov in the semifinals after saving a match point.[37] He became the youngest to win back-to-back ATP titles since Rafael Nadal in 2005.[36] His ten-match winning streak came to an end in the first round of the 2021 Australian Open, where he lost a tight five-set match to world No. 12 Denis Shapovalov.[38]\n\n\nSinner's next big result was at the Miami Open, where he reached his first ATP Masters 1000 final. During the tournament, he defeated Khachanov again and later world No. 12 Roberto Bautista Agut in the semifinal.[39][40] He finished runner-up to Hubert Hurkacz.[41]\n\n\nThen at the French Open, his campaign was stopped short for the second year running by Rafael Nadal who this time defeated Sinner in straight sets in the fourth round.[42] In his main draw debut at Wimbledon, he lost in the first round to Márton Fucsovics.\n\n\nPartnering Reilly Opelka he won his first doubles title at the 2021 Atlanta Open, defeating Steve Johnson and Jordan Thompson.[43] At the same tournament in singles he fell in the second round to Christopher O'Connell.[44]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Citi Open in Washington, D.C., Sinner went into the tournament as the fifth seed and made it to the finals and beat several young players along the way such as Emil Ruusuvuori, Sebastian Korda, and Jenson Brooksby.[45] He beat Mackenzie McDonald in the final to win his third title and first ATP 500 title. Sinner was the first Italian finalist and champion in Washington's tournament history as well as the youngest ATP 500 and first teen champion since the category was created in 2009.[46] As a result, he entered the top 15 in the ATP rankings on 9 August 2021.\n\n\nAt the US Open, he defeated Gaël Monfils in the third round to reach the second week of a Major for the second time in the season. Sinner's tournament ended when he lost to Alexander Zverev in the 4th round in straight sets.\n\n\nSinner successfully defended his title at the Sofia Open as the top seed, defeating again second seed Gaël Monfils in the final.[47]\nSinner made his sixth career final at the 2021 European Open without dropping a set en route. He defeated Lorenzo Musetti, Arthur Rinderknech and Lloyd Harris to reach the final.[48] He bested Diego Schwartzman in the final to take his fifth career title. He became the youngest man to win five ATP titles since 19-year-old Novak Djokovic.[49]\n\n\nOn 1 November, Sinner became the first male player born in the 2000s to break into the top-10 after a semifinal appearance at the Vienna Open.\nAt the Rolex Paris Masters, Sinner received a bye in the first round but was defeated by Carlos Alcaraz. Because of this, Sinner was unable to directly qualify for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals.[50]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals in Turin, Sinner was present as the first alternate. Sinner entered the tournament after countryman Matteo Berrettini was forced to withdraw with an abdominal injury after his first match with Alexander Zverev.[51] He defeated Hubert Hurkacz and became the youngest player to win an ATP Finals match on debut since Lleyton Hewitt in Lisbon in 2000 and the first alternate to win a match since Janko Tipsarević in London in 2011.[52][53] Sinner played Daniil Medvedev next in the round robin stage, holding a match point before being defeated in 3 sets. As a result, he re-entered the top-10 in the rankings and finished the year at world No. 10 on 22 November 2021.\n\n\nIn the Davis Cup Finals, Sinner defeated John Isner becoming only the second player (after Thiemo de Bakker) ever to bagel Isner.[54]\n\n\n\n### 2022: Three Major quarterfinals, Davis Cup success[edit]\n\n\nAt the Australian Open, Sinner reached the quarterfinals of a major for the second time in his career, becoming the fifth Italian man to reach that stage in Melbourne.[55] He then lost to fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the Miami Open, he saved three match points in the opening round against Emil Ruusuvuori and five match points against Pablo Carreño Busta to advance to the round of 16.[56] He then defeated Nick Kyrgios but retired against Francisco Cerúndolo in the quarterfinals. In the Monte Carlo Masters, he again reached the quarterfinals after defeating fifth seed Andrey Rublev, before losing to second seed Alexander Zverev in a three-set and over three hour-long match.[57][58] He again saved three match points in the opener at the Madrid Open against Tommy Paul to move to the second round.[59] Next, he defeated Alex de Minaur for his 100th career win;[60] he hit this milestone after 147 matches (100–47) on Tour, which was a faster rate than everyone in the Top 10 besides Rafael Nadal (100–37) and Novak Djokovic (100–43).[61] He was defeated in the third round by Félix Auger-Aliassime.[62]\n\n\nAt the French Open, he retired in the fourth round against Andrey Rublev after sustaining a knee injury.[63]\n\n\nAt the Eastbourne International, Sinner suffered his first opening round loss of the year after losing to Tommy Paul in three sets.[64] At the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, he recorded his first win at this Major over Stan Wawrinka.[65] He then beat Mikael Ymer, John Isner, and Carlos Alcaraz to reach his third career Grand Slam quarterfinal. He lost to top seed and eventual champion Novak Djokovic in five sets in the quarterfinals, after being two sets to love up.[66]\n\n\nAt the Croatia Open, Sinner defeated Carlos Alcaraz in the final to win his first clay court title.[67] In Montreal, he lost to eventual champion Pablo Carreño Busta in the third round.[68] Sinner's loss guaranteed a maiden Masters 1000 finalist from his half of the draw. At the Cincinnati Masters, he lost in the third round to Félix Auger-Aliassime after being up a set, a break, and 2 match points.[69]\n\n\nSeeded 11th at the US Open, he reached the fourth round after defeating Brandon Nakashima in four sets.[70] Next, he defeated Ilya Ivashka in a five set match lasting close to four hours to reach the quarterfinals for the first time at this Major.[71] He became the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments since Novak Djokovic in 2007–08.[72] He lost to Carlos Alcaraz in a five-set match that lasted 5 hours and 15 minutes; the match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50 am EST) and second longest match in US Open history. Sinner held a match point while serving up 5–4 in the 4th set, but ended up losing the set 5–7.[73][74]\n\n\nIn September, during the Davis Cup Finals after Matteo Berrettini won his singles match against Argentina, Sinner won the second match (best of three matches) and thus secured a place for Italy's Davis Cup team at the Final 8 of the Davis Cup Finals.[75] Following close to a month break due to an injury sustained in the semifinal at the 2022 Sofia Open[76] he returned to the 2022 Erste Bank Open in Vienna and reached also the quarterfinals losing to top seed and eventual champion Daniil Medvedev.[77] In his next tournament, the 2022 Rolex Paris Masters, he lost in the first round to qualifier Marc-Andrea Huesler.[78]\n\n\nSinner finished the year ranked 15th in the world, one space ahead of countryman Matteo Berrettini.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Major semifinal, first Masters & world No. 1 wins, World No. 4, ATP Finals debut[edit]\n\n\nSinner's season started at the 2023 Adelaide international 1, where he reached the quarter-final, defeating Kyle Edmund and Thanasi Kokkinakis, before coming up short to eventual finalist Sebastian Korda, being straight-setted 7–5 6–1.\nHis season continued at the 2023 Australian Open, where he made the 4th round, beating Kyle Edmund for the second time, Tomás Martín Etcheverry and Márton Fucsovics before losing to eventual finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas in 5 sets.\n\n\nSinner won the 2023 Open Sud de France in Montpellier, his seventh title, becoming the first player to win a tour-level title in the season without having dropped a single set and the first since countryman Lorenzo Musetti won the title in Naples in October 2022.[79]\nAt the 2023 ABN AMRO Open he defeated top seed and world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas taking his revenge for the 2023 Australian Open fourth round five setter loss, for his biggest win ever.[80] Next in the quarterfinals, he defeated Stan Wawrinka.[81] In the semifinals, he defeated home favorite Tallon Griekspoor to reach the final.[82] He lost to sixth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final.\n\n\nIn March, he played in Indian Wells where he made the semifinals.[83] He defeated Richard Gasquet, Adrian Mannarino, and Stan Wawrinka all in straight sets to advance to the quarterfinals where he faced defending champion Taylor Fritz and won in a three-set match. In the following round in the semifinals, he lost in straight sets to rival top seed Carlos Alcaraz who returned to world No. 1 following the tournament. \nIn Miami, he reached the quarterfinals of this tournament for a third straight year defeating 21st seed Grigor Dimitrov and sixth seed Andrey Rublev.[84] As a result, he returned to the top 10 in the rankings at world No. 9. He defeated Emil Ruusuvuori to reach back-to-back semifinals.[85] This time he defeated defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to reach his second Miami and career Masters final in three years,[86] putting an end to Alcaraz's hopes for a Sunshine Double and preventing him from returning to the No. 1 spot.[87] He lost to fourth seed Daniil Medvedev in straight sets in the final, extending his losing streak versus the Russian to 0–6.[88]\n\n\nIn Monte Carlo he reached a third consecutive Masters semifinal defeating compatriot and 16th seed Lorenzo Musetti.[89]\nAt the French Open, Sinner, as the No. 8 seed in the draw, was upset as the heavy favourite in the second round by Daniel Altmaier in a five-set match. Sinner served for the match in the fourth set and had match point, but was denied on a net cord shot by Altmaier, who proceeded to break back and eventually win the set and the match.[*citation needed*] The five sets match included three tiebreaks, of which Sinner only won one, in the first set. The match lasted five hours and 26 minutes, the longest match since Lorenzo Giustino against Corentin Moutet six hours and 5 minutes win in 2020, the fifth longest overall of the tournament[90] and the second longest of the season after Kokkinakis against Murray at the Australian Open.[91][92]\n\n\nHe reached back to back quarterfinals at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo, Diego Schwartzman, Quentin Halys and Daniel Elahi Galan.[93] He reached his first Major semifinal defeating Roman Safiullin, before losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[94]\n\n\nIn August, he won his maiden Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto defeating Alex de Minaur in straight sets for his eighth ATP title.[95] En route to the final, he defeated compatriot Matteo Berrettini, Andy Murray by walkover, Gaël Monfils, and Tommy Paul.\n\n\nAt the 2023 China Open, he defeated top seed and world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, his fourth tour-level win against the Spaniard, to reach his fifth final of the season, defeating second seed and world No. 3 Daniil Medvedev for the first time at the seventh time of asking.[96] As a result, he reached World No. 4 to become the second Italian in the history of the ATP rankings to reach the Top 5, equaling Adriano Panatta.[97] At the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he lost in the round of 16 to 19th seed Ben Shelton.[98]\n\n\nHe recorded his 55th win over Andrey Rublev to reach his fourth ATP 500 career final in Vienna and became the first Italian man with the most wins for a season in the Open Era surpassing Corrado Barazzutti's 54 mark in 1978.[99] He won the final defeating again top seed Daniil Medvedev to win his tenth ATP title and third at the ATP 500 level, defeating him in two consecutive finals and improving his head-to-head record against the Russian to 2–6. He also recorded his 40 tour-level hard court win in a season for the first time.[100]\n\n\nOn his debut at the 2023 ATP Finals he defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the round robin stage, his fifth top-5 win in a row.[101][102]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nSinner is an aggressive baseliner and is one of the hardest hitters on the ATP tour. Sinner's groundstroke strength is his two-handed-backhand, which he hits with more topspin than any other player on the tour, registering an average of 1858 revolutions per minute on the shot along with the fifth-best average speed of 111.2 kilometres per hour (69.1 mph).[103] His forehand is also a strength, owing to the fact he has a short compact takeback, meaning he rarely has to rush the shot, and the ability to rapidly open up his body, generating huge racket head speed and allowing him to hit the shot at over 100 mph on occasion. He uses a modern, semi-western grip to generate large amounts of topspin, increasing net clearance and reducing the likelihood of unforced errors.\n\n\nHe also possesses a powerful first serve, which can reach up to speeds of 221 kilometres per hour (137.3 mph) although it has been criticised for its low average in percentage at 59.2%, and it can frequently dip below 55%. His coaching team has tried to combat this by alternating between the pinpoint(legs together) and platform(legs apart) stances, although as of late 2023 it seems they have settled on the pinpoint stance. Sinner is aiming to incorporate more variety into his game, hence he has been developing his net game and ability to serve-and-volley, as well as his slices and dropshots, to reduce the number of long rallies he has to play from the baseline.\n\n\nSinner has been compared to Roger Federer for his calm on-court demeanour and all-court movement.[4][7][11] Federer himself has praised Sinner for the balance in his game, remarking, \"What I like about him is that he almost has the same speed of shooting from the forehand and backhand\".[6] Former world No. 1 junior and tennis coach Claudio Pistolesi has praised Sinner's good lateral movement, which he attributes in part to Sinner's background in skiing.[104] In this regard, Sinner has been compared to Novak Djokovic, who also credits a background in skiing for improving his tennis skills.[105]\n\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\nWhen Sinner began to prioritise tennis at age thirteen, he was coached by Riccardo Piatti, who had also been a part-time coach of Novak Djokovic and Milos Raonic.[11] At the time, he also began working with Andrea Volpini and Massimo Sartori, the latter of whom was a longtime coach of Andreas Seppi.[106] He continued to work with Piatti as his primary coach, and Volpini as his second coach. His team also consisted of physiotherapist Claudio Zimaglia and fitness coach Dalibor Sirola.[10] In February 2022, he decided to stop his long collaboration with Piatti and his team and began to train with Simone Vagnozzi, ex-coach of Marco Cecchinato.[107] In July 2022, coach Darren Cahill officially joined Sinner's team.[108]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSinner resides in Monte Carlo in Monaco.[3] He is a fan of A.C. Milan football club.[9] One of his tennis idols is compatriot Andreas Seppi, who is also from Alto Adige.

He has been ranked as high as world No. 4 by the ATP, achieved on 2 October 2023, making him the highest ranked Italian male player in history (tied with Adriano Panatta). He also has a career-high ranking of world No. 124 in doubles, achieved on 27 September 2021. Sinner has won ten ATP Tour titles in singles, including a Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open, and one in doubles.\n\n\nSinner grew up in northern Italy in the region of South Tyrol. He was active in skiing, football, and tennis as a child. After winning a national championship in skiing at age eight, Sinner switched his focus to tennis at age thirteen and moved to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train with veteran coach Riccardo Piatti. Despite limited success as a junior, Sinner began playing in professional events at age 16 and became one of the few players to win multiple ATP Challenger Tour titles at age 17. He won the ATP Newcomer of the Year award in 2019 after breaking through into the top 100, reaching his first ATP semifinal, and winning the Next Generation ATP Finals in Milan.\n\n\nSinner continued his rise into the top 50 in 2020 with his first top 10 victory, a French Open quarterfinal (becoming the youngest quarterfinalist in men's singles since Novak Djokovic in 2006), and a maiden ATP title at the 2020 Sofia Open. He had a strong start to 2021, highlighted by his second ATP title in a row and a Masters 1000 runner-up at the Miami Open. On 1 November 2021, he became the first player born in the 2000s to enter the ATP top 10. He became the first teenage ATP 500 champion since the category was renamed in 2009 by winning the 2021 Citi Open. Sinner won his first Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\nJannik Sinner was born 16 August 2001 to Hanspeter and Siglinde Sinner in Innichen in the region of South Tyrol in northern Italy into a Roman Catholic family. He grew up in the town of Sexten, where his father and mother work as a chef and a waitress at a ski lodge.[2] He has a brother named Marc.[3] Sinner began both skiing and playing tennis at age three. He was one of Italy's top junior skiers from eight to twelve years old, winning a national championship in giant slalom at age eight and earning a national runner-up at the age of twelve.[4][5][6]\n\n\nWhile training in skiing, Sinner gave up tennis for a year at the age of seven before his father pushed him to return to the sport.[7] When he resumed playing, he began working with Heribert Mayr as his first regular coach.[8] Nonetheless, tennis was still only his third priority behind skiing and football.[9][10]\n\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Sinner decided to give up skiing and football in favour of tennis. He preferred it over skiing because he wanted to compete directly against an opponent and to have more margin of error over the course of an entire match. He also wanted to be in an individual sport where he could make all of the decisions, an opportunity he would not have in a team sport like football.[10] He decided to move on his own to Bordighera on the Italian Riviera to train at the Piatti Tennis Centre under Riccardo Piatti and Massimo Sartori, a decision which his parents supported.[3][5][7] At the centre, Sinner lived with the family of Luka Cvjetković, one of his coaches.[11] Before Sinner began training in tennis full-time with Piatti, he had been playing only twice a week.[9]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nSinner began playing on the ITF Junior Circuit, the premier junior tour which is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), in 2016. Despite having limited success as a junior, he moved mainly to the professional tour following the end of 2017. He never played the main draw of any high-level Grade 1 events in singles, and the only higher-level Grade A tournament he entered was the Trofeo Bonfiglio. He followed up an opening round loss at Italy's Grade A tournament in 2017 with a quarterfinal in 2018. That was the only junior event he played in 2018. He never played any of the junior Grand Slam tournaments. Because he entered so few high-level tournaments, Sinner's career-high junior ranking was a relatively low No. 133.[12]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2018: ITF Futures and Challenger Tour[edit]\n\n\nSinner wasn't too focused on the junior circuit,[*clarification needed*] and he began playing on the ITF Men's Circuit in early 2018. With his low ranking, he could initially be directly accepted into only ITF Futures events. Nonetheless, he began receiving wild cards for ATP Challenger Tour events, the second-tier tour run by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), in the second half of the year.[13] His only ITF title of the year was in doubles,[14] and he finished the season ranked No. 551.[15]\n\n\n\n### 2019: NextGen Finals title and top 100[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2019 NextGen ATP Finals in Milan\nSinner won his first ATP Challenger title in Bergamo in February 2019 at the age of 17 years and 6 months, despite entering the tournament with no match wins at the Challenger level. He became the first person born in 2001 to reach a Challenger final, and the youngest Italian to win a Challenger title in history. With the title, he rose over 200 spots in ATP rankings up to No. 324.[16][17] After his first two ITF Futures titles, Sinner entered his first ATP tournament at the Hungarian Open as a lucky loser, where he notched his first tour-level win over home wild card Máté Valkusz.[18] The next week, he reached his second ATP Challenger final in Ostrava, finishing runner-up to Kamil Majchrzak.[19]\n\n\nDuring the second half of the season, Sinner played more often on the ATP Tour than the Challenger Tour.[20] His first ATP Masters victory came at the Italian Open against Steve Johnson, and he broke into the top 200 with his next ATP win at the Croatia Open Umag in July.[15] The next month, he won a second ATP Challenger title in Lexington to become one of just eleven 17-year-olds to have won multiple Challenger titles.[21] After losing in qualifying at Wimbledon, Sinner qualified for his first Grand Slam main draw at the US Open.[22] He lost his debut match to No. 24 Stan Wawrinka.[20]\n\n\nSinner had a strong finish to the season. As a wild card at the European Open, he became the youngest player in five years to reach an ATP semifinal.[23] Along the way, he knocked off top seed and world No. 13 Gaël Monfils for his first career top 50 victory.[24] This performance helped him break into the top 100 for the first time one week later.[15] At the end of the season, Sinner qualified for the 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals as the Italian wild card and the lowest seed.[25] He won in his round robin group with victories over Frances Tiafoe and Mikael Ymer, losing only to Ugo Humbert. After defeating Miomir Kecmanović in the semifinals, Sinner upset top seed and world No. 18 Alex de Minaur in straight sets to win the title.[26] He played one last event in Italy the following week, winning a third Challenger title in Ortisei. Sinner finished the year at world No. 78, becoming the youngest player in the year-end top 80 since Rafael Nadal in 2003.[18] He was also named ATP Newcomer of the Year.[27]\n\n\n\n### 2020: First ATP title and top 40[edit]\n\n\nEarly in the year, Sinner made the second round of the 2020 Australian Open, recording his first Grand Slam main draw match win over home wild card Max Purcell before losing to Márton Fucsovics. As a wild card at the Rotterdam Open, he earned his first top 10 victory against world No. 10 David Goffin.[28]\n\n\nFollowing the ATP Tour shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sinner had a successful restart to the season. Although he lost his opening round match to Karen Khachanov at the US Open, he fared better in Europe. He reached the third round at the Rome Masters, highlighted by a victory over world No. 6 Stefanos Tsitsipas.[29] He then progressed to become the youngest quarterfinalist at the French Open since Novak Djokovic in 2006, and the first to make the quarterfinals on debut since Rafael Nadal in 2005. During the tournament, he defeated Goffin again as well as US Open runner-up and world No. 7 Alexander Zverev before losing to Nadal.[30][31]\n\n\nAfter a semifinal at the Cologne Championship where he lost to Zverev,[32] Sinner closed out the season by winning the Sofia Open for his first ATP title. During the event, he defeated Next Gen rival Alex de Minaur and then Vasek Pospisil in the final.[33] He became the youngest Italian tour-level champion in the Open Era and the youngest player overall to win an ATP title since Kei Nishikori in 2008.[34][35]\n\n\nSinner finished the year ranked world No. 37.[15]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Four titles, Masters final and top 10 debut[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sinner at the 2021 French Open\nSinner carried over his success from late 2020 into the start of the 2021 season. He won his second career ATP title at the Great Ocean Road Open,[36] and notably defeated No. 20 Karen Khachanov in the semifinals after saving a match point.[37] He became the youngest to win back-to-back ATP titles since Rafael Nadal in 2005.[36] His ten-match winning streak came to an end in the first round of the 2021 Australian Open, where he lost a tight five-set match to world No. 12 Denis Shapovalov.[38]\n\n\nSinner's next big result was at the Miami Open, where he reached his first ATP Masters 1000 final. During the tournament, he defeated Khachanov again and later world No. 12 Roberto Bautista Agut in the semifinal.[39][40] He finished runner-up to Hubert Hurkacz.[41]\n\n\nThen at the French Open, his campaign was stopped short for the second year running by Rafael Nadal who this time defeated Sinner in straight sets in the fourth round.[42] In his main draw debut at Wimbledon, he lost in the first round to Márton Fucsovics.\n\n\nPartnering Reilly Opelka he won his first doubles title at the 2021 Atlanta Open, defeating Steve Johnson and Jordan Thompson.[43] At the same tournament in singles he fell in the second round to Christopher O'Connell.[44]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Citi Open in Washington, D.C., Sinner went into the tournament as the fifth seed and made it to the finals and beat several young players along the way such as Emil Ruusuvuori, Sebastian Korda, and Jenson Brooksby.[45] He beat Mackenzie McDonald in the final to win his third title and first ATP 500 title. Sinner was the first Italian finalist and champion in Washington's tournament history as well as the youngest ATP 500 and first teen champion since the category was created in 2009.[46] As a result, he entered the top 15 in the ATP rankings on 9 August 2021.\n\n\nAt the US Open, he defeated Gaël Monfils in the third round to reach the second week of a Major for the second time in the season. Sinner's tournament ended when he lost to Alexander Zverev in the 4th round in straight sets.\n\n\nSinner successfully defended his title at the Sofia Open as the top seed, defeating again second seed Gaël Monfils in the final.[47]\nSinner made his sixth career final at the 2021 European Open without dropping a set en route. He defeated Lorenzo Musetti, Arthur Rinderknech and Lloyd Harris to reach the final.[48] He bested Diego Schwartzman in the final to take his fifth career title. He became the youngest man to win five ATP titles since 19-year-old Novak Djokovic.[49]\n\n\nOn 1 November, Sinner became the first male player born in the 2000s to break into the top-10 after a semifinal appearance at the Vienna Open.\nAt the Rolex Paris Masters, Sinner received a bye in the first round but was defeated by Carlos Alcaraz. Because of this, Sinner was unable to directly qualify for the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals.[50]\n\n\nAt the ATP Finals in Turin, Sinner was present as the first alternate. Sinner entered the tournament after countryman Matteo Berrettini was forced to withdraw with an abdominal injury after his first match with Alexander Zverev.[51] He defeated Hubert Hurkacz and became the youngest player to win an ATP Finals match on debut since Lleyton Hewitt in Lisbon in 2000 and the first alternate to win a match since Janko Tipsarević in London in 2011.[52][53] Sinner played Daniil Medvedev next in the round robin stage, holding a match point before being defeated in 3 sets. As a result, he re-entered the top-10 in the rankings and finished the year at world No. 10 on 22 November 2021.\n\n\nIn the Davis Cup Finals, Sinner defeated John Isner becoming only the second player (after Thiemo de Bakker) ever to bagel Isner.[54]\n\n\n\n### 2022: Three Major quarterfinals, Davis Cup success[edit]\n\n\nAt the Australian Open, Sinner reached the quarterfinals of a major for the second time in his career, becoming the fifth Italian man to reach that stage in Melbourne.[55] He then lost to fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the Miami Open, he saved three match points in the opening round against Emil Ruusuvuori and five match points against Pablo Carreño Busta to advance to the round of 16.[56] He then defeated Nick Kyrgios but retired against Francisco Cerúndolo in the quarterfinals. In the Monte Carlo Masters, he again reached the quarterfinals after defeating fifth seed Andrey Rublev, before losing to second seed Alexander Zverev in a three-set and over three hour-long match.[57][58] He again saved three match points in the opener at the Madrid Open against Tommy Paul to move to the second round.[59] Next, he defeated Alex de Minaur for his 100th career win;[60] he hit this milestone after 147 matches (100–47) on Tour, which was a faster rate than everyone in the Top 10 besides Rafael Nadal (100–37) and Novak Djokovic (100–43).[61] He was defeated in the third round by Félix Auger-Aliassime.[62]\n\n\nAt the French Open, he retired in the fourth round against Andrey Rublev after sustaining a knee injury.[63]\n\n\nAt the Eastbourne International, Sinner suffered his first opening round loss of the year after losing to Tommy Paul in three sets.[64] At the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, he recorded his first win at this Major over Stan Wawrinka.[65] He then beat Mikael Ymer, John Isner, and Carlos Alcaraz to reach his third career Grand Slam quarterfinal. He lost to top seed and eventual champion Novak Djokovic in five sets in the quarterfinals, after being two sets to love up.[66]\n\n\nAt the Croatia Open, Sinner defeated Carlos Alcaraz in the final to win his first clay court title.[67] In Montreal, he lost to eventual champion Pablo Carreño Busta in the third round.[68] Sinner's loss guaranteed a maiden Masters 1000 finalist from his half of the draw. At the Cincinnati Masters, he lost in the third round to Félix Auger-Aliassime after being up a set, a break, and 2 match points.[69]\n\n\nSeeded 11th at the US Open, he reached the fourth round after defeating Brandon Nakashima in four sets.[70] Next, he defeated Ilya Ivashka in a five set match lasting close to four hours to reach the quarterfinals for the first time at this Major.[71] He became the youngest player to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments since Novak Djokovic in 2007–08.[72] He lost to Carlos Alcaraz in a five-set match that lasted 5 hours and 15 minutes; the match set the record as the latest finish (at 2:50 am EST) and second longest match in US Open history. Sinner held a match point while serving up 5–4 in the 4th set, but ended up losing the set 5–7.[73][74]\n\n\nIn September, during the Davis Cup Finals after Matteo Berrettini won his singles match against Argentina, Sinner won the second match (best of three matches) and thus secured a place for Italy's Davis Cup team at the Final 8 of the Davis Cup Finals.[75] Following close to a month break due to an injury sustained in the semifinal at the 2022 Sofia Open[76] he returned to the 2022 Erste Bank Open in Vienna and reached also the quarterfinals losing to top seed and eventual champion Daniil Medvedev.[77] In his next tournament, the 2022 Rolex Paris Masters, he lost in the first round to qualifier Marc-Andrea Huesler.[78]\n\n\nSinner finished the year ranked 15th in the world, one space ahead of countryman Matteo Berrettini.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Major semifinal, first Masters & world No. 1 wins, World No. 4, ATP Finals debut[edit]\n\n\nSinner's season started at the 2023 Adelaide international 1, where he reached the quarter-final, defeating Kyle Edmund and Thanasi Kokkinakis, before coming up short to eventual finalist Sebastian Korda, being straight-setted 7–5 6–1.\nHis season continued at the 2023 Australian Open, where he made the 4th round, beating Kyle Edmund for the second time, Tomás Martín Etcheverry and Márton Fucsovics before losing to eventual finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas in 5 sets.\n\n\nSinner won the 2023 Open Sud de France in Montpellier, his seventh title, becoming the first player to win a tour-level title in the season without having dropped a single set and the first since countryman Lorenzo Musetti won the title in Naples in October 2022.[79]\nAt the 2023 ABN AMRO Open he defeated top seed and world No. 3 Stefanos Tsitsipas taking his revenge for the 2023 Australian Open fourth round five setter loss, for his biggest win ever.[80] Next in the quarterfinals, he defeated Stan Wawrinka.[81] In the semifinals, he defeated home favorite Tallon Griekspoor to reach the final.[82] He lost to sixth seed Daniil Medvedev in the final.\n\n\nIn March, he played in Indian Wells where he made the semifinals.[83] He defeated Richard Gasquet, Adrian Mannarino, and Stan Wawrinka all in straight sets to advance to the quarterfinals where he faced defending champion Taylor Fritz and won in a three-set match. In the following round in the semifinals, he lost in straight sets to rival top seed Carlos Alcaraz who returned to world No. 1 following the tournament. \nIn Miami, he reached the quarterfinals of this tournament for a third straight year defeating 21st seed Grigor Dimitrov and sixth seed Andrey Rublev.[84] As a result, he returned to the top 10 in the rankings at world No. 9. He defeated Emil Ruusuvuori to reach back-to-back semifinals.[85] This time he defeated defending champion Carlos Alcaraz to reach his second Miami and career Masters final in three years,[86] putting an end to Alcaraz's hopes for a Sunshine Double and preventing him from returning to the No. 1 spot.[87] He lost to fourth seed Daniil Medvedev in straight sets in the final, extending his losing streak versus the Russian to 0–6.[88]\n\n\nIn Monte Carlo he reached a third consecutive Masters semifinal defeating compatriot and 16th seed Lorenzo Musetti.[89]\nAt the French Open, Sinner, as the No. 8 seed in the draw, was upset as the heavy favourite in the second round by Daniel Altmaier in a five-set match. Sinner served for the match in the fourth set and had match point, but was denied on a net cord shot by Altmaier, who proceeded to break back and eventually win the set and the match.[*citation needed*] The five sets match included three tiebreaks, of which Sinner only won one, in the first set. The match lasted five hours and 26 minutes, the longest match since Lorenzo Giustino against Corentin Moutet six hours and 5 minutes win in 2020, the fifth longest overall of the tournament[90] and the second longest of the season after Kokkinakis against Murray at the Australian Open.[91][92]\n\n\nHe reached back to back quarterfinals at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships defeating Juan Manuel Cerundolo, Diego Schwartzman, Quentin Halys and Daniel Elahi Galan.[93] He reached his first Major semifinal defeating Roman Safiullin, before losing to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[94]\n\n\nIn August, he won his maiden Masters 1000 title at the 2023 Canadian Open in Toronto defeating Alex de Minaur in straight sets for his eighth ATP title.[95] En route to the final, he defeated compatriot Matteo Berrettini, Andy Murray by walkover, Gaël Monfils, and Tommy Paul.\n\n\nAt the 2023 China Open, he defeated top seed and world No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz, his fourth tour-level win against the Spaniard, to reach his fifth final of the season, defeating second seed and world No. 3 Daniil Medvedev for the first time at the seventh time of asking.[96] As a result, he reached World No. 4 to become the second Italian in the history of the ATP rankings to reach the Top 5, equaling Adriano Panatta.[97] At the 2023 Rolex Shanghai Masters he lost in the round of 16 to 19th seed Ben Shelton.[98]\n\n\nHe recorded his 55th win over Andrey Rublev to reach his fourth ATP 500 career final in Vienna and became the first Italian man with the most wins for a season in the Open Era surpassing Corrado Barazzutti's 54 mark in 1978.[99] He won the final defeating again top seed Daniil Medvedev to win his tenth ATP title and third at the ATP 500 level, defeating him in two consecutive finals and improving his head-to-head record against the Russian to 2–6. He also recorded his 40 tour-level hard court win in a season for the first time.[100]\n\n\nOn his debut at the 2023 ATP Finals he defeated world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the round robin stage, his fifth top-5 win in a row.[101][102]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nSinner is an aggressive baseliner and is one of the hardest hitters on the ATP tour. Sinner's groundstroke strength is his two-handed-backhand, which he hits with more topspin than any other player on the tour, registering an average of 1858 revolutions per minute on the shot along with the fifth-best average speed of 111.2 kilometres per hour (69.1 mph).[103] His forehand is also a strength, owing to the fact he has a short compact takeback, meaning he rarely has to rush the shot, and the ability to rapidly open up his body, generating huge racket head speed and allowing him to hit the shot at over 100 mph on occasion. He uses a modern, semi-western grip to generate large amounts of topspin, increasing net clearance and reducing the likelihood of unforced errors.\n\n\nHe also possesses a powerful first serve, which can reach up to speeds of 221 kilometres per hour (137.3 mph) although it has been criticised for its low average in percentage at 59.2%, and it can frequently dip below 55%. His coaching team has tried to combat this by alternating between the pinpoint(legs together) and platform(legs apart) stances, although as of late 2023 it seems they have settled on the pinpoint stance. Sinner is aiming to incorporate more variety into his game, hence he has been developing his net game and ability to serve-and-volley, as well as his slices and dropshots, to reduce the number of long rallies he has to play from the baseline.\n\n\nSinner has been compared to Roger Federer for his calm on-court demeanour and all-court movement.[4][7][11] Federer himself has praised Sinner for the balance in his game, remarking, \"What I like about him is that he almost has the same speed of shooting from the forehand and backhand\".[6] Former world No. 1 junior and tennis coach Claudio Pistolesi has praised Sinner's good lateral movement, which he attributes in part to Sinner's background in skiing.[104] In this regard, Sinner has been compared to Novak Djokovic, who also credits a background in skiing for improving his tennis skills.[105]\n\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\nWhen Sinner began to prioritise tennis at age thirteen, he was coached by Riccardo Piatti, who had also been a part-time coach of Novak Djokovic and Milos Raonic.[11] At the time, he also began working with Andrea Volpini and Massimo Sartori, the latter of whom was a longtime coach of Andreas Seppi.[106] He continued to work with Piatti as his primary coach, and Volpini as his second coach. His team also consisted of physiotherapist Claudio Zimaglia and fitness coach Dalibor Sirola.[10] In February 2022, he decided to stop his long collaboration with Piatti and his team and began to train with Simone Vagnozzi, ex-coach of Marco Cecchinato.[107] In July 2022, coach Darren Cahill officially joined Sinner's team.[108]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSinner resides in Monte Carlo in Monaco.[3] He is a fan of A.C. Milan football club.[9] One of his tennis idols is compatriot Andreas Seppi, who is also from Alto Adige. Nonetheless, he has already surpassed Seppi in terms of achievements, with his main idols being Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic.[17]\n\n\nSinner speaks three languages: German (mother tongue), Italian and English.[109]\n\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nSinner endorses Nike,[110] Head,[111] Rolex,[112] Gucci,[113] Lavazza,[114] Alfa Romeo,[115] FASTWEB,[116] Technogym,[117] and Parmigiano Reggiano.[118]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jannik Sinner career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam singles performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win%\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 1R | QF | 4R |  | 0 / 4\n | 8–4\n | 67%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | QF | 4R | 4R | 2R |  | 0 / 4\n | 11–4\n | 73%\n |\n| Wimbledon | Q1 | NH\n | 1R | QF | SF |  | 0 / 3\n | 9–3\n | 75%\n |\n| US Open | 1R | 1R | 4R | QF | 4R |  | 0 / 5\n | 10–5\n | 67%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–1\n | 5–3\n | 6–4\n | 15–4\n | 12–4\n |  | 0 / 16\n | 38–16\n | 70%\n |\n\n\nSource: ATP profile[3]\n\n\n\n### Year-end championships finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 1 (1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2023 | ATP Finals, Turin\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 3–6, 3–6\n |\n\n\n### Masters 1000 finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 3 (1 title, 2 runners-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss\n | 2021 | Miami Open | Hard\n | ![Poland](image) Hubert Hurkacz | 6–7(4–7), 4–6\n |\n| Loss\n | 2023 | Miami Open\n | Hard\n | ![](image) Daniil Medvedev | 5–7, 3–6\n |\n| Win\n | 2023 | Canadian Open | Hard\n | ![Australia](image) Alex de Minaur | 6–4, 6–1\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Jannik Sinner career statistics\n* Italian players best ranking\n* Tennis in Italy\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Italian pronunciation: [ˈjannik ˈsinner]; German pronunciation: [ˈjanɪk ˈzɪnɐ]\n\n1. **^** \"Jannik Sinner | Overview | ATP Tour | Tennis\". *ATP Tour*.

He has been ranked by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) as high as world No. 2, and was continuously ranked in the top 10 from July 2017 to November 2022. Zverev's singles career highlights include a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and titles at the 2018 and the 2021 ATP Finals. He has won 21 ATP Tour titles in singles and two in doubles, and contested a major final at the 2020 US Open.\n\n\nZverev is a former junior world No. 1, and won a junior major singles title at the 2014 Australian Open. He had an early breakthrough on the professional tour as well, becoming one of the youngest Challenger Tour title winners in history at the age of 17. As a teenager, Zverev won two ATP titles and upset then-world No. 3 Roger Federer on grass. At 20 years old, he became the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since Novak Djokovic. At the Laver Cup, Zverev has played an instrumental role in Team Europe's early success in the competition, winning the clinching matches in 2018 and 2019. After reaching his career-best results in 2021 and 2022, he suffered an ankle injury at the French Open, from which he has gradually recovered.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\nAlexander Zverev was born on 20 April 1997 in Hamburg, Germany to Russian parents Irina Zvereva and Alexander Mikhailovich Zverev. His older brother, Mischa, born nearly a decade earlier, is also a professional tennis player. Both of his parents were professional tennis players for the Soviet Union. His father, ranked as high as No. 175 in the world, became the top-ranked men's player nationally, while his mother was the fourth highest ranked women's player in the Soviet Union. They both moved from Sochi to the capital to train at the CSKA Moscow military-run tennis club. The Soviet government often restricted their players from competing outside the country, an impediment that limited how high either of Alexander's parents could rise in the world rankings. With the collapse of the Soviet Union imminent, Irina went to Germany to compete at a tournament in 1990, with her husband accompanying as her coach. While in Germany, they were offered jobs as tennis instructors. After initially declining, they accepted an offer to work at the Uhlenhorster Hockey Club in Hamburg the following year and ended up settling in the country.[7]\n\n\nZverev, nicknamed Sascha (the Russian-language nickname for Alexander), started playing tennis at the age of 3. Since he began playing tennis at a very young age, he has said, \"One day, when I was, I think, one year and five months old, I just picked up a little racket and I was starting to push the ball all over our apartment, and since then, they took me out on the court. I enjoy it still, I enjoyed it back then.\"[8] When he was five years old, he started to play tennis at least half an hour each day.[8] He was extremely competitive as a child. His brother, Mischa, said, \"He would not understand or accept that he was losing,\" when the two would play against each other. He would never want to leave the court unless he won the match. He also played hockey and football as a child but decided to focus only on tennis around the age of 12 after an early-round loss at a high-level international junior tournament in Florida.[7]\n\n\nWhen Alexander was young, his mother was his primary coach while his father was focused on coaching his brother. He has said, \"I think I have pretty good technique, which my mum did at a young age, so credit to her for that. My backhand, in particular, is 100 percent down to my mum.\"[9] While his mother had a more relaxed teaching style, his father \"had a very Soviet way of doing physical training sessions\" that involved doing timed drills for fixed numbers of repetitions.[7] Alexander's coaches aimed for him to have a riskier, aggressive playing style built around hitting the ball with pace and finishing points quickly. This was a big contrast from how he played around age 12 when his style centered around being an \"unbelievable fighter\" from the baseline in part because he was too slow to go to the net.[9] Initially, Alexander struggled to change his playing style. He \"made a lot of errors\" and lost to opponents who excelled at keeping points alive. However, his father stuck with this strategy, saying, \"We must practise fast tennis, aggressive tennis. If you lose today it's no big deal. You must think about the future.\"[7][9]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nZverev played his first junior match in January 2011 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Poland. He is a former world No. 1 junior.[10] He entered his first event on the International Tennis Federation (ITF) junior circuit in early 2011 when he was 13. Near the beginning of 2012, Zverev won his first ITF title at the Fujairah Junior Championships, a low-level Grade 4 tournament in the United Arab Emirates. He would pick up a lower level Grade 5 title at the Oman International Junior 2 a few weeks later, which led him to begin competing in higher-level events shortly before his 15th birthday.[10] He did not have much success at tournaments that were Grade 2 and above until the following year when he reached back-to-back doubles finals with Spencer Papa at the Grade A Copa Gerdau and the Grade 1 USTA International Spring Championships.[10][11][12]\n\n\nZverev's early-season success in doubles proved to be the precursor of a major improvement in singles as well. During the European clay court season, he won his first Grade 1 title over Andrey Rublev at the Open International Junior de Beaulieu-sur-Mer.[13] He followed up that performance with his first Grade A title at the Trofeo Bonfiglio a month later, becoming the youngest boys' singles champion in the tournament's history.[14] He also finished runner-up at the 2013 French Open to Cristian Garín.[15][16] Zverev had some grass court success as well, finishing runner-up to Nick Kyrgios at the Junior International Roehampton.[17] However, he needed to retire at Wimbledon due to a shoulder injury.[18] Zverev came close to reaching another major boys' singles final at the 2013 Junior US Open, but was defeated by the eventual champion Borna Ćorić in the semifinals.[19] This success was enough for him to take over the No. 1 ranking in late October. Before the end of the season, Zverev also represented Germany in the Junior Fed Cup, leading them to a fourth-place finish.[10] His last tournament of the year was the Grade A Orange Bowl, where he was defeated by Stefan Kozlov in the semifinals.[20] As the top-ranked junior at the end of the season, he was named the ITF Junior World Champion, becoming the youngest boys' champion since Donald Young in 2005.[21]\n\n\nZverev played just two tournaments in 2014, both in Australia in January.[10] He won the singles events at both tournaments, the first of which came against Australian Omar Jasika at the Traralgon Junior International. At the Australian Open, he was able to defeat Kozlov, who was seeded second, to finish his junior career with a first major title.[22]\n\n\nJunior Grand Slam results – Singles:\n\n\nAustralian Open: **W** (2014)  \n\nFrench Open: F (2013)  \n\nWimbledon: 3R (2013)  \n\nUS Open: SF (2013)\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2011–14: Challenger title and ATP semifinal at 17[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2014 Bavarian International Tennis Championships\nAs the age of 14, Zverev entered qualifying at three different tournaments, including the 2011 Moselle Open on the ATP Tour, but lost all of his matches. He won his professional main draw debut against compatriot Christian Lichtenegger at a Futures event in Germany in August 2012. At the end of the year, he made his first professional final, finishing runner-up to Florian Reynet at an ITF $10K event in Florida.[23] Zverev continued to focus on the juniors in 2013 and did not reach another pro-level final that year,[24] but he did make his main draw debut on the ATP Tour in July, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut at his hometown tournament, the International German Open.[25] He also made his ATP Challenger Tour debut, losing to Máximo González at the Meerbusch Challenger in August.[23]\n\n\nAfter winning the boys' singles title at the 2014 Australian Open, Zverev shifted his focus to his professional career, only playing in pro events the rest of the year.[10][24] Initially, he struggled on the pro tour, failing to qualify for the main draw at his first five events of the season. He did not win a main draw match until he recorded a single victory at the Heilbronner Neckarcup Challenger, his tenth event of the year. One of his losses was a retirement against his brother Mischa.[23] Zverev made his first professional breakthrough in July when he won the Braunschweig Challenger for his first professional title, despite entering the tournament with just one career Challenger-level match win and no top 100 victories. Three of the players he defeated were in the top 100, including his first-round opponent No. 87 Tobias Kamke, his semifinal opponent No. 56 Andrey Golubev, and his final opponent No. 89 Paul-Henri Mathieu.[26]\n\n\nAt the age of 17 years and 2 months, he became the youngest player to win a Challenger title since Bernard Tomic in 2009 and the twelfth youngest in history.[27] Zverev followed up this title with a breakthrough at the ATP Tour level. He entered the International German Open having never won an ATP match but managed to reach the semifinals. He recorded four match wins at the event, including his first career victory against Robin Haase and his first top 20 victory over No. 16 Mikhail Youzhny before losing to No. 7 David Ferrer. He became the first 17-year old to defeat a top 20 opponent since Richard Gasquet in 2004 and the first to make a semifinal since Marin Čilić in 2006.[28] Zverev had risen from No. 665 to No. 285 after his Challenger title, and his ATP 500 Series semifinal appearance took him to No. 161 in the world. He finished the season ranked No. 136.[29]\n\n\n\n### 2015: ATP doubles final, top 100[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2015 US Open\nAt the beginning of the season, Zverev was still ranked too low to receive direct entry into the main draws of ATP Tour events, which forced him to continue playing Challenger events through July. He also needed to enter qualifying for ATP events throughout the year. Zverev did not qualify for either of the first two major singles events of the season.[23] He was able to qualify for his first Masters event at the Miami Open and reached the second round.[30] During the clay-court season, Zverev partnered with his brother Mischa to reach his first career ATP final in doubles at the Bavarian International Tennis Championships. The Zverev brothers finished runner-up to top-seeded Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares.[31] Later that month, he won his second career Challenger title at the Heilbronn Neckarcup to crack the top 100 of the ATP rankings.[32]\n\n\nWith a higher ranking, Zverev was directly accepted into Wimbledon. A week before the tournament, he took part in the Boodles Challenge exhibition and surprisingly upset world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[33] Zverev backed up this performance in his Grand Slam tournament main draw debut, defeating Teymuraz Gabashvili in a tight match that lasted until 9–7 in the fifth and final set.[34] He lost in the next round to Denis Kudla. Zverev opted to play on clay after Wimbledon and reached another ATP semifinal at the Swedish Open to put him back in the top 100 after one week out.[35][29] In August, Zverev returned to the United States and competed in two US Open Series events. He notably upset No. 14 Kevin Anderson at the Citi Open en route to the quarterfinals.[36][37] Zverev's brief rankings drop in July meant that he needed to qualify for the US Open. He succeeded, but lost his opening round match to compatriot Philipp Kohlschreiber in five sets.[38] Zverev won just one more main draw match the rest of the season and ended the year ranked No. 83 in the world.[39][29] As the youngest player in the top 100, he was named the ATP Newcomer of the Year.[40]\n\n\n\n### 2016: First ATP title, Federer upset, top 20[edit]\n\n\nZverev's first ATP event of the year was the 2016 Australian Open, where he had a difficult draw against world No. 2 Andy Murray and was only able to win six games in his opening match.[41] He bounced back at the Open Sud de France, reaching the semifinals in the singles event and his second career final with his brother in the doubles event.[42] During the singles event, he upset No. 13 Marin Čilić, the highest-ranked player he had defeated in an official match at the time.[43] Zverev then produced a strong result at the Indian Wells Masters, where he defeated two top 30 players. In the fourth round, he nearly upset No. 5 Rafael Nadal. Zverev had a match point while he was serving for the final set, but missed a routine forehand volley and then proceeded to lose 14 of the remaining 15 points in the match. He commented on the match point that, \"I missed probably the easiest shot I had the whole match.\"[44] Back in Europe, Zverev was able to recover as he reached his first ATP singles final at the Open de Nice Côte d'Azur, finishing runner-up to No. 15 Dominic Thiem, the top seed and defending champion.[45] Thiem also defeated him in the third round of the French Open.[46]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"I haven't really grasped it yet. That I would be standing here as a winner, I couldn't have imagined it yesterday... It's unbelievable to get a win against Roger, especially on grass.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Zverev on his victory against Federer at the Halle Open.[47][48]\n\nZverev's next breakthrough came during the grass court season at the Halle Open, where he upset world No. 3 Roger Federer in the semifinals, ending Federer's streak of ten consecutive appearances in the final while competing at the tournament.[48] He was also the first teenager to defeat Federer since Murray nearly a decade earlier.[47] Nonetheless, he finished runner-up at the event to veteran compatriot Florian Mayer.[49] After this final, he entered the top 30 for the first time and stayed ranked in the 20s for the rest of the season.[29] Despite being seeded at a major tournament for the first time, Zverev could then only match his best major singles result at Wimbledon, again falling to Berdych.[50] During the US Open Series, he reached the semifinals of the Washington Open,[51] but lost his opening round matches at both Masters events. He was then upset in the second round of the US Open by Dan Evans.[52]\n\n\nAfter the US Open, Zverev returned to Europe and won his first career ATP title at the St. Petersburg Open. He recorded his first win over No. 9 Berdych in the semifinals, and No. 3 Stan Wawrinka in the final, coming back from 0–3 down in the third set.[53] At his next event, he then defeated No. 10 Thiem in the first round of the 2016 China Open for the first time in four tries this year. In doing so, Zverev became the first teenager to record three consecutive victories against top ten opponents since Boris Becker in 1986.[54][55] Zverev's third round appearance at the Shanghai Masters then helped him rise to No. 20 in the ATP rankings, making him the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since Novak Djokovic in 2006.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2016 US Open\n### 2017: Two Masters titles, world No. 3[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2017 season, Zverev greatly improved his results at the higher level tournaments on the ATP Tour except for the four major events. It was at this time Zverev, who had been using his nickname Sascha, stated in a postmatch interview with Pam Shriver, that he would no longer be referred to as Sascha. Zverev stated that only his close family can refer to him as Sascha, as he was born in Germany and identifies as a German, and does not want a Russian nickname to be used for his professional career. At the Australian Open, Zverev again pushed Rafael Nadal to the brink, but ultimately lost in five sets.[57] His next ATP tournament was the Open Sud de France, where he won both the singles and doubles events. He and his brother defeated Fabrice Martin and Daniel Nestor for Alexander's first doubles title.[58] The following month, he made his first Masters quarterfinal at the Miami Open, upsetting No. 3 Stan Wawrinka along the way.[59] Nick Kyrgios defeated him at both Masters events that month.[60]\n\n\nAfter a slow start to the clay court season, Zverev won two more titles in May, the first of which came at home in Germany at the Bavarian International Tennis Championships.[61] He then followed up a second Masters quarterfinal at the Madrid Open with his first Masters title at the Rome Masters. He defeated Novak Djokovic in the final to become the youngest Masters champion since Djokovic in 2007 and the first such champion born in the 1990s. With the title, he also entered the top 10 for the first time.[62][63] Despite his triumph in Rome, he lost his opening round match at the French Open.[64] During the grass court season, Zverev made another singles final and again faced Federer at the Halle Open, but could not defeat him this time.[65] He and his brother also finished runner-up in the doubles event to Łukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo.[66] At Wimbledon, he achieved his best result at a major event to date, ultimately losing in the fourth round to the previous year's runner-up Milos Raonic in a tight five set match.[67]\n\n\nBack on hard courts, Zverev won his last two titles of the season in August. He won the Washington Open as well as a second consecutive Masters title at the Canadian Open, only dropping a single set at each tournament in each of his opening matches.[68] Notably, he needed to save three match points in his first match in Canada against Richard Gasquet, including a 49 shot rally.[69] He then defeated Roger Federer in the final to become the first player outside of the Big Four to win multiple Masters titles in the same season since David Nalbandian in 2007.[70][71] Despite this success, he was upset in the second round of the US Open by fellow Next Gen player Borna Ćorić.[72] At the end of the season, Zverev qualified for both the inaugural Next Generation Finals as one of the top seven 21-and-under players, and the ATP Finals as one of the top eight players in the world. He opted to skip the former event to focus on the latter.[73] At the ATP Finals, Zverev was grouped with Roger Federer, Marin Čilić, and Jack Sock. He defeated Čilić in his first match, but lost his final two matches and did not advance out of his round robin group.[74][75][76] Zverev finished the year ranked No. 4, peaking at No. 3 right before the ATP Finals, and accumulated five ATP titles from just six finals.[23][29]\n\n\n\n### 2018: Tour Finals champion, first major quarterfinal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev with the champion's trophy at the 2018 Washington Open\nZverev maintained his top 5 ranking throughout the year.[29] However, he still did not deliver any high-calibre results at the major tournaments. He was upset at the Australian Open by reigning Next Gen Finals champion and No. 59 Chung Hyeon in five sets in the third round. Zverev stated that issues at majors were \"definitely not physical\" when asked if his problems were physical or mental, and also attribute this lack of success to the extra pressure he was putting on himself at these events.[77] Zverev did not reach his first final of the year until early April at the Miami Masters. Despite taking the first set of the final, he finished runner-up to American John Isner, who had never previously won a Masters title.[78]\n\n\nZverev continued his Masters success into the clay-court season, reaching the semifinals at the Monte Carlo Masters,[79] winning his third career Masters title at the Madrid Open, and making the final at the Rome Masters. In Madrid, he defeated Dominic Thiem in the final to become the only active player outside of the Big Four to have won three Masters titles.[80] He came close to winning back-to-back Masters events, going up a break in the third set against Nadal at the Italian Open. However, Nadal was able to recover and win the final five games of the match after a rain delay.[81] Zverev had also defended his title at the Bavarian International Tennis Championships in his only other French Open tune-up to help build up a 13 match win streak that lasted until the Italian Open final.[82] He capped off his excellent clay court season by reaching his first major quarterfinal at the French Open. He needed to win three five-set matches to get that far before Thiem ended his run while he was faced with a hamstring injury.[83]\n\n\nUp until the year-end championships, Zverev struggled to build on his early season success. He lost in the third round at both Wimbledon and the US Open,[84][85] and his best result at the four remaining Masters events was a semifinal at the Shanghai Masters.[86] He was able to defend his title at the Washington Open, his only title during this period.[87] Zverev also reached two more doubles finals with his brother, but did not win either of them.[88][89] At the end of the season, Zverev qualified for both the Next Generation Finals and the ATP Finals for the second consecutive year, again choosing to only compete at the latter event. He was placed in a group with Novak Djokovic, Marin Čilić, and John Isner. This year, Zverev was able to advance out of the group, only losing to No. 1 Djokovic in the round robin.[90][91] He faced Federer in the semifinals and defeated him in straight sets to set up a rematch with Djokovic.[92] Despite being a heavy underdog and having just lost to Djokovic earlier in the week, Zverev won the final in straight sets for the tenth and biggest title of his career. He became the youngest tour champion since Djokovic a decade earlier and the first German to win the season-ending championships since Boris Becker in 1995. This was also Zverev's first victory over a current world No. 1 player.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### 2019: Early season struggles, Masters runner-up, ATP Finals semifinal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2019 French Open\nZverev opened his 2019 season with a fourth round appearance at the 2019 Australian Open, defeating Jérémy Chardy in five sets in the second round before losing to Milos Raonic in straight sets.[95][96] Zverev next played at the Mexican Open and finished runner-up to Nick Kyrgios.[97] Following this tournament, he did not win more than one match at any of his next six events, a streak that ended with two match wins at the Madrid Open.[23][98] Nonetheless, Zverev finished the clay court season strong. The week before the French Open, he won his only title of the year at the Geneva Open, defeating Nicolás Jarry in the final after saving two match points in the third set tiebreak.[99] He then went on to defeat No. 12 Fabio Fognini and reach his second consecutive quarterfinal at the French Open, where he lost to Novak Djokovic.[100] Zverev did not follow through on that success into the grass court season, where his best result was a quarterfinal at the Halle Open.[101] He was upset in the first round at both the Stuttgart Open and Wimbledon, the latter of which to qualifier Jiří Veselý.[102] Zverev attributed his early season struggles to being distracted by a legal dispute with his former agent Patricio Apey, with whom he had split from in the offseason.[103]\n\n\nZverev began to turn his season around following Wimbledon. He reached the semifinals of the German Open and the quarterfinals at the Canadian Open.[104][105] He then reached the last 16 at the US Open for the first time, where he lost to seed No. 20 Diego Schwartzman to continue his lack of success at the major tournaments.[106] He had also fallen out of the top 5 in early August for the first time in nearly two years.[29] Zverev's best result of the season came at the Shanghai Masters. He upset No. 3 Roger Federer in the quarterfinals before finishing runner-up to No. 4 Daniil Medvedev,[107][108] who was playing in his sixth consecutive final.[109] This performance helped him qualify for the ATP Finals at the end of the year. At the event, Zverev was drawn into a round-robin group with Rafael Nadal, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Daniil Medvedev. He defeated Nadal for the first time in his opening match before losing to Tsitsipas.[110] He then won his match against Medvedev, which he had needed to win to advance via the tiebreak criteria. Nonetheless, he could not defend his title, losing to Dominic Thiem in the semifinals.[111] Zverev finished the season at No. 7 in the world.[29]\n\n\n\n### 2020: US Open final & Australian Open semifinals[edit]\n\n\nZverev began his 2020 season at the inaugural ATP Cup. Germany was in Group F alongside Australia, Greece, and Canada. Against Australia, he lost to Alex de Minaur in three sets.[112] Australia won the tie over Germany 3–0.[113] Against Greece, he was defeated by Stefanos Tsitsipas.[114] Germany won the tie over Greece 2–1.[115] Against Canada, he was beaten by Denis Shapovalov.[116][117] Canada won the tie over Germany 2–1.[118] Germany ended third in Group F. Seeded seventh at the Australian Open, he first defeated Marco Cecchinato in the first round in straight sets.[119] After the match, he pledged to donate all his prize money from the tournament to relief efforts for the ongoing bushfires if he won the title, a total of A$4.12 million.[120][121] He then defeated Egor Gerasimov, Fernando Verdasco, and 17th seed Andrey Rublev to reach the quarterfinals without dropping a set. He defeated 15th seed and 2014 champion, Stan Wawrinka, in the quarterfinals in four sets to reach his first major singles semifinal.[122] He fell in his semifinal match to fifth seed, Dominic Thiem, in four sets.[123]\n\n\nDuring the week of 24 February, Zverev played at the Mexican Open. Seeded second, he was upset in his second-round match by qualifier Tommy Paul.[124] Starting from 12 March through early August, the ATP suspended tournament play due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[125][126][127]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Zverev was seeded fifth. He defeated Kevin Anderson in four sets, then beat 19-year old Brandon Nakashima in four sets. In the third round, he beat Adrian Mannarino in four sets before beating Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, he beat Borna Ćorić in four sets to reach his second major semifinal. There, he lost the first two sets to Pablo Carreño Busta, but came back to win the match in five; this was his first-ever match win from two sets down. He thus advanced to his first major final, where he faced Dominic Thiem. He became the runner-up, losing the final in a final-set tiebreaker despite leading by two sets and twice coming within two points of the title in the final set.[128]\n\n\nZverev was seeded 6th at the French Open. He beat Dennis Novak, Pierre-Hugues Herbert, and Marco Cecchinato, before losing in four sets to Jannik Sinner.\n\n\nIn October, he won two consecutive ATP 250 events in Cologne, which took place in the 2020 ATP Tour because of the cancellation of several tournaments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the finals, he defeated Félix Auger-Aliassime and Diego Schwartzman, both in straight sets.[129]\n\n\nZverev then reached the final of the Paris Masters, beating Nadal in straight sets in the semifinals,[130] where he lost to Daniil Medvedev in three sets.[131]\n\n\nIn the ATP Finals, Zverev was eliminated in the group stage after a three-set win over Diego Schwartzman, and straight-set losses to Djokovic and the eventual champion Medvedev.[132]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Six ATP titles including Olympic gold and ATP Finals, 300th career win[edit]\n\n\nZverev began his season in February with the ATP Cup, where he represented Germany with Jan-Lennard Struff, Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies to reach the semi-finals. In his first Grand Slam tournament appearance at the 2021 Australian Open, he defeated Marcos Giron, Maxime Cressy, Adrian Mannarino and Dušan Lajović. His run ended in the quarterfinals, where he lost to the eventual champion and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. In March his first tournament was in Rotterdam, where he lost in the first round to Kazakh Alexander Bublik.[133] He continued his performances in Acapulco, where he won his 14th ATP title by defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final.[134] At the tournament in Miami, he lost in the second round to Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori.[135]\n\n\nAt his first tournament in 2021 on clay in Monte Carlo, Zverev finished in the third round, losing to David Goffin.[136] In Munich, he reached the quarterfinals, losing to the 107th ranked tennis player in the world, Ilya Ivashka.[137]\n\n\nAt the Madrid Open, Zverev defeated Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, and Matteo Berrettini en route to his fourth Masters 1000 title and 15th career title.[138] At the same tournament, he also reached his first semifinal in doubles at a Masters 1000, partnering with compatriot Tim Pütz, but withdrew from the match. He reached the quarterfinals of the Masters 1000 in Rome, losing to eventual tournament winner Rafael Nadal.[139] In his second Grand Slam tournament of the year – in Paris, where he was seeded No. 6 – he won against Oscar Otte, Roman Safiullin, Laslo Đere, Kei Nishikori and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. In the semifinal, he played Stefanos Tsitsipas, to whom he lost after a 5-set battle.[140]\n\n\nZverev's first appearance on grass started with a tournament at home in Halle – he lost in the second round to the eventual tournament winner Ugo Humbert. At Wimbledon, seeded No. 4, he equaled his best achievement at the tournament to date – reaching the fourth round for a second time. Along the way he defeated Tallon Griekspoor, Tennys Sandgren and Taylor Fritz. He was defeated in the fourth round by Félix Auger-Aliassime in five sets. Following this run he returned to the top 5 after 2 years on 12 July 2021.\n\n\nAt the Olympics, Zverev beat Yen-hsun Lu, Daniel Elahi Galán, Nikoloz Basilashvili and Jérémy Chardy to reach the semifinals. In the semifinals, despite being a set and a break down against world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, Zverev rallied to break back and won eight games in a row on his way to win in three sets.[141][142] He defeated Karen Khachanov in straight sets in the final to claim the Olympic gold medal.[143] Zverev became the first German man to win a gold medal in singles and the first to win a medal since Tommy Haas won his silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.[144]\n\n\nFollowing the Olympics, Zverev reached his second Masters 1000 final of the year at the 2021 Western & Southern Open after defeating Lloyd Harris, Guido Pella, Casper Ruud and Stefanos Tsitsipas after a close three-set battle in the semifinal. Zverev had not won a match at the tournament in six prior appearances.[145] He beat Andrey Rublev for the 17th title of his career and the fourth of the season, in 59 minutes, the shortest match in the tournament history.[146]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Zverev sought to claim his first major title following his run to the final the previous year. He reached the semifinals following wins over Jack Sock and Lloyd Harris. There, he lost to Novak Djokovic in five sets despite taking the first set, ending his career-high 16-match win streak stretching back to the Olympics.[147]\n\n\nZverev was seeded 3rd at the 2021 BNP Paribas Open, where he reached the quarterfinals. On the way, he defeated Jenson Brooksby, Andy Murray and Gaël Monfils. He lost to Taylor Fritz, despite having two match points.[148]\n\n\nAt the Erste Bank Open in Vienna, seeded second, he defeated Filip Krajinović and Alex de Minaur to reach the quarterfinals. The victory over De Minaur gave Zverev his 300th ATP tour match win.[149] He then beat Félix Auger-Aliassime and Carlos Alcaraz to reach the final where he won his fifth title of the year and 18th overall, defeating Frances Tiafoe in straight sets.[150]\n\n\nZverev was the fourth seed at the 2021 Rolex Paris Masters. He received a bye into the second round, where he defeated Dušan Lajović. He defeated next sixteenth seed Grigor Dimitrov in the third round and sixth seed Casper Ruud in the quarterfinals. He lost in the semifinals to second seed Daniil Medvedev in straight sets. As a result of this run he equaled his singles career-high ranking of World No. 3 on 8 November 2021.\n\n\nFor a fifth successive season, Zverev qualified for the 2021 ATP Finals in Turin, as the third seed. He began his campaign by defeating home favourite Matteo Berrettini who retired with an injury.[151] On his way to the title he defeated the top two seeds Djokovic and Medvedev in the semifinals and finals respectively.[152] Due to this win, he became the only player active to have won multiple ATP Finals titles (2) other than Djokovic and Roger Federer, with 6 and 6, respectively.\n\n\n\n### 2022: First top-10 win at a major, world No. 2, ankle injury[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2022 Monte-Carlo Masters\nZverev started his 2022 season by representing Germany at the ATP Cup.

Great Britain ended up winning the tie over Germany 2–1.[153] Against the USA, he defeated Taylor Fritz. Germany won the tie 2–1 over the USA.[154] Against Canada, he lost to Félix Auger-Aliassime in three sets. Canada won the tie over Germany 2–1.[155] Germany not only failed to qualify for the semi-finals, but they also ended third in Group C. Seeded third at the Australian Open, he reached the fourth round where he was defeated by 14th seed, Denis Shapovalov, in straight sets.[156][157]\n\n\nAfter the Australian Open, Zverev played at the Open Sud de France. As the top seed, he made it to the final where he lost to sixth seed Alexander Bublik.[158] Seeded second at the Mexican Open, Zverev played in what was the record latest match ever played, defeating Jenson Brooksby at 4:55 A.M.[159] He was then defaulted from the tournament ahead of his following match against compatriot, Peter Gojowczyk, for violently and repeatedly hitting the umpire's chair with his racket after his loss in doubles;[160] the forfeiture of his tournament ranking points meant he did not reach the world No. 1 ranking as anticipated. Representing Germany in the Davis Cup tie against Brazil, he won both of his matches by beating Thiago Seyboth Wild and Thiago Monteiro.[161][162] Germany ended up winning the tie over Brazil 3–1 to qualify for the Davis Cup Finals.[163] Seeded third at the Indian Wells Masters, he was stunned in his second-round match by Tommy Paul.[164] However, in doubles, he and partner, Andrey Golubev, reached the semifinals where they lost to eventual champions John Isner and Jack Sock.[165] Seeded second at the Miami Open, he reached the quarterfinals where he lost to sixth seed, world No. 8, and eventual finalist, Casper Ruud, in three sets.[166]\n\n\nZverev started his clay-court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters. Seeded second, he reached the semifinals after beating ninth seed and world No. 12, Jannik Sinner, in the quarterfinals in a three-set thriller.[167] He lost in the semifinals to third seed, world No. 5, defending champion, and eventual champion, Stefanos Tsitsipas, in straight sets.[168] As the top seed at the BMW Open in Munich, he was upset in the second round by world No. 70 and eventual champion, Holger Rune.[169] Seeded second at the Madrid Open, he returned to defend his title. He reached the semifinals with a straight set win over eighth seed and world No. 10, Félix Auger-Aliassime, in the quarterfinals,[170] after a tough three sets match win over Marin Čilić in the second round[171] and Lorenzo Musetti's retirement in the third round due to a leg injury.[172] In the semifinals, he took revenge on fourth seed, world No. 5, two-time Monte-Carlo champion, and 2019 finalist, Stefanos Tsitsipas, to reach his third final at this Masters 1000 event. He improved his ATP Head2Head record to 4–7 against Tsitsipas, earning his first clay-court win against him in the process.[173] In the final, he was defeated by seventh seed and world No. 9, Carlos Alcaraz.[174] Seeded second at the Italian Open, he reached the semifinals defeating Cristian Garín in the quarterfinals.[175] In the semifinals, he faced fourth seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas, again for the third consecutive time at this Masters level in the clay court season.[176] He lost his semifinal match to Tsitsipas in three sets.[177] Seeded third at the French Open, he matched his semifinal result from the previous year, defeating sixth seed, Carlos Alcaraz, in the quarterfinals in what was his first top-10 victory at a major after 12 attempts.[178] In his semifinal match against fifth seed, former world No. 1, and 13 time Roland Garros champion, Rafael Nadal, he retired 3 hours and 13 minutes into the match after rolling his right ankle and tearing all three lateral ligaments.[179] He was rolled off the court in a wheelchair.[180] Zverev informed that the injury would cause him to miss the 2022 Wimbledon Championships[181] and on 8 June 2022 underwent surgery to repair the torn ligaments in his ankle.[182] Despite his exit at Roland Garros, he reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2 on 13 June 2022.\n\n\nIn September, he was due to return for the Davis Cup play but suffered a new injury, a bone edema, and withdrew from competition for the rest of the season.[183]\n\n\nZverev ended the year ranked 12.\n\n\n\n### 2023: French Open Semifinals, 20th ATP Title, 350th career win[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev signing autographs for fans at the 2023 Mutua Madrid Open\nZverev started his 2023 season by representing Germany at the first edition of the United Cup.

He won his first match over Stan Wawrinka.[191][192] He lost his second match to Marc-Andrea Hüsler.[193] Switzerland ended up winning the tie over Germany 3–2.[194] Seeded eighth at the Rotterdam Open, he was eliminated from the tournament in the second round by Dutch wildcard, Tallon Griekspoor, in three sets.[195] Seeded fourth at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open, he fell in the second round to wildcard, former world No. 1, two-time champion, and eventual finalist, Andy Murray.[196] In March, he played at the Dubai Championships. Seeded seventh, he reached the semifinals where he lost to second seed, defending champion, and eventual finalist, Andrey Rublev.[197] Zverev began his early U.S. hard court campaign at the Indian Wells Masters. Seeded 12th, he reached the fourth round but lost to fifth seed, world No. 6, and eventual finalist, Daniil Medvedev, in three close sets.[198] Seeded 13th at the Miami Open, he was beaten in the second round by wildcard Taro Daniel.[199]\n\n\nZverev began his clay-court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters. Seeded 13th, he earned his first victory over Alexander Bublik by beating him in the first round in three sets.[200] In the second round, he defeated world No. 29, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the second round.[201] In the third round, he lost to third seed, Daniil Medvedev, despite serving for the match twice and having two match points in the third-set tie-break.[202] This defeat was his seventh out of the last eight matches played with Medvedev. Seeded third at the BMW Open in Munich, he was defeated in the second round by Christopher O'Connell.[203] Seeded 13th at the Madrid Open, he recorded his 350th career win by beating Roberto Carballés Baena in the second round, becoming the only player under 30 to reach this milestone.[204][205] In the third round, he overpowered qualifier, Hugo Grenier, in 55 minutes.[206] In the fourth round, he lost to top seed, world No. 2, defending champion, and eventual champion, Carlos Alcaraz, in a rematch of the 2022 final.[207] Due to him not defending his finalist points from last year, his ranking fell from 16 to 22. Seeded 19th at the Italian Open, he made it to the fourth round where he lost to third seed and eventual champion, Daniil Medvedev.[208] Having made the semifinals last year, his ranking again fell, this time from 22 to 27. Seeded third at the Geneva Open, he reached the semifinal where he lost to Nicolás Jarry, who would end up winning the tournament.[209] Seeded 22nd at the French Open, he defeated Lloyd Harris, Alex Molčan, 12th seed Frances Tiafoe, and 28th seed Grigor Dimitrov in his first four rounds.[210][211][212][213] In the quarterfinals, he faced Tomás Martín Etcheverry. He prevailed over Etcheverry in four sets to reach his third consecutive semi-final at this tournament.[214] He fell in his semi-final match to world No. 4 and last year finalist, Casper Ruud, in straight sets.[215]\n\n\nZverev withdrew from the BOSS Open in Stuttgart due to a thigh injury that he picked up during his semi-final match at Roland Garros.[216][217]\n\n\nZverev began his grass court season at the Halle, where he lost to eventual champion Alexander Bublik in the semifinals.[218] At Wimbledon, Zverev lost in third round to Matteo Berrettini.[219]\n\n\nIn Båstad, Zverev lost in quarterfinals to Andrey Rublev.[220] Zverev won the Hamburg European Open, defeating Laslo Djere in the final. His triumph marked his 20th career ATP Title.[221]\n\n\nDuring the 2023 U.S. Open match against Jannik Sinner, Zverev halted play and complained to officials in response to a fan shouting the opening stanza to \"Deutschlandlied\", a song which has served as the national anthem of Germany; the use of the first and second stanza are presently commonly discouraged because of history. Alexander Zverev interpreted this as carrying Nazi sentiment and told officials that the fan had shouted, \"the most famous Hitler phrase\".[222] Zverev lost the quarterfinals match against Carlos Alcaraz after winning a 4 hour 40 minutes five sets match against Jannik Sinner.[223]\n\n\nAt the 2023 Chengdu Open he won his 21th title defeating Roman Safiullin.[224]\n\n\n\n## Team competitions[edit]\n\n\n### Laver Cup[edit]\n\n\nZverev took part in the inaugural Laver Cup in Prague in 2017. He accrued four points by winning both of his singles matches for Team Europe as they defeated Team World 15–9.[225] He played a more crucial role in 2018 and 2019, winning the clinching matches in both editions against Kevin Anderson and Milos Raonic respectively.[226][227] In the 2021 edition in Boston, he defeated John Isner in three sets in his only match in Team Europe's 14–1 win.[228][229]\n\n\n\n### Davis Cup[edit]\n\n\nZverev made his Davis Cup debut for Germany against the Czech Republic in 2016. He faced No. 7 Tomáš Berdych in his debut match and took a two sets to one lead before ultimately losing in five sets.[230] After the Czech Republic won the doubles rubber while Kohlschreiber won both singles matches, Zverev faced Lukáš Rosol in a decisive fifth rubber. Rosol won the match easily to send the Czech Republic into the next round.[231] In the 2017 against Belgium, Zverev recorded his first career match win in the competition against Arthur De Greef, but lost the doubles rubber with his brother as well as his second singles match to Steve Darcis. Belgium won the tie 4–1.[232] Zverev won his first Davis Cup tie in 2018, winning both of his singles matches against Alex de Minaur and Kyrgios to lead Germany to a 3–1 victory over Australia.[233] In the quarterfinals, Germany took a 2–1 lead against Spain behind Zverev's win over David Ferrer and a victory in doubles. However, Spain ultimately won the tie on the final day after Zverev was unable to defeat Nadal and Kohlschreiber lost a tight five-set match to Ferrer.[234]\n\n\nIn 2019, the format of the Davis Cup was changed to have eighteen countries competing in the finals over a single week in November, all but six of which were decided through a qualifying round in February. Germany was placed in the qualifying round and drawn against Hungary. Zverev participated and won both of his singles matches as Germany won the tie 5–0.[235] He did not participate in the finals in November, in which Germany lost in the quarterfinals.[236]\n\n\n\n### Hopman Cup[edit]\n\n\nZverev represented Germany at the Hopman Cup for four consecutive years from 2016 through 2019 with three different partners. In 2016, he competed with Sabine Lisicki. The duo won their tie against the French team, with Zverev winning both his singles and mixed doubles matches.[237] However, they were shut out against Great Britain and Australia Green and did not advance to the final.[238][239] The following year, he entered the competition with Andrea Petkovic. While the pair only won their tie against Great Britain, Zverev also defeated Federer in singles in his first tournament back from injury.[240]\n\n\nZverev had much more success in 2018 and 2019 when he paired up with Angelique Kerber. In their first year together, they were able to advance to the final, primarily on the strength of the pair winning all three of their mixed doubles matches.[241] In the final against Switzerland, Zverev lost his singles match to Federer.[242] Although Kerber won her singles match against Belinda Bencic, they lost the decisive mixed doubles rubber.[243] They returned in 2019 and again reached the final to set up a rematch of the previous year's final with Federer and Bencic. In a round-robin group with Australia, France, and Spain, the two of them won all six of their singles matches, but lost two of their three mixed doubles matches against Australia and France.[244] Like the previous year, the final was decided by the mixed doubles match after Federer defeated Zverev and Kerber defeated Bencic. With the Fast4 format, the match went to three sets. In the third set tiebreak, both teams had a match point at 4–4. Switzerland won the point with Federer serving to win the title.[245]\n\n\n\n### ATP Cup[edit]\n\n\nZverev represented Germany at the ATP Cup in 2020 and 2021. At the debut of this tournament in 2020, he was on the team with Jan-Lennard Struff, Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies. In the group stage, where Germany met Australia, Canada and Greece, Zverev lost all three matches to Alex de Minaur, Denis Shapovalov and Stefanos Tsitsipas respectively. Germany did not advance to the next phase of the tournament, finishing third in the group.\n\n\nIn 2021, Germany played again with the same lineup as the previous year. In the group they played against Canada and Serbia. Zverev won his first match against Denis Shapovalov. In their second meeting, he lost in singles to Novak Djokovic, but still played against him and Nikola Ćaćić in doubles while paired with Jan-Lennard Struff. Germany won that meeting, which allowed them to advance from first place in the group to the semifinals.[246] There they ended up against Russia, where Zverev lost his match to Daniil Medvedev. Germany eventually lost that game 2–1, allowing Russia to advance to the final.[247]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev hitting a forehand\nZverev is an aggressive baseliner. He often stands way back behind the baseline and aims to hit powerful groundstrokes either for winners or to wear down his opponent. Although his height slows him down on the court, it also adds to his reach and gives him the ability to get more balls back in play. Novak Djokovic has commented, \"He moves well for his height.\"[248] Zverev can generate a lot of power with both his backhand and forehand. His backhand, in particular, is regarded as his strength and one of the best in the game.[7] He uses a semi-open stance and employs a western grip on his forehand. He has a continental-eastern grip on his backhand. Zverev can also slice his backhands that require a low center of gravity, despite his height.[249]\n\n\nWith Zverev's height of 1.98 metres (6 ft 6 in), he can generate big serves at 220 kilometres per hour (140 mph) or faster at sharper angles than shorter players.[7] The year Zverev first broke into the top 20, he was still not one of the better servers on tour, ranking just 38th in serve rating. This was well behind him ranking 18th in return rating, showing that his return game was much stronger than his serving.[250] By 2018, he had improved in both categories, ranking 19th in serve rating and 8th in return rating. Zverev excels in particular at hitting a high percentage of first serves in, landing 64.2% in 2018. In his return game, he had the fifth highest percentage of first serve points won that year at 32.4%.[251][252] His second serve is much more shaky and exploitable. Zverev hit the most double faults hit on tour in 2016 and 2020.[253]\n\n\n\n![](image)Zverev serving\nZverev is an all-court player and does not aim to be better on any surface in particular. He has said, \"I feel like I can play on all surfaces. I've been to two finals or won tournaments on every single surface. I don't feel like I have to focus on one... I feel like I have good chances at all of them.\"[254] Toni Nadal, the uncle and coach of Rafael Nadal, has praised his ability on hard courts in particular, saying, \"His best surface is, in my eyes, the hard court, because he moves better than he does on clay.\"[255] Six of Zverev's first ten titles came on hard courts, while the other four were on clay. As of 2020, he has yet to win a title on grass, but has reached two finals and also defeated Federer on that surface.[23][47]\n\n\nZverev has the ability to serve-and-volley as well. His older brother Mischa is regarded as the biggest proponent of this playing style on the modern tour.[256] Although Sascha does not employ this technique as often as his brother, he has shown it can be effective in big matches such as the Madrid Masters final against Dominic Thiem, a player who rarely comes to the net.[257] Zverev's volleying technique is regarded as one of his biggest weaknesses.[9]\n\n\nZverev was tall, but skinny and not very muscular when growing up.[9] His fitness trainer Jez Green has focused on making him stronger and set a goal for him to add 4 kilograms (8.8 lb) of muscle each year. Initially, Zverev had difficulty adjusting to this training style on the court, saying, \"I had no idea what was going on in my body\", and needed to adapt his shot technique as he became more muscular. Eventually, he improved on the court. Green remarked, \"He started to become less wobbly. He started to absorb the power, so when someone hit hard he could hit the ball back and everything locked into place.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Coaching team[edit]\n\n\nZverev has been coached by his parents since he was very young. His mother was initially his primary coach before his father took over at some point.[7] Zverev made the decision to hire former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero at the Washington Open in the summer of 2017.[258] He fired Ferrero following the 2018 Australian Open after Ferrero criticized the rest of Zverev's coaching team.[259] Ivan Lendl, another former world No. 1, joined Zverev's team in August 2018.[260] They split up in July 2019 due to disappointing results and personal differences. Zverev has stated that Lendl was more interested in his dog or his golf game than in professional coaching.[261] In 2020, Zverev started to work with former World Number 3 and 2013 French Open Finalist David Ferrer. They announced their split in January 2021.[262]\n\n\nZverev's coaching team also includes physio Hugo Gravil. Fitness trainer Jez Green, who previously worked with Andy Murray, also worked with Zverev beginning 2013.[7][258] Green departed Zverev's team in 2021 after working with him for around seven years.[263][264]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nZverev lives in Monte Carlo, Monaco.[258] He grew up in Hamburg and also has spent his winters living in Florida at the Saddlebrook Academy.[8][7] He can speak German, Russian, and English.[265] Zverev has a daughter, born in 2021, with Brenda Patea, an ex-girlfriend.[266][267][268]\nSince 2021, Zverev has been dating German actress Sophia Thomalla.[269]\n\n\nIn 2017, Zverev's said his tennis idol is Roger Federer.[9] He is a fan of the Miami Heat in the National Basketball Association (NBA)[8] and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga, and in his spare time he enjoys playing basketball and golf. His best friend on the tour is Brazilian doubles specialist Marcelo Melo, a former French Open and Wimbledon champion.[270][271][272] Zverev has type 1 diabetes, having been diagnosed at the age of three.[273][274]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuit against former agent[edit]\n\n\nZverev filed a lawsuit against the ACE Group International and its CEO Patricio Apey, accusing them of \"unlawful restraint of trade\". He argued that the contract between them was oppressive, but eventually agreed to settle the dispute out-of-court before the trial was to commence.[275][276]\n\n\n\n### Domestic abuse allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Zverev's ex-girlfriend Olga Sharypova, in an article in *Racquet* magazine by journalist Ben Rothenberg, accused Zverev of physically and emotionally abusing her over the course of their relationship. Sharypova named multiple instances where Zverev allegedly became violent towards her, including punching her in the face during an argument that took place in the pair's hotel room while Zverev was competing at the 2019 Laver Cup.[277] Zverev denied the allegations and issued a statement after Sharypova's initial accusations: \"I very much regret that she makes such statements. Because the accusations are simply not true.\"[278]\n\n\nA second article by Rothenberg about the allegations was released on 25 August 2021, this time in *Slate* magazine.[279] Within a week, following a hearing at a Berlin-based German court, Zverev obtained an injunction against Rothenberg to stop publishing the allegations without more substantial evidence.[280] The German court's decision further stated Zverev's lawyers made a credible argument that the accusations were not true while also stating that the article did not have enough balance so that it does leave the impression that Zverev was guilty of the acts Sharypova accused him of committing.[280] In response, *Slate* stated that it stands by the reporting in the article.[280] The online media organization has not removed it from its website nor blocked it from readers in Germany while further protesting that the injunction was obtained without the organization having an opportunity to present evidence, and that they were appealing the decision.[280][281]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the ATP announced an investigation into the allegations against Zverev, saying in a statement \"The allegations raised against Alexander Zverev are serious and we have a responsibility to address them\".[282] The ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi confirmed in March 2022 that the investigation was still ongoing.[283] Following a 15-month ATP-commissioned investigation conducted by The Lake Forest Group (a third-party consultant working with the ATP's outside legal counsel, the Florida-based firm Smith Hulsey & Busey), the ATP announced in late January 2023 that they will not punish Zverev due to insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations.[284]\n\n\n\n### Second allegation of domestic abuse[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2023, a penalty order over alleged bodily harm against Brenda Patea, his ex-girlfriend and the mother of his child, was requested.[285] He was accused of assaulting a women and damaging her health in Berlin in May 2020. In an interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung, Patea stated that Zverev had pushed her against a wall and choked her during an argument.[286]\n\n\nOn 31st October 2023, it was confirmed that a penalty order of 450,000 euros had been imposed on Zverev by the Tiergarten district court. Zverev has lodged an objection against the order.[287]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alexander Zverev career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | Q1 | 1R | 3R | 3R | 4R | SF | QF | 4R | 2R |  | 0 / 8\n | 20–8\n | 71%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | Q2 | 3R | 1R | QF | QF | 4R | SF | SF | SF |  | 0 / 8\n | 28–8\n | 78%\n |\n| Wimbledon | A\n | 2R | 3R | 4R | 3R | 1R | NH\n | 4R | A\n | 3R |  | 0 / 7\n | 13–7\n | 65%\n |\n| US Open | Q2 | 1R | 2R | 2R | 3R | 4R | F | SF | A\n | QF |  | 0 / 8\n | 22–8\n | 73%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 1–2\n | 5–4\n | 6–4\n | 10–4\n | 10–4\n | 14–3\n | 17–4\n | 8–2\n | 12–4\n |  | 0 / 31\n | 83–31\n | 73%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 1 (1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss | 2020 | US Open | Hard | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem | 6–2, 6–4, 4–6, 3–6, 6–7(6–8) |\n\n\n### Olympic medal finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 1 (1 gold medal)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gold\n | 2021 | Summer Olympics | Hard\n | ![Russia](image) Karen Khachanov | 6–3, 6–1\n |\n\n\n### Year–end championships performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ATP Finals | did not qualify\n | RR | **W** | SF | RR | **W** | DNQ\n | RR | 2 / 5\n | 12–8\n | 60%\n |\n\n\n### Year-end championship finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (2 titles)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win\n | 2018 | ATP Finals, London\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 6–4, 6–3\n |\n| Win\n | 2021 | ATP Finals, Turin\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Russia](image) Daniil Medvedev | 6–4, 6–4\n |\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\nZverev has received the following awards:\n\n\n\n* German Sportspersonality of the Year (2021)[288]\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Alexander Zverev\". *ATP Tour*.

He has been ranked by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) as high as world No. 2, and was continuously ranked in the top 10 from July 2017 to November 2022. Zverev's singles career highlights include a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, and titles at the 2018 and the 2021 ATP Finals. He has won 21 ATP Tour titles in singles and two in doubles, and contested a major final at the 2020 US Open.\n\n\nZverev is a former junior world No. 1, and won a junior major singles title at the 2014 Australian Open. He had an early breakthrough on the professional tour as well, becoming one of the youngest Challenger Tour title winners in history at the age of 17. As a teenager, Zverev won two ATP titles and upset then-world No. 3 Roger Federer on grass. At 20 years old, he became the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since Novak Djokovic. At the Laver Cup, Zverev has played an instrumental role in Team Europe's early success in the competition, winning the clinching matches in 2018 and 2019. After reaching his career-best results in 2021 and 2022, he suffered an ankle injury at the French Open, from which he has gradually recovered.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\nAlexander Zverev was born on 20 April 1997 in Hamburg, Germany to Russian parents Irina Zvereva and Alexander Mikhailovich Zverev. His older brother, Mischa, born nearly a decade earlier, is also a professional tennis player. Both of his parents were professional tennis players for the Soviet Union. His father, ranked as high as No. 175 in the world, became the top-ranked men's player nationally, while his mother was the fourth highest ranked women's player in the Soviet Union. They both moved from Sochi to the capital to train at the CSKA Moscow military-run tennis club. The Soviet government often restricted their players from competing outside the country, an impediment that limited how high either of Alexander's parents could rise in the world rankings. With the collapse of the Soviet Union imminent, Irina went to Germany to compete at a tournament in 1990, with her husband accompanying as her coach. While in Germany, they were offered jobs as tennis instructors. After initially declining, they accepted an offer to work at the Uhlenhorster Hockey Club in Hamburg the following year and ended up settling in the country.[7]\n\n\nZverev, nicknamed Sascha (the Russian-language nickname for Alexander), started playing tennis at the age of 3. Since he began playing tennis at a very young age, he has said, \"One day, when I was, I think, one year and five months old, I just picked up a little racket and I was starting to push the ball all over our apartment, and since then, they took me out on the court. I enjoy it still, I enjoyed it back then.\"[8] When he was five years old, he started to play tennis at least half an hour each day.[8] He was extremely competitive as a child. His brother, Mischa, said, \"He would not understand or accept that he was losing,\" when the two would play against each other. He would never want to leave the court unless he won the match. He also played hockey and football as a child but decided to focus only on tennis around the age of 12 after an early-round loss at a high-level international junior tournament in Florida.[7]\n\n\nWhen Alexander was young, his mother was his primary coach while his father was focused on coaching his brother. He has said, \"I think I have pretty good technique, which my mum did at a young age, so credit to her for that. My backhand, in particular, is 100 percent down to my mum.\"[9] While his mother had a more relaxed teaching style, his father \"had a very Soviet way of doing physical training sessions\" that involved doing timed drills for fixed numbers of repetitions.[7] Alexander's coaches aimed for him to have a riskier, aggressive playing style built around hitting the ball with pace and finishing points quickly. This was a big contrast from how he played around age 12 when his style centered around being an \"unbelievable fighter\" from the baseline in part because he was too slow to go to the net.[9] Initially, Alexander struggled to change his playing style. He \"made a lot of errors\" and lost to opponents who excelled at keeping points alive. However, his father stuck with this strategy, saying, \"We must practise fast tennis, aggressive tennis. If you lose today it's no big deal. You must think about the future.\"[7][9]\n\n\n\n## Junior career[edit]\n\n\nZverev played his first junior match in January 2011 at the age of 13 at a grade 4 tournament in Poland. He is a former world No. 1 junior.[10] He entered his first event on the International Tennis Federation (ITF) junior circuit in early 2011 when he was 13. Near the beginning of 2012, Zverev won his first ITF title at the Fujairah Junior Championships, a low-level Grade 4 tournament in the United Arab Emirates. He would pick up a lower level Grade 5 title at the Oman International Junior 2 a few weeks later, which led him to begin competing in higher-level events shortly before his 15th birthday.[10] He did not have much success at tournaments that were Grade 2 and above until the following year when he reached back-to-back doubles finals with Spencer Papa at the Grade A Copa Gerdau and the Grade 1 USTA International Spring Championships.[10][11][12]\n\n\nZverev's early-season success in doubles proved to be the precursor of a major improvement in singles as well. During the European clay court season, he won his first Grade 1 title over Andrey Rublev at the Open International Junior de Beaulieu-sur-Mer.[13] He followed up that performance with his first Grade A title at the Trofeo Bonfiglio a month later, becoming the youngest boys' singles champion in the tournament's history.[14] He also finished runner-up at the 2013 French Open to Cristian Garín.[15][16] Zverev had some grass court success as well, finishing runner-up to Nick Kyrgios at the Junior International Roehampton.[17] However, he needed to retire at Wimbledon due to a shoulder injury.[18] Zverev came close to reaching another major boys' singles final at the 2013 Junior US Open, but was defeated by the eventual champion Borna Ćorić in the semifinals.[19] This success was enough for him to take over the No. 1 ranking in late October. Before the end of the season, Zverev also represented Germany in the Junior Fed Cup, leading them to a fourth-place finish.[10] His last tournament of the year was the Grade A Orange Bowl, where he was defeated by Stefan Kozlov in the semifinals.[20] As the top-ranked junior at the end of the season, he was named the ITF Junior World Champion, becoming the youngest boys' champion since Donald Young in 2005.[21]\n\n\nZverev played just two tournaments in 2014, both in Australia in January.[10] He won the singles events at both tournaments, the first of which came against Australian Omar Jasika at the Traralgon Junior International. At the Australian Open, he was able to defeat Kozlov, who was seeded second, to finish his junior career with a first major title.[22]\n\n\nJunior Grand Slam results – Singles:\n\n\nAustralian Open: **W** (2014)  \n\nFrench Open: F (2013)  \n\nWimbledon: 3R (2013)  \n\nUS Open: SF (2013)\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 2011–14: Challenger title and ATP semifinal at 17[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2014 Bavarian International Tennis Championships\nAs the age of 14, Zverev entered qualifying at three different tournaments, including the 2011 Moselle Open on the ATP Tour, but lost all of his matches. He won his professional main draw debut against compatriot Christian Lichtenegger at a Futures event in Germany in August 2012. At the end of the year, he made his first professional final, finishing runner-up to Florian Reynet at an ITF $10K event in Florida.[23] Zverev continued to focus on the juniors in 2013 and did not reach another pro-level final that year,[24] but he did make his main draw debut on the ATP Tour in July, losing to Roberto Bautista Agut at his hometown tournament, the International German Open.[25] He also made his ATP Challenger Tour debut, losing to Máximo González at the Meerbusch Challenger in August.[23]\n\n\nAfter winning the boys' singles title at the 2014 Australian Open, Zverev shifted his focus to his professional career, only playing in pro events the rest of the year.[10][24] Initially, he struggled on the pro tour, failing to qualify for the main draw at his first five events of the season. He did not win a main draw match until he recorded a single victory at the Heilbronner Neckarcup Challenger, his tenth event of the year. One of his losses was a retirement against his brother Mischa.[23] Zverev made his first professional breakthrough in July when he won the Braunschweig Challenger for his first professional title, despite entering the tournament with just one career Challenger-level match win and no top 100 victories. Three of the players he defeated were in the top 100, including his first-round opponent No. 87 Tobias Kamke, his semifinal opponent No. 56 Andrey Golubev, and his final opponent No. 89 Paul-Henri Mathieu.[26]\n\n\nAt the age of 17 years and 2 months, he became the youngest player to win a Challenger title since Bernard Tomic in 2009 and the twelfth youngest in history.[27] Zverev followed up this title with a breakthrough at the ATP Tour level. He entered the International German Open having never won an ATP match but managed to reach the semifinals. He recorded four match wins at the event, including his first career victory against Robin Haase and his first top 20 victory over No. 16 Mikhail Youzhny before losing to No. 7 David Ferrer. He became the first 17-year old to defeat a top 20 opponent since Richard Gasquet in 2004 and the first to make a semifinal since Marin Čilić in 2006.[28] Zverev had risen from No. 665 to No. 285 after his Challenger title, and his ATP 500 Series semifinal appearance took him to No. 161 in the world. He finished the season ranked No. 136.[29]\n\n\n\n### 2015: ATP doubles final, top 100[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2015 US Open\nAt the beginning of the season, Zverev was still ranked too low to receive direct entry into the main draws of ATP Tour events, which forced him to continue playing Challenger events through July. He also needed to enter qualifying for ATP events throughout the year. Zverev did not qualify for either of the first two major singles events of the season.[23] He was able to qualify for his first Masters event at the Miami Open and reached the second round.[30] During the clay-court season, Zverev partnered with his brother Mischa to reach his first career ATP final in doubles at the Bavarian International Tennis Championships. The Zverev brothers finished runner-up to top-seeded Alexander Peya and Bruno Soares.[31] Later that month, he won his second career Challenger title at the Heilbronn Neckarcup to crack the top 100 of the ATP rankings.[32]\n\n\nWith a higher ranking, Zverev was directly accepted into Wimbledon. A week before the tournament, he took part in the Boodles Challenge exhibition and surprisingly upset world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in straight sets.[33] Zverev backed up this performance in his Grand Slam tournament main draw debut, defeating Teymuraz Gabashvili in a tight match that lasted until 9–7 in the fifth and final set.[34] He lost in the next round to Denis Kudla. Zverev opted to play on clay after Wimbledon and reached another ATP semifinal at the Swedish Open to put him back in the top 100 after one week out.[35][29] In August, Zverev returned to the United States and competed in two US Open Series events. He notably upset No. 14 Kevin Anderson at the Citi Open en route to the quarterfinals.[36][37] Zverev's brief rankings drop in July meant that he needed to qualify for the US Open. He succeeded, but lost his opening round match to compatriot Philipp Kohlschreiber in five sets.[38] Zverev won just one more main draw match the rest of the season and ended the year ranked No. 83 in the world.[39][29] As the youngest player in the top 100, he was named the ATP Newcomer of the Year.[40]\n\n\n\n### 2016: First ATP title, Federer upset, top 20[edit]\n\n\nZverev's first ATP event of the year was the 2016 Australian Open, where he had a difficult draw against world No. 2 Andy Murray and was only able to win six games in his opening match.[41] He bounced back at the Open Sud de France, reaching the semifinals in the singles event and his second career final with his brother in the doubles event.[42] During the singles event, he upset No. 13 Marin Čilić, the highest-ranked player he had defeated in an official match at the time.[43] Zverev then produced a strong result at the Indian Wells Masters, where he defeated two top 30 players. In the fourth round, he nearly upset No. 5 Rafael Nadal. Zverev had a match point while he was serving for the final set, but missed a routine forehand volley and then proceeded to lose 14 of the remaining 15 points in the match. He commented on the match point that, \"I missed probably the easiest shot I had the whole match.\"[44] Back in Europe, Zverev was able to recover as he reached his first ATP singles final at the Open de Nice Côte d'Azur, finishing runner-up to No. 15 Dominic Thiem, the top seed and defending champion.[45] Thiem also defeated him in the third round of the French Open.[46]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"I haven't really grasped it yet. That I would be standing here as a winner, I couldn't have imagined it yesterday... It's unbelievable to get a win against Roger, especially on grass.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Zverev on his victory against Federer at the Halle Open.[47][48]\n\nZverev's next breakthrough came during the grass court season at the Halle Open, where he upset world No. 3 Roger Federer in the semifinals, ending Federer's streak of ten consecutive appearances in the final while competing at the tournament.[48] He was also the first teenager to defeat Federer since Murray nearly a decade earlier.[47] Nonetheless, he finished runner-up at the event to veteran compatriot Florian Mayer.[49] After this final, he entered the top 30 for the first time and stayed ranked in the 20s for the rest of the season.[29] Despite being seeded at a major tournament for the first time, Zverev could then only match his best major singles result at Wimbledon, again falling to Berdych.[50] During the US Open Series, he reached the semifinals of the Washington Open,[51] but lost his opening round matches at both Masters events. He was then upset in the second round of the US Open by Dan Evans.[52]\n\n\nAfter the US Open, Zverev returned to Europe and won his first career ATP title at the St. Petersburg Open. He recorded his first win over No. 9 Berdych in the semifinals, and No. 3 Stan Wawrinka in the final, coming back from 0–3 down in the third set.[53] At his next event, he then defeated No. 10 Thiem in the first round of the 2016 China Open for the first time in four tries this year. In doing so, Zverev became the first teenager to record three consecutive victories against top ten opponents since Boris Becker in 1986.[54][55] Zverev's third round appearance at the Shanghai Masters then helped him rise to No. 20 in the ATP rankings, making him the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since Novak Djokovic in 2006.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2016 US Open\n### 2017: Two Masters titles, world No. 3[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2017 season, Zverev greatly improved his results at the higher level tournaments on the ATP Tour except for the four major events. It was at this time Zverev, who had been using his nickname Sascha, stated in a postmatch interview with Pam Shriver, that he would no longer be referred to as Sascha. Zverev stated that only his close family can refer to him as Sascha, as he was born in Germany and identifies as a German, and does not want a Russian nickname to be used for his professional career. At the Australian Open, Zverev again pushed Rafael Nadal to the brink, but ultimately lost in five sets.[57] His next ATP tournament was the Open Sud de France, where he won both the singles and doubles events. He and his brother defeated Fabrice Martin and Daniel Nestor for Alexander's first doubles title.[58] The following month, he made his first Masters quarterfinal at the Miami Open, upsetting No. 3 Stan Wawrinka along the way.[59] Nick Kyrgios defeated him at both Masters events that month.[60]\n\n\nAfter a slow start to the clay court season, Zverev won two more titles in May, the first of which came at home in Germany at the Bavarian International Tennis Championships.[61] He then followed up a second Masters quarterfinal at the Madrid Open with his first Masters title at the Rome Masters. He defeated Novak Djokovic in the final to become the youngest Masters champion since Djokovic in 2007 and the first such champion born in the 1990s. With the title, he also entered the top 10 for the first time.[62][63] Despite his triumph in Rome, he lost his opening round match at the French Open.[64] During the grass court season, Zverev made another singles final and again faced Federer at the Halle Open, but could not defeat him this time.[65] He and his brother also finished runner-up in the doubles event to Łukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo.[66] At Wimbledon, he achieved his best result at a major event to date, ultimately losing in the fourth round to the previous year's runner-up Milos Raonic in a tight five set match.[67]\n\n\nBack on hard courts, Zverev won his last two titles of the season in August. He won the Washington Open as well as a second consecutive Masters title at the Canadian Open, only dropping a single set at each tournament in each of his opening matches.[68] Notably, he needed to save three match points in his first match in Canada against Richard Gasquet, including a 49 shot rally.[69] He then defeated Roger Federer in the final to become the first player outside of the Big Four to win multiple Masters titles in the same season since David Nalbandian in 2007.[70][71] Despite this success, he was upset in the second round of the US Open by fellow Next Gen player Borna Ćorić.[72] At the end of the season, Zverev qualified for both the inaugural Next Generation Finals as one of the top seven 21-and-under players, and the ATP Finals as one of the top eight players in the world. He opted to skip the former event to focus on the latter.[73] At the ATP Finals, Zverev was grouped with Roger Federer, Marin Čilić, and Jack Sock. He defeated Čilić in his first match, but lost his final two matches and did not advance out of his round robin group.[74][75][76] Zverev finished the year ranked No. 4, peaking at No. 3 right before the ATP Finals, and accumulated five ATP titles from just six finals.[23][29]\n\n\n\n### 2018: Tour Finals champion, first major quarterfinal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev with the champion's trophy at the 2018 Washington Open\nZverev maintained his top 5 ranking throughout the year.[29] However, he still did not deliver any high-calibre results at the major tournaments. He was upset at the Australian Open by reigning Next Gen Finals champion and No. 59 Chung Hyeon in five sets in the third round. Zverev stated that issues at majors were \"definitely not physical\" when asked if his problems were physical or mental, and also attribute this lack of success to the extra pressure he was putting on himself at these events.[77] Zverev did not reach his first final of the year until early April at the Miami Masters. Despite taking the first set of the final, he finished runner-up to American John Isner, who had never previously won a Masters title.[78]\n\n\nZverev continued his Masters success into the clay-court season, reaching the semifinals at the Monte Carlo Masters,[79] winning his third career Masters title at the Madrid Open, and making the final at the Rome Masters. In Madrid, he defeated Dominic Thiem in the final to become the only active player outside of the Big Four to have won three Masters titles.[80] He came close to winning back-to-back Masters events, going up a break in the third set against Nadal at the Italian Open. However, Nadal was able to recover and win the final five games of the match after a rain delay.[81] Zverev had also defended his title at the Bavarian International Tennis Championships in his only other French Open tune-up to help build up a 13 match win streak that lasted until the Italian Open final.[82] He capped off his excellent clay court season by reaching his first major quarterfinal at the French Open. He needed to win three five-set matches to get that far before Thiem ended his run while he was faced with a hamstring injury.[83]\n\n\nUp until the year-end championships, Zverev struggled to build on his early season success. He lost in the third round at both Wimbledon and the US Open,[84][85] and his best result at the four remaining Masters events was a semifinal at the Shanghai Masters.[86] He was able to defend his title at the Washington Open, his only title during this period.[87] Zverev also reached two more doubles finals with his brother, but did not win either of them.[88][89] At the end of the season, Zverev qualified for both the Next Generation Finals and the ATP Finals for the second consecutive year, again choosing to only compete at the latter event. He was placed in a group with Novak Djokovic, Marin Čilić, and John Isner. This year, Zverev was able to advance out of the group, only losing to No. 1 Djokovic in the round robin.[90][91] He faced Federer in the semifinals and defeated him in straight sets to set up a rematch with Djokovic.[92] Despite being a heavy underdog and having just lost to Djokovic earlier in the week, Zverev won the final in straight sets for the tenth and biggest title of his career. He became the youngest tour champion since Djokovic a decade earlier and the first German to win the season-ending championships since Boris Becker in 1995. This was also Zverev's first victory over a current world No. 1 player.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### 2019: Early season struggles, Masters runner-up, ATP Finals semifinal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2019 French Open\nZverev opened his 2019 season with a fourth round appearance at the 2019 Australian Open, defeating Jérémy Chardy in five sets in the second round before losing to Milos Raonic in straight sets.[95][96] Zverev next played at the Mexican Open and finished runner-up to Nick Kyrgios.[97] Following this tournament, he did not win more than one match at any of his next six events, a streak that ended with two match wins at the Madrid Open.[23][98] Nonetheless, Zverev finished the clay court season strong. The week before the French Open, he won his only title of the year at the Geneva Open, defeating Nicolás Jarry in the final after saving two match points in the third set tiebreak.[99] He then went on to defeat No. 12 Fabio Fognini and reach his second consecutive quarterfinal at the French Open, where he lost to Novak Djokovic.[100] Zverev did not follow through on that success into the grass court season, where his best result was a quarterfinal at the Halle Open.[101] He was upset in the first round at both the Stuttgart Open and Wimbledon, the latter of which to qualifier Jiří Veselý.[102] Zverev attributed his early season struggles to being distracted by a legal dispute with his former agent Patricio Apey, with whom he had split from in the offseason.[103]\n\n\nZverev began to turn his season around following Wimbledon. He reached the semifinals of the German Open and the quarterfinals at the Canadian Open.[104][105] He then reached the last 16 at the US Open for the first time, where he lost to seed No. 20 Diego Schwartzman to continue his lack of success at the major tournaments.[106] He had also fallen out of the top 5 in early August for the first time in nearly two years.[29] Zverev's best result of the season came at the Shanghai Masters. He upset No. 3 Roger Federer in the quarterfinals before finishing runner-up to No. 4 Daniil Medvedev,[107][108] who was playing in his sixth consecutive final.[109] This performance helped him qualify for the ATP Finals at the end of the year. At the event, Zverev was drawn into a round-robin group with Rafael Nadal, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Daniil Medvedev. He defeated Nadal for the first time in his opening match before losing to Tsitsipas.[110] He then won his match against Medvedev, which he had needed to win to advance via the tiebreak criteria. Nonetheless, he could not defend his title, losing to Dominic Thiem in the semifinals.[111] Zverev finished the season at No. 7 in the world.[29]\n\n\n\n### 2020: US Open final & Australian Open semifinals[edit]\n\n\nZverev began his 2020 season at the inaugural ATP Cup. Germany was in Group F alongside Australia, Greece, and Canada. Against Australia, he lost to Alex de Minaur in three sets.[112] Australia won the tie over Germany 3–0.[113] Against Greece, he was defeated by Stefanos Tsitsipas.[114] Germany won the tie over Greece 2–1.[115] Against Canada, he was beaten by Denis Shapovalov.[116][117] Canada won the tie over Germany 2–1.[118] Germany ended third in Group F. Seeded seventh at the Australian Open, he first defeated Marco Cecchinato in the first round in straight sets.[119] After the match, he pledged to donate all his prize money from the tournament to relief efforts for the ongoing bushfires if he won the title, a total of A$4.12 million.[120][121] He then defeated Egor Gerasimov, Fernando Verdasco, and 17th seed Andrey Rublev to reach the quarterfinals without dropping a set. He defeated 15th seed and 2014 champion, Stan Wawrinka, in the quarterfinals in four sets to reach his first major singles semifinal.[122] He fell in his semifinal match to fifth seed, Dominic Thiem, in four sets.[123]\n\n\nDuring the week of 24 February, Zverev played at the Mexican Open. Seeded second, he was upset in his second-round match by qualifier Tommy Paul.[124] Starting from 12 March through early August, the ATP suspended tournament play due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[125][126][127]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Zverev was seeded fifth. He defeated Kevin Anderson in four sets, then beat 19-year old Brandon Nakashima in four sets. In the third round, he beat Adrian Mannarino in four sets before beating Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, he beat Borna Ćorić in four sets to reach his second major semifinal. There, he lost the first two sets to Pablo Carreño Busta, but came back to win the match in five; this was his first-ever match win from two sets down. He thus advanced to his first major final, where he faced Dominic Thiem. He became the runner-up, losing the final in a final-set tiebreaker despite leading by two sets and twice coming within two points of the title in the final set.[128]\n\n\nZverev was seeded 6th at the French Open. He beat Dennis Novak, Pierre-Hugues Herbert, and Marco Cecchinato, before losing in four sets to Jannik Sinner.\n\n\nIn October, he won two consecutive ATP 250 events in Cologne, which took place in the 2020 ATP Tour because of the cancellation of several tournaments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the finals, he defeated Félix Auger-Aliassime and Diego Schwartzman, both in straight sets.[129]\n\n\nZverev then reached the final of the Paris Masters, beating Nadal in straight sets in the semifinals,[130] where he lost to Daniil Medvedev in three sets.[131]\n\n\nIn the ATP Finals, Zverev was eliminated in the group stage after a three-set win over Diego Schwartzman, and straight-set losses to Djokovic and the eventual champion Medvedev.[132]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Six ATP titles including Olympic gold and ATP Finals, 300th career win[edit]\n\n\nZverev began his season in February with the ATP Cup, where he represented Germany with Jan-Lennard Struff, Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies to reach the semi-finals. In his first Grand Slam tournament appearance at the 2021 Australian Open, he defeated Marcos Giron, Maxime Cressy, Adrian Mannarino and Dušan Lajović. His run ended in the quarterfinals, where he lost to the eventual champion and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. In March his first tournament was in Rotterdam, where he lost in the first round to Kazakh Alexander Bublik.[133] He continued his performances in Acapulco, where he won his 14th ATP title by defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final.[134] At the tournament in Miami, he lost in the second round to Finland's Emil Ruusuvuori.[135]\n\n\nAt his first tournament in 2021 on clay in Monte Carlo, Zverev finished in the third round, losing to David Goffin.[136] In Munich, he reached the quarterfinals, losing to the 107th ranked tennis player in the world, Ilya Ivashka.[137]\n\n\nAt the Madrid Open, Zverev defeated Rafael Nadal, Dominic Thiem, and Matteo Berrettini en route to his fourth Masters 1000 title and 15th career title.[138] At the same tournament, he also reached his first semifinal in doubles at a Masters 1000, partnering with compatriot Tim Pütz, but withdrew from the match. He reached the quarterfinals of the Masters 1000 in Rome, losing to eventual tournament winner Rafael Nadal.[139] In his second Grand Slam tournament of the year – in Paris, where he was seeded No. 6 – he won against Oscar Otte, Roman Safiullin, Laslo Đere, Kei Nishikori and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. In the semifinal, he played Stefanos Tsitsipas, to whom he lost after a 5-set battle.[140]\n\n\nZverev's first appearance on grass started with a tournament at home in Halle – he lost in the second round to the eventual tournament winner Ugo Humbert. At Wimbledon, seeded No. 4, he equaled his best achievement at the tournament to date – reaching the fourth round for a second time. Along the way he defeated Tallon Griekspoor, Tennys Sandgren and Taylor Fritz. He was defeated in the fourth round by Félix Auger-Aliassime in five sets. Following this run he returned to the top 5 after 2 years on 12 July 2021.\n\n\nAt the Olympics, Zverev beat Yen-hsun Lu, Daniel Elahi Galán, Nikoloz Basilashvili and Jérémy Chardy to reach the semifinals. In the semifinals, despite being a set and a break down against world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, Zverev rallied to break back and won eight games in a row on his way to win in three sets.[141][142] He defeated Karen Khachanov in straight sets in the final to claim the Olympic gold medal.[143] Zverev became the first German man to win a gold medal in singles and the first to win a medal since Tommy Haas won his silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.[144]\n\n\nFollowing the Olympics, Zverev reached his second Masters 1000 final of the year at the 2021 Western & Southern Open after defeating Lloyd Harris, Guido Pella, Casper Ruud and Stefanos Tsitsipas after a close three-set battle in the semifinal. Zverev had not won a match at the tournament in six prior appearances.[145] He beat Andrey Rublev for the 17th title of his career and the fourth of the season, in 59 minutes, the shortest match in the tournament history.[146]\n\n\nAt the US Open, Zverev sought to claim his first major title following his run to the final the previous year. He reached the semifinals following wins over Jack Sock and Lloyd Harris. There, he lost to Novak Djokovic in five sets despite taking the first set, ending his career-high 16-match win streak stretching back to the Olympics.[147]\n\n\nZverev was seeded 3rd at the 2021 BNP Paribas Open, where he reached the quarterfinals. On the way, he defeated Jenson Brooksby, Andy Murray and Gaël Monfils. He lost to Taylor Fritz, despite having two match points.[148]\n\n\nAt the Erste Bank Open in Vienna, seeded second, he defeated Filip Krajinović and Alex de Minaur to reach the quarterfinals. The victory over De Minaur gave Zverev his 300th ATP tour match win.[149] He then beat Félix Auger-Aliassime and Carlos Alcaraz to reach the final where he won his fifth title of the year and 18th overall, defeating Frances Tiafoe in straight sets.[150]\n\n\nZverev was the fourth seed at the 2021 Rolex Paris Masters. He received a bye into the second round, where he defeated Dušan Lajović. He defeated next sixteenth seed Grigor Dimitrov in the third round and sixth seed Casper Ruud in the quarterfinals. He lost in the semifinals to second seed Daniil Medvedev in straight sets. As a result of this run he equaled his singles career-high ranking of World No. 3 on 8 November 2021.\n\n\nFor a fifth successive season, Zverev qualified for the 2021 ATP Finals in Turin, as the third seed. He began his campaign by defeating home favourite Matteo Berrettini who retired with an injury.[151] On his way to the title he defeated the top two seeds Djokovic and Medvedev in the semifinals and finals respectively.[152] Due to this win, he became the only player active to have won multiple ATP Finals titles (2) other than Djokovic and Roger Federer, with 6 and 6, respectively.\n\n\n\n### 2022: First top-10 win at a major, world No. 2, ankle injury[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev at the 2022 Monte-Carlo Masters\nZverev started his 2022 season by representing Germany at the ATP Cup. Germany was in Group C alongside Great Britain, the USA, and Canada. Against Great Britain, he beat Cameron Norrie. Great Britain ended up winning the tie over Germany 2–1.[153] Against the USA, he defeated Taylor Fritz. Germany won the tie 2–1 over the USA.[154] Against Canada, he lost to Félix Auger-Aliassime in three sets. Canada won the tie over Germany 2–1.[155] Germany not only failed to qualify for the semi-finals, but they also ended third in Group C. Seeded third at the Australian Open, he reached the fourth round where he was defeated by 14th seed, Denis Shapovalov, in straight sets.[156][157]\n\n\nAfter the Australian Open, Zverev played at the Open Sud de France. As the top seed, he made it to the final where he lost to sixth seed Alexander Bublik.[158] Seeded second at the Mexican Open, Zverev played in what was the record latest match ever played, defeating Jenson Brooksby at 4:55 A.M.[159] He was then defaulted from the tournament ahead of his following match against compatriot, Peter Gojowczyk, for violently and repeatedly hitting the umpire's chair with his racket after his loss in doubles;[160] the forfeiture of his tournament ranking points meant he did not reach the world No. 1 ranking as anticipated. Representing Germany in the Davis Cup tie against Brazil, he won both of his matches by beating Thiago Seyboth Wild and Thiago Monteiro.[161][162] Germany ended up winning the tie over Brazil 3–1 to qualify for the Davis Cup Finals.[163] Seeded third at the Indian Wells Masters, he was stunned in his second-round match by Tommy Paul.[164] However, in doubles, he and partner, Andrey Golubev, reached the semifinals where they lost to eventual champions John Isner and Jack Sock.[165] Seeded second at the Miami Open, he reached the quarterfinals where he lost to sixth seed, world No. 8, and eventual finalist, Casper Ruud, in three sets.[166]\n\n\nZverev started his clay-court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters. Seeded second, he reached the semifinals after beating ninth seed and world No. 12, Jannik Sinner, in the quarterfinals in a three-set thriller.[167] He lost in the semifinals to third seed, world No. 5, defending champion, and eventual champion, Stefanos Tsitsipas, in straight sets.[168] As the top seed at the BMW Open in Munich, he was upset in the second round by world No. 70 and eventual champion, Holger Rune.[169] Seeded second at the Madrid Open, he returned to defend his title. He reached the semifinals with a straight set win over eighth seed and world No. 10, Félix Auger-Aliassime, in the quarterfinals,[170] after a tough three sets match win over Marin Čilić in the second round[171] and Lorenzo Musetti's retirement in the third round due to a leg injury.[172] In the semifinals, he took revenge on fourth seed, world No. 5, two-time Monte-Carlo champion, and 2019 finalist, Stefanos Tsitsipas, to reach his third final at this Masters 1000 event. He improved his ATP Head2Head record to 4–7 against Tsitsipas, earning his first clay-court win against him in the process.[173] In the final, he was defeated by seventh seed and world No. 9, Carlos Alcaraz.[174] Seeded second at the Italian Open, he reached the semifinals defeating Cristian Garín in the quarterfinals.[175] In the semifinals, he faced fourth seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas, again for the third consecutive time at this Masters level in the clay court season.[176] He lost his semifinal match to Tsitsipas in three sets.[177] Seeded third at the French Open, he matched his semifinal result from the previous year, defeating sixth seed, Carlos Alcaraz, in the quarterfinals in what was his first top-10 victory at a major after 12 attempts.[178] In his semifinal match against fifth seed, former world No. 1, and 13 time Roland Garros champion, Rafael Nadal, he retired 3 hours and 13 minutes into the match after rolling his right ankle and tearing all three lateral ligaments.[179] He was rolled off the court in a wheelchair.[180] Zverev informed that the injury would cause him to miss the 2022 Wimbledon Championships[181] and on 8 June 2022 underwent surgery to repair the torn ligaments in his ankle.[182] Despite his exit at Roland Garros, he reached a career-high ranking of world No. 2 on 13 June 2022.\n\n\nIn September, he was due to return for the Davis Cup play but suffered a new injury, a bone edema, and withdrew from competition for the rest of the season.[183]\n\n\nZverev ended the year ranked 12.\n\n\n\n### 2023: French Open Semifinals, 20th ATP Title, 350th career win[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev signing autographs for fans at the 2023 Mutua Madrid Open\nZverev started his 2023 season by representing Germany at the first edition of the United Cup. Germany was in Group C alongside the Czech Republic and the USA. Against the Czech Republic, he lost to Jiří Lehečka.[184][185] The Czech Republic won the tie over Germany 3–2.[186] Against the US, he lost to Taylor Fritz.[187] The USA beat Germany 5–0.[188] Germany failed to qualify for the knockout round and ended third in Group C. Seeded 12th at the Australian Open, he won his first match since June 2022 by beating lucky loser, Juan Pablo Varillas, in the first round in five sets.[189] He was defeated in the second round by American and lucky loser, Michael Mmoh, in four sets.[190]\n\n\nAfter the Australian Open, Zverev represented Germany in the Davis Cup tie against Switzerland. He won his first match over Stan Wawrinka.[191][192] He lost his second match to Marc-Andrea Hüsler.[193] Switzerland ended up winning the tie over Germany 3–2.[194] Seeded eighth at the Rotterdam Open, he was eliminated from the tournament in the second round by Dutch wildcard, Tallon Griekspoor, in three sets.[195] Seeded fourth at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open, he fell in the second round to wildcard, former world No. 1, two-time champion, and eventual finalist, Andy Murray.[196] In March, he played at the Dubai Championships. Seeded seventh, he reached the semifinals where he lost to second seed, defending champion, and eventual finalist, Andrey Rublev.[197] Zverev began his early U.S. hard court campaign at the Indian Wells Masters. Seeded 12th, he reached the fourth round but lost to fifth seed, world No. 6, and eventual finalist, Daniil Medvedev, in three close sets.[198] Seeded 13th at the Miami Open, he was beaten in the second round by wildcard Taro Daniel.[199]\n\n\nZverev began his clay-court season at the Monte-Carlo Masters. Seeded 13th, he earned his first victory over Alexander Bublik by beating him in the first round in three sets.[200] In the second round, he defeated world No. 29, Roberto Bautista Agut, in the second round.[201] In the third round, he lost to third seed, Daniil Medvedev, despite serving for the match twice and having two match points in the third-set tie-break.[202] This defeat was his seventh out of the last eight matches played with Medvedev. Seeded third at the BMW Open in Munich, he was defeated in the second round by Christopher O'Connell.[203] Seeded 13th at the Madrid Open, he recorded his 350th career win by beating Roberto Carballés Baena in the second round, becoming the only player under 30 to reach this milestone.[204][205] In the third round, he overpowered qualifier, Hugo Grenier, in 55 minutes.[206] In the fourth round, he lost to top seed, world No. 2, defending champion, and eventual champion, Carlos Alcaraz, in a rematch of the 2022 final.[207] Due to him not defending his finalist points from last year, his ranking fell from 16 to 22. Seeded 19th at the Italian Open, he made it to the fourth round where he lost to third seed and eventual champion, Daniil Medvedev.[208] Having made the semifinals last year, his ranking again fell, this time from 22 to 27. Seeded third at the Geneva Open, he reached the semifinal where he lost to Nicolás Jarry, who would end up winning the tournament.[209] Seeded 22nd at the French Open, he defeated Lloyd Harris, Alex Molčan, 12th seed Frances Tiafoe, and 28th seed Grigor Dimitrov in his first four rounds.[210][211][212][213] In the quarterfinals, he faced Tomás Martín Etcheverry. He prevailed over Etcheverry in four sets to reach his third consecutive semi-final at this tournament.[214] He fell in his semi-final match to world No. 4 and last year finalist, Casper Ruud, in straight sets.[215]\n\n\nZverev withdrew from the BOSS Open in Stuttgart due to a thigh injury that he picked up during his semi-final match at Roland Garros.[216][217]\n\n\nZverev began his grass court season at the Halle, where he lost to eventual champion Alexander Bublik in the semifinals.[218] At Wimbledon, Zverev lost in third round to Matteo Berrettini.[219]\n\n\nIn Båstad, Zverev lost in quarterfinals to Andrey Rublev.[220] Zverev won the Hamburg European Open, defeating Laslo Djere in the final. His triumph marked his 20th career ATP Title.[221]\n\n\nDuring the 2023 U.S. Open match against Jannik Sinner, Zverev halted play and complained to officials in response to a fan shouting the opening stanza to \"Deutschlandlied\", a song which has served as the national anthem of Germany; the use of the first and second stanza are presently commonly discouraged because of history. Alexander Zverev interpreted this as carrying Nazi sentiment and told officials that the fan had shouted, \"the most famous Hitler phrase\".[222] Zverev lost the quarterfinals match against Carlos Alcaraz after winning a 4 hour 40 minutes five sets match against Jannik Sinner.[223]\n\n\nAt the 2023 Chengdu Open he won his 21th title defeating Roman Safiullin.[224]\n\n\n\n## Team competitions[edit]\n\n\n### Laver Cup[edit]\n\n\nZverev took part in the inaugural Laver Cup in Prague in 2017. He accrued four points by winning both of his singles matches for Team Europe as they defeated Team World 15–9.[225] He played a more crucial role in 2018 and 2019, winning the clinching matches in both editions against Kevin Anderson and Milos Raonic respectively.[226][227] In the 2021 edition in Boston, he defeated John Isner in three sets in his only match in Team Europe's 14–1 win.[228][229]\n\n\n\n### Davis Cup[edit]\n\n\nZverev made his Davis Cup debut for Germany against the Czech Republic in 2016. He faced No. 7 Tomáš Berdych in his debut match and took a two sets to one lead before ultimately losing in five sets.[230] After the Czech Republic won the doubles rubber while Kohlschreiber won both singles matches, Zverev faced Lukáš Rosol in a decisive fifth rubber. Rosol won the match easily to send the Czech Republic into the next round.[231] In the 2017 against Belgium, Zverev recorded his first career match win in the competition against Arthur De Greef, but lost the doubles rubber with his brother as well as his second singles match to Steve Darcis. Belgium won the tie 4–1.[232] Zverev won his first Davis Cup tie in 2018, winning both of his singles matches against Alex de Minaur and Kyrgios to lead Germany to a 3–1 victory over Australia.[233] In the quarterfinals, Germany took a 2–1 lead against Spain behind Zverev's win over David Ferrer and a victory in doubles. However, Spain ultimately won the tie on the final day after Zverev was unable to defeat Nadal and Kohlschreiber lost a tight five-set match to Ferrer.[234]\n\n\nIn 2019, the format of the Davis Cup was changed to have eighteen countries competing in the finals over a single week in November, all but six of which were decided through a qualifying round in February. Germany was placed in the qualifying round and drawn against Hungary. Zverev participated and won both of his singles matches as Germany won the tie 5–0.[235] He did not participate in the finals in November, in which Germany lost in the quarterfinals.[236]\n\n\n\n### Hopman Cup[edit]\n\n\nZverev represented Germany at the Hopman Cup for four consecutive years from 2016 through 2019 with three different partners. In 2016, he competed with Sabine Lisicki. The duo won their tie against the French team, with Zverev winning both his singles and mixed doubles matches.[237] However, they were shut out against Great Britain and Australia Green and did not advance to the final.[238][239] The following year, he entered the competition with Andrea Petkovic. While the pair only won their tie against Great Britain, Zverev also defeated Federer in singles in his first tournament back from injury.[240]\n\n\nZverev had much more success in 2018 and 2019 when he paired up with Angelique Kerber. In their first year together, they were able to advance to the final, primarily on the strength of the pair winning all three of their mixed doubles matches.[241] In the final against Switzerland, Zverev lost his singles match to Federer.[242] Although Kerber won her singles match against Belinda Bencic, they lost the decisive mixed doubles rubber.[243] They returned in 2019 and again reached the final to set up a rematch of the previous year's final with Federer and Bencic. In a round-robin group with Australia, France, and Spain, the two of them won all six of their singles matches, but lost two of their three mixed doubles matches against Australia and France.[244] Like the previous year, the final was decided by the mixed doubles match after Federer defeated Zverev and Kerber defeated Bencic. With the Fast4 format, the match went to three sets. In the third set tiebreak, both teams had a match point at 4–4. Switzerland won the point with Federer serving to win the title.[245]\n\n\n\n### ATP Cup[edit]\n\n\nZverev represented Germany at the ATP Cup in 2020 and 2021. At the debut of this tournament in 2020, he was on the team with Jan-Lennard Struff, Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies. In the group stage, where Germany met Australia, Canada and Greece, Zverev lost all three matches to Alex de Minaur, Denis Shapovalov and Stefanos Tsitsipas respectively. Germany did not advance to the next phase of the tournament, finishing third in the group.\n\n\nIn 2021, Germany played again with the same lineup as the previous year. In the group they played against Canada and Serbia. Zverev won his first match against Denis Shapovalov. In their second meeting, he lost in singles to Novak Djokovic, but still played against him and Nikola Ćaćić in doubles while paired with Jan-Lennard Struff. Germany won that meeting, which allowed them to advance from first place in the group to the semifinals.[246] There they ended up against Russia, where Zverev lost his match to Daniil Medvedev. Germany eventually lost that game 2–1, allowing Russia to advance to the final.[247]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zverev hitting a forehand\nZverev is an aggressive baseliner. He often stands way back behind the baseline and aims to hit powerful groundstrokes either for winners or to wear down his opponent. Although his height slows him down on the court, it also adds to his reach and gives him the ability to get more balls back in play. Novak Djokovic has commented, \"He moves well for his height.\"[248] Zverev can generate a lot of power with both his backhand and forehand. His backhand, in particular, is regarded as his strength and one of the best in the game.[7] He uses a semi-open stance and employs a western grip on his forehand. He has a continental-eastern grip on his backhand. Zverev can also slice his backhands that require a low center of gravity, despite his height.[249]\n\n\nWith Zverev's height of 1.98 metres (6 ft 6 in), he can generate big serves at 220 kilometres per hour (140 mph) or faster at sharper angles than shorter players.[7] The year Zverev first broke into the top 20, he was still not one of the better servers on tour, ranking just 38th in serve rating. This was well behind him ranking 18th in return rating, showing that his return game was much stronger than his serving.[250] By 2018, he had improved in both categories, ranking 19th in serve rating and 8th in return rating. Zverev excels in particular at hitting a high percentage of first serves in, landing 64.2% in 2018. In his return game, he had the fifth highest percentage of first serve points won that year at 32.4%.[251][252] His second serve is much more shaky and exploitable. Zverev hit the most double faults hit on tour in 2016 and 2020.[253]\n\n\n\n![](image)Zverev serving\nZverev is an all-court player and does not aim to be better on any surface in particular. He has said, \"I feel like I can play on all surfaces. I've been to two finals or won tournaments on every single surface. I don't feel like I have to focus on one... I feel like I have good chances at all of them.\"[254] Toni Nadal, the uncle and coach of Rafael Nadal, has praised his ability on hard courts in particular, saying, \"His best surface is, in my eyes, the hard court, because he moves better than he does on clay.\"[255] Six of Zverev's first ten titles came on hard courts, while the other four were on clay. As of 2020, he has yet to win a title on grass, but has reached two finals and also defeated Federer on that surface.[23][47]\n\n\nZverev has the ability to serve-and-volley as well. His older brother Mischa is regarded as the biggest proponent of this playing style on the modern tour.[256] Although Sascha does not employ this technique as often as his brother, he has shown it can be effective in big matches such as the Madrid Masters final against Dominic Thiem, a player who rarely comes to the net.[257] Zverev's volleying technique is regarded as one of his biggest weaknesses.[9]\n\n\nZverev was tall, but skinny and not very muscular when growing up.[9] His fitness trainer Jez Green has focused on making him stronger and set a goal for him to add 4 kilograms (8.8 lb) of muscle each year. Initially, Zverev had difficulty adjusting to this training style on the court, saying, \"I had no idea what was going on in my body\", and needed to adapt his shot technique as he became more muscular. Eventually, he improved on the court. Green remarked, \"He started to become less wobbly. He started to absorb the power, so when someone hit hard he could hit the ball back and everything locked into place.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Coaching team[edit]\n\n\nZverev has been coached by his parents since he was very young. His mother was initially his primary coach before his father took over at some point.[7] Zverev made the decision to hire former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero at the Washington Open in the summer of 2017.[258] He fired Ferrero following the 2018 Australian Open after Ferrero criticized the rest of Zverev's coaching team.[259] Ivan Lendl, another former world No. 1, joined Zverev's team in August 2018.[260] They split up in July 2019 due to disappointing results and personal differences. Zverev has stated that Lendl was more interested in his dog or his golf game than in professional coaching.[261] In 2020, Zverev started to work with former World Number 3 and 2013 French Open Finalist David Ferrer. They announced their split in January 2021.[262]\n\n\nZverev's coaching team also includes physio Hugo Gravil. Fitness trainer Jez Green, who previously worked with Andy Murray, also worked with Zverev beginning 2013.[7][258] Green departed Zverev's team in 2021 after working with him for around seven years.[263][264]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nZverev lives in Monte Carlo, Monaco.[258] He grew up in Hamburg and also has spent his winters living in Florida at the Saddlebrook Academy.[8][7] He can speak German, Russian, and English.[265] Zverev has a daughter, born in 2021, with Brenda Patea, an ex-girlfriend.[266][267][268]\nSince 2021, Zverev has been dating German actress Sophia Thomalla.[269]\n\n\nIn 2017, Zverev's said his tennis idol is Roger Federer.[9] He is a fan of the Miami Heat in the National Basketball Association (NBA)[8] and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga, and in his spare time he enjoys playing basketball and golf. His best friend on the tour is Brazilian doubles specialist Marcelo Melo, a former French Open and Wimbledon champion.[270][271][272] Zverev has type 1 diabetes, having been diagnosed at the age of three.[273][274]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuit against former agent[edit]\n\n\nZverev filed a lawsuit against the ACE Group International and its CEO Patricio Apey, accusing them of \"unlawful restraint of trade\". He argued that the contract between them was oppressive, but eventually agreed to settle the dispute out-of-court before the trial was to commence.[275][276]\n\n\n\n### Domestic abuse allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Zverev's ex-girlfriend Olga Sharypova, in an article in *Racquet* magazine by journalist Ben Rothenberg, accused Zverev of physically and emotionally abusing her over the course of their relationship. Sharypova named multiple instances where Zverev allegedly became violent towards her, including punching her in the face during an argument that took place in the pair's hotel room while Zverev was competing at the 2019 Laver Cup.[277] Zverev denied the allegations and issued a statement after Sharypova's initial accusations: \"I very much regret that she makes such statements. Because the accusations are simply not true.\"[278]\n\n\nA second article by Rothenberg about the allegations was released on 25 August 2021, this time in *Slate* magazine.[279] Within a week, following a hearing at a Berlin-based German court, Zverev obtained an injunction against Rothenberg to stop publishing the allegations without more substantial evidence.[280] The German court's decision further stated Zverev's lawyers made a credible argument that the accusations were not true while also stating that the article did not have enough balance so that it does leave the impression that Zverev was guilty of the acts Sharypova accused him of committing.[280] In response, *Slate* stated that it stands by the reporting in the article.[280] The online media organization has not removed it from its website nor blocked it from readers in Germany while further protesting that the injunction was obtained without the organization having an opportunity to present evidence, and that they were appealing the decision.[280][281]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the ATP announced an investigation into the allegations against Zverev, saying in a statement \"The allegations raised against Alexander Zverev are serious and we have a responsibility to address them\".[282] The ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi confirmed in March 2022 that the investigation was still ongoing.[283] Following a 15-month ATP-commissioned investigation conducted by The Lake Forest Group (a third-party consultant working with the ATP's outside legal counsel, the Florida-based firm Smith Hulsey & Busey), the ATP announced in late January 2023 that they will not punish Zverev due to insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations.[284]\n\n\n\n### Second allegation of domestic abuse[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2023, a penalty order over alleged bodily harm against Brenda Patea, his ex-girlfriend and the mother of his child, was requested.[285] He was accused of assaulting a women and damaging her health in Berlin in May 2020. In an interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung, Patea stated that Zverev had pushed her against a wall and choked her during an argument.[286]\n\n\nOn 31st October 2023, it was confirmed that a penalty order of 450,000 euros had been imposed on Zverev by the Tiergarten district court. Zverev has lodged an objection against the order.[287]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alexander Zverev career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n*Current through the 2023 US Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | Q1 | 1R | 3R | 3R | 4R | SF | QF | 4R | 2R |  | 0 / 8\n | 20–8\n | 71%\n |\n| French Open | A\n | Q2 | 3R | 1R | QF | QF | 4R | SF | SF | SF |  | 0 / 8\n | 28–8\n | 78%\n |\n| Wimbledon | A\n | 2R | 3R | 4R | 3R | 1R | NH\n | 4R | A\n | 3R |  | 0 / 7\n | 13–7\n | 65%\n |\n| US Open | Q2 | 1R | 2R | 2R | 3R | 4R | F | SF | A\n | QF |  | 0 / 8\n | 22–8\n | 73%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–0\n | 1–2\n | 5–4\n | 6–4\n | 10–4\n | 10–4\n | 14–3\n | 17–4\n | 8–2\n | 12–4\n |  | 0 / 31\n | 83–31\n | 73%\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 1 (1 runner-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss | 2020 | US Open | Hard | ![Austria](image) Dominic Thiem | 6–2, 6–4, 4–6, 3–6, 6–7(6–8) |\n\n\n### Olympic medal finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 1 (1 gold medal)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gold\n | 2021 | Summer Olympics | Hard\n | ![Russia](image) Karen Khachanov | 6–3, 6–1\n |\n\n\n### Year–end championships performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | SR | W–L | Win %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ATP Finals | did not qualify\n | RR | **W** | SF | RR | **W** | DNQ\n | RR | 2 / 5\n | 12–8\n | 60%\n |\n\n\n### Year-end championship finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (2 titles)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win\n | 2018 | ATP Finals, London\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 6–4, 6–3\n |\n| Win\n | 2021 | ATP Finals, Turin\n | Hard (i)\n | ![Russia](image) Daniil Medvedev | 6–4, 6–4\n |\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\nZverev has received the following awards:\n\n\n\n* German Sportspersonality of the Year (2021)[288]\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Alexander Zverev\". *ATP Tour*.
