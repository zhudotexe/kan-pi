An estimated 500 million people worldwide watched this event, the largest television audience for a live broadcast at that time.[1][2]\nA **Moon landing** or **lunar landing** is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon. This includes both crewed and robotic missions. The first human-made object to touch the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2, on 13 September 1959.[3]\n\n\nThe United States' Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969.[4] There were six crewed U.S. landings between 1969 and 1972, and numerous uncrewed landings, with no soft landings happening between 22 August 1976 and 14 December 2013.\n\n\nThe United States is the only country to have successfully conducted crewed missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972. All soft landings took place on the near side of the Moon until 3 January 2019, when the Chinese Chang'e 4 spacecraft made the first landing on the far side of the Moon.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Uncrewed landings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stamp with a drawing of the first soft landed probe Luna 9, next to the first view of the lunar surface photographed by the probe\nSix national space agencies (Interkosmos, NASA, CNSA, ISRO, JAXA and the European Space Agency) have reached the moon with uncrewed missions that achieved varying degrees of success, as well as two private/commercial missions from Israel and Japan. The Soviet Union (Interkosmos), the United States (NASA), China (CNSA) and India (ISRO) are the only four nations to have successfully achieved soft landings.[6]\n\n\nThe Soviet Union performed the first hard Moon landing – \"hard\" meaning the spacecraft intentionally crashes into the Moon at high speeds – with the Luna 2 spacecraft in 1959, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with Ranger 4. \n\n\nMore recently, other space programs have made intentional hard landings, sometimes with end-of-life lunar orbiters that could no longer maintain their orbits. Japan's lunar orbiter Hiten impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The European Space Agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter SMART-1 on 3 September 2006. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1 executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009.\n\n\nFollowing their initial hard landings on the Moon, sixteen Soviet, U.S., Chinese and Indian spacecraft have used braking rockets (retrorockets) to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface. In 1966 the Soviet Union accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna 9 and Luna 13 missions. The U.S. followed with five Surveyor soft landings. China's ongoing  \"Chang'e\" program has landed 3 times since 2013, achieving soil sample return and the first landing on the far side of the Moon.\n\n\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first uncrewed lunar soil sample return with Luna 16 on 24 September 1970. Luna 17 was the first successful uncrewed lunar rover mission, in 1970. China's Chang'e 4 made the first uncrewed soft landing on the far side of the Moon on 3 January 2019.[5]\n\n\nTwo organizations have attempted but failed to achieve soft landings: Israeli private space agency SpaceIL with their Beresheet spacecraft, and Japanese company ispace's Hakuto-R Mission 1.\n\n\nOn August 23, 2023, ISRO successfully landed its Chandrayaan-3 module at the lunar south pole, making India the fourth nation to successfully complete a soft landing on the Moon.[7] Chandrayaan-3 saw a successful soft landing of its *Vikram* lander and *Pragyan* rover at 6.04pm IST (1234 GMT), marking the first uncrewed soft landing in the little-explored region.[8]\n\n\n\n## Crewed landings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Apollo program\n\nSee also: List of people who have walked on the Moon\n\n![](image)The view through the window of the Lunar Module *Orion* shortly after Apollo 16's landing\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting 20 July 1969, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 with Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last man to step off the lunar surface.\n\n\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the command module. The last three missions included a drivable lunar rover, the Lunar Roving Vehicle, for increased mobility.\n\n\n\n## Scientific background[edit]\n\n\nTo get to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave Earth's gravity well; currently, the only practical means is a rocket. Unlike airborne vehicles such as balloons and jets, a rocket can continue accelerating in the vacuum outside the atmosphere.\n\n\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about 160 kilometres per hour (99 mph) and be ruggedized to withstand a \"hard landing\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \"soft landing\" (the only option for humans). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard Moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in 1962 all failed.[9] The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first uncrewed soft lunar landing by the U.S.\n\n\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the escape velocity of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is 2.38 kilometres per second (1.48 mi/s).[10] The change in velocity (referred to as a delta-v) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original launch vehicle as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on Titan carried out by the *Huygens* probe in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using atmospheric entry techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\n\n\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.[11] Crash landings[12] may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been many such Moon crashes, often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the Lunar Module were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the Moon.\n\n\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing. These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\n\n\n\n## Political background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Space Race\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these template messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section's **tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia**.

World War II had introduced many new and deadly innovations including blitzkrieg-style surprise attacks used in the invasion of Poland and Finland, and in the attack on Pearl Harbor; the V-2 rocket, a ballistic missile which killed thousands in attacks on London and Antwerp; and the atom bomb, which killed hundreds of thousands in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the hydrogen bomb.\n\n\n\n![](image)The first image of another world from space, returned by Luna 3, showed the far side of the Moon in October 1959.\nWilly Ley wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\".[13] On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union launched *Sputnik 1* as the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and so initiated the Space Race. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.[*citation needed*] Also, the steady beeping of the radio beacon aboard *Sputnik 1* as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides[*citation needed*] as effective propaganda to Third World countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet political system compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a solar orbit, the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon, and the first photography of the never-before-seen far side of the Moon. These were the Luna 1, Luna 2, and Luna 3 spacecraft.\n\n\n\n![](image)A 1963 conceptual model of the Apollo Lunar Excursion Module\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, NASA. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that would bridge the so-called missile gap and enable a policy of deterrence to nuclear war with the Soviets known as mutual assured destruction or MAD. These newly developed missiles were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\n\n\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,[*citation needed*] just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\n\n\n\n## Early Soviet uncrewed lunar missions (1958–1965)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \"Luna\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \"Sputnik\" or \"Cosmos\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Launch vehicle\n | Launch date\n | Goal\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 23 September 1958\n | Impact\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 93 s\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 12 October 1958\n | Impact\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 104 s\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 4 December 1958\n | Impact\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 254 s\n |\n| Luna-1 | 361\n | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 2 January 1959\n | Impact\n | Partial success – first spacecraft to reach escape velocity, lunar flyby, solar orbit; missed the Moon\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 18 June 1959\n | Impact\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 153 s\n |\n| Luna-2 | 390\n | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 12 September 1959\n | Impact\n | Success – first lunar impact\n |\n| Luna-3 | 270\n | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 4 October 1959\n | Flyby\n | Success – first photos of lunar far side\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 15 April 1960\n | Flyby\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 16 April 1960\n | Flyby\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 1 s\n |\n| Sputnik-25 |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 4 January 1963\n | Landing\n | Failure – stranded in low Earth orbit\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 3 February 1963\n | Landing\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 105 s\n |\n| Luna-4 | 1422\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 2 April 1963\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar flyby at 8,000 kilometres (5,000 mi)\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 21 March 1964\n | Landing\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 20 April 1964\n | Landing\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n| Cosmos-60\n |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 12 March 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – stranded in low Earth orbit\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 10 April 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n| Luna-5 | 1475\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 9 May 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar impact\n |\n| Luna-6 | 1440\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 8 June 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar flyby at 160,000 kilometres (99,000 mi)\n |\n| Luna-7 | 1504\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 4 October 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar impact\n |\n| Luna-8 | 1550\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 3 December 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar impact during landing attempt\n |\n\n\n## Early U.S. uncrewed lunar missions (1958–1965)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **is written like a personal reflection, personal essay, or argumentative essay** that states a Wikipedia editor's personal feelings or presents an original argument about a topic.

Fifteen consecutive U.S. uncrewed lunar missions over a six-year period from 1958 to 1964 all failed their primary photographic missions;[14][15] however, Rangers 4 and 6 successfully repeated the Soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions.[16][17]\n\n\nFailures included three U.S. attempts[9][16][18] in 1962 to hard land small seismometer packages released by the main Ranger spacecraft. These surface packages were to use retrorockets to survive landing, unlike the parent vehicle, which was designed to deliberately crash onto the surface. The final three Ranger probes performed successful high altitude lunar reconnaissance photography missions during intentional crash impacts between 2.62 and 2.68 kilometres per second (9,400 and 9,600 km/h).[19][20][21]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Launch vehicle\n | Launch date\n | Goal\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pioneer 0 | 38\n | Thor-Able | 17 August 1958\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – first stage explosion; destroyed\n |\n| Pioneer 1 | 34\n | Thor-Able\n | 11 October 1958\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – software error; reentry\n |\n| Pioneer 2 | 39\n | Thor-Able\n | 8 November 1958\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – third stage misfire; reentry\n |\n| Pioneer 3 | 6\n | Juno\n | 6 December 1958\n | Flyby\n | Failure – first stage misfire, reentry\n |\n| Pioneer 4 | 6\n | Juno\n | 3 March 1959\n | Flyby\n | Partial success – first US craft to reach escape velocity, lunar flyby too far to shoot photos due to targeting error; solar orbit\n |\n| Pioneer P-1 | 168\n | Atlas-Able\n | 24 September 1959\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – pad explosion; destroyed\n |\n| Pioneer P-3 | 168\n | Atlas-Able\n | 29 November 1959\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – payload shroud; destroyed\n |\n| Pioneer P-30 | 175\n | Atlas-Able\n | 25 September 1960\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – second stage anomaly; reentry\n |\n| Pioneer P-31 | 175\n | Atlas-Able\n | 15 December 1960\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – first stage explosion; destroyed\n |\n| Ranger 1 | 306\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 23 August 1961\n | Prototype test\n | Failure – upper stage anomaly; reentry\n |\n| Ranger 2 | 304\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 18 November 1961\n | Prototype test\n | Failure – upper stage anomaly; reentry\n |\n| Ranger 3 | 330\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 26 January 1962\n | Landing\n | Failure – booster guidance; solar orbit\n |\n| Ranger 4 | 331\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 23 April 1962\n | Landing\n | Partial success – first U.S. spacecraft to reach another celestial body; crash impact – no photos returned\n |\n| Ranger 5 | 342\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 18 October 1962\n | Landing\n | Failure – spacecraft power; solar orbit\n |\n| Ranger 6 | 367\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 30 January 1964\n | Impact\n | Failure – spacecraft camera; crash impact\n |\n| Ranger 7 | 367\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 28 July 1964\n | Impact\n | Success – returned 4308 photos, crash impact\n |\n| Ranger 8 | 367\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 17 February 1965\n | Impact\n | Success – returned 7137 photos, crash impact\n |\n| Ranger 9 | 367\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 21 March 1965\n | Impact\n | Success – returned 5814 photos, crash impact\n |\n\n\n### Pioneer missions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around 110,000 kilometres (68,000 mi) and 1,450 kilometres (900 mi), far short of the roughly 400,000 kilometres (250,000 mi) required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\n\n\nNASA then collaborated with the United States Army's Ballistic Missile Agency to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the Juno ICBM, carrying only photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger-Müller tube detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around 100,000 kilometres (62,000 mi), serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the Van Allen radiation belts before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than 60,000 kilometres (37,000 mi), twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a solar orbit.\n\n\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \"paddlewheel\" solar panels extending from a one-meter diameter spherical spin-stabilized spacecraft body equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure magnetic fields, detect low frequency electromagnetic waves in space and use a sophisticated integrated propulsion system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its Atlas ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\n\n\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory embarked upon an uncrewed spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as Mariners; lunar versions were Rangers. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\n\n\n\n### Ranger missions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ranger program\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of 110,000 kilometres (68,000 mi) and a perigee of 60,000 kilometres (37,000 mi).[22]\n\n\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the magnetosphere over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth parking orbit after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\n\n\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.[9][16][18] All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1 m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650 mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of 5,050 pounds-force (22.5 kN),[16] and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5 m in diameter. This lander (code-named *Tonto*) was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid freon. A 42 kg (56 pounds) 30-centimetre-diameter (0.98 ft) metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Everything that we do ought to really be tied-in to getting onto the Moon ahead of the Russians. ...We're ready to spend reasonable amounts of money, but we're talking about fantastic expenditures which wreck our budget and all these other domestic programs, and the only justification for it, in my opinion, to do it is because we hope to beat them and demonstrate that starting behind, as we did by a couple of years, by God, we passed them.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— John F. Kennedy on the planned Moon landing, 21 November 1962[24]\n\nThis payload sphere contained six silver-cadmium batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a 5 lb (2.3 kg) meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\n\n\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the 3.1 metres (10 ft) Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.[16] Seconds before impact, at 5 and 0.6 kilometres (3.11 and 0.37 mi) above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took pictures (which may be viewed here).\n\n\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at 330 metres (1,080 ft) above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior heat sterilization of the spacecraft by keeping it above the boiling point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.[*citation needed*] These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo crewed Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While Ranger 6 suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent Ranger 7 mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\n\n\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the Ranger 7 mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the United States Congress intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo crewed Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with Ranger 8 and Ranger 9 further buoyed U.S. hopes.\n\n\n\n## Soviet uncrewed soft landings (1966–1976)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model of Luna 16 Moon soil sample return lander\n![](image)Model of Soviet Lunokhod automatic Moon rover\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February 1966. Airbags protected its 99 kilograms (218 lb) ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second (54 km/h; 34 mph).[25] Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.[26]\n\n\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.[27] It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\n\n\nIn 1970 and 1973 two Lunokhod (\"Moonwalker\") robotic lunar rovers were delivered to the Moon, where they successfully operated for 10 and 4 months respectively, covering 10.5 km (Lunokhod 1) and 37 km (Lunokhod 2). These rover missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Booster\n | Launch date\n | Goal\n | Result\n | Landing zone\n | Lat/Lon |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Luna-9 | 1580\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 31 January 1966\n | Landing\n | Success – first lunar soft landing, numerous photos\n | Oceanus Procellarum | 7.13°N 64.37°W\n |\n| Luna-13 | 1580\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 21 December 1966\n | Landing\n | Success – second lunar soft landing, numerous photos\n | Oceanus Procellarum | 18°52'N 62°3'W\n |\n|  |  | Proton | 19 February 1969\n | Lunar rover\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 14 June 1969\n | Sample return\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Luna-15 | 5,700\n | Proton\n | 13 July 1969\n | Sample return\n | Failure – lunar crash impact\n | Mare Crisium | unknown\n |\n| Cosmos-300\n |  | Proton\n | 23 September 1969\n | Sample return\n | Failure – stranded in low Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Cosmos-305\n |  | Proton\n | 22 October 1969\n | Sample return\n | Failure – stranded in low Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 6 February 1970\n | Sample return\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Luna-16 | 5,600\n | Proton\n | 12 September 1970\n | Sample return\n | Success – returned 0.10 kg of Moon soil back to Earth\n | Mare Fecunditatis | 000.68S 056.30E\n |\n| Luna-17 | 5,700\n | Proton\n | 10 November 1970\n | Lunar rover\n | Success – Lunokhod-1 rover traveled 10.5 km across lunar surface\n | Mare Imbrium | 038.28N 325.00E\n |\n| Luna-18 | 5,750\n | Proton\n | 2 September 1971\n | Sample return\n | Failure – lunar crash impact\n | Mare Fecunditatis\n | 003.57N 056.50E\n |\n| Luna-20 | 5,727\n | Proton\n | 14 February 1972\n | Sample return\n | Success – returned 0.05 kg of Moon soil back to Earth\n | Mare Fecunditatis\n | 003.57N 056.50E\n |\n| Luna-21 | 5,950\n | Proton\n | 8 January 1973\n | Lunar rover\n | Success – Lunokhod-2 rover traveled 37.0 km across lunar surface\n | LeMonnier Crater | 025.85N 030.45E\n |\n| Luna-23 | 5,800\n | Proton\n | 28 October 1974\n | Sample return\n | Failure – Moon landing achieved, but malfunction prevented sample return\n | Mare Crisium\n | 012.00N 062.00E\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 16 October 1975\n | Sample return\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Luna-24 | 5,800\n | Proton\n | 9 August 1976\n | Sample return\n | Success – returned 0.17 kg of Moon soil back to Earth\n | Mare Crisium\n | 012.25N 062.20E\n |\n\n\n## U.S. uncrewed soft landings (1966–1968)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Launch of Surveyor 1\n![](image)Pete Conrad, commander of Apollo 12, stands next to Surveyor 3 lander. In the background is the Apollo 12 lander, *Intrepid*.\nThe U.S. robotic Surveyor program was part of an effort to locate a safe site on the Moon for a human landing and test under lunar conditions the radar and landing systems required to make a true controlled touchdown. Five of Surveyor's seven missions made successful uncrewed Moon landings. Surveyor 3 was visited two years after its Moon landing by the crew of Apollo 12. They removed parts of it for examination back on Earth to determine the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Booster\n | Launch date\n | Goal\n | Result\n | Landing zone\n | Lat/Lon |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Surveyor 1 | 292\n | Atlas – Centaur | 30 May 1966\n | Landing\n | Success – 11,000 pictures returned, first U.S. Moon landing\n | Oceanus Procellarum | 002.45S 043.22W\n |\n| Surveyor 2 | 292\n | Atlas – Centaur\n | 20 September 1966\n | Landing\n | Failure – midcourse engine malfunction, placing vehicle in unrecoverable tumble; crashed southeast of Copernicus Crater\n | Sinus Medii | 004.00S 011.00W\n |\n| Surveyor 3 | 302\n | Atlas – Centaur\n | 20 April 1967\n | Landing\n | Success – 6,000 pictures returned; trench dug to 17.5 cm depth after 18 hr of robot arm use\n | Oceanus Procellarum\n | 002.94S 336.66E\n |\n| Surveyor 4 | 282\n | Atlas – Centaur\n | 14 July 1967\n | Landing\n | Failure – radio contact lost 2.5 minutes before touchdown; perfect automated Moon landing possible but outcome unknown\n | Sinus Medii\n | unknown\n |\n| Surveyor 5 | 303\n | Atlas – Centaur\n | 8 September 1967\n | Landing\n | Success – 19,000 photos returned, first use of alpha scatter soil composition monitor\n | Mare Tranquillitatis | 001.41N 023.18E\n |\n| Surveyor 6 | 300\n | Atlas – Centaur\n | 7 November 1967\n | Landing\n | Success – 30,000 photos returned, robot arm and alpha scatter science, engine restart, second landing 2.5 m away from first\n | Sinus Medii\n | 000.46N 358.63E\n |\n| Surveyor 7 | 306\n | Atlas – Centaur\n | 7 January 1968\n | Landing\n | Success – 21,000 photos returned; robot arm and alpha scatter science; laser beams from Earth detected\n | Tycho Crater | 041.01S 348.59E\n |\n\n\n## Transition from direct ascent landings to lunar orbit operations[edit]\n\n\nWithin four months of each other in early 1966 the Soviet Union and the United States had accomplished successful Moon landings with uncrewed spacecraft. To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming crewed landers with their much greater weight.\n\n\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a 50-kilometre-per-hour (31 mph) ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned 160-kilometre-per-hour (99 mph) impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a crewed flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\n\n\n\n![](image)A timeline of the space race between 1957 and 1975, with missions from the US and USSR\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before crewed spacecraft could follow uncrewed ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all flew directly to the surface without a lunar orbit. Such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for uncrewed spacecraft on a one-way trip.\n\n\nIn contrast, crewed vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile for a crewed Moon landing.\n\n\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions featuring lunar orbit as a prerequisite to a crewed Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial uncrewed orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of crewed landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\n\n\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's maria. Such mass concentrations (\"mascons\") can send a crewed mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\n\n\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA Lunar Prospector orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist Eugene Shoemaker was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor – currently[*when?*] the only human remains on the Moon.\n\n\n\n## Soviet lunar orbit satellites (1966–1974)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| U.S.S.R. mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Booster\n | Launched\n | Mission goal\n | Mission result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cosmos – 111\n |  | Molniya-M | 1 March 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Failure – stranded in low Earth orbit\n |\n| Luna-10 | 1,582\n | Molniya-M\n | 31 March 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 2,738 km x 2,088 km x 72 deg orbit, 178 m period, 60-day science mission\n |\n| Luna-11 | 1,640\n | Molniya-M\n | 24 August 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 2,931 km x 1,898 km x 27 deg orbit, 178 m period, 38-day science mission\n |\n| Luna-12 | 1,620\n | Molniya-M\n | 22 October 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 2,938 km x 1,871 km x 10 deg orbit, 205 m period, 89-day science mission\n |\n| Cosmos-159\n | 1,700\n | Molniya-M\n | 17 May 1967\n | Prototype test\n | Success – high Earth orbit crewed landing communications gear radio calibration test\n |\n|  |  | Molniya-M\n | 7 February 1968\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit – attempted radio calibration test?\n |\n| Luna-14 | 1,700\n | Molniya-M\n | 7 April 1968\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 870 km x 160 km x 42 deg orbit, 160 m period, unstable orbit, radio calibration test?\n |\n| Luna-19 | 5,700\n | Proton | 28 September 1971\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 140 km x 140 km x 41 deg orbit, 121 m period, 388-day science mission\n |\n| Luna-22 | 5,700\n | Proton\n | 29 May 1974\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 222 km x 219 km x 19 deg orbit, 130 m period, 521-day science mission\n |\n\n\nLuna 10 became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\n\n\n\n## U.S. lunar orbit satellites (1966–1967)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| U.S. mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Booster\n | Launched\n | Mission goal\n | Mission result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lunar Orbiter 1 | 386\n | Atlas – Agena | 10 August 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 1,160 km X 189 km x 12 deg orbit, 208 m period, 80-day photography mission\n |\n| Lunar Orbiter 2 | 386\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 6 November 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 1,860 km X 52 km x 12 deg orbit, 208 m period, 339-day photography mission\n |\n| Lunar Orbiter 3 | 386\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 5 February 1967\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 1,860 km X 52 km x 21 deg orbit, 208 m period, 246-day photography mission\n |\n| Lunar Orbiter 4 | 386\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 4 May 1967\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 6,111 km X 2,706 km x 86 deg orbit, 721 m period, 180-day photography mission\n |\n| Lunar Orbiter 5 | 386\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 1 August 1967\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 6,023 km X 195 km x 85 deg orbit, 510 m period, 183-day photography mission\n |\n\n\n## Soviet circumlunar loop flights (1967–1970)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Soviet crewed lunar programs\n\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called free return trajectory. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a crewed circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges beyond those found in a crewed low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a crewed Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\n\n\nInhabited Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around 7,500 m/s (27,000 km/h). Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around 11,000 m/s (40,000 km/h). The g-loading on astronauts during the resulting deceleration can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\n\n\nAchieving a crewed circumlunar loop flight prior to a crewed lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their Zond spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were robotic planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate human spaceflight program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a crewed circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\n\n\nInitial crewed spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet Vostok and U.S. Mercury programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as Voskhod effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten Gemini low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking crucial to a crewed lunar landing mission profile.\n\n\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviet Union began flying their second-generation Zond crewed spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him or her immediately to Earth. The Zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational Proton launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet human Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation Soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced N-1 booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a crewed Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. human lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\n\n\nLike Zond, Apollo flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop if a service module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which is the only crewed circumlunar loop mission flown to date.[*when?*]\n\n\n\n\n\n| U.S.S.R mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Booster\n | Launched\n | Mission goal\n | Payload\n | Mission result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cosmos-146 | 5,400\n | Proton | 10 March 1967\n | High Earth Orbit\n | uncrewed\n | Partial success – Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n |\n| Cosmos-154 | 5,400\n | Proton\n | 8 April 1967\n | High Earth Orbit\n | uncrewed\n | Partial success – Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 28 September 1967\n | High Earth Orbit\n | uncrewed\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 22 November 1967\n | High Earth Orbit\n | uncrewed\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n| Zond-4 | 5,140\n | Proton\n | 2 March 1968\n | High Earth Orbit\n | uncrewed\n | Partial success – launched successfully to 300,000 km high Earth orbit, high speed reentry test guidance malfunction, intentional self-destruct to prevent landfall outside Soviet Union\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 23 April 1968\n | Circumlunar Loop\n | non-human biological payload\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit; launch preparation tank explosion kills three in pad crew\n |\n| Zond-5 | 5,375\n | Proton\n | 15 September 1968\n | Circumlunar Loop\n | non-human biological payload\n | Success – looped around Moon with Earth's first near-lunar life forms, two tortoises and other live biological specimens, and the capsule and payload safely to Earth despite landing off-target outside the Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean\n |\n| Zond-6 | 5,375\n | Proton\n | 10 November 1968\n | Circumlunar Loop\n | non-human biological payload\n | Partial success – looped around Moon, successful reentry, but loss of cabin air pressure caused biological payload death, parachute system malfunction and severe vehicle damage upon landing\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 20 January 1969\n | Circumlunar Loop\n | non-human biological payload\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n| Zond-7 | 5,979\n | Proton\n | 8 August 1969\n | Circumlunar Loop\n | non-human biological payload\n | Success – looped around Moon, returned biological payload safely to Earth and landed on-target inside Soviet Union.

Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to humans.\n\n\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue uncrewed Zond tests until their reliability to support human flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the lunar module, and because of CIA reports of a potential Soviet crewed circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of Apollo 8 from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\n\n\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in Baikonur, giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. Cosmonauts went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first human trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet Politburo decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a crewed Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another uncrewed test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\n\n\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. Apollo spacecraft had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The Apollo 8 mission carried out the first human trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the Saturn V booster for crewed use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. Apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a crewed Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within 47,400 feet (14.4 km) of the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module too heavy to land. With the failure of the robotic Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna 15 in July 1969, the stage was set for Apollo 11.\n\n\n\n## Human Moon landings (1969–1972)[edit]\n\n\n### US strategy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo program § Political pressure builds\n\n![](image)The U.S. Saturn V and the Soviet N1\nPlans for human Moon exploration began during the Eisenhower administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in *Collier's* magazine, Wernher von Braun had popularized the idea of a crewed expedition to establish a lunar base. A human Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, atmospheric re-entry without ablative overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviets launched Sputnik, von Braun promoted a plan for the US Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\n\n\nAfter the early Soviet successes, especially Yuri Gagarin's flight, US President John F. Kennedy looked for a project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President Lyndon Johnson to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the Third World. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the US, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\n\n\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads; the Soviets' were much heavier, and the powerful R-7 rocket was developed to carry them. More modest missions such as flying around the Moon, or a space lab in lunar orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun), offered too much advantage to the Soviets; *landing*, however, would capture the world's imagination.\n\n\n\n![](image)Apollo landing sites\nJohnson had championed the US human spaceflight program ever since Sputnik, sponsoring legislation to create NASA while he was still a senator. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating them to a crewed lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. These diversions dismayed NASA's leader, James E. Webb, who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\n\n\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V launch vehicle, which achieved a perfect record: zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures in thirteen launches.\n\n\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians both on the left (more money for social programs) and on the right (more money for the military). By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson became President in 1963, his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy had planned.\n\n\n\n### Soviet strategy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Soviet Moonshot\n\nSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said in October 1963 the USSR was \"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year did the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\n\n\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites, eventually resulting in the Apollo-Soyuz mission. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea at first: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. Though Khrushchev was eventually warming up to the idea, the realization of a joint Moon landing was choked by Kennedy's assassination.[28]\n\n\nSergey Korolev, the Soviet space program's chief designer, had started promoting his Soyuz craft and the N1 launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a human Moon landing. Khrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a human cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all crewed projects under his direction.\n\n\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, coordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for a mission that would have placed Alexei Leonov on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a crewed landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\n\n\nA program of automated return vehicles was begun, in the hope of being the first to return lunar rocks. This had several failures. It eventually succeeded with Luna 16 in 1970.[29] But this had little impact, because the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 lunar landings and rock returns had already taken place by then.\n\n\n\n### Apollo missions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, Lunar Module pilot of the first lunar landing mission, poses for a photograph beside the deployed United States flag during an Apollo 11 Extravehicular Activity (EVA) on the lunar surface.\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of crewed Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.[30]\n\n\n\n### Human Moon landings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Mission name\n | Lunar lander\n | Lunar landing date\n | Lunar liftoff date\n | Lunar landing site\n | Duration on lunar surface (DD:HH:MM)\n | Crew\n | Number of EVAs | Total EVA Time (HH:MM)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Apollo 11 | *Eagle* | 20 July 1969\n | 21 July 1969\n | Sea of Tranquility | 0:21:31\n | Neil Armstrong, Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin | 1\n | 2:31\n |\n| Apollo 12 | *Intrepid* | 19 November 1969\n | 21 November 1969\n | Ocean of Storms | 1:07:31\n | Charles \"Pete\" Conrad, Alan Bean | 2\n | 7:45\n |\n| Apollo 14 | *Antares* | 5 February 1971\n | 6 February 1971\n | Fra Mauro | 1:09:30\n | Alan B.

Apollo 11 was the first of six Apollo program lunar landings.\nPresident Richard Nixon had speechwriter William Safire prepare a condolence speech for delivery in case Armstrong and Aldrin became marooned on the Moon's surface and could not be rescued.[31]\n\n\nIn 1951, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke forecast that a man would reach the Moon by 1978.[32]\n\n\nOn 16 August 2006, the Associated Press reported that NASA is missing the original Slow-scan television tapes (which were made before the scan conversion for conventional TV) of the Apollo 11 Moon walk. Some news outlets have mistakenly reported the SSTV tapes found in Western Australia, but those tapes were only recordings of data from the Apollo 11 Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package.[33] The tapes were found in 2008 and sold at auction in 2019 for the 50th anniversary of the landing.[34]\n\n\nScientists believe the six American flags planted by astronauts have been bleached white because of more than 40 years of exposure to solar radiation.[35] Using LROC images, it has been determined that five of the six American flags are still standing and casting shadows at all of the sites, except Apollo 11.[36] Astronaut Buzz Aldrin reported that the flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during liftoff of Apollo 11.[36]\n\n\n\n## Late 20th century–Early 21st century uncrewed crash landings[edit]\n\n\n### Hiten (Japan)[edit]\n\n\nLaunched on 24 January 1990, 11:46 UTC. At the end of its mission, the Japanese lunar orbiter Hiten was commanded to crash into the lunar surface and did so on 10 April 1993 at 18:03:25.7 UT (11 April 03:03:25.7 JST).[37]\n\n\n\n### Lunar Prospector (US)[edit]\n\n\nLunar Prospector was launched on 7 January 1998. The mission ended on 31 July 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a crater near the lunar south pole after the presence of water ice was successfully detected.[38]\n\n\n\n### SMART-1 (ESA)[edit]\n\n\nLaunched 27 September 2003, 23:14 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. At the end of its mission, the ESA lunar orbiter SMART-1 performed a controlled crash into the Moon, at about 2 km/s. The time of the crash was 3 September 2006, at 5:42 UTC.[39]\n\n\n\n### Chandrayaan-1 (India)[edit]\n\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled hard landing with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP). The MIP was ejected from the Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter and performed remote sensing experiments during its descent to the lunar surface. It impacted near Shackleton crater at the south pole of the lunar surface at 14 November 2008, 20:31 IST. \n\n\nChandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008, 00:52 UTC.[40]\n\n\n\n### Chang'e 1 (China)[edit]\n\n\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1, executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009, 20:44 GMT, after a 16-month mission. Chang'e 1 was launched on 24 October 2007, 10:05 UTC.[41]\n\n\n\n### SELENE (Japan)[edit]\n\n\nSELENE or *Kaguya* after successfully orbiting the Moon for a year and eight months, the main orbiter was instructed to impact on the lunar surface near the crater Gill at 18:25 UTC on 10 June 2009.[42] SELENE or *Kaguya* was launched on 14 September 2007.\n\n\n\n### LCROSS (US)[edit]\n\n\nThe LCROSS data collecting shepherding spacecraft was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on 18 June 2009 on board an Atlas V rocket with a Centaur upper stage. On 9 October 2009, at 11:31 UTC, the Centaur upper stage impacted the lunar surface, releasing the kinetic energy equivalent of detonating approximately 2 tons of TNT (8.86 GJ).[43] Six minutes later at 11:37 UTC, the LCROSS shepherding spacecraft also impacted the surface.[44]\n\n\n\n### GRAIL (US)[edit]\n\n\nThe GRAIL mission consisted of two small spacecraft: GRAIL A (*Ebb*), and GRAIL B (*Flow*). They were launched on 10 September 2011 on board a Delta II rocket. GRAIL A separated from the rocket about nine minutes after launch, and GRAIL B followed about eight minutes later.[45][46] The first probe entered orbit on 31 December 2011 and the second followed on 1 January 2012.[47] The two spacecraft impacted the Lunar surface on 17 December 2012.[48]\n\n\n\n### LADEE (US)[edit]\n\n\nLADEE was launched on 7 September 2013.[49] The mission ended on 18 April 2014, when the spacecraft's controllers intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon,[50][51] which, later, was determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.[52][53]\n\n\n\n### Manfred Memorial Moon Mission (Luxemburg)[edit]\n\n\nThe Manfred Memorial Moon Mission was launched on the 23 October 2014. It conducted a lunar flyby and operated for 19 days which was four times longer than expected. The Manfred Memorial Moon Mission remained attached to the upper stage of its launch vehicle (CZ-3C/E). The spacecraft along with its upper stage impacted the Moon on 4 March 2022.[54][55][56]\n\n\n\n## 21st century uncrewed soft landings and attempts[edit]\n\n\n### Chang'e 3 (China)[edit]\n\n\n![Yutu rover on lunar surface](image)Yutu rover on lunar surface\nOn 14 December 2013 at 13:12 UTC[57] Chang'e 3 soft-landed a rover on the Moon. This was China's first soft landing on another celestial body and world's first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 on 22 August 1976.[58] The mission was launched on 1 December 2013. After successful landing, the lander release the Yutu rover, which moved 114 meters before being immobilized due to system malfunction. But the rover was still operational until July 2016.[59]\n\n\n\n### Chang'e 4 (China)[edit]\n\n\n![Chang'e 4 lander on the surface of far side of the Moon.](image)Chinese Chang'e 4 lander on the surface of far side of the Moon\n![Yutu-2 rover deployed by Chang'e 4 lander.](image)*Yutu-2* rover deployed by Chang'e 4 lander\nOn 3 January 2019 at 2:26 UTC Chang'e 4 became the first spacecraft to land on the far side of the Moon.[60] Chang'e 4 was originally designed as the backup of Chang'e 3. It was later adjusted as a mission to the far side of the Moon after the success of Chang'e 3.[61] After making a successful landing within Von Kármán crater, the Chang'e 4 lander deployed the 140kg Yutu-2 rover and began human's very first close exploration of the far side of the Moon. Because the Moon blocks the communications between far side and Earth, a relay satellite, Queqiao, was launched to the Earth–Moon L2 Lagrangian point a few months prior to the landing to enable communications.\n\n\n*Yutu-2*, the second lunar rover from China, was equipped with panoramic camera, lunar penetrating radar, visible and near-infrared Imaging spectrometer and advanced small analyzer for neutrals. As of July 2022, it has survived more than 1000 days on the lunar surface and is still driving with cumulative travel distance of over 1200 meters.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### *Beresheet* (Israel/SpaceIL)[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 February 2019, Israeli private space agency SpaceIL launched their spacecraft *Beresheet* on a Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral, Florida with the intention of achieving a soft landing. SpaceIL lost contact with the spacecraft during final descent on 11 April 2019, and it crashed as a result of a main engine failure.\n\n\nThe mission was the first Israeli, and the first privately funded, lunar landing attempt.[64] Despite the failure, the mission represents the closest a private entity has come to a soft lunar landing.[65]\n\n\nSpaceIL was originally conceived in 2011 as a venture to pursue the Google Lunar X Prize. The *Beresheet* lunar lander's target landing destination was within Mare Serenitatis, a vast volcanic basin on the Moon's northern near side.\n\n\n\n### Chandrayaan 2 (India)[edit]\n\n\nISRO, the Indian National Space agency, launched Chandrayaan 2 on 22 July 2019.[66][67] It had three major modules: orbiter, lander and rover. Each of these modules had scientific instruments from scientific research institutes in India and the US.[68] On 7 September 2019 contact was lost with the *Vikram* lander at an altitude of 2.1 km (1.3 mi) after a rough braking phase.[69] *Vikram* was later confirmed to have crashed and been destroyed.\n\n\n\n### Chang'e 5 (China)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Chang'e 5 returner carrying lunar sample was transported back to CAST.\nOn 6 December 2020 at 21:42 UTC Chang'e 5 landed and collected the first lunar soil samples in over 40 years, and then returned the samples to Earth. The 8.2t stack consisting of lander, ascender, orbiter and returner was launched to lunar orbit by a Long March 5 rocket on November 24. The lander-ascender combination was separated with the orbiter and returner before landing near Mons Rümker in Oceanus Procellarum. The ascender was later launched back to lunar orbit, carrying samples collected by the lander, and completed the first-ever robotic rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit.[70][71] The sample container was then transferred to the returner, which successfully landed on Inner Mongolia on 16 December 2020, completing China's first extraterrestrial sample return mission.[72]\n\n\n\n### Luna 25 (Russia)[edit]\n\n\nIn Russia's first attempt to reach the Moon since 1976, and since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Luna 25 spacecraft failed during \"pre-landing\" maneuvers, and crashed into the lunar surface on August 19, 2023.[73]\n\n\n\n### Chandrayaan 3 (India)[edit]\n\n\n![Vikram lander of Chandrayaan-3 near lunar south pole](image)Vikram lander of Chandrayaan-3 near lunar south pole\nIndia's national space agency ISRO launched Chandrayaan-3 on 14 July 2023. Chandrayaan-3 consists of an Indigenous Lander Module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and the *Pragyan* rover. The lander with the rover successfully landed near the lunar south pole at 18:04 IST on 23 August 2023.[74][75]\n\n\n\n## Landings on moons of other Solar System bodies[edit]\n\n\n21st century progress in space exploration has broadened the phrase *moon landing* to include other moons in the Solar System. The *Huygens* probe of the *Cassini–Huygens* mission to Saturn performed a successful moon landing on Titan in 2005. Similarly, the Soviet probe Phobos 2 came within 120 mi (190 km) of performing a landing on Mars' moon Phobos in 1989 before radio contact with that lander was suddenly lost. A similar Russian sample return mission called Fobos-Grunt (\"grunt\" means \"soil\" in Russian) launched in November 2011, but stalled in low Earth orbit. There is widespread interest in performing a future landing on Jupiter's moon Europa to drill down and explore the possible liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface.[76]\n\n\n\n## Proposed future missions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Future missions\n\nThe Lunar Polar Exploration Mission is a robotic space mission concept by ISRO and Japan's space agency JAXA[77][78] that would send a lunar rover and lander to explore south pole region of the Moon in 2025.[79][80] JAXA is likely to provide launch service using the future H3 rocket, along with responsibility for the rover. ISRO would be responsible for the lander.[78][81]\n\n\nOn 11 December 2017, US President Donald Trump signed Space Policy Directive 1, which directed NASA to return to the Moon with a crewed mission, for \"long-term exploration and use\" and missions to other planets.[82] On 26 March 2019, Vice President Mike Pence formally announced that the mission will include the first female lunar astronaut.[83] The Artemis program intends to land a crewed mission on the Moon in 2024, and to begin sustained operations by 2028, supported by a planned Lunar Gateway.[84]\n\n\nThe Chinese Lunar Exploration Program plans 3 additional \"Chang'e\" uncrewed missions between 2025 and 2028, in active preparation for the International Lunar Research Station it plans to construct with Russia, Venezuela, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates in the 2030's. In addition, the China Manned Space Agency intends to conduct crewed lunar landings by 2029 or 2030; in preparation for this effort, the various Chinese space agencies and contractors are currently developing a human-rated super-heavy launch vehicle (the Long March 10), a new crewed lunar spacecraft, and a crewed lunar lander.[85]\n\n\nRussia's Roscosmos haș announced plans to launch a lunar polar orbiter as Luna 26, in 2027.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Apollo astronauts\n* Lunar Escape Systems\n* Robert Goddard\n* Soyuz 7K-L1\n* First on the Moon (disambiguation)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Manned Space Chronology: Apollo\\_11\". spaceline.org.

Except for the Apollo program, all soft landings were uncrewed.\n |\n\n\n![](image)Still frame from a video transmission, taken moments before Neil Armstrong became the first human to step onto the surface of the Moon, at 02:56 UTC on 21 July 1969. An estimated 500 million people worldwide watched this event, the largest television audience for a live broadcast at that time.[1][2]\nA **Moon landing** or **lunar landing** is the arrival of a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon. This includes both crewed and robotic missions. The first human-made object to touch the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2, on 13 September 1959.[3]\n\n\nThe United States' Apollo 11 was the first crewed mission to land on the Moon, on 20 July 1969.[4] There were six crewed U.S. landings between 1969 and 1972, and numerous uncrewed landings, with no soft landings happening between 22 August 1976 and 14 December 2013.\n\n\nThe United States is the only country to have successfully conducted crewed missions to the Moon, with the last departing the lunar surface in December 1972. All soft landings took place on the near side of the Moon until 3 January 2019, when the Chinese Chang'e 4 spacecraft made the first landing on the far side of the Moon.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Uncrewed landings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stamp with a drawing of the first soft landed probe Luna 9, next to the first view of the lunar surface photographed by the probe\nSix national space agencies (Interkosmos, NASA, CNSA, ISRO, JAXA and the European Space Agency) have reached the moon with uncrewed missions that achieved varying degrees of success, as well as two private/commercial missions from Israel and Japan. The Soviet Union (Interkosmos), the United States (NASA), China (CNSA) and India (ISRO) are the only four nations to have successfully achieved soft landings.[6]\n\n\nThe Soviet Union performed the first hard Moon landing – \"hard\" meaning the spacecraft intentionally crashes into the Moon at high speeds – with the Luna 2 spacecraft in 1959, a feat the U.S. duplicated in 1962 with Ranger 4. \n\n\nMore recently, other space programs have made intentional hard landings, sometimes with end-of-life lunar orbiters that could no longer maintain their orbits. Japan's lunar orbiter Hiten impacted the Moon's surface on 10 April 1993. The European Space Agency performed a controlled crash impact with their orbiter SMART-1 on 3 September 2006. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled crash impact with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP) on 14 November 2008. The Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1 executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009.\n\n\nFollowing their initial hard landings on the Moon, sixteen Soviet, U.S., Chinese and Indian spacecraft have used braking rockets (retrorockets) to make soft landings and perform scientific operations on the lunar surface. In 1966 the Soviet Union accomplished the first soft landings and took the first pictures from the lunar surface during the Luna 9 and Luna 13 missions. The U.S. followed with five Surveyor soft landings. China's ongoing  \"Chang'e\" program has landed 3 times since 2013, achieving soil sample return and the first landing on the far side of the Moon.\n\n\nThe Soviet Union achieved the first uncrewed lunar soil sample return with Luna 16 on 24 September 1970. Luna 17 was the first successful uncrewed lunar rover mission, in 1970. China's Chang'e 4 made the first uncrewed soft landing on the far side of the Moon on 3 January 2019.[5]\n\n\nTwo organizations have attempted but failed to achieve soft landings: Israeli private space agency SpaceIL with their Beresheet spacecraft, and Japanese company ispace's Hakuto-R Mission 1.\n\n\nOn August 23, 2023, ISRO successfully landed its Chandrayaan-3 module at the lunar south pole, making India the fourth nation to successfully complete a soft landing on the Moon.[7] Chandrayaan-3 saw a successful soft landing of its *Vikram* lander and *Pragyan* rover at 6.04pm IST (1234 GMT), marking the first uncrewed soft landing in the little-explored region.[8]\n\n\n\n## Crewed landings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Apollo program\n\nSee also: List of people who have walked on the Moon\n\n![](image)The view through the window of the Lunar Module *Orion* shortly after Apollo 16's landing\nA total of twelve men have landed on the Moon. This was accomplished with two US pilot-astronauts flying a Lunar Module on each of six NASA missions across a 41-month period starting 20 July 1969, with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11, and ending on 14 December 1972 with Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt on Apollo 17. Cernan was the last man to step off the lunar surface.\n\n\nAll Apollo lunar missions had a third crew member who remained on board the command module. The last three missions included a drivable lunar rover, the Lunar Roving Vehicle, for increased mobility.\n\n\n\n## Scientific background[edit]\n\n\nTo get to the Moon, a spacecraft must first leave Earth's gravity well; currently, the only practical means is a rocket. Unlike airborne vehicles such as balloons and jets, a rocket can continue accelerating in the vacuum outside the atmosphere.\n\n\nUpon approach of the target moon, a spacecraft will be drawn ever closer to its surface at increasing speeds due to gravity. In order to land intact it must decelerate to less than about 160 kilometres per hour (99 mph) and be ruggedized to withstand a \"hard landing\" impact, or it must decelerate to negligible speed at contact for a \"soft landing\" (the only option for humans). The first three attempts by the U.S. to perform a successful hard Moon landing with a ruggedized seismometer package in 1962 all failed.[9] The Soviets first achieved the milestone of a hard lunar landing with a ruggedized camera in 1966, followed only months later by the first uncrewed soft lunar landing by the U.S.\n\n\nThe speed of a crash landing on its surface is typically between 70 and 100% of the escape velocity of the target moon, and thus this is the total velocity which must be shed from the target moon's gravitational attraction for a soft landing to occur. For Earth's Moon, the escape velocity is 2.38 kilometres per second (1.48 mi/s).[10] The change in velocity (referred to as a delta-v) is usually provided by a landing rocket, which must be carried into space by the original launch vehicle as part of the overall spacecraft. An exception is the soft moon landing on Titan carried out by the *Huygens* probe in 2005. As the moon with the thickest atmosphere, landings on Titan may be accomplished by using atmospheric entry techniques that are generally lighter in weight than a rocket with equivalent capability.\n\n\nThe Soviets succeeded in making the first crash landing on the Moon in 1959.[11] Crash landings[12] may occur because of malfunctions in a spacecraft, or they can be deliberately arranged for vehicles which do not have an onboard landing rocket. There have been many such Moon crashes, often with their flight path controlled to impact at precise locations on the lunar surface. For example, during the Apollo program the S-IVB third stage of the Saturn V rocket as well as the spent ascent stage of the Lunar Module were deliberately crashed on the Moon several times to provide impacts registering as a moonquake on seismometers that had been left on the lunar surface. Such crashes were instrumental in mapping the internal structure of the Moon.\n\n\nTo return to Earth, the escape velocity of the Moon must be overcome for the spacecraft to escape the gravity well of the Moon. Rockets must be used to leave the Moon and return to space. Upon reaching Earth, atmospheric entry techniques are used to absorb the kinetic energy of a returning spacecraft and reduce its speed for safe landing. These functions greatly complicate a moon landing mission and lead to many additional operational considerations. Any moon departure rocket must first be carried to the Moon's surface by a moon landing rocket, increasing the latter's required size. The Moon departure rocket, larger moon landing rocket and any Earth atmosphere entry equipment such as heat shields and parachutes must in turn be lifted by the original launch vehicle, greatly increasing its size by a significant and almost prohibitive degree.\n\n\n\n## Political background[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Space Race\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these template messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section's **tone or style may not reflect the encyclopedic tone used on Wikipedia**.

World War II had introduced many new and deadly innovations including blitzkrieg-style surprise attacks used in the invasion of Poland and Finland, and in the attack on Pearl Harbor; the V-2 rocket, a ballistic missile which killed thousands in attacks on London and Antwerp; and the atom bomb, which killed hundreds of thousands in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In the 1950s, tensions mounted between the two ideologically opposed superpowers of the United States and the Soviet Union that had emerged as victors in the conflict, particularly after the development by both countries of the hydrogen bomb.\n\n\n\n![](image)The first image of another world from space, returned by Luna 3, showed the far side of the Moon in October 1959.\nWilly Ley wrote in 1957 that a rocket to the Moon \"could be built later this year if somebody can be found to sign some papers\".[13] On 4 October 1957, the Soviet Union launched *Sputnik 1* as the first artificial satellite to orbit the Earth and so initiated the Space Race. This unexpected event was a source of pride to the Soviets and shock to the U.S., who could now potentially be surprise attacked by nuclear-tipped Soviet rockets in under 30 minutes.[*citation needed*] Also, the steady beeping of the radio beacon aboard *Sputnik 1* as it passed overhead every 96 minutes was widely viewed on both sides[*citation needed*] as effective propaganda to Third World countries demonstrating the technological superiority of the Soviet political system compared to that of the U.S. This perception was reinforced by a string of subsequent rapid-fire Soviet space achievements. In 1959, the R-7 rocket was used to launch the first escape from Earth's gravity into a solar orbit, the first crash impact onto the surface of the Moon, and the first photography of the never-before-seen far side of the Moon. These were the Luna 1, Luna 2, and Luna 3 spacecraft.\n\n\n\n![](image)A 1963 conceptual model of the Apollo Lunar Excursion Module\nThe U.S. response to these Soviet achievements was to greatly accelerate previously existing military space and missile projects and to create a civilian space agency, NASA. Military efforts were initiated to develop and produce mass quantities of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that would bridge the so-called missile gap and enable a policy of deterrence to nuclear war with the Soviets known as mutual assured destruction or MAD. These newly developed missiles were made available to civilians of NASA for various projects (which would have the added benefit of demonstrating the payload, guidance accuracy and reliabilities of U.S. ICBMs to the Soviets).\n\n\nWhile NASA stressed peaceful and scientific uses for these rockets, their use in various lunar exploration efforts also had secondary goal of realistic, goal-oriented testing of the missiles themselves and development of associated infrastructure,[*citation needed*] just as the Soviets were doing with their R-7.\n\n\n\n## Early Soviet uncrewed lunar missions (1958–1965)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, historical records were released to allow the true accounting of Soviet lunar efforts. Unlike the U.S. tradition of assigning a particular mission name in advance of a launch, the Soviets assigned a public \"Luna\" mission number only if a launch resulted in a spacecraft going beyond Earth orbit. The policy had the effect of hiding Soviet Moon mission failures from public view. If the attempt failed in Earth orbit before departing for the Moon, it was frequently (but not always) given a \"Sputnik\" or \"Cosmos\" Earth-orbit mission number to hide its purpose. Launch explosions were not acknowledged at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Launch vehicle\n | Launch date\n | Goal\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 23 September 1958\n | Impact\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 93 s\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 12 October 1958\n | Impact\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 104 s\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 4 December 1958\n | Impact\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 254 s\n |\n| Luna-1 | 361\n | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 2 January 1959\n | Impact\n | Partial success – first spacecraft to reach escape velocity, lunar flyby, solar orbit; missed the Moon\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 18 June 1959\n | Impact\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 153 s\n |\n| Luna-2 | 390\n | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 12 September 1959\n | Impact\n | Success – first lunar impact\n |\n| Luna-3 | 270\n | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 4 October 1959\n | Flyby\n | Success – first photos of lunar far side\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 15 April 1960\n | Flyby\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K72\n | 16 April 1960\n | Flyby\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 1 s\n |\n| Sputnik-25 |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 4 January 1963\n | Landing\n | Failure – stranded in low Earth orbit\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 3 February 1963\n | Landing\n | Failure – booster malfunction at T+ 105 s\n |\n| Luna-4 | 1422\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 2 April 1963\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar flyby at 8,000 kilometres (5,000 mi)\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 21 March 1964\n | Landing\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 20 April 1964\n | Landing\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n| Cosmos-60\n |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 12 March 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – stranded in low Earth orbit\n |\n|  |  | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 10 April 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n| Luna-5 | 1475\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 9 May 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar impact\n |\n| Luna-6 | 1440\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 8 June 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar flyby at 160,000 kilometres (99,000 mi)\n |\n| Luna-7 | 1504\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 4 October 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar impact\n |\n| Luna-8 | 1550\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 3 December 1965\n | Landing\n | Failure – lunar impact during landing attempt\n |\n\n\n## Early U.S. uncrewed lunar missions (1958–1965)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **is written like a personal reflection, personal essay, or argumentative essay** that states a Wikipedia editor's personal feelings or presents an original argument about a topic.

Fifteen consecutive U.S. uncrewed lunar missions over a six-year period from 1958 to 1964 all failed their primary photographic missions;[14][15] however, Rangers 4 and 6 successfully repeated the Soviet lunar impacts as part of their secondary missions.[16][17]\n\n\nFailures included three U.S. attempts[9][16][18] in 1962 to hard land small seismometer packages released by the main Ranger spacecraft. These surface packages were to use retrorockets to survive landing, unlike the parent vehicle, which was designed to deliberately crash onto the surface. The final three Ranger probes performed successful high altitude lunar reconnaissance photography missions during intentional crash impacts between 2.62 and 2.68 kilometres per second (9,400 and 9,600 km/h).[19][20][21]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Launch vehicle\n | Launch date\n | Goal\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pioneer 0 | 38\n | Thor-Able | 17 August 1958\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – first stage explosion; destroyed\n |\n| Pioneer 1 | 34\n | Thor-Able\n | 11 October 1958\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – software error; reentry\n |\n| Pioneer 2 | 39\n | Thor-Able\n | 8 November 1958\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – third stage misfire; reentry\n |\n| Pioneer 3 | 6\n | Juno\n | 6 December 1958\n | Flyby\n | Failure – first stage misfire, reentry\n |\n| Pioneer 4 | 6\n | Juno\n | 3 March 1959\n | Flyby\n | Partial success – first US craft to reach escape velocity, lunar flyby too far to shoot photos due to targeting error; solar orbit\n |\n| Pioneer P-1 | 168\n | Atlas-Able\n | 24 September 1959\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – pad explosion; destroyed\n |\n| Pioneer P-3 | 168\n | Atlas-Able\n | 29 November 1959\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – payload shroud; destroyed\n |\n| Pioneer P-30 | 175\n | Atlas-Able\n | 25 September 1960\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – second stage anomaly; reentry\n |\n| Pioneer P-31 | 175\n | Atlas-Able\n | 15 December 1960\n | Lunar orbit\n | Failure – first stage explosion; destroyed\n |\n| Ranger 1 | 306\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 23 August 1961\n | Prototype test\n | Failure – upper stage anomaly; reentry\n |\n| Ranger 2 | 304\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 18 November 1961\n | Prototype test\n | Failure – upper stage anomaly; reentry\n |\n| Ranger 3 | 330\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 26 January 1962\n | Landing\n | Failure – booster guidance; solar orbit\n |\n| Ranger 4 | 331\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 23 April 1962\n | Landing\n | Partial success – first U.S. spacecraft to reach another celestial body; crash impact – no photos returned\n |\n| Ranger 5 | 342\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 18 October 1962\n | Landing\n | Failure – spacecraft power; solar orbit\n |\n| Ranger 6 | 367\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 30 January 1964\n | Impact\n | Failure – spacecraft camera; crash impact\n |\n| Ranger 7 | 367\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 28 July 1964\n | Impact\n | Success – returned 4308 photos, crash impact\n |\n| Ranger 8 | 367\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 17 February 1965\n | Impact\n | Success – returned 7137 photos, crash impact\n |\n| Ranger 9 | 367\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 21 March 1965\n | Impact\n | Success – returned 5814 photos, crash impact\n |\n\n\n### Pioneer missions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The first, a mission managed by the United States Air Force, exploded during launch; all subsequent Pioneer lunar flights had NASA as the lead management organization. The next two returned to Earth and burned up upon reentry into the atmosphere after achieved maximum altitudes of around 110,000 kilometres (68,000 mi) and 1,450 kilometres (900 mi), far short of the roughly 400,000 kilometres (250,000 mi) required to reach the vicinity of the Moon.\n\n\nNASA then collaborated with the United States Army's Ballistic Missile Agency to fly two extremely small cone-shaped probes on the Juno ICBM, carrying only photocells which would be triggered by the light of the Moon and a lunar radiation environment experiment using a Geiger-Müller tube detector. The first of these reached an altitude of only around 100,000 kilometres (62,000 mi), serendipitously gathering data that established the presence of the Van Allen radiation belts before reentering Earth's atmosphere. The second passed by the Moon at a distance of more than 60,000 kilometres (37,000 mi), twice as far as planned and too far away to trigger either of the on-board scientific instruments, yet still becoming the first U.S. spacecraft to reach a solar orbit.\n\n\nThe final Pioneer lunar probe design consisted of four \"paddlewheel\" solar panels extending from a one-meter diameter spherical spin-stabilized spacecraft body equipped to take images of the lunar surface with a television-like system, estimate the Moon's mass and topography of the poles, record the distribution and velocity of micrometeorites, study radiation, measure magnetic fields, detect low frequency electromagnetic waves in space and use a sophisticated integrated propulsion system for maneuvering and orbit insertion as well. None of the four spacecraft built in this series of probes survived launch on its Atlas ICBM outfitted with an Able upper stage.\n\n\nFollowing the unsuccessful Atlas-Able Pioneer probes, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory embarked upon an uncrewed spacecraft development program whose modular design could be used to support both lunar and interplanetary exploration missions. The interplanetary versions were known as Mariners; lunar versions were Rangers. JPL envisioned three versions of the Ranger lunar probes: Block I prototypes, which would carry various radiation detectors in test flights to a very high Earth orbit that came nowhere near the Moon; Block II, which would try to accomplish the first Moon landing by hard landing a seismometer package; and Block III, which would crash onto the lunar surface without any braking rockets while taking very high resolution wide-area photographs of the Moon during their descent.\n\n\n\n### Ranger missions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Ranger program\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The goal was to place these Block I spacecraft in a very high Earth orbit with an apogee of 110,000 kilometres (68,000 mi) and a perigee of 60,000 kilometres (37,000 mi).[22]\n\n\nFrom that vantage point, scientists could make direct measurements of the magnetosphere over a period of many months while engineers perfected new methods to routinely track and communicate with spacecraft over such large distances. Such practice was deemed vital to be assured of capturing high-bandwidth television transmissions from the Moon during a one-shot fifteen-minute time window in subsequent Block II and Block III lunar descents. Both Block I missions suffered failures of the new Agena upper stage and never left low Earth parking orbit after launch; both burned up upon reentry after only a few days.\n\n\nThe first attempts to perform a Moon landing took place in 1962 during the Rangers 3, 4 and 5 missions flown by the United States.[9][16][18] All three Block II missions basic vehicles were 3.1 m high and consisted of a lunar capsule covered with a balsa wood impact-limiter, 650 mm in diameter, a mono-propellant mid-course motor, a retrorocket with a thrust of 5,050 pounds-force (22.5 kN),[16] and a gold- and chrome-plated hexagonal base 1.5 m in diameter. This lander (code-named *Tonto*) was designed to provide impact cushioning using an exterior blanket of crushable balsa wood and an interior filled with incompressible liquid freon. A 42 kg (56 pounds) 30-centimetre-diameter (0.98 ft) metal payload sphere floated and was free to rotate in a liquid freon reservoir contained in the landing sphere.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Everything that we do ought to really be tied-in to getting onto the Moon ahead of the Russians. ...We're ready to spend reasonable amounts of money, but we're talking about fantastic expenditures which wreck our budget and all these other domestic programs, and the only justification for it, in my opinion, to do it is because we hope to beat them and demonstrate that starting behind, as we did by a couple of years, by God, we passed them.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— John F. Kennedy on the planned Moon landing, 21 November 1962[24]\n\nThis payload sphere contained six silver-cadmium batteries to power a fifty-milliwatt radio transmitter, a temperature sensitive voltage controlled oscillator to measure lunar surface temperatures, and a seismometer designed with sensitivity high enough to detect the impact of a 5 lb (2.3 kg) meteorite on the opposite side of the Moon. Weight was distributed in the payload sphere so it would rotate in its liquid blanket to place the seismometer into an upright and operational position no matter what the final resting orientation of the external landing sphere. After landing, plugs were to be opened allowing the freon to evaporate and the payload sphere to settle into upright contact with the landing sphere. The batteries were sized to allow up to three months of operation for the payload sphere. Various mission constraints limited the landing site to Oceanus Procellarum on the lunar equator, which the lander ideally would reach 66 hours after launch.\n\n\nNo cameras were carried by the Ranger landers, and no pictures were to be captured from the lunar surface during the mission. Instead, the 3.1 metres (10 ft) Ranger Block II mother ship carried a 200-scan-line television camera to capture images during the free-fall descent to the lunar surface. The camera was designed to transmit a picture every 10 seconds.[16] Seconds before impact, at 5 and 0.6 kilometres (3.11 and 0.37 mi) above the lunar surface, the Ranger mother ships took pictures (which may be viewed here).\n\n\nOther instruments gathering data before the mother ship crashed onto the Moon were a gamma ray spectrometer to measure overall lunar chemical composition and a radar altimeter. The radar altimeter was to give a signal ejecting the landing capsule and its solid-fueled braking rocket overboard from the Block II mother ship. The braking rocket was to slow and the landing sphere to a dead stop at 330 metres (1,080 ft) above the surface and separate, allowing the landing sphere to free fall once more and hit the surface.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn Ranger 3, failure of the Atlas guidance system and a software error aboard the Agena upper stage combined to put the spacecraft on a course that would miss the Moon. Attempts to salvage lunar photography during a flyby of the Moon were thwarted by in-flight failure of the onboard flight computer. This was probably because of prior heat sterilization of the spacecraft by keeping it above the boiling point of water for 24 hours on the ground, to protect the Moon from being contaminated by Earth organisms. Heat sterilization was also blamed for subsequent in-flight failures of the spacecraft computer on Ranger 4 and the power subsystem on Ranger 5. Only Ranger 4 reached the Moon in an uncontrolled crash impact on the far side of the Moon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHeat sterilization was discontinued for the final four Block III Ranger probes.[*citation needed*] These replaced the Block II landing capsule and its retrorocket with a heavier, more capable television system to support landing site selection for upcoming Apollo crewed Moon landing missions. Six cameras were designed to take thousands of high-altitude photographs in the final twenty-minute period before crashing on the lunar surface. Camera resolution was 1,132 scan lines, far higher than the 525 lines found in a typical U.S. 1964 home television. While Ranger 6 suffered a failure of this camera system and returned no photographs despite an otherwise successful flight, the subsequent Ranger 7 mission to Mare Cognitum was a complete success.\n\n\nBreaking the six-year string of failures in U.S. attempts to photograph the Moon at close range, the Ranger 7 mission was viewed as a national turning point and instrumental in allowing the key 1965 NASA budget appropriation to pass through the United States Congress intact without a reduction in funds for the Apollo crewed Moon landing program. Subsequent successes with Ranger 8 and Ranger 9 further buoyed U.S. hopes.\n\n\n\n## Soviet uncrewed soft landings (1966–1976)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Model of Luna 16 Moon soil sample return lander\n![](image)Model of Soviet Lunokhod automatic Moon rover\nThe Luna 9 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet Union, performed the first successful soft Moon landing on 3 February 1966. Airbags protected its 99 kilograms (218 lb) ejectable capsule which survived an impact speed of over 15 metres per second (54 km/h; 34 mph).[25] Luna 13 duplicated this feat with a similar Moon landing on 24 December 1966. Both returned panoramic photographs that were the first views from the lunar surface.[26]\n\n\nLuna 16 was the first robotic probe to land on the Moon and safely return a sample of lunar soil back to Earth.[27] It represented the first lunar sample return mission by the Soviet Union, and was the third lunar sample return mission overall, following the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions. This mission was later successfully repeated by Luna 20 (1972) and Luna 24 (1976).\n\n\nIn 1970 and 1973 two Lunokhod (\"Moonwalker\") robotic lunar rovers were delivered to the Moon, where they successfully operated for 10 and 4 months respectively, covering 10.5 km (Lunokhod 1) and 37 km (Lunokhod 2). These rover missions were in operation concurrently with the Zond and Luna series of Moon flyby, orbiter and landing missions.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Booster\n | Launch date\n | Goal\n | Result\n | Landing zone\n | Lat/Lon |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Luna-9 | 1580\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 31 January 1966\n | Landing\n | Success – first lunar soft landing, numerous photos\n | Oceanus Procellarum | 7.13°N 64.37°W\n |\n| Luna-13 | 1580\n | Semyorka – 8K78\n | 21 December 1966\n | Landing\n | Success – second lunar soft landing, numerous photos\n | Oceanus Procellarum | 18°52'N 62°3'W\n |\n|  |  | Proton | 19 February 1969\n | Lunar rover\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 14 June 1969\n | Sample return\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Luna-15 | 5,700\n | Proton\n | 13 July 1969\n | Sample return\n | Failure – lunar crash impact\n | Mare Crisium | unknown\n |\n| Cosmos-300\n |  | Proton\n | 23 September 1969\n | Sample return\n | Failure – stranded in low Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Cosmos-305\n |  | Proton\n | 22 October 1969\n | Sample return\n | Failure – stranded in low Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 6 February 1970\n | Sample return\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Luna-16 | 5,600\n | Proton\n | 12 September 1970\n | Sample return\n | Success – returned 0.10 kg of Moon soil back to Earth\n | Mare Fecunditatis | 000.68S 056.30E\n |\n| Luna-17 | 5,700\n | Proton\n | 10 November 1970\n | Lunar rover\n | Success – Lunokhod-1 rover traveled 10.5 km across lunar surface\n | Mare Imbrium | 038.28N 325.00E\n |\n| Luna-18 | 5,750\n | Proton\n | 2 September 1971\n | Sample return\n | Failure – lunar crash impact\n | Mare Fecunditatis\n | 003.57N 056.50E\n |\n| Luna-20 | 5,727\n | Proton\n | 14 February 1972\n | Sample return\n | Success – returned 0.05 kg of Moon soil back to Earth\n | Mare Fecunditatis\n | 003.57N 056.50E\n |\n| Luna-21 | 5,950\n | Proton\n | 8 January 1973\n | Lunar rover\n | Success – Lunokhod-2 rover traveled 37.0 km across lunar surface\n | LeMonnier Crater | 025.85N 030.45E\n |\n| Luna-23 | 5,800\n | Proton\n | 28 October 1974\n | Sample return\n | Failure – Moon landing achieved, but malfunction prevented sample return\n | Mare Crisium\n | 012.00N 062.00E\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 16 October 1975\n | Sample return\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |  |  |\n| Luna-24 | 5,800\n | Proton\n | 9 August 1976\n | Sample return\n | Success – returned 0.17 kg of Moon soil back to Earth\n | Mare Crisium\n | 012.25N 062.20E\n |\n\n\n## U.S. uncrewed soft landings (1966–1968)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Launch of Surveyor 1\n![](image)Pete Conrad, commander of Apollo 12, stands next to Surveyor 3 lander.

Five of Surveyor's seven missions made successful uncrewed Moon landings. Surveyor 3 was visited two years after its Moon landing by the crew of Apollo 12.

To the general public both countries had demonstrated roughly equal technical capabilities by returning photographic images from the surface of the Moon. These pictures provided a key affirmative answer to the crucial question of whether or not lunar soil would support upcoming crewed landers with their much greater weight.\n\n\nHowever, the Luna 9 hard landing of a ruggedized sphere using airbags at a 50-kilometre-per-hour (31 mph) ballistic impact speed had much more in common with the failed 1962 Ranger landing attempts and their planned 160-kilometre-per-hour (99 mph) impacts than with the Surveyor 1 soft landing on three footpads using its radar-controlled, adjustable-thrust retrorocket. While Luna 9 and Surveyor 1 were both major national accomplishments, only Surveyor 1 had reached its landing site employing key technologies that would be needed for a crewed flight. Thus as of mid-1966, the United States had begun to pull ahead of the Soviet Union in the so-called Space Race to land a man on the Moon.\n\n\n\n![](image)A timeline of the space race between 1957 and 1975, with missions from the US and USSR\nAdvances in other areas were necessary before crewed spacecraft could follow uncrewed ones to the surface of the Moon. Of particular importance was developing the expertise to perform flight operations in lunar orbit. Ranger, Surveyor and initial Luna Moon landing attempts all flew directly to the surface without a lunar orbit. Such direct ascents use a minimum amount of fuel for uncrewed spacecraft on a one-way trip.\n\n\nIn contrast, crewed vehicles need additional fuel after a lunar landing to enable a return trip back to Earth for the crew. Leaving this massive amount of required Earth-return fuel in lunar orbit until it is used later in the mission is far more efficient than taking such fuel down to the lunar surface in a Moon landing and then hauling it all back into space yet again, working against lunar gravity both ways. Such considerations lead logically to a lunar orbit rendezvous mission profile for a crewed Moon landing.\n\n\nAccordingly, beginning in mid-1966 both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. naturally progressed into missions featuring lunar orbit as a prerequisite to a crewed Moon landing. The primary goals of these initial uncrewed orbiters were extensive photographic mapping of the entire lunar surface for the selection of crewed landing sites and, for the Soviets, the checkout of radio communications gear that would be used in future soft landings.\n\n\nAn unexpected major discovery from initial lunar orbiters were vast volumes of dense materials beneath the surface of the Moon's maria. Such mass concentrations (\"mascons\") can send a crewed mission dangerously off course in the final minutes of a Moon landing when aiming for a relatively small landing zone that is smooth and safe. Mascons were also found over a longer period of time to greatly disturb the orbits of low-altitude satellites around the Moon, making their orbits unstable and forcing an inevitable crash on the lunar surface in the relatively short period of months to a few years.\n\n\nControlling the location of impact for spent lunar orbiters can have scientific value. For example, in 1999 the NASA Lunar Prospector orbiter was deliberately targeted to impact a permanently shadowed area of Shoemaker Crater near the lunar south pole. It was hoped that energy from the impact would vaporize suspected shadowed ice deposits in the crater and liberate a water vapor plume detectable from Earth. No such plume was observed. However, a small vial of ashes from the body of pioneer lunar scientist Eugene Shoemaker was delivered by the Lunar Prospector to the crater named in his honor – currently[*when?*] the only human remains on the Moon.\n\n\n\n## Soviet lunar orbit satellites (1966–1974)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| U.S.S.R. mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Booster\n | Launched\n | Mission goal\n | Mission result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cosmos – 111\n |  | Molniya-M | 1 March 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Failure – stranded in low Earth orbit\n |\n| Luna-10 | 1,582\n | Molniya-M\n | 31 March 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 2,738 km x 2,088 km x 72 deg orbit, 178 m period, 60-day science mission\n |\n| Luna-11 | 1,640\n | Molniya-M\n | 24 August 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 2,931 km x 1,898 km x 27 deg orbit, 178 m period, 38-day science mission\n |\n| Luna-12 | 1,620\n | Molniya-M\n | 22 October 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 2,938 km x 1,871 km x 10 deg orbit, 205 m period, 89-day science mission\n |\n| Cosmos-159\n | 1,700\n | Molniya-M\n | 17 May 1967\n | Prototype test\n | Success – high Earth orbit crewed landing communications gear radio calibration test\n |\n|  |  | Molniya-M\n | 7 February 1968\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit – attempted radio calibration test?\n |\n| Luna-14 | 1,700\n | Molniya-M\n | 7 April 1968\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 870 km x 160 km x 42 deg orbit, 160 m period, unstable orbit, radio calibration test?\n |\n| Luna-19 | 5,700\n | Proton | 28 September 1971\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 140 km x 140 km x 41 deg orbit, 121 m period, 388-day science mission\n |\n| Luna-22 | 5,700\n | Proton\n | 29 May 1974\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 222 km x 219 km x 19 deg orbit, 130 m period, 521-day science mission\n |\n\n\nLuna 10 became the first spacecraft to orbit the Moon on 3 April 1966.\n\n\n\n## U.S. lunar orbit satellites (1966–1967)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| U.S. mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Booster\n | Launched\n | Mission goal\n | Mission result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lunar Orbiter 1 | 386\n | Atlas – Agena | 10 August 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 1,160 km X 189 km x 12 deg orbit, 208 m period, 80-day photography mission\n |\n| Lunar Orbiter 2 | 386\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 6 November 1966\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 1,860 km X 52 km x 12 deg orbit, 208 m period, 339-day photography mission\n |\n| Lunar Orbiter 3 | 386\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 5 February 1967\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 1,860 km X 52 km x 21 deg orbit, 208 m period, 246-day photography mission\n |\n| Lunar Orbiter 4 | 386\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 4 May 1967\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 6,111 km X 2,706 km x 86 deg orbit, 721 m period, 180-day photography mission\n |\n| Lunar Orbiter 5 | 386\n | Atlas – Agena\n | 1 August 1967\n | Lunar orbiter\n | Success – 6,023 km X 195 km x 85 deg orbit, 510 m period, 183-day photography mission\n |\n\n\n## Soviet circumlunar loop flights (1967–1970)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Soviet crewed lunar programs\n\nIt is possible to aim a spacecraft from Earth so it will loop around the Moon and return to Earth without entering lunar orbit, following the so-called free return trajectory. Such circumlunar loop missions are simpler than lunar orbit missions because rockets for lunar orbit braking and Earth return are not required. However, a crewed circumlunar loop trip poses significant challenges beyond those found in a crewed low-Earth-orbit mission, offering valuable lessons in preparation for a crewed Moon landing. Foremost among these are mastering the demands of re-entering the Earth's atmosphere upon returning from the Moon.\n\n\nInhabited Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle return to Earth from speeds of around 7,500 m/s (27,000 km/h). Due to the effects of gravity, a vehicle returning from the Moon hits Earth's atmosphere at a much higher speed of around 11,000 m/s (40,000 km/h). The g-loading on astronauts during the resulting deceleration can be at the limits of human endurance even during a nominal reentry. Slight variations in the vehicle flight path and reentry angle during a return from the Moon can easily result in fatal levels of deceleration force.\n\n\nAchieving a crewed circumlunar loop flight prior to a crewed lunar landing became a primary goal of the Soviets with their Zond spacecraft program. The first three Zonds were robotic planetary probes; after that, the Zond name was transferred to a completely separate human spaceflight program. The initial focus of these later Zonds was extensive testing of required high-speed reentry techniques. This focus was not shared by the U.S., who chose instead to bypass the stepping stone of a crewed circumlunar loop mission and never developed a separate spacecraft for this purpose.\n\n\nInitial crewed spaceflights in the early 1960s placed a single person in low Earth orbit during the Soviet Vostok and U.S. Mercury programs. A two-flight extension of the Vostok program known as Voskhod effectively used Vostok capsules with their ejection seats removed to achieve Soviet space firsts of multiple person crews in 1964 and spacewalks in early 1965. These capabilities were later demonstrated by the U.S. in ten Gemini low Earth orbit missions throughout 1965 and 1966, using a totally new second-generation spacecraft design that had little in common with the earlier Mercury. These Gemini missions went on to prove techniques for orbital rendezvous and docking crucial to a crewed lunar landing mission profile.\n\n\nAfter the end of the Gemini program, the Soviet Union began flying their second-generation Zond crewed spacecraft in 1967 with the ultimate goal of looping a cosmonaut around the Moon and returning him or her immediately to Earth. The Zond spacecraft was launched with the simpler and already operational Proton launch rocket, unlike the parallel Soviet human Moon landing effort also underway at the time based on third-generation Soyuz spacecraft requiring development of the advanced N-1 booster. The Soviets thus believed they could achieve a crewed Zond circumlunar flight years before a U.S. human lunar landing and so score a propaganda victory. However, significant development problems delayed the Zond program and the success of the U.S. Apollo lunar landing program led to the eventual termination of the Zond effort.\n\n\nLike Zond, Apollo flights were generally launched on a free return trajectory that would return them to Earth via a circumlunar loop if a service module malfunction failed to place them in lunar orbit. This option was implemented after an explosion aboard the Apollo 13 mission in 1970, which is the only crewed circumlunar loop mission flown to date.[*when?*]\n\n\n\n\n\n| U.S.S.R mission\n | Mass (kg)\n | Booster\n | Launched\n | Mission goal\n | Payload\n | Mission result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cosmos-146 | 5,400\n | Proton | 10 March 1967\n | High Earth Orbit\n | uncrewed\n | Partial success – Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n |\n| Cosmos-154 | 5,400\n | Proton\n | 8 April 1967\n | High Earth Orbit\n | uncrewed\n | Partial success – Successfully reached high Earth orbit, but became stranded and was unable to initiate controlled high speed atmospheric reentry test\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 28 September 1967\n | High Earth Orbit\n | uncrewed\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 22 November 1967\n | High Earth Orbit\n | uncrewed\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n| Zond-4 | 5,140\n | Proton\n | 2 March 1968\n | High Earth Orbit\n | uncrewed\n | Partial success – launched successfully to 300,000 km high Earth orbit, high speed reentry test guidance malfunction, intentional self-destruct to prevent landfall outside Soviet Union\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 23 April 1968\n | Circumlunar Loop\n | non-human biological payload\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit; launch preparation tank explosion kills three in pad crew\n |\n| Zond-5 | 5,375\n | Proton\n | 15 September 1968\n | Circumlunar Loop\n | non-human biological payload\n | Success – looped around Moon with Earth's first near-lunar life forms, two tortoises and other live biological specimens, and the capsule and payload safely to Earth despite landing off-target outside the Soviet Union in the Indian Ocean\n |\n| Zond-6 | 5,375\n | Proton\n | 10 November 1968\n | Circumlunar Loop\n | non-human biological payload\n | Partial success – looped around Moon, successful reentry, but loss of cabin air pressure caused biological payload death, parachute system malfunction and severe vehicle damage upon landing\n |\n|  |  | Proton\n | 20 January 1969\n | Circumlunar Loop\n | non-human biological payload\n | Failure – booster malfunction, failed to reach Earth orbit\n |\n| Zond-7 | 5,979\n | Proton\n | 8 August 1969\n | Circumlunar Loop\n | non-human biological payload\n | Success – looped around Moon, returned biological payload safely to Earth and landed on-target inside Soviet Union.

Despite the failure suffered in its final moments, the Zond 6 mission was reported by Soviet media as being a success as well. Although hailed worldwide as remarkable achievements, both these Zond missions flew off-nominal reentry trajectories resulting in deceleration forces that would have been fatal to humans.\n\n\nAs a result, the Soviets secretly planned to continue uncrewed Zond tests until their reliability to support human flight had been demonstrated. However, due to NASA's continuing problems with the lunar module, and because of CIA reports of a potential Soviet crewed circumlunar flight in late 1968, NASA fatefully changed the flight plan of Apollo 8 from an Earth-orbit lunar module test to a lunar orbit mission scheduled for late December 1968.\n\n\nIn early December 1968 the launch window to the Moon opened for the Soviet launch site in Baikonur, giving the USSR their final chance to beat the US to the Moon. Cosmonauts went on alert and asked to fly the Zond spacecraft then in final countdown at Baikonur on the first human trip to the Moon. Ultimately, however, the Soviet Politburo decided the risk of crew death was unacceptable given the combined poor performance to that point of Zond/Proton and so scrubbed the launch of a crewed Soviet lunar mission. Their decision proved to be a wise one, since this unnumbered Zond mission was destroyed in another uncrewed test when it was finally launched several weeks later.\n\n\nBy this time flights of the third generation U.S. Apollo spacecraft had begun. Far more capable than the Zond, the Apollo spacecraft had the necessary rocket power to slip into and out of lunar orbit and to make course adjustments required for a safe reentry during the return to Earth. The Apollo 8 mission carried out the first human trip to the Moon on 24 December 1968, certifying the Saturn V booster for crewed use and flying not a circumlunar loop but instead a full ten orbits around the Moon before returning safely to Earth. Apollo 10 then performed a full dress rehearsal of a crewed Moon landing in May 1969. This mission orbited within 47,400 feet (14.4 km) of the lunar surface, performing necessary low-altitude mapping of trajectory-altering mascons using a factory prototype lunar module too heavy to land. With the failure of the robotic Soviet sample return Moon landing attempt Luna 15 in July 1969, the stage was set for Apollo 11.\n\n\n\n## Human Moon landings (1969–1972)[edit]\n\n\n### US strategy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apollo program § Political pressure builds\n\n![](image)The U.S. Saturn V and the Soviet N1\nPlans for human Moon exploration began during the Eisenhower administration. In a series of mid-1950s articles in *Collier's* magazine, Wernher von Braun had popularized the idea of a crewed expedition to establish a lunar base. A human Moon landing posed several daunting technical challenges to the US and USSR. Besides guidance and weight management, atmospheric re-entry without ablative overheating was a major hurdle. After the Soviets launched Sputnik, von Braun promoted a plan for the US Army to establish a military lunar outpost by 1965.\n\n\nAfter the early Soviet successes, especially Yuri Gagarin's flight, US President John F. Kennedy looked for a project that would capture the public imagination. He asked Vice President Lyndon Johnson to make recommendations on a scientific endeavor that would prove US world leadership. The proposals included non-space options such as massive irrigation projects to benefit the Third World. The Soviets, at the time, had more powerful rockets than the US, which gave them an advantage in some kinds of space mission.\n\n\nAdvances in US nuclear weapon technology had led to smaller, lighter warheads; the Soviets' were much heavier, and the powerful R-7 rocket was developed to carry them. More modest missions such as flying around the Moon, or a space lab in lunar orbit (both were proposed by Kennedy to von Braun), offered too much advantage to the Soviets; *landing*, however, would capture the world's imagination.\n\n\n\n![](image)Apollo landing sites\nJohnson had championed the US human spaceflight program ever since Sputnik, sponsoring legislation to create NASA while he was still a senator. When Kennedy asked him in 1961 to research the best achievement to counter the Soviets' lead, Johnson responded that the US had an even chance of beating them to a crewed lunar landing, but not for anything less. Kennedy seized on Apollo as the ideal focus for efforts in space. He ensured continuing funding, shielding space spending from the 1963 tax cut, but diverting money from other NASA scientific projects. These diversions dismayed NASA's leader, James E. Webb, who perceived the need for NASA's support from the scientific community.\n\n\nThe Moon landing required development of the large Saturn V launch vehicle, which achieved a perfect record: zero catastrophic failures or launch vehicle-caused mission failures in thirteen launches.\n\n\nFor the program to succeed, its proponents would have to defeat criticism from politicians both on the left (more money for social programs) and on the right (more money for the military). By emphasizing the scientific payoff and playing on fears of Soviet space dominance, Kennedy and Johnson managed to swing public opinion: by 1965, 58 percent of Americans favored Apollo, up from 33 percent two years earlier. After Johnson became President in 1963, his continuing defense of the program allowed it to succeed in 1969, as Kennedy had planned.\n\n\n\n### Soviet strategy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Soviet Moonshot\n\nSoviet leader Nikita Khrushchev said in October 1963 the USSR was \"not at present planning flight by cosmonauts to the Moon,\" while insisting that the Soviets had not dropped out of the race. Only after another year did the USSR fully commit itself to a Moon-landing attempt, which ultimately failed.\n\n\nAt the same time, Kennedy had suggested various joint programs, including a possible Moon landing by Soviet and U.S. astronauts and the development of better weather-monitoring satellites, eventually resulting in the Apollo-Soyuz mission. Khrushchev, sensing an attempt by Kennedy to steal Russian space technology, rejected the idea at first: if the USSR went to the Moon, it would go alone. Though Khrushchev was eventually warming up to the idea, the realization of a joint Moon landing was choked by Kennedy's assassination.[28]\n\n\nSergey Korolev, the Soviet space program's chief designer, had started promoting his Soyuz craft and the N1 launcher rocket that would have the capability of carrying out a human Moon landing. Khrushchev directed Korolev's design bureau to arrange further space firsts by modifying the existing Vostok technology, while a second team started building a completely new launcher and craft, the Proton booster and the Zond, for a human cislunar flight in 1966. In 1964 the new Soviet leadership gave Korolev the backing for a Moon landing effort and brought all crewed projects under his direction.\n\n\nWith Korolev's death and the failure of the first Soyuz flight in 1967, coordination of the Soviet Moon landing program quickly unraveled. The Soviets built a landing craft and selected cosmonauts for a mission that would have placed Alexei Leonov on the Moon's surface, but with the successive launch failures of the N1 booster in 1969, plans for a crewed landing suffered first delay and then cancellation.\n\n\nA program of automated return vehicles was begun, in the hope of being the first to return lunar rocks. This had several failures. It eventually succeeded with Luna 16 in 1970.[29] But this had little impact, because the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 lunar landings and rock returns had already taken place by then.\n\n\n\n### Apollo missions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, Lunar Module pilot of the first lunar landing mission, poses for a photograph beside the deployed United States flag during an Apollo 11 Extravehicular Activity (EVA) on the lunar surface.\nIn total, twenty-four U.S. astronauts have traveled to the Moon. Three have made the trip twice, and twelve have walked on its surface. Apollo 8 was a lunar-orbit-only mission, Apollo 10 included undocking and Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI), followed by LM staging to CSM redocking, while Apollo 13, originally scheduled as a landing, ended up as a lunar fly-by, by means of free return trajectory; thus, none of these missions made landings. Apollo 7 and Apollo 9 were Earth-orbit-only missions. Apart from the inherent dangers of crewed Moon expeditions as seen with Apollo 13, one reason for their cessation according to astronaut Alan Bean is the cost it imposes in government subsidies.[30]\n\n\n\n### Human Moon landings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Mission name\n | Lunar lander\n | Lunar landing date\n | Lunar liftoff date\n | Lunar landing site\n | Duration on lunar surface (DD:HH:MM)\n | Crew\n | Number of EVAs | Total EVA Time (HH:MM)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Apollo 11 | *Eagle* | 20 July 1969\n | 21 July 1969\n | Sea of Tranquility | 0:21:31\n | Neil Armstrong, Edwin \"Buzz\" Aldrin | 1\n | 2:31\n |\n| Apollo 12 | *Intrepid* | 19 November 1969\n | 21 November 1969\n | Ocean of Storms | 1:07:31\n | Charles \"Pete\" Conrad, Alan Bean | 2\n | 7:45\n |\n| Apollo 14 | *Antares* | 5 February 1971\n | 6 February 1971\n | Fra Mauro | 1:09:30\n | Alan B.

Apollo 11 was the first of six Apollo program lunar landings.\nPresident Richard Nixon had speechwriter William Safire prepare a condolence speech for delivery in case Armstrong and Aldrin became marooned on the Moon's surface and could not be rescued.[31]\n\n\nIn 1951, science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke forecast that a man would reach the Moon by 1978.[32]\n\n\nOn 16 August 2006, the Associated Press reported that NASA is missing the original Slow-scan television tapes (which were made before the scan conversion for conventional TV) of the Apollo 11 Moon walk. Some news outlets have mistakenly reported the SSTV tapes found in Western Australia, but those tapes were only recordings of data from the Apollo 11 Early Apollo Surface Experiments Package.[33] The tapes were found in 2008 and sold at auction in 2019 for the 50th anniversary of the landing.[34]\n\n\nScientists believe the six American flags planted by astronauts have been bleached white because of more than 40 years of exposure to solar radiation.[35] Using LROC images, it has been determined that five of the six American flags are still standing and casting shadows at all of the sites, except Apollo 11.[36] Astronaut Buzz Aldrin reported that the flag was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent engine during liftoff of Apollo 11.[36]\n\n\n\n## Late 20th century–Early 21st century uncrewed crash landings[edit]\n\n\n### Hiten (Japan)[edit]\n\n\nLaunched on 24 January 1990, 11:46 UTC. At the end of its mission, the Japanese lunar orbiter Hiten was commanded to crash into the lunar surface and did so on 10 April 1993 at 18:03:25.7 UT (11 April 03:03:25.7 JST).[37]\n\n\n\n### Lunar Prospector (US)[edit]\n\n\nLunar Prospector was launched on 7 January 1998. The mission ended on 31 July 1999, when the orbiter was deliberately crashed into a crater near the lunar south pole after the presence of water ice was successfully detected.[38]\n\n\n\n### SMART-1 (ESA)[edit]\n\n\nLaunched 27 September 2003, 23:14 UTC from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana. At the end of its mission, the ESA lunar orbiter SMART-1 performed a controlled crash into the Moon, at about 2 km/s. The time of the crash was 3 September 2006, at 5:42 UTC.[39]\n\n\n\n### Chandrayaan-1 (India)[edit]\n\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) performed a controlled hard landing with its Moon Impact Probe (MIP). The MIP was ejected from the Chandrayaan-1 lunar orbiter and performed remote sensing experiments during its descent to the lunar surface. It impacted near Shackleton crater at the south pole of the lunar surface at 14 November 2008, 20:31 IST. \n\n\nChandrayaan-1 was launched on 22 October 2008, 00:52 UTC.[40]\n\n\n\n### Chang'e 1 (China)[edit]\n\n\nThe Chinese lunar orbiter Chang'e 1, executed a controlled crash onto the surface of the Moon on 1 March 2009, 20:44 GMT, after a 16-month mission. Chang'e 1 was launched on 24 October 2007, 10:05 UTC.[41]\n\n\n\n### SELENE (Japan)[edit]\n\n\nSELENE or *Kaguya* after successfully orbiting the Moon for a year and eight months, the main orbiter was instructed to impact on the lunar surface near the crater Gill at 18:25 UTC on 10 June 2009.[42] SELENE or *Kaguya* was launched on 14 September 2007.\n\n\n\n### LCROSS (US)[edit]\n\n\nThe LCROSS data collecting shepherding spacecraft was launched together with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) on 18 June 2009 on board an Atlas V rocket with a Centaur upper stage. On 9 October 2009, at 11:31 UTC, the Centaur upper stage impacted the lunar surface, releasing the kinetic energy equivalent of detonating approximately 2 tons of TNT (8.86 GJ).[43] Six minutes later at 11:37 UTC, the LCROSS shepherding spacecraft also impacted the surface.[44]\n\n\n\n### GRAIL (US)[edit]\n\n\nThe GRAIL mission consisted of two small spacecraft: GRAIL A (*Ebb*), and GRAIL B (*Flow*). They were launched on 10 September 2011 on board a Delta II rocket. GRAIL A separated from the rocket about nine minutes after launch, and GRAIL B followed about eight minutes later.[45][46] The first probe entered orbit on 31 December 2011 and the second followed on 1 January 2012.[47] The two spacecraft impacted the Lunar surface on 17 December 2012.[48]\n\n\n\n### LADEE (US)[edit]\n\n\nLADEE was launched on 7 September 2013.[49] The mission ended on 18 April 2014, when the spacecraft's controllers intentionally crashed LADEE into the far side of the Moon,[50][51] which, later, was determined to be near the eastern rim of Sundman V crater.[52][53]\n\n\n\n### Manfred Memorial Moon Mission (Luxemburg)[edit]\n\n\nThe Manfred Memorial Moon Mission was launched on the 23 October 2014. It conducted a lunar flyby and operated for 19 days which was four times longer than expected. The Manfred Memorial Moon Mission remained attached to the upper stage of its launch vehicle (CZ-3C/E). The spacecraft along with its upper stage impacted the Moon on 4 March 2022.[54][55][56]\n\n\n\n## 21st century uncrewed soft landings and attempts[edit]\n\n\n### Chang'e 3 (China)[edit]\n\n\n![Yutu rover on lunar surface](image)Yutu rover on lunar surface\nOn 14 December 2013 at 13:12 UTC[57] Chang'e 3 soft-landed a rover on the Moon. This was China's first soft landing on another celestial body and world's first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 on 22 August 1976.[58] The mission was launched on 1 December 2013. After successful landing, the lander release the Yutu rover, which moved 114 meters before being immobilized due to system malfunction. But the rover was still operational until July 2016.[59]\n\n\n\n### Chang'e 4 (China)[edit]\n\n\n![Chang'e 4 lander on the surface of far side of the Moon.](image)Chinese Chang'e 4 lander on the surface of far side of the Moon\n![Yutu-2 rover deployed by Chang'e 4 lander.](image)*Yutu-2* rover deployed by Chang'e 4 lander\nOn 3 January 2019 at 2:26 UTC Chang'e 4 became the first spacecraft to land on the far side of the Moon.[60] Chang'e 4 was originally designed as the backup of Chang'e 3. It was later adjusted as a mission to the far side of the Moon after the success of Chang'e 3.[61] After making a successful landing within Von Kármán crater, the Chang'e 4 lander deployed the 140kg Yutu-2 rover and began human's very first close exploration of the far side of the Moon. Because the Moon blocks the communications between far side and Earth, a relay satellite, Queqiao, was launched to the Earth–Moon L2 Lagrangian point a few months prior to the landing to enable communications.\n\n\n*Yutu-2*, the second lunar rover from China, was equipped with panoramic camera, lunar penetrating radar, visible and near-infrared Imaging spectrometer and advanced small analyzer for neutrals. As of July 2022, it has survived more than 1000 days on the lunar surface and is still driving with cumulative travel distance of over 1200 meters.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### *Beresheet* (Israel/SpaceIL)[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 February 2019, Israeli private space agency SpaceIL launched their spacecraft *Beresheet* on a Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral, Florida with the intention of achieving a soft landing. SpaceIL lost contact with the spacecraft during final descent on 11 April 2019, and it crashed as a result of a main engine failure.\n\n\nThe mission was the first Israeli, and the first privately funded, lunar landing attempt.[64] Despite the failure, the mission represents the closest a private entity has come to a soft lunar landing.[65]\n\n\nSpaceIL was originally conceived in 2011 as a venture to pursue the Google Lunar X Prize. The *Beresheet* lunar lander's target landing destination was within Mare Serenitatis, a vast volcanic basin on the Moon's northern near side.\n\n\n\n### Chandrayaan 2 (India)[edit]\n\n\nISRO, the Indian National Space agency, launched Chandrayaan 2 on 22 July 2019.[66][67] It had three major modules: orbiter, lander and rover. Each of these modules had scientific instruments from scientific research institutes in India and the US.[68] On 7 September 2019 contact was lost with the *Vikram* lander at an altitude of 2.1 km (1.3 mi) after a rough braking phase.[69] *Vikram* was later confirmed to have crashed and been destroyed.\n\n\n\n### Chang'e 5 (China)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Chang'e 5 returner carrying lunar sample was transported back to CAST.\nOn 6 December 2020 at 21:42 UTC Chang'e 5 landed and collected the first lunar soil samples in over 40 years, and then returned the samples to Earth. The 8.2t stack consisting of lander, ascender, orbiter and returner was launched to lunar orbit by a Long March 5 rocket on November 24. The lander-ascender combination was separated with the orbiter and returner before landing near Mons Rümker in Oceanus Procellarum. The ascender was later launched back to lunar orbit, carrying samples collected by the lander, and completed the first-ever robotic rendezvous and docking in lunar orbit.[70][71] The sample container was then transferred to the returner, which successfully landed on Inner Mongolia on 16 December 2020, completing China's first extraterrestrial sample return mission.[72]\n\n\n\n### Luna 25 (Russia)[edit]\n\n\nIn Russia's first attempt to reach the Moon since 1976, and since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Luna 25 spacecraft failed during \"pre-landing\" maneuvers, and crashed into the lunar surface on August 19, 2023.[73]\n\n\n\n### Chandrayaan 3 (India)[edit]\n\n\n![Vikram lander of Chandrayaan-3 near lunar south pole](image)Vikram lander of Chandrayaan-3 near lunar south pole\nIndia's national space agency ISRO launched Chandrayaan-3 on 14 July 2023. Chandrayaan-3 consists of an Indigenous Lander Module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and the *Pragyan* rover. The lander with the rover successfully landed near the lunar south pole at 18:04 IST on 23 August 2023.[74][75]\n\n\n\n## Landings on moons of other Solar System bodies[edit]\n\n\n21st century progress in space exploration has broadened the phrase *moon landing* to include other moons in the Solar System. The *Huygens* probe of the *Cassini–Huygens* mission to Saturn performed a successful moon landing on Titan in 2005. Similarly, the Soviet probe Phobos 2 came within 120 mi (190 km) of performing a landing on Mars' moon Phobos in 1989 before radio contact with that lander was suddenly lost. A similar Russian sample return mission called Fobos-Grunt (\"grunt\" means \"soil\" in Russian) launched in November 2011, but stalled in low Earth orbit. There is widespread interest in performing a future landing on Jupiter's moon Europa to drill down and explore the possible liquid water ocean beneath its icy surface.[76]\n\n\n\n## Proposed future missions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Future missions\n\nThe Lunar Polar Exploration Mission is a robotic space mission concept by ISRO and Japan's space agency JAXA[77][78] that would send a lunar rover and lander to explore south pole region of the Moon in 2025.[79][80] JAXA is likely to provide launch service using the future H3 rocket, along with responsibility for the rover. ISRO would be responsible for the lander.[78][81]\n\n\nOn 11 December 2017, US President Donald Trump signed Space Policy Directive 1, which directed NASA to return to the Moon with a crewed mission, for \"long-term exploration and use\" and missions to other planets.[82] On 26 March 2019, Vice President Mike Pence formally announced that the mission will include the first female lunar astronaut.[83] The Artemis program intends to land a crewed mission on the Moon in 2024, and to begin sustained operations by 2028, supported by a planned Lunar Gateway.[84]\n\n\nThe Chinese Lunar Exploration Program plans 3 additional \"Chang'e\" uncrewed missions between 2025 and 2028, in active preparation for the International Lunar Research Station it plans to construct with Russia, Venezuela, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates in the 2030's. In addition, the China Manned Space Agency intends to conduct crewed lunar landings by 2029 or 2030; in preparation for this effort, the various Chinese space agencies and contractors are currently developing a human-rated super-heavy launch vehicle (the Long March 10), a new crewed lunar spacecraft, and a crewed lunar lander.[85]\n\n\nRussia's Roscosmos haș announced plans to launch a lunar polar orbiter as Luna 26, in 2027.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Apollo astronauts\n* Lunar Escape Systems\n* Robert Goddard\n* Soyuz 7K-L1\n* First on the Moon (disambiguation)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Manned Space Chronology: Apollo\\_11\". spaceline.org.

Alongside the atheist majority of 60%, there were sizable minorities of Russian Orthodox Christians (approximately 20%) and Muslims (approximately 15%).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Revolution and Civil war, 1917 - 1923[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of the Soviet Union in 1926\nDuring the Russian Revolution and Civil War period, Russia lost territories of the former Russian Empire, whose populations totalled about 30 million people (Poland: 18 million; Finland: 3 million; Romania: 3 million; the Baltic states: 5 million, Kars: 400 thousand). At least 2 million citizens of the former Russian Empire died during the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, and a further 1 to 2 million emigrated.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Interwar period, 1924 to 1940[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of the Soviet Union in 1939\n### Great Patriotic War, 1941 - 1945[edit]\n\n\nPopulation pyramid before and after the Second World War\n![](image)\n1941\n![](image)\n1946\n\nDuring the Second World War on the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union lost an approximate 26.6 million people.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Rejuvenation of the population, 1946 - 1960s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of the Soviet Union in 1950\nAfter the Second World War, the population of the Soviet Union began to gradually recover to pre-war levels. By 1959 there were a registered 209,035,000 people, over the 1941 population count of 196,716,000. In 1958-59, Soviet fertility stood at around 2.8 children per woman.[1]\n\n\n\n### Population dynamics in the 1970s - 1980s[edit]\n\n\nThe crude birth rate in the Soviet Union throughout its history had been decreasing - from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, mostly due to urbanization and rising average age of marriages. The total fertility rate fell from 2.4 in 1969-70 to 2.3 in 1978-79.[2] The crude death rate had been gradually decreasing as well - from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974.[3] While death rates did not differ greatly across regions of the Soviet Union through much of Soviet history, birth rates in the southern republics of Transcaucasia and Central Asia were much higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post-World War II period. This was partly due to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally early marriages in southern republics.[3]\n\n\nMainly as a result of differential birthrates, with most of the European nationalities moving toward sub-replacement fertility and the Central Asian and other nationalities of southern republics having well-above replacement-level fertility, the percentage of the population who were ethnic Russians was gradually being reduced. According to some Western predictions made in the 1990s, if the Soviet Union had stayed together, it is likely that ethnic Russians would have lost their majority status in the 2000s (decade).[4] This differential could not be offset by assimilation of non-Russians by Russians, in part because the nationalities of southern republics maintained a distinct ethnic consciousness and were not easily assimilated.\n\n\nThe late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a dramatic reversal of the path of declining mortality in the Soviet Union, and was especially notable among men in working ages, and also especially in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country.[5] While not unique to the Soviet Union (Hungary in particular showed a pattern that was similar to Russia), this male mortality increase, accompanied by a noticeable increase in infant mortality rates in the early 1970s, drew the attention of Western demographers and Sovietologists at the time.[6]\n\n\nAn analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, the situation for adult mortality began to improve again.[7] Referring to data for the two decades ending in 1989–1990, while noting some abatement in adult mortality rates in the Soviet republics in the 1980s, Ward Kingkade and Eduardo Arriaga characterized this situation as follows: \"All the former Soviet countries have followed the universal tendency for mortality to decline as infectious diseases are brought under control while death rates from degenerative diseases rise. What is exceptional in the former Soviet countries and some of their East European neighbors is that a subsequent increase in mortality from causes other than infectious disease has brought about overall rises in mortality from all causes combined. Another distinctive characteristic of the former Soviet case is the presence of unusually high levels of mortality from accidents and other external causes, which are typically associated with alcoholism.\"[8]\n\n\nThe rising infant mortality rates in the Soviet Union in the 1970s became the subject of much discussion and debate among Western demographers. The infant mortality rate (IMR) had increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise in infant mortality as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services.[9] Others regarded it as largely an artifact of improved reporting of infant deaths, and found the increases to be concentrated in the Central Asian republics where improvement in coverage and reporting of births and deaths might well have the greatest effect on increasing the published rates.[10]\n\n\nThe rising reported adult mortality and infant mortality was not explained or defended by Soviet officials at the time. Instead, they simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late 1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real and artificial aspects of the reported mortality increases. When these researchers began to report their findings, they accepted the increases in adult male mortality as real and focused their research on explaining its causes and finding solutions.[11] In contrast, investigations of the rise in reported infant mortality concluded that while the reported increases in the IMR were largely an artifact of improved reporting of infant deaths in the Central Asian republics, the actual levels in this region were much higher than had yet been reported officially.[12] In this sense, the reported *rise* in infant mortality in the Soviet Union as a whole was an artifact of improved statistical reporting, but reflected the reality of a much higher actual infant mortality *level* than had previously been recognized in official statistics.\n\n\nAs the detailed data series that was ultimately published in the late 1980s showed, the reported IMR for the Soviet Union as a whole increased from 24.7 in 1970 to a peak of 31.4 in 1976. After that the IMR gradually decreased and by 1989 it had fallen to 22.7, which was lower than had been reported in any previous year (though close to the figure of 22.9 in 1971).[13] In 1989, the IMR ranged from a low of 11.1 in the Latvian SSR to a high of 54.7 in the Turkmen SSR.[14]\n\n\nResearch conducted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union revealed that the originally reported mortality rates vary substantially underestimated the actual rates, especially for infant mortality. This has been shown for Transcaucasian and Central Asian republics.[15][16]\n\n\nAfter two decades of declining and stagnating fertility rates, the Soviet TFR rose from 2.27 in 1978-79 to 2.51 in 1986-87. Most Muslim areas of the USSR continued to fall, while non-Muslim regions rose slightly.[17]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of the Soviet Union\n\n![](image)Demographics of Soviet Union, Data of Andreev, E.M., *et al.*, *Naselenie Sovetskogo Soiuza, 1922-1991*.

At least 2 million citizens of the former Russian Empire died in the course of the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, and a further 1 to 2 million emigrated.

Maris, Mongols, Nenetses, Ossetians, Roma, Romanians, Tats, Tuvans, Udmurts, and Yakuts. Dozens of these other ethnic groups were the titular nations of different Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics or Autonomous Oblasts within the union-level republics (ex. Tatars in Tatar ASSR within the RSFSR, Abkhaz ASSR within Georgia) or had been previously (Volga German ASSR, Crimean ASSR).\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\nThroughout its entire history, ethnic Russians made up a majority of Soviet citizens. According to the 1939 census, Russians reached a peak of 58.4% of the population.[32] Previously in 1926, Russians were 52.9% of the population. This could be due to the decrease of Ukrainians, which coincides with the Holodomor. \n\n\nSince 1939, the percentage of ethnic Russians in the USSR began to decrease. By 1959, 54.6% of Soviet citizens were recorded as ethnic Russians. At first, this was due to the incorporation of new territories westward in Europe after World War II, such as the Polish Eastern Borderlands, the Baltic states, Carpathian Ruthenia, and Bessarabia. This resulted in an increase of non-Russian ethnic groups, especially those who were Belarusian, Ukrainian, Polish, Moldovan, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. However, starting in the 1960s, the decline of the Russian majority was mainly driven by indigenous ethnic groups residing in the Caucasian and Central Asian Soviet republics. For example, the five main Central Asian groups, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, and Turkmens, together saw a 163.81% increase from 1959 to 1989. Azerbaijanis, the largest Muslim group in the Soviet Caucasus, grew from 2.9 million people to almost 6.8 million during the same time, which represents a 130.31% increase. Meanwhile, ethnic Russians increased by only 27.20%. When the 1989 census was released, ethnic Russians made up just 50.8% of the population and were projected to become a minority within the next decade. \n\n\nThe rise of non-Russians, especially Soviet Muslims from the Caucasus and Central Asia can be explained by analysing the different patterns of total fertility rates among ethnic groups. According to research professors Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, Soviet fertility was both high and low. The national rate stood at 2.8 children per woman in 1958-59 before falling to 2.4 in 1969-70 and 2.3 in 1978-79.[33] The total fertility for ethnic Russian women within the RSFSR declined from 2.4 to 1.8 in the late 1960s and 1970s. The same trend could be found in the Baltic and Western regions of the USSR, which each of the Soviet republics' titular nationality approaching sub-replacement fertility. Caucasian ethnic groups, such as Armenians and Georgians followed the same trend, but on average had more children than Soviet citizens living in Russia, the Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova. Overall, the mentioned ethnicities had an average total fertility rate between 1.8 and 2.3 by 1978-79.[34] In contrast, Soviet Muslim women had much higher fertility rates. In 1969-70, the average Muslim woman had 7 children, which represents an increase from 6.2 in 1958-59. Despite decreasing to 5.6 in 1978-79 and further falling in the 1980s, the birth rate amongst Soviet Muslims remained consistently higher than those who were non-Muslims.[35]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in the Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union promoted state atheism from 1928 to 1941, in which religion was largely discouraged and heavily persecuted. The USSR remained a secular state from 1945 until its dissolution. However, according to various Soviet and Western sources, over one-third of the country's people professed religious beliefs: Russian Orthodox 20%, Muslim 15%, Protestant, Georgian Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and Roman Catholic 7%, Jewish less than 1%, atheist 60% (1990 est.).[21] Some indigenous pagan belief systems existed in the Siberian and Russian Far Eastern lands in the local populations.\n\n\n\n## Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the Soviet Union\n\nRussian became the official language of the Soviet Union in 1990.[36] Until that time it was still necessary to have a language of common communication. The *de facto* result inevitably favored Russian, the native language of half of Soviet citizens.[37]\n\n\nOverall Soviet citizens spoke more than 200 languages and dialects (at least 18 with more than 1 million speakers); Slavic group: 75%, other Indo-European: 8%, Altaic: 12%, Uralic: 3%, Caucasian: 2% (1990 est.)[21]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographics of Central Asia\n* Religion in the Soviet Union\n* Family in the Soviet Union\n* List of Russian censuses\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Aanderson, Barbara A.

Alongside the atheist majority of 60%, there were sizable minorities of Russian Orthodox Christians (approximately 20%) and Muslims (approximately 15%).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Revolution and Civil war, 1917 - 1923[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of the Soviet Union in 1926\nDuring the Russian Revolution and Civil War period, Russia lost territories of the former Russian Empire, whose populations totalled about 30 million people (Poland: 18 million; Finland: 3 million; Romania: 3 million; the Baltic states: 5 million, Kars: 400 thousand). At least 2 million citizens of the former Russian Empire died during the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, and a further 1 to 2 million emigrated.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Interwar period, 1924 to 1940[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of the Soviet Union in 1939\n### Great Patriotic War, 1941 - 1945[edit]\n\n\nPopulation pyramid before and after the Second World War\n![](image)\n1941\n![](image)\n1946\n\nDuring the Second World War on the Eastern Front, the Soviet Union lost an approximate 26.6 million people.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Rejuvenation of the population, 1946 - 1960s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of the Soviet Union in 1950\nAfter the Second World War, the population of the Soviet Union began to gradually recover to pre-war levels. By 1959 there were a registered 209,035,000 people, over the 1941 population count of 196,716,000. In 1958-59, Soviet fertility stood at around 2.8 children per woman.[1]\n\n\n\n### Population dynamics in the 1970s - 1980s[edit]\n\n\nThe crude birth rate in the Soviet Union throughout its history had been decreasing - from 44.0 per thousand in 1926 to 18.0 in 1974, mostly due to urbanization and rising average age of marriages. The total fertility rate fell from 2.4 in 1969-70 to 2.3 in 1978-79.[2] The crude death rate had been gradually decreasing as well - from 23.7 per thousand in 1926 to 8.7 in 1974.[3] While death rates did not differ greatly across regions of the Soviet Union through much of Soviet history, birth rates in the southern republics of Transcaucasia and Central Asia were much higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post-World War II period. This was partly due to slower rates of urbanization and traditionally early marriages in southern republics.[3]\n\n\nMainly as a result of differential birthrates, with most of the European nationalities moving toward sub-replacement fertility and the Central Asian and other nationalities of southern republics having well-above replacement-level fertility, the percentage of the population who were ethnic Russians was gradually being reduced. According to some Western predictions made in the 1990s, if the Soviet Union had stayed together, it is likely that ethnic Russians would have lost their majority status in the 2000s (decade).[4] This differential could not be offset by assimilation of non-Russians by Russians, in part because the nationalities of southern republics maintained a distinct ethnic consciousness and were not easily assimilated.\n\n\nThe late 1960s and the 1970s witnessed a dramatic reversal of the path of declining mortality in the Soviet Union, and was especially notable among men in working ages, and also especially in Russia and other predominantly Slavic areas of the country.[5] While not unique to the Soviet Union (Hungary in particular showed a pattern that was similar to Russia), this male mortality increase, accompanied by a noticeable increase in infant mortality rates in the early 1970s, drew the attention of Western demographers and Sovietologists at the time.[6]\n\n\nAn analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, the situation for adult mortality began to improve again.[7] Referring to data for the two decades ending in 1989–1990, while noting some abatement in adult mortality rates in the Soviet republics in the 1980s, Ward Kingkade and Eduardo Arriaga characterized this situation as follows: \"All the former Soviet countries have followed the universal tendency for mortality to decline as infectious diseases are brought under control while death rates from degenerative diseases rise. What is exceptional in the former Soviet countries and some of their East European neighbors is that a subsequent increase in mortality from causes other than infectious disease has brought about overall rises in mortality from all causes combined. Another distinctive characteristic of the former Soviet case is the presence of unusually high levels of mortality from accidents and other external causes, which are typically associated with alcoholism.\"[8]\n\n\nThe rising infant mortality rates in the Soviet Union in the 1970s became the subject of much discussion and debate among Western demographers. The infant mortality rate (IMR) had increased from 24.7 in 1970 to 27.9 in 1974. Some researchers regarded the rise in infant mortality as largely real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services.[9] Others regarded it as largely an artifact of improved reporting of infant deaths, and found the increases to be concentrated in the Central Asian republics where improvement in coverage and reporting of births and deaths might well have the greatest effect on increasing the published rates.[10]\n\n\nThe rising reported adult mortality and infant mortality was not explained or defended by Soviet officials at the time. Instead, they simply stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years. Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late 1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed and researchers could delve into the real and artificial aspects of the reported mortality increases. When these researchers began to report their findings, they accepted the increases in adult male mortality as real and focused their research on explaining its causes and finding solutions.[11] In contrast, investigations of the rise in reported infant mortality concluded that while the reported increases in the IMR were largely an artifact of improved reporting of infant deaths in the Central Asian republics, the actual levels in this region were much higher than had yet been reported officially.[12] In this sense, the reported *rise* in infant mortality in the Soviet Union as a whole was an artifact of improved statistical reporting, but reflected the reality of a much higher actual infant mortality *level* than had previously been recognized in official statistics.\n\n\nAs the detailed data series that was ultimately published in the late 1980s showed, the reported IMR for the Soviet Union as a whole increased from 24.7 in 1970 to a peak of 31.4 in 1976. After that the IMR gradually decreased and by 1989 it had fallen to 22.7, which was lower than had been reported in any previous year (though close to the figure of 22.9 in 1971).[13] In 1989, the IMR ranged from a low of 11.1 in the Latvian SSR to a high of 54.7 in the Turkmen SSR.[14]\n\n\nResearch conducted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union revealed that the originally reported mortality rates vary substantially underestimated the actual rates, especially for infant mortality. This has been shown for Transcaucasian and Central Asian republics.[15][16]\n\n\nAfter two decades of declining and stagnating fertility rates, the Soviet TFR rose from 2.27 in 1978-79 to 2.51 in 1986-87. Most Muslim areas of the USSR continued to fall, while non-Muslim regions rose slightly.[17]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of the Soviet Union\n\n![](image)Demographics of Soviet Union, Data of Andreev, E.M., *et al.*, *Naselenie Sovetskogo Soiuza, 1922-1991*.

At least 2 million citizens of the former Russian Empire died in the course of the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, and a further 1 to 2 million emigrated. An estimated 800,000 to 1,200,000 people died during the purges of the 1930s.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to the Russian Academy of Sciences the Soviet Union suffered 26.6 million deaths (1941-1945) during World War II, including an increase in infant mortality of 1.3 million. Total war-loss figures include territories annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939–1945.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAlthough the population growth-rate decreased over time, it remained positive throughout the history of the Soviet Union in all republics, and the population grew each year by more than 2 million except during periods of wartime, and famine.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1897 (Russian Empire):\n | 125,640,000\n |\n| 1911 (Russian Empire):\n | 167,003,000\n |\n| 1920 (Russian SFSR):\n | 137,727,000\\*\n |\n| 1926\n | 148,656,000[18] |\n| 1937\n | 162,500,000[18] Measured quantity is not of the same type as previous one, units are different or at least would have been different at the time before completion of project 'new soviet man'\n |\n| 1939\n | 168,524,000[18] |\n| 1941\n | 196,716,000[18] |\n| 1946\n | 170,548,000[18] |\n| 1951\n | 182,321,000[18] |\n| 1959\n | 209,035,000[18] |\n| 1970\n | 241,720,000[19] |\n| 1977\n | 257,800,000\n |\n| 1982\n | 270,000,000\n |\n| 1985\n | 277,800,000\n |\n| 1990\n | 290,938,469\n |\n| 1991\n | 293,047,571\n |\n\n\n### Life expectancy and infant mortality[edit]\n\n\nA newborn Soviet child in 1926–27 had a life expectancy of 44.4 years, up from 32.3 years in the Russian Empire thirty years before.

Maris, Mongols, Nenetses, Ossetians, Roma, Romanians, Tats, Tuvans, Udmurts, and Yakuts. Dozens of these other ethnic groups were the titular nations of different Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics or Autonomous Oblasts within the union-level republics (ex. Tatars in Tatar ASSR within the RSFSR, Abkhaz ASSR within Georgia) or had been previously (Volga German ASSR, Crimean ASSR).\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\nThroughout its entire history, ethnic Russians made up a majority of Soviet citizens. According to the 1939 census, Russians reached a peak of 58.4% of the population.[32] Previously in 1926, Russians were 52.9% of the population. This could be due to the decrease of Ukrainians, which coincides with the Holodomor. \n\n\nSince 1939, the percentage of ethnic Russians in the USSR began to decrease. By 1959, 54.6% of Soviet citizens were recorded as ethnic Russians. At first, this was due to the incorporation of new territories westward in Europe after World War II, such as the Polish Eastern Borderlands, the Baltic states, Carpathian Ruthenia, and Bessarabia. This resulted in an increase of non-Russian ethnic groups, especially those who were Belarusian, Ukrainian, Polish, Moldovan, Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian. However, starting in the 1960s, the decline of the Russian majority was mainly driven by indigenous ethnic groups residing in the Caucasian and Central Asian Soviet republics. For example, the five main Central Asian groups, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tajiks, and Turkmens, together saw a 163.81% increase from 1959 to 1989. Azerbaijanis, the largest Muslim group in the Soviet Caucasus, grew from 2.9 million people to almost 6.8 million during the same time, which represents a 130.31% increase. Meanwhile, ethnic Russians increased by only 27.20%. When the 1989 census was released, ethnic Russians made up just 50.8% of the population and were projected to become a minority within the next decade. \n\n\nThe rise of non-Russians, especially Soviet Muslims from the Caucasus and Central Asia can be explained by analysing the different patterns of total fertility rates among ethnic groups. According to research professors Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, Soviet fertility was both high and low. The national rate stood at 2.8 children per woman in 1958-59 before falling to 2.4 in 1969-70 and 2.3 in 1978-79.[33] The total fertility for ethnic Russian women within the RSFSR declined from 2.4 to 1.8 in the late 1960s and 1970s. The same trend could be found in the Baltic and Western regions of the USSR, which each of the Soviet republics' titular nationality approaching sub-replacement fertility. Caucasian ethnic groups, such as Armenians and Georgians followed the same trend, but on average had more children than Soviet citizens living in Russia, the Baltic states, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova. Overall, the mentioned ethnicities had an average total fertility rate between 1.8 and 2.3 by 1978-79.[34] In contrast, Soviet Muslim women had much higher fertility rates. In 1969-70, the average Muslim woman had 7 children, which represents an increase from 6.2 in 1958-59. Despite decreasing to 5.6 in 1978-79 and further falling in the 1980s, the birth rate amongst Soviet Muslims remained consistently higher than those who were non-Muslims.[35]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in the Soviet Union\n\nThe Soviet Union promoted state atheism from 1928 to 1941, in which religion was largely discouraged and heavily persecuted. The USSR remained a secular state from 1945 until its dissolution. However, according to various Soviet and Western sources, over one-third of the country's people professed religious beliefs: Russian Orthodox 20%, Muslim 15%, Protestant, Georgian Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and Roman Catholic 7%, Jewish less than 1%, atheist 60% (1990 est.).[21] Some indigenous pagan belief systems existed in the Siberian and Russian Far Eastern lands in the local populations.\n\n\n\n## Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the Soviet Union\n\nRussian became the official language of the Soviet Union in 1990.[36] Until that time it was still necessary to have a language of common communication. The *de facto* result inevitably favored Russian, the native language of half of Soviet citizens.[37]\n\n\nOverall Soviet citizens spoke more than 200 languages and dialects (at least 18 with more than 1 million speakers); Slavic group: 75%, other Indo-European: 8%, Altaic: 12%, Uralic: 3%, Caucasian: 2% (1990 est.)[21]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographics of Central Asia\n* Religion in the Soviet Union\n* Family in the Soviet Union\n* List of Russian censuses\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Aanderson, Barbara A.

It determined the resident population of the United States to be 248,709,873, an increase of 9.8 percent over the 226,545,805 persons enumerated during the 1980 census.[1]\n\n\nApproximately 16 percent of households received a \"long form\" of the 1990 census, which contained more than 100 questions. Full documentation on the 1990 census, including census forms and a procedural history, is available from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.\n\n\nIt was the first census to designate \"Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\" as a racial group separate from Asians.\n\n\nTo increase black participation in the 1990 United States census, the bureau recruited Bill Cosby, Magic Johnson, Alfre Woodard, and Miss America Debbye Turner as spokespeople.[2] The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series. Aggregate data for small areas, together with electronic boundary files, can be downloaded from the National Historical Geographic Information System. Personally identifiable information will be available in 2062.[3]\n\n\nThis was the first census since 1880 in which Chicago was not the second-largest city, having been overtaken by Los Angeles. As of the 2020 census, Los Angeles has remained the nation's second-largest city.\n\n\n\n\n## State rankings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map showing the population change of each US State by

Representatives starting with the 1992 elections. Consequently, this affected the number of votes each state has in the Electoral College for the 1992 presidential election.\n\n\nBecause of population changes, twenty-one states had changes in their number of seats. Eight states gained at least one seat, and thirteen states lost at least one seat. The final result involved 19 seats being switched.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Gained seven seats | Gained four seats | Gained three seats | Gained one seat | Lost one seat | Lost two seats | Lost three seats\n

It determined the resident population of the United States to be 248,709,873, an increase of 9.8 percent over the 226,545,805 persons enumerated during the 1980 census.[1]\n\n\nApproximately 16 percent of households received a \"long form\" of the 1990 census, which contained more than 100 questions. Full documentation on the 1990 census, including census forms and a procedural history, is available from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.\n\n\nIt was the first census to designate \"Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\" as a racial group separate from Asians.\n\n\nTo increase black participation in the 1990 United States census, the bureau recruited Bill Cosby, Magic Johnson, Alfre Woodard, and Miss America Debbye Turner as spokespeople.[2] The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series. Aggregate data for small areas, together with electronic boundary files, can be downloaded from the National Historical Geographic Information System. Personally identifiable information will be available in 2062.[3]\n\n\nThis was the first census since 1880 in which Chicago was not the second-largest city, having been overtaken by Los Angeles. As of the 2020 census, Los Angeles has remained the nation's second-largest city.\n\n\n\n\n## State rankings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map showing the population change of each US State by

Representatives starting with the 1992 elections. Consequently, this affected the number of votes each state has in the Electoral College for the 1992 presidential election.\n\n\nBecause of population changes, twenty-one states had changes in their number of seats. Eight states gained at least one seat, and thirteen states lost at least one seat. The final result involved 19 seats being switched.[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Gained seven seats | Gained four seats | Gained three seats | Gained one seat | Lost one seat | Lost two seats | Lost three seats\n

As of 2022[update], Chinese state media reported the country's total fertility rate to be 1.09.[4]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous country from at least 1950 until being surpassed by India in 2023.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of December 2022, China's population stood at 1.4118 billion.[7] According to the 2020 census, 91.11% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.89% were minorities. China's population growth rate is only 0.03%, ranking 159th in the world.[8] China conducted its sixth national population census in 2010,[9][10] and its seventh census was completed in late 2020, with data released in May 2021.[11] Unless otherwise indicated, the statistics on this page pertain to mainland China only; see also Demographics of Hong Kong, Demographics of Macau and Demographics of Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Chinese history\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Under Mao Zedong, China nearly doubled in population from 540 million in 1949 to 969 million in 1979. This growth slowed because of the one-child policy instituted in 1979.[13] The 2022 data shows a declining population for the first time since 1961.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of China from 1950 to 2022\n![](image)Age structure projections for China up to 2100\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous nation for many centuries, until being surpassed by India in 2023.[17] When China took its first post-1949 census in 1953, the population stood at 583 million; by the fifth census in 2000, the population had more than doubled, reaching 1.2 billion.\n\n\nBy the sixth census in 2020, the total population had reached to 1,419,933,142, with the mainland having 1,411,778,724, Hong Kong having 7,474,200, and Macau having 683,218. However, this number is disputed by obstetrics researcher Yi Fuxian, who argues that data related to population growth is inflated by local governments to obtain financial subsidies from the central government.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Population of China by age and sex (demographic pyramid)[edit]\n\n\n* ![China population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953](image)\n\nChina population

population census since 1964. It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the State Statistical Bureau. Pretests and small scale trial runs were conducted and checked for accuracy between 1980 and 1981 in twenty-four provincial-level units. Census stations were opened in rural production brigades and urban neighborhoods. Beginning on 1 July 1982, each household sent a representative to a census station to be enumerated. The census required about a month to complete and employed approximately 5 million census takers.\n\n\nThe 1982 census collected data in nineteen demographic categories relating to individuals and households. The thirteen areas concerning individuals were name, relationship to head of household, sex, age, nationality, registration status, educational level, profession, occupation, status of nonworking persons, marital status, number of children born and still living, and number of births in 1981. The six items pertaining to households were type (domestic or collective), serial number, number of persons, number of births in 1981, number of deaths in 1981, and number of registered persons absent for more than one year. Information was gathered in a number of important areas for which previous data were either extremely inaccurate or simply nonexistent, including fertility, marital status, urban population, minority ethnic groups, sex composition, age distribution, and employment and unemployment.\n\n\nA fundamental anomaly in the 1982 statistics was noted by some Western analysts. They pointed out that although the birth and death rates recorded by the census and those recorded through the household registration system were different, the two systems arrived at similar population totals. The discrepancies in the vital rates were the result of the underreporting of both births and deaths to the authorities under the registration system; families would not report some births because of the one-child policy and would not report some deaths so as to hold on to the rations of the deceased.\n\n\nNevertheless, the 1982 census was a watershed for both Chinese and world demographics. After an eighteen-year gap, population specialists were given a wealth of reliable, up-to-date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns, measure current population conditions, and predict future population trends. For example, Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age-sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends. The data on age-specific fertility and mortality rates provided the necessary base-line information for making population projections. The census data also were useful for estimating future manpower potential, consumer needs, and utility, energy, and health-service requirements. The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population. Previously, there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth's inhabitants. Demographers who had been conducting research on global population without accurate data on the Chinese fifth of the world's population were particularly thankful for the 1982 breakthrough census.\n\n\n\n### Population control[edit]\n\n\nSee also: One-child policy and Two-child policy\n\n![](image)Birth rate in China\nInitially, China's post-1949 leaders were ideologically disposed to view a large population as an asset. But the liabilities of a large, rapidly growing population soon became apparent. For one year, starting in August 1956, vigorous support was given to the Ministry of Public Health's mass birth control efforts. These efforts, however, had little impact on fertility. After the interval of the Great Leap Forward, Chinese leaders again saw rapid population growth as an obstacle to development, and their interest in birth control revived. In the early 1960s, schemes somewhat more muted than during the first campaign, emphasized the virtues of late marriage. Birth control offices were set up in the central government and some provincial-level governments in 1964. The second campaign was particularly successful in the cities, where the birth rate was cut in half during the 1963–66 period. The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution brought the program to a halt, however.\n\n\nIn 1972 and 1973 the party mobilized its resources for a nationwide birth control campaign administered by a group in the State Council. Committees to oversee birth control activities were established at all administrative levels and in various collective enterprises. This extensive and seemingly effective network covered both the rural and the urban population. In urban areas public security headquarters included population control sections. In rural areas the country's \"barefoot doctors\" distributed information and contraceptives to people's commune members. By 1973 Mao Zedong was personally identified with the family planning movement, signifying a greater leadership commitment to controlled population growth than ever before. Yet until several years after Mao's death in 1976, the leadership was reluctant to put forth directly the rationale that population control was necessary for economic growth and improved living standards.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPopulation growth targets were set for both administrative units and individual families. In the mid-1970s the maximum recommended family size was two children in cities and three or four in the country. Since 1979 the government has advocated a one-child limit for both rural and urban areas and has generally set a maximum of two children in special circumstances. As of 1986 the policy for minority nationalities was two children per couple, three in special circumstances, and no limit for ethnic groups with very small populations. The overall goal of the one-child policy was to keep the total population within 1.2 billion through the year 2000, on the premise that the Four Modernizations program would be of little value if population growth was not brought under control.\n\n\nThe one-child policy was a highly ambitious population control program. Like previous programs of the 1960s and 1970s, the one-child policy employed a combination of public education, social pressure, and in some cases coercion. The one-child policy was unique, however, in that it linked reproduction with economic cost or benefit.\n\n\nUnder the one-child program, a sophisticated system rewarded those who observed the policy and penalized those who did not. Through this policy, the rate of increasing population was tempered after the penalties were made. Couples with only one child were given a \"one-child certificate\" entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses, longer maternity leave, better child care, and preferential housing assignments. In return, they were required to pledge that they would not have more children. In the countryside, there was great pressure to adhere to the one-child limit. Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total, the effectiveness of the one-child policy in rural areas was considered the key to the success or failure of the program as a whole.\n\n\nIn rural areas the day-to-day work of family planning was done by cadres at the team and brigade levels who were responsible for women's affairs and by health workers. The women's team leader made regular household visits to keep track of the status of each family under her jurisdiction and collected information on which women were using contraceptives, the methods used, and which had become pregnant. She then reported to the brigade women's leader, who documented the information and took it to a monthly meeting of the commune birth-planning committee. According to reports, ceilings or quotas had to be adhered to; to satisfy these cutoffs, unmarried young people were persuaded to postpone marriage, couples without children were advised to \"wait their turn,\" women with unauthorized pregnancies were pressured to have abortions, and those who already had children were urged to use contraception or undergo sterilization. Couples with more than one child were exhorted[*by whom?*] to be sterilized.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe one-child policy enjoyed much greater success in urban than in rural areas. Even without state intervention, there were compelling reasons for urban couples to limit the family to a single child. Raising a child required a significant portion of family income, and in the cities a child did not become an economic asset until he or she entered the work force at age sixteen. Couples with only one child were given preferential treatment in housing allocation. In addition, because city dwellers who were employed in state enterprises received pensions after retirement, the sex of their first child was less important to them than it was to those in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNumerous reports surfaced of coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy. The alleged methods ranged from intense psychological pressure to the use of physical force, including some grisly accounts of forced abortions and infanticide. Chinese officials admitted that isolated, uncondoned abuses of the program occurred and that they condemned such acts, but they insisted that the family planning program was administered on a voluntary basis using persuasion and economic measures only. International reaction to the allegations were mixed. The UN Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation were generally supportive of China's family planning program. The United States Agency for International Development, however, withdrew US$10 million from the Fund in March 1985 based on allegations that coercion had been used.\n\n\nObservers suggested that an accurate assessment of the one-child program would not be possible until all women who came of childbearing age in the early 1980s passed their fertile years. As of 1987 the one-child program had achieved mixed results. In general, it was very successful in almost all urban areas but less successful in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results. For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234 million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China's population would be age 65 or older by 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million.[21] Even though China has already opened two-child policy since 2016, data shows that the second-child policy cannot stop the problem of an aging population. China needs to find an appropriate birth policy to optimize the demographic dividend, which refers to the proportion of labor-age population.[22] On the other hand, the higher house prices squeeze the marriage in China. The house price plays an important role on the influence of marriage and fertility. The increasing house price leads to the lower marriage rate and cause the other serious social problems in China. For the rapid reduction of marriage and fertility, the central government should establish the policy to deal with the high house price.[23]\n\n\n\n### Population density and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density in the year 2000\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the Heihe–Tengchong Line; although this eastern area comprises only 43% of China's total land area, its population density, at roughly 280/km2, is comparable to that of Japan.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains[*which?*] and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley (of which the delta region was the most populous), Sichuan Basin, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast.\n\n\nPopulation is most sparse in the mountainous, desert, and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, portions are completely uninhabited, and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km2. The Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet autonomous regions and Qinghai and Gansu comprise 55% of the country's land area but in 1985 contained only 5.7% of its population.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Area (km2) | Population | Density\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China | 9,650,000 (100%) | 1,411,778,724 (100%) | 134.7/km2 |\n| **5 provinces** | 5,246,400 (54.45%) | 84,493,388 (5.98%) | 15.16/km2 |\n|  | Inner Mongolia | 1,183,000 (12.28% ) | 24,049,155 (1.70%) | 20.33/km2 |\n| Xinjiang | 1,660,000 (17.23%) | 25,852,345 (1.83%) | 12.62/km2 |\n| Tibet | 1,228,400 (12.75%) | 3,648,100 (0.26%) | 2.31/km2 |\n| Qinghai | 721,000 (7.48%) | 5,923,957 (0.42%) | 7.65/km2 |\n| Gansu | 454,000 (4.71%) | 25,019,831 (1.77%) | 57.65/km2 |\n| **Other provinces** | 4,403,605 (45.55%) | 1,327,285,336 (94.02%) | 277.27/km2 |\n| Source: National Bureau of Statistics |\n\n\n\n## Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)China population changes 1949 - 2022\n### Table of births and deaths 1949–2022[edit]\n\n\nChina's fertility statistics differ depending on the source.

Beginning in the early 1950s, mortality steadily declined; it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987. One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China's population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the United States Bureau of the Census. The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the Great Leap Forward (1958–60).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to Chinese government statistics, the crude birth rate followed five distinct patterns from 1949 to 1982. It remained stable from 1949 to 1954, varied widely from 1955 to 1965, experienced fluctuations between 1966 and 1969, dropped sharply in the late 1970s, and increased from 1980 to 1981. Between 1970 and 1980, the crude birth rate dropped from 33.4 per 1,000 to 18.2 per 1,000. The government attributed this dramatic decline in fertility to the *wǎn xī shǎo* (\"晚、稀、少\", or \"late, long, few\": later marriages, longer intervals between births, and fewer children) birth control campaign. However, elements of socioeconomic change, such as increased employment of women in both urban and rural areas and reduced infant mortality (a greater percentage of surviving children would tend to reduce demand for additional children), may have played some role. The birth rate increased in the 1980s to a level over 20 per 1,000, primarily as a result of a marked rise in marriages and first births. The rise was an indication of problems with the one-child policy of 1979. Chinese sources, however, indicate that the birth rate started to decrease again in the 1990s and reached a level of around 12 per 1,000 in recent years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn urban areas, the housing shortage may have been at least partly responsible for the decreased birth rate. Also, the policy in force during most of the 1960s and the early 1970s of sending large numbers of high school graduates to the countryside deprived cities of a significant proportion of persons of childbearing age and undoubtedly had some effect on birth rates (see Cultural Revolution (1966–76)). Primarily for economic reasons, rural birth rates tended to decline less than urban rates. The right to grow and sell agricultural products for personal profit and the lack of an old-age welfare system were incentives for rural people to produce many children, especially sons, for help in the fields and for support in old age. Because of these conditions, it is unclear to what degree education had been able to erode traditional values favoring large families.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nChina exhibits a serious gender imbalance. Census data obtained in 2000 revealed that 119 boys were born for every 100 girls, and among China's \"floating population\" the ratio was as high as 128:100. These situations led the government in July 2004 to ban selective abortions of female fetuses. It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025–2030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease.[28]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the National Health Commission reported 9.56 million births, the lowest figure on record since 1949.[29]\n\n\n\n### Total fertility rate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, the TFR was 1.22 (0.86 for cities, 1.08 for towns and 1.43 for villages/outposts). Beijing had the lowest TFR at 0.67, while Guizhou had the highest at 2.19. The Xiangyang district of Jiamusi city (Heilongjiang) has a TFR of 0.41, which is the lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history. Other extremely low TFR counties are: 0.43 in the Heping district of Tianjin city (Tianjin), and 0.46 in the Mawei district of Fuzhou city (Fujian). At the other end TFR was 3.96 in Geji County (Tibet), 4.07 in Jiali County (Tibet), and 5.47 in Baqing County (Tibet).[30]\n\n\nThe 2010 census reported a TFR of 1.18 (0.88 in cities, 1.15 in townships, and\n1.44 in rural areas).[31]\nThe five regions with the lowest fertility rates were Beijing (0.71), Shanghai\n(0.74), Liaoning (0.74), Heilongjiang (0.75), and Jilin (0.76). The five regions with the highest\nfertility rates were Guangxi (1.79), Guizhou (1.75), Xinjiang (1.53), Hainan (1.51), and Anhui\n(1.48).[31]\n\n\nTotal fertility rate by ethnic group (2010 census): Han (1.14), Zhuang (1.59), Hui (1.48), Manchu (1.18), Uyghur (2.04), Miao (1.82), Yi (1.82), Tujia (1.74), Tibetan (1.60), Mongols (1.26).[32]\n\n\nIn 2022, the TFR was 1.09.[4]\n\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the number of people theoretically able to enter the Chinese labor force (individuals aged 15 to 59), shrank slightly to 937.27 million, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, resulting from a demographic transition, is anticipated to continue until at least 2030.[33]\nThe World Factbook estimated the 2019 active labor force was 774.71 million.[34]\n\n\n\n### Height and weight[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2020, the average Chinese man was 169.7 centimeters tall (5 ft 7 in) in 2019, the figures showed, and women's average height was 158 centimeters (5 ft 2.2 in). The same study showed an average Chinese man weighed 69.6 kilograms (153.4 lbs, or 11 stone 0 lbs), up 3.4 kilograms (7.5 lbs) over 10 years, while women were 1.7 kilograms (3.8 pounds) heavier on average at 59 kilograms (130.1 pounds, or 9 stone 4.1 lbs). They were up 1.2 centimeters (0.47  in) and 0.8 centimeters (0.31 in) respectively from 5 years earlier.[35]\n\n\n\n### Gender balance[edit]\n\n\nFuture challenges for China will be the gender disparity. According to the 2020 census, males account for 51.24% of China's 1.41 billion people, while females made up 48.76% of the total. The sex ratio (the number of males for each female in a population) at birth was 118.06 boys to every 100 girls (54.14%) in 2010, higher than the 116.86 (53.89%) of 2000, but 0.53 points lower than the ratio of 118.59 (54.25%) in 2005.[36] In most Western countries the sex ratio at birth is around 105 boys to 100 girls (51.22%).\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of ethnic groups in China.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) officially recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, the largest of which are Han, who constitute 91.51% of the total population in 2010. Ethnic minorities constitute 8.49% or 113.8 million of China's population in 2010. During the past decades ethnic minorities have experienced higher growth rates than the majority Han population, because they are not under the one-child policy. Their proportion of the population in China has grown from 6.1% in 1953, to 8.04% in 1990, 8.41% in 2000, and 8.49% in 2010. Large ethnic minorities (data according to the 2000 census) include the Zhuang (16 million, 1.28%), Manchu (10 million, 0.84%), Uyghur (9 million, 0.78%), Hui (9 million, 0.71%), Miao (8 million, 0.71%), Yi (7 million, 0.61%), Tujia (5.75 million, 0.63%), Mongols (5 million, 0.46%), Tibetan (5 million, 0.43%), Buyei (3 million, 0.23%), and Korean (2 million, 0.15%). Over 126,000 Westerners from Canada, the US and Europe are living in Mainland China.[37] Almost 1% of people living in Hong Kong are Westerners.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of China according to ethnic

Migration in China and Chinese emigration\n\nInternal migration in the People's Republic of China is one of the most extensive in the world according to the International Labour Organization.[67] In fact, research done by Kam Wing Chan of the University of Washington suggests that \"In the 30 years since 1979, China's urban population has grown by about 440 million to 622 million in 2009. Of the 440 million increase, about 340 million was attributable to net migration and urban reclassification. Even if only half of that increase was migration, the volume of rural-urban migration in such a short period is likely the largest in human history.\"[68] Migrants in China are commonly members of a floating population, which refers primarily to migrants in China without local household registration status through the Chinese Hukou system.[69] In general, rural-urban migrant workers are most excluded from local educational resources, citywide social welfare programs and many jobs because of their lack of hukou status.[70]\n\n\nIn 2011 a total of 252.78 million migrant workers (an increase of 4.4% compared to 2010) existed in China. Out of these, migrant workers who left their hometown and worked in other provinces accounted for 158.63 million (an increase of 3.4% compared to 2010) and migrant workers who worked within their home provinces reached 94.15 million (an increase of 5.9% compared to 2010).[71] Estimations are that Chinese cities will face an influx of another 243 million migrants by 2025, taking the urban population up to nearly 1 billion people.[72] This population of migrants would represent \"almost 40 percent of the total urban population,\" a number which is almost three times the current level.[72][73] While it is often difficult to collect accurate statistical data on migrant floating populations, the number of migrants is undoubtedly quite large. \"In China's largest cities, for instance, it is often quoted that at least one out of every five persons is a migrant.\"[74] China's government influences the pattern of urbanization through the Hukou permanent residence registration system, land-sale policies, infrastructure investment and the incentives offered to local government officials. The other factors influencing migration of people from rural provincial areas to large cities are employment, education, business opportunities and higher standard of living.[75]\n\n\nThe mass emigration known as the Chinese diaspora,[76] which occurred from the 19th century to 1949, was mainly caused by wars and starvation in mainland China, invasion from various foreign countries, as well as the problems resulting from political corruption. Most immigrants were illiterate peasants and manual labourers, called \"coolies\" by analogy to the same pattern of immigration from India, who emigrated to work in countries such as the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## Urbanization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban construction work in Guangshui, 2013\nMain article: Urbanization in China\n\nUrbanization increased in speed following the initiation of the reform and opening policy. By the end of 2014, 54.7% of the total population lived in urban areas, a rate that rose from 26% in 1990.[77]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[78]\nNo statistics have been included for areas currently governed by the Republic of China (Taiwan).

It is worthwhile to note that this does not include other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of national ancestral gods or the gods of nature (which in northern China is more common than ancestor worship), and Taoism and Confucianism.\n2. **^** Historical record and contemporary scholarly fieldwork testify certain central and northern provinces of China as hotbeds of folk religious sects and Confucian religious groups.\n3. **^** The map represents the geographic diffusion of the tradition of folk religious movements of salvation, Confucian churches and *jiaohua* (\"transformative teachings\") movements, based on historical data and contemporary fieldwork. Due to incomplete data and ambiguous identity of many of these traditions the map may not be completely accurate. Sources include a *World Religion Map* from Harvard University, based on data from the World Religion Database, showing highly unprecise ranges of Chinese folk (salvationist) religions' membership by province. Another source, the studies of China's Regional Religious System, find \"very high activity of popular religion and secret societies and low Buddhist presence in northern regions, while very high Buddhist presence in the southeast\".[44]\n[note 2]\n\n\t* Hebei: Fieldwork by Thomas David Dubois[45] testifies the dominance of folk religious movements, specifically the Church of the Heaven and the Earth and the Church of the Highest Supreme, since their \"energetic revival since the 1970s\" (p. 13), in the religious life of the counties of Hebei. Religious life in rural Hebei is also characterised by a type of organisation called the benevolent churches and the salvationist movement known as Zailiism has returned active since the 1990s.\n\t* Henan: According to Heberer and Jakobi (2000)[46] Henan has been for centuries a hub of folk religious sects (p. 7) that constitute significant focuses of the religious life of the province. Sects present in the region include the Baguadao or Tianli (\"Order of Heaven\") sect, the Dadaohui, the Tianxianmiaodao, the Yiguandao, and many others. Henan also has a strong popular Confucian orientation (p. 5).\n\t* Northeast China: According to official records by the then-government, the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue or Morality Society had 8 million members in Manchuria, or northeast China in the 1930s, making up about 25% of the total population of the area (note that the state of Manchuria also included the eastern end of modern-day Inner Mongolia).[47] Folk religious movements of a Confucian nature, or Confucian churches, were in fact very successful in the northeast.\n\t* Shandong: The province is traditionally a stronghold of Confucianism and is the area of origin of many folk religious sects and Confucian churches of the modern period, including the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, the Way of the Return to the One (皈依道 *Guīyīdào*), the Way of Unity (一貫道 *Yīguàndào*), and others. Alex Payette (2016) testifies the rapid growth of Confucian groups in the province in the 2010s.[48]\n\nAccording to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2012,[49] about 2.2% of the total population of China (around 30 million people) claims membership in the folk religious sects, which have likely maintained their historical dominance in central-northern and northeastern China.\n4. **^** The statistics for Chinese ancestorism, that is the worship of ancestor-gods within the lineage system, are from the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey of 2010.[43] The statistics for Buddhism and Christianity are from the China Family Panel Studies survey of 2012.[51] The statistics for Islam are from a survey conducted in 2010.[52] It is worthwhile to note that the populations of Chinese ancestorism and Buddhism may overlap, even with the large remaining parts of the population whose belief is not documented in the table. The latter, the uncharted population, may practise other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of gods, Taoism, Confucianism and folk salvationisms, or may be atheist. Indeed, according to the CFPS 2012, only 6.3% of the Chinese were irreligious in the sense of \"atheism\", while the rest practised the worship of gods and ancestors.[53]: 13\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Country Comparisons - Infant mortality rate\". *The World Factbook*.

As of 2022[update], Chinese state media reported the country's total fertility rate to be 1.09.[4]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous country from at least 1950 until being surpassed by India in 2023.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of December 2022, China's population stood at 1.4118 billion.[7] According to the 2020 census, 91.11% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.89% were minorities. China's population growth rate is only 0.03%, ranking 159th in the world.[8] China conducted its sixth national population census in 2010,[9][10] and its seventh census was completed in late 2020, with data released in May 2021.[11] Unless otherwise indicated, the statistics on this page pertain to mainland China only; see also Demographics of Hong Kong, Demographics of Macau and Demographics of Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Chinese history\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Under Mao Zedong, China nearly doubled in population from 540 million in 1949 to 969 million in 1979. This growth slowed because of the one-child policy instituted in 1979.[13] The 2022 data shows a declining population for the first time since 1961.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of China from 1950 to 2022\n![](image)Age structure projections for China up to 2100\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous nation for many centuries, until being surpassed by India in 2023.[17] When China took its first post-1949 census in 1953, the population stood at 583 million; by the fifth census in 2000, the population had more than doubled, reaching 1.2 billion.\n\n\nBy the sixth census in 2020, the total population had reached to 1,419,933,142, with the mainland having 1,411,778,724, Hong Kong having 7,474,200, and Macau having 683,218. However, this number is disputed by obstetrics researcher Yi Fuxian, who argues that data related to population growth is inflated by local governments to obtain financial subsidies from the central government.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Population of China by age and sex (demographic pyramid)[edit]\n\n\n* ![China population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953](image)\n\nChina population

population census since 1964. It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the State Statistical Bureau. Pretests and small scale trial runs were conducted and checked for accuracy between 1980 and 1981 in twenty-four provincial-level units. Census stations were opened in rural production brigades and urban neighborhoods. Beginning on 1 July 1982, each household sent a representative to a census station to be enumerated. The census required about a month to complete and employed approximately 5 million census takers.\n\n\nThe 1982 census collected data in nineteen demographic categories relating to individuals and households. The thirteen areas concerning individuals were name, relationship to head of household, sex, age, nationality, registration status, educational level, profession, occupation, status of nonworking persons, marital status, number of children born and still living, and number of births in 1981. The six items pertaining to households were type (domestic or collective), serial number, number of persons, number of births in 1981, number of deaths in 1981, and number of registered persons absent for more than one year. Information was gathered in a number of important areas for which previous data were either extremely inaccurate or simply nonexistent, including fertility, marital status, urban population, minority ethnic groups, sex composition, age distribution, and employment and unemployment.\n\n\nA fundamental anomaly in the 1982 statistics was noted by some Western analysts. They pointed out that although the birth and death rates recorded by the census and those recorded through the household registration system were different, the two systems arrived at similar population totals. The discrepancies in the vital rates were the result of the underreporting of both births and deaths to the authorities under the registration system; families would not report some births because of the one-child policy and would not report some deaths so as to hold on to the rations of the deceased.\n\n\nNevertheless, the 1982 census was a watershed for both Chinese and world demographics. After an eighteen-year gap, population specialists were given a wealth of reliable, up-to-date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns, measure current population conditions, and predict future population trends. For example, Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age-sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends. The data on age-specific fertility and mortality rates provided the necessary base-line information for making population projections. The census data also were useful for estimating future manpower potential, consumer needs, and utility, energy, and health-service requirements. The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population. Previously, there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth's inhabitants. Demographers who had been conducting research on global population without accurate data on the Chinese fifth of the world's population were particularly thankful for the 1982 breakthrough census.\n\n\n\n### Population control[edit]\n\n\nSee also: One-child policy and Two-child policy\n\n![](image)Birth rate in China\nInitially, China's post-1949 leaders were ideologically disposed to view a large population as an asset. But the liabilities of a large, rapidly growing population soon became apparent. For one year, starting in August 1956, vigorous support was given to the Ministry of Public Health's mass birth control efforts. These efforts, however, had little impact on fertility. After the interval of the Great Leap Forward, Chinese leaders again saw rapid population growth as an obstacle to development, and their interest in birth control revived. In the early 1960s, schemes somewhat more muted than during the first campaign, emphasized the virtues of late marriage. Birth control offices were set up in the central government and some provincial-level governments in 1964. The second campaign was particularly successful in the cities, where the birth rate was cut in half during the 1963–66 period. The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution brought the program to a halt, however.\n\n\nIn 1972 and 1973 the party mobilized its resources for a nationwide birth control campaign administered by a group in the State Council. Committees to oversee birth control activities were established at all administrative levels and in various collective enterprises. This extensive and seemingly effective network covered both the rural and the urban population. In urban areas public security headquarters included population control sections. In rural areas the country's \"barefoot doctors\" distributed information and contraceptives to people's commune members. By 1973 Mao Zedong was personally identified with the family planning movement, signifying a greater leadership commitment to controlled population growth than ever before. Yet until several years after Mao's death in 1976, the leadership was reluctant to put forth directly the rationale that population control was necessary for economic growth and improved living standards.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPopulation growth targets were set for both administrative units and individual families. In the mid-1970s the maximum recommended family size was two children in cities and three or four in the country. Since 1979 the government has advocated a one-child limit for both rural and urban areas and has generally set a maximum of two children in special circumstances. As of 1986 the policy for minority nationalities was two children per couple, three in special circumstances, and no limit for ethnic groups with very small populations. The overall goal of the one-child policy was to keep the total population within 1.2 billion through the year 2000, on the premise that the Four Modernizations program would be of little value if population growth was not brought under control.\n\n\nThe one-child policy was a highly ambitious population control program. Like previous programs of the 1960s and 1970s, the one-child policy employed a combination of public education, social pressure, and in some cases coercion. The one-child policy was unique, however, in that it linked reproduction with economic cost or benefit.\n\n\nUnder the one-child program, a sophisticated system rewarded those who observed the policy and penalized those who did not. Through this policy, the rate of increasing population was tempered after the penalties were made. Couples with only one child were given a \"one-child certificate\" entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses, longer maternity leave, better child care, and preferential housing assignments. In return, they were required to pledge that they would not have more children. In the countryside, there was great pressure to adhere to the one-child limit. Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total, the effectiveness of the one-child policy in rural areas was considered the key to the success or failure of the program as a whole.\n\n\nIn rural areas the day-to-day work of family planning was done by cadres at the team and brigade levels who were responsible for women's affairs and by health workers. The women's team leader made regular household visits to keep track of the status of each family under her jurisdiction and collected information on which women were using contraceptives, the methods used, and which had become pregnant. She then reported to the brigade women's leader, who documented the information and took it to a monthly meeting of the commune birth-planning committee. According to reports, ceilings or quotas had to be adhered to; to satisfy these cutoffs, unmarried young people were persuaded to postpone marriage, couples without children were advised to \"wait their turn,\" women with unauthorized pregnancies were pressured to have abortions, and those who already had children were urged to use contraception or undergo sterilization. Couples with more than one child were exhorted[*by whom?*] to be sterilized.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe one-child policy enjoyed much greater success in urban than in rural areas. Even without state intervention, there were compelling reasons for urban couples to limit the family to a single child. Raising a child required a significant portion of family income, and in the cities a child did not become an economic asset until he or she entered the work force at age sixteen. Couples with only one child were given preferential treatment in housing allocation. In addition, because city dwellers who were employed in state enterprises received pensions after retirement, the sex of their first child was less important to them than it was to those in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNumerous reports surfaced of coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy. The alleged methods ranged from intense psychological pressure to the use of physical force, including some grisly accounts of forced abortions and infanticide. Chinese officials admitted that isolated, uncondoned abuses of the program occurred and that they condemned such acts, but they insisted that the family planning program was administered on a voluntary basis using persuasion and economic measures only. International reaction to the allegations were mixed. The UN Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation were generally supportive of China's family planning program. The United States Agency for International Development, however, withdrew US$10 million from the Fund in March 1985 based on allegations that coercion had been used.\n\n\nObservers suggested that an accurate assessment of the one-child program would not be possible until all women who came of childbearing age in the early 1980s passed their fertile years. As of 1987 the one-child program had achieved mixed results. In general, it was very successful in almost all urban areas but less successful in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results. For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234 million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China's population would be age 65 or older by 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million.[21] Even though China has already opened two-child policy since 2016, data shows that the second-child policy cannot stop the problem of an aging population. China needs to find an appropriate birth policy to optimize the demographic dividend, which refers to the proportion of labor-age population.[22] On the other hand, the higher house prices squeeze the marriage in China. The house price plays an important role on the influence of marriage and fertility. The increasing house price leads to the lower marriage rate and cause the other serious social problems in China. For the rapid reduction of marriage and fertility, the central government should establish the policy to deal with the high house price.[23]\n\n\n\n### Population density and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density in the year 2000\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the Heihe–Tengchong Line; although this eastern area comprises only 43% of China's total land area, its population density, at roughly 280/km2, is comparable to that of Japan.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains[*which?*] and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley (of which the delta region was the most populous), Sichuan Basin, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast.\n\n\nPopulation is most sparse in the mountainous, desert, and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, portions are completely uninhabited, and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km2. The Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet autonomous regions and Qinghai and Gansu comprise 55% of the country's land area but in 1985 contained only 5.7% of its population.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Area (km2) | Population | Density\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China | 9,650,000 (100%) | 1,411,778,724 (100%) | 134.7/km2 |\n| **5 provinces** | 5,246,400 (54.45%) | 84,493,388 (5.98%) | 15.16/km2 |\n|  | Inner Mongolia | 1,183,000 (12.28% ) | 24,049,155 (1.70%) | 20.33/km2 |\n| Xinjiang | 1,660,000 (17.23%) | 25,852,345 (1.83%) | 12.62/km2 |\n| Tibet | 1,228,400 (12.75%) | 3,648,100 (0.26%) | 2.31/km2 |\n| Qinghai | 721,000 (7.48%) | 5,923,957 (0.42%) | 7.65/km2 |\n| Gansu | 454,000 (4.71%) | 25,019,831 (1.77%) | 57.65/km2 |\n| **Other provinces** | 4,403,605 (45.55%) | 1,327,285,336 (94.02%) | 277.27/km2 |\n| Source: National Bureau of Statistics |\n\n\n\n## Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)China population changes 1949 - 2022\n### Table of births and deaths 1949–2022[edit]\n\n\nChina's fertility statistics differ depending on the source.

Beginning in the early 1950s, mortality steadily declined; it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987. One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China's population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the United States Bureau of the Census. The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the Great Leap Forward (1958–60).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to Chinese government statistics, the crude birth rate followed five distinct patterns from 1949 to 1982. It remained stable from 1949 to 1954, varied widely from 1955 to 1965, experienced fluctuations between 1966 and 1969, dropped sharply in the late 1970s, and increased from 1980 to 1981. Between 1970 and 1980, the crude birth rate dropped from 33.4 per 1,000 to 18.2 per 1,000. The government attributed this dramatic decline in fertility to the *wǎn xī shǎo* (\"晚、稀、少\", or \"late, long, few\": later marriages, longer intervals between births, and fewer children) birth control campaign. However, elements of socioeconomic change, such as increased employment of women in both urban and rural areas and reduced infant mortality (a greater percentage of surviving children would tend to reduce demand for additional children), may have played some role. The birth rate increased in the 1980s to a level over 20 per 1,000, primarily as a result of a marked rise in marriages and first births. The rise was an indication of problems with the one-child policy of 1979. Chinese sources, however, indicate that the birth rate started to decrease again in the 1990s and reached a level of around 12 per 1,000 in recent years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn urban areas, the housing shortage may have been at least partly responsible for the decreased birth rate. Also, the policy in force during most of the 1960s and the early 1970s of sending large numbers of high school graduates to the countryside deprived cities of a significant proportion of persons of childbearing age and undoubtedly had some effect on birth rates (see Cultural Revolution (1966–76)). Primarily for economic reasons, rural birth rates tended to decline less than urban rates. The right to grow and sell agricultural products for personal profit and the lack of an old-age welfare system were incentives for rural people to produce many children, especially sons, for help in the fields and for support in old age. Because of these conditions, it is unclear to what degree education had been able to erode traditional values favoring large families.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nChina exhibits a serious gender imbalance. Census data obtained in 2000 revealed that 119 boys were born for every 100 girls, and among China's \"floating population\" the ratio was as high as 128:100. These situations led the government in July 2004 to ban selective abortions of female fetuses. It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025–2030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease.[28]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the National Health Commission reported 9.56 million births, the lowest figure on record since 1949.[29]\n\n\n\n### Total fertility rate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, the TFR was 1.22 (0.86 for cities, 1.08 for towns and 1.43 for villages/outposts). Beijing had the lowest TFR at 0.67, while Guizhou had the highest at 2.19. The Xiangyang district of Jiamusi city (Heilongjiang) has a TFR of 0.41, which is the lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history. Other extremely low TFR counties are: 0.43 in the Heping district of Tianjin city (Tianjin), and 0.46 in the Mawei district of Fuzhou city (Fujian). At the other end TFR was 3.96 in Geji County (Tibet), 4.07 in Jiali County (Tibet), and 5.47 in Baqing County (Tibet).[30]\n\n\nThe 2010 census reported a TFR of 1.18 (0.88 in cities, 1.15 in townships, and\n1.44 in rural areas).[31]\nThe five regions with the lowest fertility rates were Beijing (0.71), Shanghai\n(0.74), Liaoning (0.74), Heilongjiang (0.75), and Jilin (0.76). The five regions with the highest\nfertility rates were Guangxi (1.79), Guizhou (1.75), Xinjiang (1.53), Hainan (1.51), and Anhui\n(1.48).[31]\n\n\nTotal fertility rate by ethnic group (2010 census): Han (1.14), Zhuang (1.59), Hui (1.48), Manchu (1.18), Uyghur (2.04), Miao (1.82), Yi (1.82), Tujia (1.74), Tibetan (1.60), Mongols (1.26).[32]\n\n\nIn 2022, the TFR was 1.09.[4]\n\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the number of people theoretically able to enter the Chinese labor force (individuals aged 15 to 59), shrank slightly to 937.27 million, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, resulting from a demographic transition, is anticipated to continue until at least 2030.[33]\nThe World Factbook estimated the 2019 active labor force was 774.71 million.[34]\n\n\n\n### Height and weight[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2020, the average Chinese man was 169.7 centimeters tall (5 ft 7 in) in 2019, the figures showed, and women's average height was 158 centimeters (5 ft 2.2 in). The same study showed an average Chinese man weighed 69.6 kilograms (153.4 lbs, or 11 stone 0 lbs), up 3.4 kilograms (7.5 lbs) over 10 years, while women were 1.7 kilograms (3.8 pounds) heavier on average at 59 kilograms (130.1 pounds, or 9 stone 4.1 lbs). They were up 1.2 centimeters (0.47  in) and 0.8 centimeters (0.31 in) respectively from 5 years earlier.[35]\n\n\n\n### Gender balance[edit]\n\n\nFuture challenges for China will be the gender disparity. According to the 2020 census, males account for 51.24% of China's 1.41 billion people, while females made up 48.76% of the total. The sex ratio (the number of males for each female in a population) at birth was 118.06 boys to every 100 girls (54.14%) in 2010, higher than the 116.86 (53.89%) of 2000, but 0.53 points lower than the ratio of 118.59 (54.25%) in 2005.[36] In most Western countries the sex ratio at birth is around 105 boys to 100 girls (51.22%).\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of ethnic groups in China.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) officially recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, the largest of which are Han, who constitute 91.51% of the total population in 2010. Ethnic minorities constitute 8.49% or 113.8 million of China's population in 2010. During the past decades ethnic minorities have experienced higher growth rates than the majority Han population, because they are not under the one-child policy. Their proportion of the population in China has grown from 6.1% in 1953, to 8.04% in 1990, 8.41% in 2000, and 8.49% in 2010. Large ethnic minorities (data according to the 2000 census) include the Zhuang (16 million, 1.28%), Manchu (10 million, 0.84%), Uyghur (9 million, 0.78%), Hui (9 million, 0.71%), Miao (8 million, 0.71%), Yi (7 million, 0.61%), Tujia (5.75 million, 0.63%), Mongols (5 million, 0.46%), Tibetan (5 million, 0.43%), Buyei (3 million, 0.23%), and Korean (2 million, 0.15%). Over 126,000 Westerners from Canada, the US and Europe are living in Mainland China.[37] Almost 1% of people living in Hong Kong are Westerners.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of China according to ethnic

Migration in China and Chinese emigration\n\nInternal migration in the People's Republic of China is one of the most extensive in the world according to the International Labour Organization.[67] In fact, research done by Kam Wing Chan of the University of Washington suggests that \"In the 30 years since 1979, China's urban population has grown by about 440 million to 622 million in 2009. Of the 440 million increase, about 340 million was attributable to net migration and urban reclassification. Even if only half of that increase was migration, the volume of rural-urban migration in such a short period is likely the largest in human history.\"[68] Migrants in China are commonly members of a floating population, which refers primarily to migrants in China without local household registration status through the Chinese Hukou system.[69] In general, rural-urban migrant workers are most excluded from local educational resources, citywide social welfare programs and many jobs because of their lack of hukou status.[70]\n\n\nIn 2011 a total of 252.78 million migrant workers (an increase of 4.4% compared to 2010) existed in China. Out of these, migrant workers who left their hometown and worked in other provinces accounted for 158.63 million (an increase of 3.4% compared to 2010) and migrant workers who worked within their home provinces reached 94.15 million (an increase of 5.9% compared to 2010).[71] Estimations are that Chinese cities will face an influx of another 243 million migrants by 2025, taking the urban population up to nearly 1 billion people.[72] This population of migrants would represent \"almost 40 percent of the total urban population,\" a number which is almost three times the current level.[72][73] While it is often difficult to collect accurate statistical data on migrant floating populations, the number of migrants is undoubtedly quite large. \"In China's largest cities, for instance, it is often quoted that at least one out of every five persons is a migrant.\"[74] China's government influences the pattern of urbanization through the Hukou permanent residence registration system, land-sale policies, infrastructure investment and the incentives offered to local government officials. The other factors influencing migration of people from rural provincial areas to large cities are employment, education, business opportunities and higher standard of living.[75]\n\n\nThe mass emigration known as the Chinese diaspora,[76] which occurred from the 19th century to 1949, was mainly caused by wars and starvation in mainland China, invasion from various foreign countries, as well as the problems resulting from political corruption. Most immigrants were illiterate peasants and manual labourers, called \"coolies\" by analogy to the same pattern of immigration from India, who emigrated to work in countries such as the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## Urbanization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban construction work in Guangshui, 2013\nMain article: Urbanization in China\n\nUrbanization increased in speed following the initiation of the reform and opening policy. By the end of 2014, 54.7% of the total population lived in urban areas, a rate that rose from 26% in 1990.[77]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[78]\nNo statistics have been included for areas currently governed by the Republic of China (Taiwan).

It is worthwhile to note that this does not include other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of national ancestral gods or the gods of nature (which in northern China is more common than ancestor worship), and Taoism and Confucianism.\n2. **^** Historical record and contemporary scholarly fieldwork testify certain central and northern provinces of China as hotbeds of folk religious sects and Confucian religious groups.\n3. **^** The map represents the geographic diffusion of the tradition of folk religious movements of salvation, Confucian churches and *jiaohua* (\"transformative teachings\") movements, based on historical data and contemporary fieldwork. Due to incomplete data and ambiguous identity of many of these traditions the map may not be completely accurate. Sources include a *World Religion Map* from Harvard University, based on data from the World Religion Database, showing highly unprecise ranges of Chinese folk (salvationist) religions' membership by province. Another source, the studies of China's Regional Religious System, find \"very high activity of popular religion and secret societies and low Buddhist presence in northern regions, while very high Buddhist presence in the southeast\".[44]\n[note 2]\n\n\t* Hebei: Fieldwork by Thomas David Dubois[45] testifies the dominance of folk religious movements, specifically the Church of the Heaven and the Earth and the Church of the Highest Supreme, since their \"energetic revival since the 1970s\" (p. 13), in the religious life of the counties of Hebei. Religious life in rural Hebei is also characterised by a type of organisation called the benevolent churches and the salvationist movement known as Zailiism has returned active since the 1990s.\n\t* Henan: According to Heberer and Jakobi (2000)[46] Henan has been for centuries a hub of folk religious sects (p. 7) that constitute significant focuses of the religious life of the province. Sects present in the region include the Baguadao or Tianli (\"Order of Heaven\") sect, the Dadaohui, the Tianxianmiaodao, the Yiguandao, and many others. Henan also has a strong popular Confucian orientation (p. 5).\n\t* Northeast China: According to official records by the then-government, the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue or Morality Society had 8 million members in Manchuria, or northeast China in the 1930s, making up about 25% of the total population of the area (note that the state of Manchuria also included the eastern end of modern-day Inner Mongolia).[47] Folk religious movements of a Confucian nature, or Confucian churches, were in fact very successful in the northeast.\n\t* Shandong: The province is traditionally a stronghold of Confucianism and is the area of origin of many folk religious sects and Confucian churches of the modern period, including the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, the Way of the Return to the One (皈依道 *Guīyīdào*), the Way of Unity (一貫道 *Yīguàndào*), and others. Alex Payette (2016) testifies the rapid growth of Confucian groups in the province in the 2010s.[48]\n\nAccording to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2012,[49] about 2.2% of the total population of China (around 30 million people) claims membership in the folk religious sects, which have likely maintained their historical dominance in central-northern and northeastern China.\n4. **^** The statistics for Chinese ancestorism, that is the worship of ancestor-gods within the lineage system, are from the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey of 2010.[43] The statistics for Buddhism and Christianity are from the China Family Panel Studies survey of 2012.[51] The statistics for Islam are from a survey conducted in 2010.[52] It is worthwhile to note that the populations of Chinese ancestorism and Buddhism may overlap, even with the large remaining parts of the population whose belief is not documented in the table. The latter, the uncharted population, may practise other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of gods, Taoism, Confucianism and folk salvationisms, or may be atheist. Indeed, according to the CFPS 2012, only 6.3% of the Chinese were irreligious in the sense of \"atheism\", while the rest practised the worship of gods and ancestors.[53]: 13\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Country Comparisons - Infant mortality rate\". *The World Factbook*.
