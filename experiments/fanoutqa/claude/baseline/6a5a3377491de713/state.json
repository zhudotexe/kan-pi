During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 23 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and was directed by Louis J. Horvitz.[7] Actor Steve Martin hosted the show for the first time.[8] Three weeks earlier in a ceremony at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California held on March 3, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Ren\u00e9e Zellweger.[9]\n\n\n*Gladiator* won five awards, including Best Picture.[10] Other winners included *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* and *Traffic* with four awards and *Almost Famous*, *Big Mama*, *Erin Brockovich*, *Father and Daughter*, *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*, *Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport*, *Pollock*, *Quiero Ser*, *U-571*, and *Wonder Boys* with one. The telecast garnered almost 43 million viewers in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nThe nominees for the 73rd Academy Awards were announced on February 13, 2001, by Robert Rehme, president of the Academy, and Academy Award-winning actress Kathy Bates.[11] *Gladiator* received the most nominations with twelve. *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* came in second with ten.[12]\n\n\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 25, 2001.[13] *Gladiator* became the first film to win Best Picture without a directing or screenwriting win since 1949's *All the King's Men*.[14] Best Director winner Steven Soderbergh, who received nominations for both *Erin Brockovich* and *Traffic* (for which he won the award), was the third person to receive double directing nominations in the same year.[A][15] *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* became the third film nominated simultaneously for Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film in the same year.[B][16] Moreover, its ten nominations were the most for a foreign language film.[17] With four wins, the film is tied with *Fanny and Alexander* and *Parasite* as the most awarded foreign language films in Academy Awards history.[18] By virtue of his brother's Best Supporting Actor nomination for 1988's *Running on Empty*, Best Supporting Actor nominee Joaquin Phoenix and River became the first pair of brothers to earn acting nominations.[19]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Branko Lustig, Best Picture co-winner\n![](image)Steven Soderbergh, Best Director winner\n![](image)Russell Crowe, Best Actor winner\n![](image)Julia Roberts, Best Actress winner\n![](image)Benicio del Toro, Best Supporting Actor winner\n![](image)Marcia Gay Harden, Best Supporting Actress winner\n![](image)Cameron Crowe, Best Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen/Original Screenplay winner\n![](image)Stephen Gaghan, Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published/Adapted Screenplay winner\n![](image)Ang Lee, Best Foreign Language Film winner\n![](image)Florian Gallenberger, Best Live Action Short Film winner\n![](image)Micha\u00ebl Dudok de Wit, Best Animated Short Film winner\n![](image)Tan Dun, Best Original Score winner\n![](image)Bob Dylan, Best Original Song winner\n![](image)Peter Pau, Best Cinematography winner\n![](image)Rick Baker, Best Makeup co-winner\n![](image)Stephen Mirrione, Best Film Editing winner\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in **boldface**, and indicated with a double dagger (\u2021).[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Best Picture**\n* ***Gladiator* \u2013 Douglas Wick, David Franzoni, and Branko Lustig, producers\u2021**\n\t+ *Chocolat* \u2013 David Brown, Kit Golden, and Leslie Holleran, producers\n\t+ *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* \u2013 Bill Kong, Hsu Li-kong, and Ang Lee, producers\n\t+ *Erin Brockovich* \u2013 Danny DeVito, Michael Shamberg, and Stacey Sher, producers\n\t+ *Traffic* \u2013 Marshall Herskovitz, Edward Zwick, and Laura Bickford, producers\n | **Best Director**\n* **Steven Soderbergh\u00a0\u2013 *Traffic***\u2021\n\t+ Stephen Daldry\u00a0\u2013 *Billy Elliot*\n\t+ Ang Lee\u00a0\u2013 *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*\n\t+ Steven Soderbergh\u00a0\u2013 *Erin Brockovich*\n\t+ Ridley Scott\u00a0\u2013 *Gladiator*\n |\n| **Best Actor**\n* **Russell Crowe\u00a0\u2013 *Gladiator* as General Maximus Decimus Meridius**\u2021\n\t+ Javier Bardem\u00a0\u2013 *Before Night Falls* as Reinaldo Arenas\n\t+ Tom Hanks\u00a0\u2013 *Cast Away* as Chuck Noland\n\t+ Ed Harris\u00a0\u2013 *Pollock* as Jackson Pollock\n\t+ Geoffrey Rush\u00a0\u2013 *Quills* as the Marquis de Sade\n | **Best Actress**\n* **Julia Roberts\u00a0\u2013 *Erin Brockovich* as Erin Brockovich**\u2021\n\t+ Joan Allen\u00a0\u2013 *The Contender* as Laine Hanson\n\t+ Juliette Binoche\u00a0\u2013 *Chocolat* as Vianne Rocher\n\t+ Ellen Burstyn\u00a0\u2013 *Requiem for a Dream* as Sara Goldfarb\n\t+ Laura Linney\u00a0\u2013 *You Can Count on Me* as Sammy Prescott\n |\n| **Best Supporting Actor**\n* **Benicio del Toro\u00a0\u2013 *Traffic* as Javier Rodriguez**\u2021\n\t+ Jeff Bridges\u00a0\u2013 *The Contender* as President Jackson Evans\n\t+ Willem Dafoe\u00a0\u2013 *Shadow of the Vampire* as Max Schreck\n\t+ Albert Finney\u00a0\u2013 *Erin Brockovich* as Edward L.

I am simply elated to have him on board. He was at the top of our list, we offered and he accepted; it was as simple as that.\"[29] Martin expressed his delight in hosting the gala jokingly retorting, \"If you can't win 'em, join 'em.\"[30]\n\n\nIn view of the gala taking place in the year 2001, Cates christened the show with a theme saluting the Stanley Kubrick science fiction film *2001: A Space Odyssey*.[31] In tandem with the theme, astronauts Susan J. Helms, Yury Usachov, and James S. Voss who were inside the International Space Station Alpha Destiny module during Expedition 2 appeared at the beginning of the telecast via satellite to introduce host Martin.[32] Throughout the broadcast, the orchestra conducted by film composer Bill Conti performed a remixed version of \"Also Sprach Zarathustra (2001)\" composed by Brazilian jazz musician Eumir Deodato.[33] Furthermore, *2001* author Arthur C. Clarke presented the Best Adapted Screenplay award from his home in Sri Lanka.[34][35]\n\n\nSeveral others participated in the production of the ceremony. Production designer Roy Christopher designed a new stage for the show which featured gigantic louvered cove that curved from the stage floor to the ceiling via the auditorium's backstage wall. Many media outlets described the set design resembling a cross section of a space capsule.[36] In addition, four stainless steel arcs each carved with a silhouette of the Oscar statuette were flanked at the front and back of the stage allowing presenters and winners to pass through them.[36] Dancer Debbie Allen choreographed the performances of the Best Original Song nominees.[37] Musicians Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman performed excerpts from the five nominees for Best Original Score.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### Box office performance of nominees[edit]\n\n\nBefore the nominees were announced on February 13, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees was $471 million with an average of $94 million per film.[40] *Gladiator* was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $186.6 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by *Erin Brockovich* ($125.5 million), *Traffic* ($71.2 million), *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* ($60.7 million) and finally, *Chocolat* ($27 million).[40]\n\n\nOf the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 49 nominations went to 15 films on the list. Only *Cast Away* (3rd), *Gladiator* (4th), *Erin Brockovich* (12th), *Traffic* (31st), and *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* (41st) directing, acting, screenwriting, or Best Picture.[41] The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were *Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas* (1st), *The Perfect Storm* (5th), *Meet the Parents* (7th), *The Patriot* (17th), *Space Cowboys* (23rd), *The Emperor's New Groove* (25th), *U-571* (26th), *Hollow Man* (30th), *102 Dalmatians* (38th), and *The Cell* (40th).[41]\n\n\n\n### Critical reviews[edit]\n\n\nThe show received a positive reception from most media outlets. Television critic Ken Tucker of *Entertainment Weekly* wrote, \"As host, Martin was typically dapper and comfortably low-key, pacing himself throughout the evening.\" He also added, \"The Oscars seemed as bouncy and well oiled as Russell Crowe's 'do\u2014a '50s Gene Vincent-style quiff that made for a cool rock & roll segue into Dylan's Best Song performance.\"[42] *USA Today* critic Robert Bianco gave an average review of the telecast but commended the host stating, \"Martin was a droll delight \u2014 as amusing as Oscar star Billy Crystal, but in an entirely different way. Where Crystal was all hard work and good humor, the more deadpan and deceptively proper Martin let his nastier jokes sneak up on you.\"[43] Tom Shales from *The Washington Post* commented Martin was \"the best Oscar host since Johnny Carson.\" In addition, he quipped that \"The show was almost too dignified for its own good, yet it remained exciting and entertaining even at its loftier and more pretentious moments.\"[44]\n\n\nSome media outlets were more critical of the show. Barry Garron of *The Hollywood Reporter* commented, \"Here was veteran producer Gil Cates presiding over one of the few Academy Award presentations that ended on time and still managed to be too long.\" Additionally, he quipped \"If nothing else, tonight's show proved that, despite the many Awards most viewers have no interest in, the show can be done in three and a half hours.\"[45] *The Atlanta Journal-Constitution* columnist Steve Murray remarked, \"It wasn't just that Martin lacked the impish, insider energy of Billy Crystal \u2013 or even Whoopi Goldberg's hypnotically awful self-satisfaction. No, the 73rd annual Academy Awards still seemed to go on forever, even though it was one of the shortest in years.\"[46] Television critic John Carman of the *San Francisco Chronicle* wrote, \"Even with a rookie host, Steve Martin, the Academy Awards show was long on decorum and disappointingly short on verve.\"[47]\n\n\n\n### Ratings and reception[edit]\n\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 42.9 million people over its length, which was a 7% decrease from the previous year's ceremony.[48][49] An estimated 72.2 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards.[49] The show also earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 26.2% of households watching over a 40 share.[50] In addition, it garnered a lower 18\u201349 demo rating with a 17.8 rating among viewers in that demographic.[50]\n\n\nIn July 2001, the ceremony presentation received eight nominations at the 53rd Primetime Emmys.[51] Two months later, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Outstanding Sound Mixing For A Variety Or Music Series Or Special (Edward J. Greene, Tom Vicari, Bob Douglass).[52]\n\n\n\n## *In Memoriam*[edit]\n\n\nThe annual *In Memoriam* tribute, presented by actor John Travolta, honored the following people.[53]\n\n\n\n* Douglas Fairbanks Jr. \u2013 Actor\n* Marie Windsor \u2013 Actress\n* Beah Richards \u2013 Actress\n* Edward Anhalt \u2013 Screenwriter\n* Billy Barty \u2013 Actor\n* Julius Epstein \u2013 Screenwriter\n* George Montgomery \u2013 Actor\n* Ring Lardner Jr. \u2013 Screenwriter\n* Steve Reeves \u2013 Actor and body builder\n* Jean Peters \u2013 Actress\n* Vittorio Gassman \u2013 Actor\n* Jean-Pierre Aumont \u2013 Actor\n* Dale Evans \u2013 Actress and singer\n* Gwen Verdon \u2013 Actress and dancer\n* Stanley Kramer \u2013 Producer, Director\n* Jack Nitzsche \u2013 Composer\n* Harold Nicholas \u2013 Tap dancer\n* Howard W.

The ceremony was scheduled one week later than usual to avoid a clash with the 2006 Winter Olympics.[3] During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories honoring films released in 2005. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Gil Cates and directed by Louis J. Horvitz.[4][5] Actor Jon Stewart hosted the show for the first time.[6] Two weeks earlier in a ceremony at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California held on February 18, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Rachel McAdams.[7]\n\n\n*Crash* won three awards, including Best Picture.[8] Other winners included *Brokeback Mountain*, *King Kong*, and *Memoirs of a Geisha* with three awards and *Capote*, *The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe*, *The Constant Gardener*, *Hustle & Flow*, *March of the Penguins*, *The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation*, *A Note of Triumph: The Golden Age of Norman Corwin*, *Six Shooter*, *Syriana*, *Tsotsi*, *Walk the Line*, and *Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit* with one. The telecast garnered nearly 39 million viewers in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nThe nominees for the 78th Academy Awards were announced on January 31, 2006, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in the Academy's Beverly Hills headquarters by Sid Ganis, president of the Academy, and actress Mira Sorvino.[9] *Brokeback Mountain* earned the most nominations with eight total; *Crash*, *Good Night, and Good Luck*, and *Memoirs of a Geisha* tied for second with six nominations each.[10] All five Best Picture nominees received corresponding Best Director nominations (the fourth occurrence in Oscar history since the Best Picture nominees roster was limited to five films).[11]\n\n\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on March 5, 2006.[12] Several notable achievements by multiple individuals and films occurred during the ceremony. *Crash* was the first Best Picture winner since 1976's *Rocky* to win only three Oscars.[13] Best Director winner Ang Lee became the first non-Caucasian winner of that category.[14] For this first time since the 34th ceremony held in 1962, all four acting winners were first-time nominees.[15][16] At age 20, Keira Knightley was the second-youngest Best Actress nominee for her performance as Elizabeth Bennet in *Pride & Prejudice*. Best Supporting Actor winner George Clooney was the fifth person to receive acting, directing, and screenwriting nominations in the same year and the first person to achieve this feat for two different films.[17] By virtue of his nominations for both *Memoirs of a Geisha* and *Munich*, composer John Williams earned a total of 45 nominations tying him with Alfred Newman as the second most nominated individual in Oscar history.[a][18] \"It's Hard out Here for a Pimp\" became the second rap song to win Best Original Song and the first such song to be performed at an Oscars ceremony.[19]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Paul Haggis, Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay co-winner\n![](image)Ang Lee, Best Director winner\n![](image)Philip Seymour Hoffman, Best Actor winner\n![](image)Reese Witherspoon, Best Actress winner\n![](image)George Clooney, Best Supporting Actor winner\n![](image)Rachel Weisz, Best Supporting Actress winner\n![](image)Larry McMurtry, Best Adapted Screenplay co-winner\n![](image)Nick Park, Best Animated Feature winner\n![](image)Gavin Hood, Best Foreign Language Film winner\n![](image)Martin McDonagh, Best Live Action Short Film winner\n![](image)Gustavo Santaolalla, Best Original Score winner\n![](image)Juicy J, Best Original Song co-winner\n![](image)DJ Paul, Best Original Song co-winner\n![](image)Joe Letteri, Best Visual Effects co-winner\n![](image)Richard Taylor, Best Visual Effects co-winner\n\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in **boldface**, and indicated with a double dagger (\u2021).[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Best Picture**\n* ***Crash*\u00a0\u2013 Paul Haggis and Cathy Schulman, producers**\u2021\n\t+ *Brokeback Mountain*\u00a0\u2013 Diana Ossana and James Schamus, producers\n\t+ *Capote*\u00a0\u2013 Caroline Baron, William Vince and Michael Ohoven, producers\n\t+ *Good Night, and Good Luck*\u00a0\u2013 Grant Heslov, producer\n\t+ *Munich*\u00a0\u2013 Kathleen Kennedy, Steven Spielberg and Barry Mendel, producers\n | **Best Director**\n* **Ang Lee\u00a0\u2013 *Brokeback Mountain***\u2021\n\t+ Bennett Miller\u00a0\u2013 *Capote*\n\t+ Paul Haggis\u00a0\u2013 *Crash*\n\t+ George Clooney\u00a0\u2013 *Good Night, and Good Luck*\n\t+ Steven Spielberg\u00a0\u2013 *Munich*\n |\n| **Best Actor**\n* **Philip Seymour Hoffman\u00a0\u2013 *Capote* as Truman Capote**\u2021\n\t+ Terrence Howard\u00a0\u2013 *Hustle & Flow* as DJay\n\t+ Heath Ledger\u00a0\u2013 *Brokeback Mountain* as Ennis Del Mar\n\t+ Joaquin Phoenix\u00a0\u2013 *Walk the Line* as Johnny Cash\n\t+ David Strathairn\u00a0\u2013 *Good Night, and Good Luck* as Edward R.

However, Crystal declined the offer citing his commitment to his one-man comedy show *700 Sundays*.[29][30]\n\n\nIn January 2006, Cates announced that actor, comedian, and talk show host Jon Stewart, who had previously hosted two consecutive Grammy Awards ceremonies in 2001 and 2002, was chosen as host of the 2006 telecast.[31] Cates explained the decision to hire him saying, \"My wife and I watch him every night. Jon is the epitome of a perfect host \u2014 smart, engaging, irreverent and funny.\"[32] In a statement, Stewart expressed that he was honored to be selected to emcee the program, jokingly adding, \"Although, as an avid watcher of the Oscars, I can't help but be a little disappointed with the choice. It appears to be another sad attempt to smoke out Billy Crystal.\"[33]\n\n\nSeveral other people and companies participated in the production of the ceremony. Bill Conti served as musical supervisor for the telecast.[34] Media firm The Ant Farm produced a thirty-second trailer promoting the broadcast featuring clips highlighting past Oscar winners to the tune of the song \"Our Lives\" by The Calling.[35] Previous Oscar hosts such as Whoopi Goldberg and Steve Martin, and actors Mel Gibson, George Clooney, Halle Berry appeared in an opening comedic sketch.[36] Actor Tom Hanks participated in a pre-taped comedic sketch lampooning Oscar speeches.[37] Stephen Colbert (host of *The Colbert Report*, the sister program of Stewart's *The Daily Show*) narrated two different mock attack ads lampooning both the intense campaigning and lobbying during Oscar season put forth by film studios and political advertising during elections.[38] Violinist Itzhak Perlman performed excerpts from the five nominees for Best Original Score.[39]\n\n\n\n### Box office performance of nominated films[edit]\n\n\nWhen the nominations were announced on January 31, the field of major nominees favored independent, low-budget films over blockbusters.[40][41] The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $186 million with an average gross of $37.3 million per film.[42] *Crash* was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $53.4 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by *Brokeback Mountain* ($51.7 million), *Munich* ($40.8 million), *Good Night and Good Luck* ($25.2 million), and finally *Capote* ($15.4 million).[42]\n\n\nOf the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 35 nominations went to 13 films on the list. Only  *Walk the Line* (19th), *Cinderella Man* (41st), *Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit* (45th), and *Crash* (48th) were nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature, or any of the directing, acting, or screenwriting.[43] The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were *Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* (1st), *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire* (2nd), *The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe* (3rd), *War of the Worlds* (4th), *King Kong* (5th), *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory* (7th), *Batman Begins* (8th), *March of the Penguins*, (26th), and *Memoirs of a Geisha* (47th).[43]\n\n\n\n### Critical reviews[edit]\n\n\nSome media outlets received the broadcast positively. *St. Louis Post-Dispatch* television critic Gail Pennington praised Stewart's performance as host writing that he \"did the Oscars proud Sunday night, turning in a four-star hosting performance that unfortunately made the rest of the show seem sluggish by comparison.\"[44] Film critic Roger Ebert said that Stewart was \"on target, topical and funny,\" and added, \"He was as relaxed, amusing and at home as Johnny Carson.\"[45] Columnist Ray Richmond of *The Hollywood Reporter* commented, \"He seemed at times nervous and self-conscious, but on the whole, Stewart delivered with just the right balance of reverence and smugness.\"[46]\n\n\nOthers media publications were more critical of the show. Television critic Rob Owen of the *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette* wrote that Stewart was more \"amusing than funny\". He added, \"Many of his jokes fell flat with the stars in the Kodak Theatre, and his tendency to bow down before celebrities quickly grew tiresome.\"[47] Tom Shales from *The Washington Post* commented, \"It's hard to believe that professional entertainers could have put together a show less entertaining than this year's Oscars, hosted with a smug humorlessness by comic Jon Stewart, a sad and pale shadow of great hosts gone by.\" Moreover, he derided the \"piles and piles and miles and miles of clips from films present and past\" writing that it \"squandered the visual luster\" of the ceremony.[48] Associated Press television critic Frazier Moore remarked, \"Stewart, usually a very funny guy, displayed a lack of beginner's luck as first-time host...His usually impeccable blend of puckishness and self-effacement fell flat in the service of Oscar.\" He also criticized the decision to play music over the winner's acceptance speeches calling it \"distracting and obnoxious.\"[49]\n\n\n\n### Ratings and reception[edit]\n\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 38.94 million people over its length, which was an 8% decrease from the previous year's ceremony.[50] Additionally, the show earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 23.0% of households watching over a 35 share.[51] Furthermore, it garnered a lower 18\u201349 demo rating with a 13.9 rating among viewers in that demographic.[51]\n\n\nIn July 2006, the ceremony presentation received nine nominations at the 58th Primetime Emmys.[52] The following month, the ceremony won four of those nominations for Outstanding Art Direction (Roy Christopher and Jeff Richman), Outstanding Directing for a Variety, Music, or Comedy Program (Louis J. Horvitz), Outstanding Main Title Design (Renato Grgic, Alen Petkovic, Kristijan Petrovic, and Jon Teschner), and Outstanding Sound Mixing For A Variety, Music, or Animation Series or Special (Patrick Baltzell, Robert Douglass, Edward J.

The telecast garnered almost 38 million viewers in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nThe nominees for the 83rd Academy Awards were announced on January 25, 2011, at 5:38\u00a0a.m. PST at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California by Tom Sherak, president of the Academy, and actress Mo'Nique.[14] *The King's Speech* led the nominations with twelve, followed by *True Grit* with ten.[15][16]\n\n\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on February 27, 2011.[17] *Toy Story 3* became the third animated film to be nominated for Best Picture.[18][19] *True Grit* was the second film after 2002's *Gangs of New York* to lose all ten of its nominations.[20] By virtue of his nomination for Best Actor in *127 Hours*, host James Franco became the first person since Paul Hogan, who was a co-host and a Best Original Screenplay nominee during the 59th ceremony in 1987, to host the ceremony while receiving a nomination in the same year.[21][22] He was also the first acting nominee since Michael Caine at the 45th ceremony in 1973 to achieve this distinction.[23] With Christian Bale and Melissa Leo's respective wins in the Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress categories, *The Fighter* became the first film since 1986's *Hannah and Her Sisters* to win both supporting acting categories.[24]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n![Photo of Tom Hooper at the premiere of Les Mis\u00e9rables in Sydney, Australia.](image)Tom Hooper, Best Director winner\n![Photo of Colin Firth receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2011.](image)Colin Firth, Best Actor winner\n![Photo of Natalie Portman attending the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival.](image)Natalie Portman, Best Actress winner\n![Photo of Christian Bale attending the 2019 Berlin Film Festival.](image)Christian Bale, Best Supporting Actor winner\n![Photo of Melissa Leo attending the premiere of Whatever Works in 2009.](image)Melissa Leo, Best Supporting Actress winner\n![Photo of Aaron Sorkin attending PaleyFest 2013.](image)Aaron Sorkin, Best Adapted Screenplay winner\n![Photo of Lee Unkrich at the 2009 Venice Film Festival.](image)Lee Unkrich, Best Animated Feature winner\n![Photo of Susanne Bier at the 2011 Miami International Film Festival.](image)Susanne Bier, Best Foreign Language Film winner\n![Photo of Charles Ferguson on April 19, 2012.](image)Charles Ferguson, Best Documentary Feature co-winner\n![Photo of Randy Newman in 1979.](image)Randy Newman, Best Original Song winner\n![Photo of Rick Baker at the 2011 Saturn Awards.](image)Rick Baker, Best Makeup co-winnerWinners[25] are listed first, highlighted in **boldface**, and indicated with a double-dagger (\u2021).\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Best Picture**\n* ***The King's Speech*\u00a0\u2013 Iain Canning, Emile Sherman and Gareth Unwin, producers**\u2021\n\t+ *Black Swan*\u00a0\u2013 Mike Medavoy, Brian Oliver and Scott Franklin, producers\n\t+ *The Fighter*\u00a0\u2013 David Hoberman, Todd Lieberman and Mark Wahlberg, producers\n\t+ *Inception*\u00a0\u2013 Emma Thomas and Christopher Nolan, producers\n\t+ *The Kids Are All Right*\u00a0\u2013 Gary Gilbert, Jeffrey Levy-Hinte and Celine Rattray, producers\n\t+ *127 Hours*\u00a0\u2013 Christian Colson, Danny Boyle and John Smithson, producers\n\t+ *The Social Network*\u00a0\u2013 Scott Rudin, Dana Brunetti, Michael De Luca and Ce\u00e1n Chaffin, producers\n\t+ *Toy Story 3*\u00a0\u2013 Darla K.

We hope to create an Oscar broadcast that will both showcase their incredible talents and entertain the world on February 27,\" said Cohen and Mischer regarding their selections to host the gala. \"We are completely thrilled that James and Anne will be joining forces with our brilliant creative team to do just that.\"[36] Franco and Hathaway became the first male-female duo to co-host the awards show since comedian Jerry Lewis and actress Celeste Holm presided over the 29th ceremony in 1957.[22][37] At age 28, Hathaway was also the youngest person to host an Oscar ceremony.[38]\n\n\nFurthermore, AMPAS announced that this year's ceremony was \"the most interactive awards show in history\". The Academy revamped their official website oscar.com to include lists of all the nominees and winners, as well as film trailers and exclusive video content produced by both AMPAS and Oscar telecaster ABC.[39] Also, via the Academy's Twitter and Facebook pages, people could post questions for any actor or celebrity attending the festivities to answer. One of the four Oscar pre-show co-hosts would then pose selected questions to both nominees and attendees alike.[39] For a fee of US$4.99, users had online access to two dozen video streams that would take them from the red carpet, through the ceremony and on to the post-telecast Governors Ball. Several of the cameras utilized 360-degree views that viewers could direct.[40]\n\n\nSeveral other people participated in the production of the ceremony. For a younger writer, France consulted Judd Apatow, who suggested Jordan Rubin who brought in Megan Amram.[34] William Ross served as musical director and conductor for the ceremony.[41] Production designer Steve Bass built a new stage design for the ceremony.[42] *Entertainment Weekly* columnist and TV personality Dave Karger greeted guests entering the red carpet.[43] Designer Marc Friedland designed a new envelope heralding the winner of each category made from a high-gloss iridescent metallic gold paper stock, with red-lacquered lining that featured the Oscar statuette stamped in satin gold leaf.[44][45] During the run-up to the ceremony, television personality Chris Harrison hosted \"Road to the Oscars\", a weekly behind-the-scenes video blog.[46] Ben Mankiewicz hosted the official ABC pre-show, giving professional betting odds for the winners.[34] PS22 Chorus children's choir performed \"Over the Rainbow\" from *The Wizard of Oz* at the end of the ceremony.[47]\n\n\nAccording to Rubin, Hathaway was heavily involved during the month of preparation.[34] Franco on the other hand was busy shooting movies, while teaching a class and getting both his masters and his PhD.[34] When filming started, Hathaway was focused and determined while Franco was more laid back, causing friction.[34] In the closing weeks, Franco went back to Apatow who hired four additional writers; in response, Hathaway brought in Liz Feldman.[34] This resulted last-minute scrambling. According to Amram, \"[a] lot of stuff that made it into the show was written a few days beforehand.\"[34] Franco immediately left after the show ended, catching a flight to make a morning seminar on medieval manuscripts at Yale.[48]\n\n\n\n### Box office performance of nominated films[edit]\n\n\nFor the second consecutive year, the field of major nominees included at least one blockbuster at the American and Canadian box offices. However, only three of the nominees had grossed over $100\u00a0million before the nominations were announced, compared with five from the previous year.[49] The combined gross of the ten Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $1.2 billion, the second-highest ever behind 2009. The average gross was $119.3 million.[50]\n\n\nTwo of the ten Best Picture nominees were among the top ten releases in box office during the nominations. At the time of the announcement of nominations on January 25, *Toy Story 3* was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $414.9\u00a0million in domestic box office receipts.[51] The only other top ten box office hit to receive a nomination was *Inception* which earned $292.5\u00a0million. Among the remaining eight nominees, *True Grit* was the next-highest-grossing film with $137.9\u00a0million followed by *The Social Network* ($95.4\u00a0million), *Black Swan* ($83.2\u00a0million), *The Fighter* ($72.6\u00a0million), *The King's Speech* ($57.3\u00a0million), *The Kids Are All Right* ($20.8\u00a0million), *127 Hours* ($11.2\u00a0million), and finally *Winter's Bone* ($6.2\u00a0million).[51]\n\n\nOf the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 55 nominations went to 15 films on the list. Only *Toy Story 3* (1st), *Inception* (5th), *How to Train Your Dragon* (9th), *True Grit* (17th), *The Social Network* (29th), *The Town* (32nd), *Black Swan* (38th), and *The Fighter* (45th) were nominated for directing, acting, screenwriting, Best Picture or Animated Feature.[52] The other top-50 box office hits that earned nominations were *Alice in Wonderland* (2nd), *Iron Man 2* (3rd), *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\u00a0\u2014 Part 1* (6th), *Tangled* (10th), *Tron: Legacy* (12th), *Salt* (21st), and *Unstoppable* (39th).[52]\n\n\n\n### Critical reviews[edit]\n\n\nThe show received a negative reception from most media publications. According to writer Bruce Vilanch, the crowd enjoyed the starting short film, but when Franco and Hathaway came on stage, it shifted. According to Rubin, Hathaway \"was embracing their arrival on stage\" while Franco was filming the crowd on his phone.[34] Mara Reinstein of *The Ringer* said there was no single moment of failure but described the broadcast as \"death by a thousand paper cuts.\"[34]\n\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert said, \"Despite the many worthy nominated films, the Oscarcast was painfully dull, slow, witless, and hosted by the ill-matched James Franco and Anne Hathaway. She might have made a delightful foil for another partner, but Franco had a deer-in-the-headlights manner and read his lines robotically.\" He went on to praise the winners of the night, but he ended his review with the words, \"Dead. In. The. Water.\"[53] Writer David Wild called it \"the world's most uncomfortable blind date between the cool rocker stoner kid and the adorable theater camp cheerleader.\"[34] Television critic Tim Goodman of *The Hollywood Reporter* commented, \"In what could go down as one of the worst Oscar telecasts in history, a bad and risky idea\u00a0\u2014 letting two actors host\u00a0\u2014 played out in spectacularly unwatchable fashion on the biggest of all nights for the film world.\" He also added, \"These Oscars were a bore-fest that seemed to drag on relentlessly but listlessly.\"[54] Gail Pennington of the *St. Louis Post-Dispatch* wrote that the ceremony \"felt a little like a bad night on *Saturday Night Live*\u00a0\u2014 awkward, slow and not particularly entertaining.\" Regarding the hosts, she quipped that Hathaway \"at least tried\", but she remarked, \"Franco seemed half asleep, or possibly stoned.\"[55]\n\n\nSome media outlets received the broadcast more positively. *Entertainment Weekly* television critic Ken Tucker stated that the show was \"Funny, poised, relaxed, and smart, Anne Hathaway and James Franco made for marvelous Oscar hosts. Their combination of respect and informality struck the right tone for the night, a happily surprising production that had its share of fine moments both planned and ad-libbed.\" On the overall aspect of the ceremony, they concluded \"all in all, it was a fun, briskly paced night.\"[56] Mary McNamara from the *Los Angeles Times* commented, \"The two seemed to be following the directive to \"first do no harm,\" as if they knew they couldn't score as big as Jimmy Fallon did with the Emmy Awards, but were determined to avoid becoming morning show fodder like Ricky Gervais was after this year's Golden Globes. The result was a show that moved along, with a few draggy bits and high notes, like precisely what it was: a very long and fancy awards show.\" Her review further said \"Overall, the evening had an oddly business-like feel, a mind-numbing evenness that was exacerbated by the relentless predictability of the winners, and the fact that none of the acting winners were played off no matter how long their \"thank-yous\" went.\"[57]\n\n\n\n### Ratings and reception[edit]\n\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 37.9 million people over its length, which was a 9% decrease from the previous year's ceremony.[58][59] An estimated 71.3 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards.[60] The show also drew lower Nielsen ratings compared to the two previous ceremonies, with 21.2% of households watching over a 33 share.[5] In addition, the program scored an 11.8 rating over a 30 share among the 18\u201349 demographic, which was a 12 percent decrease over last year's demographic numbers.[61]\n\n\n\n## *In Memoriam*[edit]\n\n\nThe *In Memoriam* tribute, which featured Celine Dion performing the Charlie Chaplin song \"Smile\", paid tribute to the following individuals.[62]\n\n\n\n* John Barry \u2013 Composer\n* Grant McCune \u2013 Visual effects\n* Tony Curtis \u2013 Actor\n* Edward Limato \u2013 Agent\n* Tom Mankiewicz \u2013 Writer\n* Gloria Stuart \u2013 Actress\n* William Fraker \u2013 Cinematographer\n* Joseph Strick \u2013 Director\n* Lionel Jeffries \u2013 Actor\n* Sally Menke \u2013 Editor\n* Ronni Chasen \u2013 Publicist\n* Leslie Nielsen \u2013 Actor\n* Robert Radnitz \u2013 Producer\n* Claude Chabrol \u2013 Director\n* Pete Postlethwaite \u2013 Actor\n* Bill Littlejohn \u2013 Animator\n* Pierre Guffroy \u2013 Art director\n* Patricia Neal \u2013 Actress\n* George Hickenlooper \u2013 Director\n* Irving Ravetch \u2013 Writer\n* Robert Culp \u2013 Actor\n* Bob Boyle \u2013 Art director\n* Mario Monicelli \u2013 Director\n* Lynn Redgrave \u2013 Actress\n* Elliott Kastner \u2013 Producer\n* Dede Allen \u2013 Editor\n* Peter Yates \u2013 Producer, director\n* Anne Francis \u2013 Actress\n* Arthur Penn \u2013 Producer, director\n* Theoni Aldredge \u2013 Costume designer\n* Susannah York \u2013 Actress\n* Ronald Neame \u2013 Director\n* David Wolper \u2013 Producer\n* Jill Clayburgh \u2013 Actress\n* Alan Hume \u2013 Cinematographer\n* Irvin Kershner \u2013 Director\n* Dennis Hopper \u2013 Actor\n* Dino De Laurentiis \u2013 Producer\n* Blake Edwards \u2013 Writer, director\n* Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Actor\n* Lena Horne \u2013 Singer, actress\n\nAt the end of the montage, Halle Berry paid special tribute to Horne and introduced a film clip of her singing the titular song from the film *Stormy Weather*.[63]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 17th Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 31st Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 31st Brit Awards\n* 53rd Annual Grammy Awards\n* 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 64th British Academy Film Awards\n* 35th Laurence Olivier Awards\n* 65th Tony Awards\n* 68th Golden Globe Awards\n* List of submissions to the 83rd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"James Franco and Anne Hathaway to co-host 2011 Oscars\".

In an interview released from *The Huffington Post*, he said \"I don't know that my family nor my soul could take it. It's a beast. It was fun to check off the list, but for the amount of time spent and the understandable opinionated response, I don't know that it's a delightful balance to do every year or even again.\"[26] In September 2015, AMPAS recruited David Hill and Reginald Hudlin as producers of the ceremony.[27] \"We're delighted to have this talented team on board,\" AMPAS president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in a press release announcing the decision, \"David is a true innovator with a dynamic personality. His vast experience as a live events producer, coupled with Reginald's energy, creativity and talent as a filmmaker, is sure to make this year's Oscar telecast a memorable one.\"[28]\n\n\nThe following month, Hill and Hudlin selected actor and comedian Chris Rock to host the 2016 telecast.[29] They explained their decision to hire Rock back as host saying, \"Chris Rock is truly the MVP of the entertainment industry. Comedian, actor, writer, producer, director, documentarian\u00a0\u2014 he's done it all. He's going to be a phenomenal Oscar host!\"[5] Rock expressed that he was thrilled to be selected to emcee the gala again, commenting, \"I'm so glad to be hosting the Oscars, it's great to be back.\"[30]\n\n\nThe key art and marketing for the ceremony featured the tagline \"We all dream in gold\", with print advertising featuring photography of past winners. AMPAS chief marketing officer Christina Kounelias explained that it was meant to reflect the Academy Awards as being both \"a symbol of excellence but also this idea of 'If you can dream it, you can achieve it'\".[31][32]\n\n\nSeveral other individuals participated in the production of the ceremony. Radio disc jockey and personality Ellen K served as announcer for the show.[33] Byron Phillips and Harold Wheeler were hired as music producer and music director respectively.[4] For a fourth consecutive year Derek McLane returned to design a new set for the show.[34] Fatima Robinson was in charge of choreography for the broadcast.[34] For the first time, the Oscar statuettes were manufactured by Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry in Rock Tavern, New York.[35] In a further effort to streamline acceptance speeches, dedications were displayed on an on-screen ticker, rather than read by the winner.[36] Prior to introducing singer Lady Gaga's performance of Best Original Song nominee \"Til It Happens to You\" from the documentary film *The Hunting Ground*, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden pleaded with viewers to sign an online pledge supporting \"It's On Us\" to end campus sexual assault.[37]\n\n\n\n### Anohni boycott[edit]\n\n\nAnohni, the first transgender person to be nominated for an Academy Award in the Best Original Song category boycotted the ceremony because the producers did not consider her to perform the nominated song on stage, stating: \"Everyone told me that I still ought to attend, that a walk down the red carpet would still be 'good for my career'. Last night I tried to force myself to get on the plane to fly to LA for all the nominee events, but the feelings of embarrassment and anger knocked me back, and I couldn't get on the plane.\" She also added: \"I imagined how it would feel for me to sit amongst all those Hollywood stars, some of the brave ones approaching me with sad faces and condolences. There I was, feeling a sting of shame that reminded me of America's earliest affirmations of my inadequacy as a transperson. I turned around at the airport and went back home.\" Other nominees set to perform included Lady Gaga, Sam Smith, The Weeknd and Dave Grohl, who was not a nominee himself.[38]\n\n\n\n### Box office performance of nominated films[edit]\n\n\n\n\nNorth American box office gross for Best Picture nominees[39]\n| Film\n | Pre-nomination(before Jan. 14)\n | Post-nomination(Jan. 14\u00a0\u2013 Feb. 28)\n | Post-awards(after Feb. 28)\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *The Martian* | $226.6 million\n | $1.8 million\n | $53,548\n | $228.4 million\n |\n| *The Revenant* | $54.1 million\n | $116.5 million\n | $11.9 million\n | $182.6 million\n |\n| *Mad Max: Fury Road* | $153.6 million\n | --\n | --\n | $153.6 million\n |\n| *Bridge of Spies* | $70.8 million\n | $1.4 million\n | $49,549\n | $72.3 million\n |\n| *The Big Short* | $44.6 million\n | $23.9 million\n | $1.7 million\n | $70.2 million\n |\n| *Spotlight* | $28.8 million\n | $10.3 million\n | $5.5 million\n | $44.6 million\n |\n| *Brooklyn* | $22.8 million\n | $13.7 million\n | $1.6 million\n | $38.1 million\n |\n| *Room* | $5.2 million\n | $8.2 million\n | $1.2 million\n | $14.7 million\n |\n\n\nAt the time of the nominations announcement on January 14, 2016, the combined gross of the eight Best Picture nominees at the American and Canadian box offices was $607 million, with an average of $75.8 million per film.[40] When the nominations were announced on January 14, 2016, *The Martian* was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $226.6 million in domestic box office receipts.[39] *Mad Max: Fury Road* was the second-highest-grossing film with $153.6 million; this was followed by *Bridge of Spies* ($70.7 million), *The Revenant* ($54.1 million), *The Big Short* ($44.6 million), *Spotlight* ($28.8 million), *Brooklyn* ($22.7 million), and *Room* ($5.1 million).[39]\n\n\nOf the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 46 nominations went to 11 films on the list. Only *Inside Out* (4th), *The Martian* (8th), *Straight Outta Compton* (18th), *The Revenant* (15th), *Mad Max: Fury Road* (21st), *Creed* (29th), and *Bridge of Spies* (42nd) were nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature, or any of the directing, acting, or screenwriting awards. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (1st), *Cinderella* (9th), *Spectre* (10th), and *Fifty Shades of Grey* (17th).[41]\n\n\n\n### Criticism regarding lack of diversity[edit]\n\n\nShortly after the nominations were announced, many news media outlets observed that there was a lack of racial diversity amongst the nominees in major categories. For the second consecutive year, all twenty acting nominees and four out of the five directors nominated were Caucasian.[42] Activist and former attorney April Reign, who was credited with starting the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, tweeted, \"It's actually worse than last year. Best Documentary and Best Original Screenplay. That's it. #OscarsSoWhite.\" She also noted that while the Caucasian screenwriters of the film *Straight Outta Compton* earned nominations, the African American cast of the film was overlooked.[43] As a result, the academy was ridiculed again over social media with the aforementioned hashtag.[44] Moreover, actress Jada Pinkett Smith and director and newly minted Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award recipient Spike Lee announced plans to boycott the ceremony and encouraged others to not watch the telecast in protest of the lack of diversity.[45] Actor and model Tyrese Gibson and rapper 50 Cent also pressured Chris Rock to drop out of his Oscar hosting duties.[46]\n\n\nIn response to the criticism, several individuals including AMPAS members voiced their opinions regarding the lack of diversity. Some members defended the academy saying that the nominations are based on performance and merit, not race. Actress Penelope Ann Miller responded to the criticism by stating \"I voted for a number of black performers, and I was sorry they weren't nominated. To imply that this is because all of us are racists is extremely offensive. I don't want to be lumped into a category of being a racist because I'm certainly not and because I support and benefit from the talent of black people in this business. It was just an incredibly competitive year.\"[47] In an interview with a French radio station, Best Actress nominee Charlotte Rampling said efforts to stage a boycott of the Oscars were \"racist to whites.\"[48] Oscar winning producer Gerald R. Molen commented, \"There is no racism except for those who create an issue. That is the worst kind. Using such an ugly way of complaining,\" He also denounced members criticizing the academy's choices as \"spoiled brats.\"[49]\n\n\nOthers agreed that the academy had a diversity problem and supported efforts towards change. Best Supporting Actress winner Lupita Nyong'o wrote, \"I am disappointed by the lack of inclusion in this year's Academy Awards nominations. It has me thinking about unconscious prejudice and what merits prestige in our culture.\" She concluded by saying, \"I stand with my peers who are calling for change in expanding the stories that are told and recognition of the people who tell them.\"[50] In a Facebook post, Best Actress winner Reese Witherspoon expressed her frustration with the lack of diversity among the nominees and added, \"Nothing can diminish the quality of their work, but these filmmakers deserve recognition. As an Academy member, I would love to see a more diverse voting membership.\"[51] During an interview with a reporter, President Barack Obama commented on the controversy saying, \"I think when everybody's story is told, then that makes for better art. That makes for better entertainment. It makes everybody feel part of one American family. So I think, as a whole, the industry should do what every other industry should do, which is to look for talent, provide opportunity to everybody.\"[52]\n\n\nA week after the nominations announcement, the academy announced several rules changes regarding membership in hopes of increasing the number of women and non-white members in the membership by 2020. Beginning in 2016, new members would earn Oscar voting privileges for the next ten years. After that time period, those members may retain voting privileges for another ten years if they have remained active in the motion picture industry. Members would earn lifetime voting privileges if they have served three consecutive ten-year voting eligibility terms or have earned or won an Academy Award.[53] Issacs justified the academy's decision to overhaul the membership requirements saying, \"The Academy is going to lead and not wait for the industry to catch up; these new measures regarding governance and voting will have an immediate impact and begin the process of significantly changing our membership composition.\"[54] Furthermore, the academy would establish three new governor seats that will be nominated by Isaacs and confirmed by the Board.[55] However, the academy's actions also include taking away the membership rights of academy members who have not recently worked in the industry, such as actor Bill Mumy and award-winning screenwriter Patricia Resnick. \"Replacing sexism and racism with ageism is not the answer,\" Resnick said.[56]\n\n\nOn the morning of the Oscars, the National Action Network led by civil rights activist Al Sharpton held a protest a few blocks from the Dolby Theatre regarding the Oscar's diversity problems. \"You are out of time,\" Sharpton said in a rebuke to the academy. \"We are not going to allow the Oscars to continue. This will be the last night of an all-white Oscars.\"[57] In addition, African-American filmmakers Ryan Coogler and Ava DuVernay held a charity event addressing the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, called #JusticeForFlint, on the same night as the Oscars.[58] Despite organizers insisting that the event was being held almost simultaneously with the Oscars, many viewed it as an alternative to watching the ceremony.[59]\n\n\n\n### Asian accountants joke[edit]\n\n\nDuring the show, Rock introduced onstage three children of Asian heritage posing as accountants for PricewaterhouseCoopers, saying: \"They sent us their most dedicated, accurate, and hard-working representatives... Please welcome Ming Zhu, Bao Ling and David Moskowitz.\" He also added, \"If anybody's upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone that was also made by these kids.\"[60] In response to the segment, U.S. Congresswoman Judy Chu expressed her disappointment at Rock, broadcaster ABC, and AMPAS in a press release that read, \"It is not right to protest the exclusion of one group by making jokes at the expense of another. I am so disappointed that the Academy and ABC would rely on such offensive characterizations, especially given the controversy over the lack of diversity.\"[61] Actress Constance Wu tweeted, \"To parade little kids on stage [with] no speaking lines merely to be the butt of a racist joke is reductive & gross.\"[62] Furthermore, 25 AMPAS members of Asian descent, including actors Nancy Kwan, Sandra Oh, and George Takei, and director Ang Lee, signed a letter condemning Rock's skit, saying: \"In light of criticism over #OscarsSoWhite, we were hopeful that the telecast would provide the Academy a way forward and the chance to present a spectacular example of inclusion and diversity. Instead, the Oscars show was marred by a tone-deaf approach to its portrayal of Asians.\"[63]\n\n\nIn a phone interview with the Associated Press, Academy President Isaacs apologized for the joke, stating, \"I can understand the feelings, and we are setting up a meeting to discuss, because, as you well know, no one sets out to be offensive, and I'm very sorry that has happened. I think so much is achieved with dialogue, so much is achieved. And that is what we'll continue to do: have dialogue, listen, and just keep fixing.\"[64]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception and television ratings[edit]\n\n\nThe show received a mixed reception from media publications. A few media outlets reviewed the broadcast more positively with some praise for Rock. Television critic Mary McNamara of the *Los Angeles Times* remarked: \"Rock's Oscars had some of the most powerful moments seen in the telecast's history.\" She concluded that, \"After years of being dissed for its irrelevance, this year's Oscars took action. The results were mixed, to be sure, and Rock did not ever settle into his usual balance of outrage and humanity.\"[65] *The New York Times* columnist James Poniewozik commented, \"With Chris Rock, the Oscars find a lucky pairing of host and subject.\" In addition, he wrote, \"His performance was an example of something the industry is still trying to learn: that you can achieve both inclusion and entertainment by giving the right person just the right opportunity.\"[66] *The Denver Post*'s Joanne Ostrow wrote, \"Chris Rock poked the elephant in the room at the 2016 Academy Awards, prodded it again and again, and never let up.\"[67]\n\n\nOthers were more critical of the show. *The Hollywood Reporter* columnist Daniel Feinberg remarked, \"Chris Rock led a telecast that had important things to say, but still felt endless.\" In addition, Feinberg called the ceremony \"overstuffed\" and the on-screen running scroll a \"total failure\".[68] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press quipped, \"When Rock was absent, languor prevailed.\" He added, \"One other beef: The attempt to banish the names of those thanked by winners to a text crawl at the bottom of the screen. If viewers wanted to watch a channel with annoying and distracting text at the bottom of the screen, they'd just tune to a cable-news channel.\"[69] *Orlando Sentinel* television critic Hal Boedeker gave high marks toward Rock but commented, \"No host, no matter how gifted, can transform the lumbering format into a scintillating event.\" He ended his comments by stating, \"Staging a more entertaining Oscar telecast. Why must the show be a slog?\"[70]\n\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew 34.42 million people over its length, which was a 4% decrease from the previous year's ceremony.[9] An estimated 58 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards.[71] The telecast also garnered lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with a 23.4 household rating.[72] In addition, the program scored lower in the 18-49 demo rating with a 10.5 rating over a 31% share.[9] It was the lowest viewership for an Academy Awards telecast since the 80th ceremony, held in 2008.[9]\n\n\nIn July 2016, the ceremony presentation received nine nominations for the 68th Primetime Emmys.[73] The following month, the ceremony did not win any of the nominations.[74]\n\n\n\n## *In Memoriam*[edit]\n\n\nThe annual \"In Memoriam\" tribute was presented by actor Louis Gossett Jr.[23][75] Singer Dave Grohl performed The Beatles' song \"Blackbird\" during the tribute.[24]\n\n\n\n* Wes Craven \u2013 Director\n* Stan Freberg \u2013 Voice actor\n* Saeed Jaffrey \u2013 Actor\n* Miroslav Ondricek \u2013 Cinematographer\n* Robert Balser \u2013 Animation director\n* Lizabeth Scott \u2013 Actress\n* Stuart Reiss \u2013 Set decorator\n* Chantal Akerman \u2013 Director, writer\n* Christopher Lee \u2013 Actor\n* Robert Chartoff \u2013 Producer\n* Murray Weissman \u2013 Publicist\n* Jerry Weintraub \u2013 Producer\n* James L.

The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Jesse Collins, Stacey Sher, and Steven Soderbergh, and was directed by Glenn Weiss.[9][10] For the third consecutive year, the ceremony had no official host.[11] In related events, the Academy Scientific and Technical Awards were presented by host Nia DaCosta on February 13, 2021, in a virtual ceremony.[12]\n\n\n*Nomadland* won three awards at the main ceremony, including Best Picture.[13] Other winners included *The Father*, *Judas and the Black Messiah*, *Ma Rainey's Black Bottom*, *Mank*, *Soul* and *Sound of Metal* with two awards each, and *Another Round*, *Colette*, *If Anything Happens I Love You*, *Minari*, *My Octopus Teacher*, *Promising Young Woman*, *Tenet*, and *Two Distant Strangers* with one. The telecast received mostly negative reviews, and it garnered 10.4 million viewers, making it the least-watched Oscar broadcast since viewership records began for the 46th ceremony in 1974.[6][14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## Winners and nominees[edit]\n\n\nThe nominees for the 93rd Academy Awards were announced on March 15, 2021, by actress Priyanka Chopra and singer Nick Jonas during a live global stream originating from London.[16] *Mank* led all nominees with ten nominations. The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on April 25.[17] Chinese filmmaker Chlo\u00e9 Zhao became the first woman of color to win Best Director and the second woman overall after Kathryn Bigelow, who won at the 2010 ceremony for directing *The Hurt Locker*.[18]\n\n\nAt age 83, Best Actor winner Anthony Hopkins was the oldest performer to ever win a competitive acting Oscar.[19] Best Actress winner Frances McDormand became the seventh person to win a third acting Oscar, the third to win three leading performance Oscars, and the second to win Best Actress three times.[20] As a producer of *Nomadland*, she also was the first person in history to win Oscars for both acting and producing for the same film.[21]\n\n\nBest Supporting Actress winner Youn Yuh-jung became the first Korean performer and second Asian woman to win an acting Oscar after Miyoshi Umeki, who won the same category for her role in 1957's *Sayonara*.[22] With his nominations in Best Supporting Actor and Best Original Song for *One Night in Miami...*, Leslie Odom Jr. was the fourth consecutive person to earn acting and songwriting nominations for the same film.[b]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n![Chlo\u00e9 Zhao in 2019.](image)Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Best Picture co-winner and Best Director winner\n![Frances McDormand in 2015.](image)Frances McDormand, Best Picture co-winner and Best Actress winner\n![Anthony Hopkins in 2010.](image)Anthony Hopkins, Best Actor winner\n![Daniel Kaluuya in 2017.](image)Daniel Kaluuya, Best Supporting Actor winner\n![Youn Yuh-jung in 2016.](image)Youn Yuh-jung, Best Supporting Actress winner\n![Emerald Fennell in 2013.](image)Emerald Fennell, Best Original Screenplay winner\n![Florian Zeller in 2009.](image)Florian Zeller, Best Adapted Screenplay co-winner\n![Thomas Vinterberg in 2010.](image)Thomas Vinterberg, Best International Feature winner\n![Jon Batiste in 2018.](image)Jon Batiste, Best Original Score co-winner\n![H.E.R. in February 2019.](image)H.E.R., Best Original Song co-winner\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in **boldface**, and indicated with a double dagger (\u2021).[24]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Best Picture**\n* ***Nomadland***\u00a0\u2013 **Mollye Asher, Dan Janvey, Frances McDormand, Peter Spears and Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, producers**\u2021\n\t+ *The Father*\u00a0\u2013 Philippe Carcassonne, Jean-Louis Livi and David Parfitt, producers\n\t+ *Judas and the Black Messiah*\u00a0\u2013 Ryan Coogler, Charles D.

Academy scheduled the 93rd ceremony for February 28, 2021.[28] However, due to the impacts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic on both cinema and television, the AMPAS Board of Governors later decided to move the date for the 2021 gala by two months to April 25.[29] The annual Academy Governors Awards and corresponding nominees luncheon were canceled due to COVID-19 safety concerns.[30] This marked the first time since the 60th ceremony held in 1988 that the awards were held in April.[31] It also was the first time since the 53rd ceremony in 1981 that the ceremony was postponed from its original date.[32]\n\n\nIn December 2020, the Academy hired television producer Jesse Collins, film producer Stacey Sher, and Oscar-winning director Steven Soderbergh to oversee production of the telecast. \"The upcoming Oscars is the perfect occasion for innovation and for re-envisioning the possibilities for the awards show. This is a dream team who will respond directly to these times. The Academy is excited to work with them to deliver an event that reflects the worldwide love of movies and how they connect us and entertain us when we need them the most,\" remarked Academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson.[33]\n\n\nThe tagline for the ceremony, \"Bring Your Movie Love\", was intended to reflect \"our global appreciation for the power of film to foster connection, to educate, and to inspire us to tell our own stories.\"[34] In tandem with the theme, the Academy hired seven artists to create custom posters for the event inspired by the question, \"What do movies mean to you?\"[35] Another aspect of the telecast's production was to produce the ceremony as if it were a film, including promoting the presenters as a \"cast\",[36][37] being filmed at the traditional cinematic frame rate of 24 frames per-second as opposed to 30, and using a cinematic aspect ratio rather than the standard 16:9 aspect ratio used by most television programming.[38]\n\n\nAs a result of concerns stemming from the pandemic, AMPAS announced that the main ceremony would be held for the first time at Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles with portions of the festivities taking place at Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.[39] To satisfy health and safety protocols, the Academy limited the number of people attending the gala to primarily nominees and presenters.[37][40] Attendees were asked to submit travel plans to Oscar organizers prior to arriving in Los Angeles and undergo multiple COVID-19 tests and isolation ten days prior to the event.[41] Guests were also asked to wear face masks whenever the broadcast paused for commercial breaks.[42] In consideration of overseas nominees unable to attend the ceremony, producers set up satellite \"hubs\" such as at BFI Southbank in London where they could participate in the gala.[43][44] Additionally, the five Best Original Song nominees were performed in previously recorded segments that were shown during the red carpet pre-show. Four of the songs were performed atop the Dolby Family Terrace of the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures; \"Husavik\" from *Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga* was performed on location in the song's namesake town in Iceland.[3]\n\n\nThe Roots musician and *The Tonight Show* bandleader Questlove served as musical director for the ceremony.[45] He, along with Oscars red carpet pre-show host Ariana DeBose and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, presented trailers for the upcoming films *Summer of Soul (...Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)*, *West Side Story*, and *In the Heights*, respectively, during the ceremony.[46][47] Architect David Rockwell served as production designer for the show.[48] In a press conference between the production team and reporters, Rockwell stated that the main lobby inside Union Station would be repurposed as the main setting for the awards presentation while adjacent outdoor areas would serve as patios for attendees to congregate before and after the ceremony.[49] He also cited the Millennium Biltmore Hotel and The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, the latter of which was the venue of the inaugural Oscars ceremony, as inspirations for the design and staging of the festivities.[50] Actors Colman Domingo and Andrew Rannells hosted *Oscars: After Dark*, a program airing immediately after the ceremony interviewing winners and nominees.[51]\n\n\nThe ceremony offered accommodations for those who are deaf or visually impaired; it was the first Academy Awards to be broadcast with audio description for the visually impaired (carried via second audio program on the ABC telecast), which (along with its closed captioning) was sponsored by Google. A sign language interpreter was available in the media room. Contrarily, deaf actress Marlee Matlin served as one of the award presenters, with her long-time partner Jack Jason interpreting her American Sign Language to spoken English.[52][53][54]\n\n\n\n### Eligibility and other rule changes[edit]\n\n\nDue to the ceremony date change, the Academy changed the eligibility deadline for feature films from December 31, 2020, to February 28, 2021. AMPAS president Rubin and CEO Hudson explained the decision to extended the eligibility period saying, \"For over a century, movies have played an important role in comforting, inspiring, and entertaining us during the darkest of times. They certainly have this year. Our hope, in extending the eligibility period and our Awards date, is to provide the flexibility filmmakers need to finish and release their films without being penalized for something beyond anyone's control.\"[55]\n\n\nThe Academy also revised its release and distribution requirements by allowing for films that were released via video on demand or streaming to be eligible for the awards on the condition that said films were originally scheduled to have a theatrical release and were subsequently uploaded to AMPAS's online screening service within 60 days of their public release. AMPAS also amended its theatrical exhibition qualifying rules to allow films debuting in theaters located in New York City, Chicago, the San Francisco Bay Area, Atlanta, and Miami to qualify for the awards in addition to venues in Los Angeles.[56] Moreover, a week of nightly screenings at a drive-in theater within the aforementioned cities also rendered films eligible for consideration.[57]\n\n\nFurthermore, the Academy made changes to specific award categories. The Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing categories were combined into a single Best Sound category due to concerns from the Sound branch that the two categories had too much overlap in scope.[58] The rules for Best Original Score were changed to require that a film's score include a minimum of 60% original music, with franchise films and sequels being required to have a minimum of 80% new music.[59] Finally, preliminary voting for Best International Feature Film was also opened to all voting members of the Academy for the first time.[60]\n\n\n\n### Best Actor announcement ending[edit]\n\n\n![Chadwick Boseman in 2017.](image)Many viewers and television critics believed Chadwick Boseman's impending win for Best Actor was a reason that producers saved the category as the last to be presented at the ceremony.\nIn a break with tradition, the lead acting categories were presented last after the awarding of Best Picture, with Best Actor coming last.[61] This led many viewers to believe that the ceremony's producers were anticipating Chadwick Boseman posthumously winning Best Actor, which could have been accompanied by a tribute to the actor; Boseman had been considered a strong frontrunner for the award.[62][63] When presenter Joaquin Phoenix announced that Anthony Hopkins was the winner of the category, Phoenix said that the Academy accepted the award on behalf of the latter, who was not present, and the ceremony came to an abrupt end.[63] It was later reported that Hopkins, who did not want to travel from his home in Wales, offered to appear via Zoom, but the producers declined his request.[63]\n\n\nThe day after the ceremony, he released an acceptance speech on Instagram, in which he thanked the Academy, said that he \"really did not expect\" to win, and paid tribute to Boseman.[62] The selection of Hopkins over Boseman was controversial, with some feeling like it was a setup,[64][65] though Boseman's brother reported the family did not have any hard feelings toward the Academy.[66]\n\n\nIn a subsequent interview with the *Los Angeles Times*, Soderbergh said that switching the traditional order of awards was planned before the nominations were announced, claiming \"actors' speeches tend to be more dramatic than producers' speeches\". He said that the possibility of Boseman's widow accepting the award \"would have been such a shattering moment\" and \"there would be nowhere to go after that\". Soderbergh also defended the decision to not allow acceptance speeches via Zoom.[67]\n\n\n\n### Critical reviews[edit]\n\n\nMany media outlets received the broadcast negatively.[14][15] Television critic Mike Hale of *The New York Times* wrote, \"Sunday's broadcast on ABC was more like a cross between the Golden Globes and the closing-night banquet of a long, exhausting convention.\" He also commented, \"The trade-off \u2014 whether because of the smaller crowd, the social distancing, or the sound quality in the cavernous space \u2014 was what felt like a dead room, both acoustically and emotionally. There were powerful and moving speeches, but they didn't seem to be generating much excitement, and when the people in the room aren't excited, it's hard to get excited at home.\"[68] *Rolling Stone* columnist Rob Sheffield noted, \"The most flamboyantly unplanned and half-assed Oscar Night in recent history was a grind from beginning to end.\" He also criticized the production of the \"In Memoriam\" segment saying that the montage was edited at an inappropriately fast pace.[69] Kelly Lawler of *USA Today* commented, \"While it was certainly challenging to stage the show safely, last month's Grammys proved that it is possible to make something entertaining and engaging amid the pandemic. Unfortunately, the Oscars producers seemingly missed that show. The Oscars were a train wreck at the train station, an excruciatingly long, boring telecast that lacked the verve of so many movies we love.\"[70]\n\n\nOthers gave a more favorable review of the show. *Time* columnist Judy Berman wrote that the ceremony \"was more entertaining than the average pre-COVID Oscars. It started out especially strong.\" She also added, \"Every part of this year's ceremony felt more intimate and less stuffy than just about any awards show I can remember. For once, the art and community of film seemed to take precedence over the business of film.\"[71] Associated Press reporter Lindsey Bahr commented, \"The 93rd Academy Awards wasn't exactly a movie, but it was a show made for people who love learning about movies. And it stubbornly, defiantly wasn't trying to be anything else.\"[72] Darren Franlch of *Entertainment Weekly* gave an average review of the telecast, but singled out the winners and presenters for providing memorable moments throughout the show.[73]\n\n\n\n### Ratings and reception[edit]\n\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 10.4 million people over its length, which was a 56% decrease from the previous year's ceremony.[74] The show also earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 5.9% of households watching the ceremony.[7] In addition, it garnered a lower rating among viewers between ages 18\u201349 with a 2.1 rating among viewers in that demographic.[75] It earned the lowest viewership for an Academy Award telecast since figures were compiled beginning with the 46th ceremony in 1974.[76]\n\n\nIn July 2021, the ceremony presentation received eight nominations for the 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards.[77] Two months later, the ceremony won for Outstanding Production Design for a Variety Special (Alana Billingsley, Joe Celli, Jason Howard, and David Rockwell).[78]\n\n\n\n### Censorship in China and Hong Kong[edit]\n\n\nThe ceremony was subject to various forms of censorship in China and its territories. Due to scrutiny over *Nomadland* director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2014a Chinese-American citizen who reportedly made comments critical of China in a 2013 interview with *Filmmaker* magazine\u2014the ceremony telecast was pulled by its local rightsholders in the mainland, and all discussions of the ceremony were censored from Chinese social media and news outlets.[79][80]\n\n\nIn addition, Hong Kong broadcaster TVB announced that the ceremony would not be shown live in the region for the first time since 1969. A TVB spokesperson told AFP that this was a \"commercial decision\". It was speculated that the decision was in retaliation for the nomination of *Do Not Split*, a documentary on Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests in 2019, for Best Documentary Short Subject.[81]\n\n\n\n## \"In Memoriam\"[edit]\n\n\nThe annual \"In Memoriam\" segment was presented by Angela Bassett.[82][83] The montage featured the song \"As\" by singer Stevie Wonder.[84]\n\n\n\n* Cicely Tyson \u2013 actress\n* Ian Holm \u2013 actor\n* Max von Sydow \u2013 actor\n* Cloris Leachman \u2013 actress\n* Yaphet Kotto \u2013 actor\n* Joel Schumacher \u2013 director\n* Bertrand Tavernier \u2013 director\n* Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re \u2013 writer, director\n* Olivia de Havilland \u2013 actress\n* Irrfan Khan \u2013 actor\n* Michael Apted \u2013 director, producer\n* Paula Kelly \u2013 actress\n* Christopher Plummer \u2013 actor\n* Allen Daviau \u2013 cinematographer\n* George Segal \u2013 actor\n* Wilford Brimley \u2013 actor\n* Thomas Jefferson Byrd \u2013 actor\n* Marge Champion \u2013 actress, dancer, choreographer\n* Ron Cobb \u2013 production designer, concept artist\n* Shirley Knight \u2013 actress\n* Jos\u00e9 Luis Diaz \u2013 sound editor\n* Kelly Preston \u2013 actress\n* Rhonda Fleming \u2013 actress\n* Kelly Asbury \u2013 director, writer, animator\n* Fred Willard \u2013 actor\n* Hal Holbrook \u2013 actor\n* Kurt Luedtke \u2013 writer\n* Linda Manz \u2013 actress\n* Michael Chapman \u2013 cinematographer, director\n* Martin Cohen \u2013 producer\n* Kim Ki-duk \u2013 director, writer\n* Helen McCrory \u2013 actress\n* Ennio Morricone \u2013 composer\n* Thomas Pollock \u2013 executive\n* Carl Reiner \u2013 actor, writer, director, producer\n* Larry McMurtry \u2013 writer\n* Lynn Shelton \u2013 director\n* Earl Cameron \u2013 actor\n* Alan Parker \u2013 director, writer\n* Mike Fenton \u2013 casting director\n* Edward S.
